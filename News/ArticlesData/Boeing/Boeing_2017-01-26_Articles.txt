Shakespeare, 86, pilot and engineer Jan 27 Evesham school official widens defamation suit, blames mayor for lost job offer Jan 25 More from David O'Reilly Arrow icon Charles B. Shakespeare of Moorestown, a pilot and engineer who designed helicopters and several innovative medical devices, died Jan. 21 of multiple myeloma at Samaritan Healthcare and Hospice in Mount Holly. He was 86. Starting as a young man Mr. Shakespeare worked for the Boeing Corp., where he helped to develop the fast, heavy-lifting, twin-rotor Chinook helicopter that played a major role in the United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War. He later worked for several medical technology design firms, where he played leading roles in developing a blood cell analyzer, a wearable heart monitor, and ultrasound devices. In junior high school he took up the tuba, but at Lower Merion High School, “Charlie” discovered the wind instrument that would be his truest love: the airplane. He took on several after-school jobs to pay for flying lessons and earned his pilot’s license while still a teenager. In 1949 he entered Lehigh University, where he joined Air Force ROTC and earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. After graduating in 1953, he married June Aletha Culp, then entered the Air Force. As the Korean War raged on a distant continent, he found himself stationed in Munich, where he piloted A-26 light bombers in a tow-target squadron. After completing his military service in 1955, he began work for the Boeing plant in Ridley Park,  which would win a contract to develop a new class of large, versatile transport helicopter for the U.S. Army. Mr. Shakespeare became a senior engineer on the project, and the Chinook — which is still in production — would prove one of history’s most successful aeronautic designs. “He felt he had his dream job: a pilot and an engineer,” his second wife, Kathleen Magee Shakespeare, recalled last week. But as Mr. Shakespeare grew opposed to America’s role in the Vietnam War, he came to regret his role in the Chinook’s creation, she said, and in 1968 quit Boeing to turn his attention to medical technology. He also took part in civil rights demonstrations because, she said, “he was passionate about social justice.” His daughter by his first marriage, Hannah Shakespeare, recalled that her parents would often co-sign for the mortgages of African-American couples who could not get mortgages from banks. “They had a lot of people indebted to them,” she said, “by which I mean grateful.” Their marriage ended in divorce in 1978. As head of engineering at Geometric Data, a division of Smith, Kline & French Laboratories, Mr. Shakespeare led the development of the automated differential blood analyzer, according to the family. In the 1970s he departed Geometric to found Aegis Medical Systems of Mount Laurel, which pioneered and marketed an innovative wearable electrocardiogram. In 1981 Mr. Shakespeare remarried, and in 1987 started at the Interspec Corp., where he participated in the development of ultrasound imaging devices. In 1994. he became head of engineering at Spectrasonics Imaging of Wayne and developed electronics that allowed imagining systems to distinguish various kinds of prostate cancer. “When he arrived with us, he was already a senior individual, but he kept up with the technology in what is usually a young man’s business, said Richard Bernardi, Spectrasonics’ president. “He was a very pleasant individual. A very good engineer and a very good manager of people and projects.”     Throughout his life he continually took to the skies, typically by flying his own glider out of Beltsville, Pa., and as recently as last year. He also was a maker of “gorgeous” wood furniture, according to his wife, who said that after retiring from Spectrasonics in 2008, he took up once again the the first wind instrument of his youth, the tuba. He started played with a Moorestown troupe called “Bob’s Bandits,” and took particular delight in playing at the annual Christmas Tuba Concert at the Kimmel Center. A lifelong Democrat who served for many years on his party’s township committee, he once joked with his wife that he wanted his funeral to be a “Democratic party.”   In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by sons Joseph and Matthew and two grandchildren. Donations in his memory may be made to Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Camden. The family will conduct a memorial service with music for Mr. Shakespeare starting 10:30 a.m. March 4 at the Mount Laurel Home for Funerals in Mount Laurel.

(Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press) In one of his first actions at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary retired Gen. James Mattis has ordered a review of two costly programs that President Trump has pointed out as examples of wasteful government spending. In a pair of memorandums dated on Thursday, Mattis ordered Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work to initiate reviews of plans to build new presidential aircraft and another to move forward with fielding the F-35 stealth jet. [Trump suggests he would ditch F-35 in favor of cheaper plane] Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the reviews were a “prudent step” designed to assist the budget process and allocate military resources. “This action is also consistent with the president’s guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation’s defense, and it aligns with the secretary’s priority to increase military readiness while gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense,” Davis said in a statement. [The inaccuracies in Donald Trump’s Air Force One tweet] The reviews follow Trump’s criticism, before his inauguration, of the expected cost of replacing aging Air Force One planes, which are due to be supplied by U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing. While the final price of the new aircraft is not yet set, Boeing has a contract to design a pair of replacement aircraft for a cost of over $2.5 billion. Following Trump’s call to “cancel the contract,” Boeing’s leadership has promised it would build the planes for less than the $4 billion Trump estimated they would ultimately cost. Mattis’s order instructs Work to identify “means to substantially reduce the program’s costs while delivering needed capabilities.” The new Pentagon boss, who was sworn in a week ago, likewise asked Work in the second memorandum to work to determine ways to lower the cost of Lockheed Martin’s $400 billion program to build the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The plane, the U.S. military’s most expensive weapons program, has been under development for years but has been criticized for design flaws and high costs. It has not yet flown in combat. Last month, Trump complained of the F-35’s cost in a tweet and suggested he would explore replacing the plane with the F-18 Super Hornet, an older jet that is made by Boeing. Mattis’s order calls for a comparison of the two planes and an analysis of whether improvements to the Super Hornet can “provide a competitive, cost effective fighter aircraft alternative.” The Thursday memos also offered new information about which portions of the F-35 program could be the subject of cost-cutting measures. Mattis’s Thursday memo specified that the review would compare the F-35C with the F-18, whereas the president’s past tweets and statements referred to the program on the whole. The F-35A makes up 85 percent of the program and is somewhat cheaper than the F-35C because of its higher volume of production. The revelation that Boeing’s F-18 is being considered as an alternative to just the F-35C model — which makes up a very small portion of the F-35 program as a whole — negates much of the concern over Trump’s tweet that asked Boeing to “price out a comparable F-18.” “Unintentionally or intentionally, [Trump’s] tweet created more confusion in the military and aircraft universe than necessary, because it was vague,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis with Teal Group, a defense market research firm. “People who knew the program knew that was nonsense.” Trump’s comments about high-profile defense products and companies were a break from presidential custom, injecting an element of uncertainty and anxiety into the military hardware industry. They are in keeping with his public negotiations with other companies whose actions he says threaten to harm U.S. workers and consumers. The president’s public jabs at defense companies have rattled markets and sparked confusion across the industry. Defense stocks have soared as the prospect of a military buildup nudges closer to reality, but the specific companies and programs mentioned in Trump’s tweets have seen sharp fluctuations at each mention. News of the Pentagon review caused stock prices at both Lockheed Martin and Boeing to drop by about 1 percent. Defense companies have sought to play down the president’s desire to slash programs and have instead repeatedly suggested changes to procurement regulations as a way to cut costs. “We welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with the Trump administration. We are focused on providing the armed forces with needed capabilities at the best possible value,” Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email. “Lockheed Martin stands ready to support Secretary Mattis’ review of the F-35 program and welcomes the appropriate focus on affordability and capability,” Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said in an email. “We also believe there are opportunities to continue to drive down program costs by using sound buying practices.” Any modification to the F-35 program has the potential to affect not just the company that assembles the plane, but also an extensive network of suppliers spanning at least 45 states. The chairman of BAE Systems, which services the F-35 program, hinted at the president’s plans in an interview with Bloomberg Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We’ve been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,” said BAE Chairman Roger Carr. “We respect that and we’ll work towards a contribution towards that.” world national-security checkpoint Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

At a kilometre long and 500m wide, the building is the largest in the world by volume. The 28,000 plus employees are encouraged to make use of the 450 tricycles to get around, and stop off at six diners and coffee shops to fuel their journey. On any given day, 20,000 meals are served at the “Dreamliner Diner”, “Twin Aisle Cafe” and “Queen of the Skies” eatery, along with Tully’s coffee shops. Divided into various sections dedicated to different aircraft types, the factory operates 24/7 and uses no central heating or airconditioning.

Picture: Robyn IronsideSource:Supplied There is some automation — in the form of driverless vehicles that deliver tool kits to the engineers and mechanics — but mostly the factory relies on hands on expertise to complete the high tech machines to Boeing’s specifications and those of the airline customer. Every few days a shiny new aircraft is completed and shunted out for testing by Boeing’s own pilots before being handed over to their new owners. Australian airlines have made many visits to the factory and in October, Qantas will return to take delivery of its first 787-9 Dreamliner. The 236-seat aircraft will be among the 84 787-9s completed at the factory this year. The same number of 777s and about six new 747s are also built in a 12-month period, and work is about to begin on the newest Boeing model — a 777X. Although staff are not allowed access to Wi-Fi and there are strict controls on mobile phones, the factory operates public tours — which bring in 300,000 people a year. Restricted to the upper deck of the cavernous space, public visitors must also surrender their phones — such is the concern about the theft of Boeing’s secrets. World’s biggest collection of brand new aircraft — fresh from the Boeing factory and awaiting testing before delivery. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Nevertheless, factory tours are the most popular tourist activity in Washington State, with visitors eager to explore the home of one of the world’s best known brands. The 90-minute tours cost $33 for adults and $20 for youths aged 15 and under. As well as the factory, the price includes the Future of Flight Aviation Center overlooking the mega warehouse and the aircraft testing area where the largest collection of brand new planes can be seen.

The change means a further shrinking of the already slim orderbook for the 747-8. Most of the new variant 747s ordered to date have been the -8 freighter version, as airlines increasingly turn to “big twins” for long-haul passenger services. Boeing has reduced the 747-8 production rate to 0.5 aircraft a month as it fulfills remaining orders. Arik Air’s order for the 747-8I dates back to 2011. The two 787-9s are worth $529 million at book value. A regional source, who requested not to be identified, told ATW the 787-9 “makes much better sense” than the 747-8I for Arik Air, notably on routes to the US and UK. Boeing said the delivery dates were a matter for the customer; an Arik Air representative said she did not have that information, but understood deliveries were “not imminent.” According to Arik Air’s website, the Nigerian flag carrier’s long-haul fleet comprises two Airbus A340-500s and two A330-200s. Its short- to medium-haul services are operated by a mixed batch of 10 Boeing 737-700s and -800s, while regional routes are operated by four Bombardier CRJ900s, a single -1000 and two Q400s.

More About: Trump and Manufacturing Getty Images Advertisement U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and plans for Boeing Co. to build new Air Force One presidential aircraft, two high-profile contracting programs that President Donald Trump has singled out for criticism. Mattis issued the reviews in order to “inform programmatic and budgetary decisions, recognizing the critical importance of each of these acquisition programs,” Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement Friday. “This action is also consistent with the president’s guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation’s defense.” In December, Trump tweeted that F-35 costs are “out of control,” and this month he boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” without identifying which projects he was referring to. Trump extracted general promises to cut costs on the F-35 and on the new Air Force One after meetings with the chief executive officers of the companies, which are the two biggest U.S. government contractors. The F-35 is the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program, at a projected cost of $379 billion, although defense officials under former President Barack Obama maintained that the program’s days of unending overruns and delays were past.

Presidential Aircraft “We have been responsive in providing information to the Trump administration and we look forward to continuing that dialogue as this process moves forward,” Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, said in a phone interview. A Lockheed representative didn’t respond to a request for comment. Lockheed fell 1.1% to $252.17 at 2:51 p.m. New York time. Boeing declined 1% to $167.45. For Air Force One, Mattis said the review will identify how to “substantially reduce the program’s costs.” The Pentagon has budgeted $3.2 billion through fiscal 2021 for research and development, construction and acquisition of two of the aircraft used by presidents, with more spending anticipated after that, according to Kevin Brancato, a government contracting analyst with Bloomberg Government. The plane itself is a relatively small portion of the cost, he said. Air Force One planes are flying fortresses, outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses. F-35 Alternative In a memorandum on the F-35, Mattis said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to “determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost” of the fighter jet, saying it should begin immediately. Mattis’s directive gives Boeing a chance--even if it’s a long-shot--to reenter a program it lost to Lockheed in 2001, when its candidate for a stealthy fighter was passed over. The new defense secretary ordered a study of whether Boeing’s older F/A-18 Super Hornet could be upgraded to provide a less costly alternative to the Navy version of the F-35. The deputy defense secretary “will oversee a review that compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative,” Mattis said in his directive. The Navy version of the F-35 is easier to target than those tailored for the Air Force and Marine Corps because it’s not scheduled to become operational until February 2019.  Relative Stealthiness While the F-35 has advantages over the Boeing plane, such as its greater stealth capabilities, that’s not always necessary, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. “The value you get for the F-35 on a maintenance basis and the differentials that you get relative to range, payload and speed don’t always warrant it being the first choice,” he said in a telephone interview. Under current plans, the Pentagon is scheduled to increase purchases of the F-35 in the coming fiscal year 2018 budget to 70 from 63 this year. Then, the number would grow to 80 in fiscal 2019. There’s also a pending “block buy” of 450 aircraft in the coming years as the Pentagon seeks a total fleet of 2,443, including 1,763 for the Air Force. Michael Gilmore, the recently departed director of the Pentagon’s testing office, said in a memo this month to senior Pentagon leaders that the Trump administration should “rigorously and comprehensively review” the F-35. He cited the fighter’s “significant, well-documented deficiencies in critical combat capabilities.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

An F-35C Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet prepares to make its first-ever landing on the Nimitz aircraft carrier off the coast of San Diego on Nov. 3, 2014. (Don Bartletti / Los Angeles Times) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of the Air Force One and F-35 fighter jet programs, two projects that have frequently been in President Trump’s crosshairs. Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said Friday that Mattis ordered separate reviews of both programs to “inform programmatic and budgetary decisions,” as well as his “recommendations to the president regarding critical military capabilities.” In a Thursday memo to the deputy secretary of Defense, Mattis said the review would look for opportunities to “significantly reduce” the cost of the F-35 program while still meeting requirements. As part of that, Mattis said a parallel review would compare the operational capabilities of the F-35C for the Navy, which is designed to withstand the stress of landing on carriers, with the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. This review would determine whether improvements could be made to an advanced Super Hornet that would provide a “competitive, cost-effective fighter aircraft alternative” to the F-35, the memo said.

In his first news conference since the election, Trump on Wednesday slammed the aircraft program, saying it is “way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.” He... (Samantha Masunaga) A separate memo from Mattis ordered a review of the Air Force One program to determine whether costs could be cut. Both programs have connections to Southern California. Boeing Co., which builds the iconic presidential 747 aircraft, has several hundred suppliers in the U.S. that support the 747 program. One of the largest is Triumph Aerostructures, which assembles the 747's center fuselage panels in Hawthorne. Northrop Grumman Corp. operates an El Segundo facility that produces fuselages for Boeing’s F/A-18. More than 100 Southern California suppliers provide parts and software for the F-35’s builder, Lockheed Martin Corp. Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement, “We welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with the Trump administration.” Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., said it was ready to support the review. “We are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services,” the company said in a statement. Since December, Trump has targeted the costs of both the Air Force One and F-35 programs in tweets and speeches. He has met with both Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s chief executives since then. But pitting an advanced Super Hornet against the F-35 is not a new idea. The U.S. Navy has been buying Super Hornets in greater numbers than the F-35 for years, said Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst for the Teal Group. The first F/A-18s flew in the 1980s, and proved their worth in the 1990s during Operation Desert Storm. “It’s been the reality for some time,” he said.  The F-35 has three variants to fit the needs of the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The Air Force version is the most common type, with many planes going to U.S. allies. The U.S. Navy is the predominant customer for the F-35C, Aboulafia said.

At the same time, Mattis ordered a similar review of the $4 billion cost for developing a new aircraft for the US president, Air Force One, the ultra-high-tech and secure 747 built by Boeing. "The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is a critical acquisition program that warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated program costs," Mattis said in the order. He said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to find ways "to significantly reduce the cost" while ensuring the new jets, which cost about $100 million each, meet US defense needs. He said the review should also compare the F-35 with the Boeing-built F-18 Super Hornet fighter to see if the latter, which costs significantly less, can meet US needs. In December, Trump assailed both the F-35 and Air Force One programs as overly costly, and after that met with the chief executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to extract savings. "The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases," Trump said on Twitter at the time. - Lockheed shares sink - The first 200 F-35s of a program that envisions some 2,450 ultimately being acquired by the different US armed services have been delivered. The aircraft have also been sold to Israel, with the first two delivered in December. Proponents tout the F-35's radar-dodging stealth technology, supersonic speeds, close air-support capabilities, airborne agility and a massive array of sensors giving pilots unparalleled access to information. But the program has faced numerous setbacks, including a mysterious engine fire in 2014 that led commanders to ground planes until the problem could be resolved. News of Mattis' order sent Lockheed shares tumbling. They were trading up about 1.0 percent before the announcement; dropping 1.0 percent at $252.18 afterward. Boeing shares fell in early trade and were off 0.9 percent after the announcement. Lockheed said in a statement that it "welcomes" Mattis's review and its focus on costs. The company said costs can be cut if the program adopts a multi-year procurement approach that would allow components to be bought on a large scale. It also argued that the F-35 is the best alternative. "We are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services," Lockheed said. On Tuesday, Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson sought to assuage shareholders by saying the new president's objective is not "about slashing our profits." "We understand his concerns about affordability and we certainly share that," she said in a conference call with analysts. "It's about how do we get the costs down today and in the future."

Sneaker-like boots, and a hoodie for a helmet. And plenty of Velcro. Those are among the features of the spacesuit astronauts will wear aboard Boeing CST-100 Starliner capsules flying from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station, possibly in the summer of 2018. The company earlier this week unveiled a new launch-and-entry suit inside a former shuttle hangar at Kennedy Space Center, where Boeing will assemble and refurbish Starliners. Compared to the bulky orange “pumpkin” suits worn by shuttle crews, the “Boeing blue” suits are lighter and more modern, said former astronaut Chris Ferguson, Boeing’s director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems.

Boeing’s suit, designed with the Massachusetts-based David Clark Co., weighs about 12 pounds, compared with 30 pounds for NASA’s orange suits formally called the Advanced Crew Escape Suit, or ACES. Developed as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, under which Boeing has a contract worth up to $4.2 billion, the suit is the first of several modern designs to be released. SpaceX will have its own spacesuit for crews flying from Kennedy Space Center to the International Space Station in Dragon spacecraft, possibly as soon as May 2018. NASA is modifying the ACES suit for crews expected to fly in Orion deep space capsules in the early '20s. Boeing’s suit includes boots that resemble running shoes, designed in collaboration with Reebok. White feet gradually bleed into blue pant legs that can be unzipped at the ankles. USA TODAY Boeing, SpaceX progressing toward crew launches Boxy gray pockets on the legs offer room to stow survival gear, pencils or tools. Velcro leg straps provide more places to secure gear that would otherwise float away in microgravity. Blue gloves clipped to the arms are slim and flexible enough to allow crew members to operate tablets loaded with procedures and checklists. “What the spacesuit does is create an artificial environment for them to survive until they can get safely back to land.”Chris Ferguson, former astronaut and director of Boeing’s Starliner Crew and Mission Systems In one fashion-forward flourish, blue and gray pleats line the upper arms and shoulders. Ferguson said the folds were mainly decorative, covering stitching that provides mobility when the suits are inflated. Astronauts will wear headsets for protection and communications, similar to those worn on aircraft carrier decks. Over those will be pulled a soft, blue hood and clear polycarbonate visor, rather than a hard “bubble” helmet. The hood’s front zips to the neck instead of a hard helmet fastening to a heavy metal ring. Interior flaps provide an airtight seal. The “get us home suit,” as Ferguson called it, couldn't be used for a spacewalk. It's intended to provide air and cooling to keep astronauts safe during launch and landings back on land, and during emergencies, like if a micrometeoroid strike caused a loss of cabin pressure. “Space is an unforgiving and hazardous environment,” Ferguson said. “What the spacesuit does is create an artificial environment for them to survive until they can get safely back to land.” Boeing plans to test the Starliner's launch escape system next January in New Mexico. An orbital test flight without a crew could fly by June 2018, before a two-person crew of Boeing and NASA test pilots boards that August in their new blue flight suits.

The change means a further shrinking of the already slim orderbook for the 747-8. Most of the new variant 747s ordered to date have been the -8 freighter version, as airlines increasingly turn to “big twins” for long-haul passenger services. Boeing has reduced the 747-8 production rate to 0.5 aircraft a month as it fulfills remaining orders. Arik Air’s order for the 747-8I dates back to 2011. The two 787-9s are worth $529 million at book value. A regional source, who requested not to be identified, told ATW the 787-9 “makes much better sense” than the 747-8I for Arik Air, notably on routes to the US and UK. Boeing said the delivery dates were a matter for the customer; an Arik Air representative said she did not have that information, but understood deliveries were “not imminent.” According to Arik Air’s website, the Nigerian flag carrier’s long-haul fleet comprises two Airbus A340-500s and two A330-200s. Its short- to medium-haul services are operated by a mixed batch of 10 Boeing 737-700s and -800s, while regional routes are operated by four Bombardier CRJ900s, a single -1000 and two Q400s.

Credit: Boeing Boeing has unveiled the advanced new lightweight spacesuits that astronauts will sport as passengers aboard the company’s CST-100 Starliner space taxi during commercial taxi journey’s to and from and the International Space Station (ISS) and other low Earth orbit destinations. The signature ‘Boeing Blue’ spacesuits will be much lighter, as well as more flexible and comfortable compared to earlier generations of spacesuits wore by America’s astronauts over more than five decades of human spaceflight, starting with the Mercury capsule to the latest gear worn by Space Shuttle astronauts. “The suit capitalizes on historical designs, meets NASA requirements for safety and functionality, and introduces cutting-edge innovations,” say NASA officials. The suits protect the astronauts during both launch and reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere during the return home. Indeed Chris Ferguson, a former NASA Space Shuttle Commander who now works for Boeing as a Starliner program director, helped reveal the ‘Boeing Blue’ spacesuits during a Facebook live event, where he modeled the new suit. “We slogged through some of the real engineering challenges and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it’s time to get on to the rubber meeting the road,” Ferguson said. The suits offer superior functionality, comfort and protection for astronauts who will don them when crewed Starliner flights to the space station begin as soon as next year. Astronaut Eric Boe evaluates Boeing Starliner spacesuit in mockup of spacecraft cockpit. Credits: Boeing At roughly half the weight (about 10 pounds vs. 20 pounds) compared to the launch-and-entry suits worn by space shuttle astronauts, crews look forward to wearing the ‘Boeing Blue’ suits. “Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle,” said Chris Ferguson, Boeing director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems and a former NASA astronaut. Among the advances cited are: • Lighter and more flexible through use of advanced materials and new joint patterns • Helmet and visor incorporated into the suit instead of detachable. The suit’s hood-like soft helmet sports a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space. • A communications headset within the helmet also helps connect astronauts to ground and space crews • Touchscreen-sensitive gloves that allow astronauts to interact with the capsule’s tablets screens overhead • Vents that allow astronauts to be cooler, but can still pressurize the suit immediately • Breathable, slip resistant boots • Zippers in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing • Innovative layers will keep astronauts cooler “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said, in a statement. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” The astronauts help the designers to perfect the suits very practically by wearing them inside Starliner mock-ups, moving around to accomplish tasks, reaching for the tablets screens, and climbing in and out of the capsule repeatedly, says Boe “so they can establish the best ways for astronauts to work inside the spacecraft’s confines.” Astronaut Sunni Williams puts on the communications carrier of Boeing’s new Starliner spacesuit. Credits: Boeing “The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft’s redundant life support systems,” said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don’t need a spacesuit. It’s like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed.” Boeing graphic of Starliner spacesuit features.

The inaugural flight tests are slated to begin in 2018 under contract to NASA. The procedure on launch day will be similar to earlier manned launches. But for Starliner, the capsule will launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket – currently being man-rated.

After reaching Space Launch Complex 41, they will take the elevator up, stride across the recently installed Crew Access Arm and board Starliner as it stands atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The first test flight will carry a crew of two. Soon thereafter the crew size will grow to four when regular crew rotation flights to the ISS start as soon as 2019. “To me, it’s a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we’ve been,” Ferguson said. “The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft.” Boeing is currently manufacturing the Starliner spacecraft at the company’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) NASA unveiled its brand new blue spacesuit and it's a nod to the future. The new gear is Boeing-designed. "Lightweight. Highly mobile. Minimalist. Innovative," Boeing said of the new technology in a statement. The spacesuits will be worn by astronauts who will be on NASA mission aboard the Boeing-designed 'Starliner' spacecraft. "The 'Boeing Blue' suit will be worn by all Starliner crew members during launch, ascent and re-entry and will be customized for each crew member to maximize protection, capability and comfort," the Boeing statement added. NASA said the spacesuit is lightweight, flexible and reportedly comfortable, and includes features that will enable astronauts to use touch screen technology thanks to sensors in the finger areas of the suit. Similar to its predecessor, the suit is built with a bulb to be worn over the head that enables it to become pressurized in the event of an emergency, giving 'Boeing Blue' the iconic space exploration look.

Business Trump's Pentagon Chief Orders Review Of F-35 What is the F-35 fighter jet program? The F-35 fighter jet program is the most expensive weapons program ever with a total estimated cost of $379 billion. The F-35 fighter jet program is the most expensive weapons program ever with a total estimated cost of $379 billion. NAFEESA SYEED, TONY CAPACCIO, RICHARD CLOUGHBloomberg Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, quickly drawing rebukes from members of Connecticut's congressional delegation defending the state's network of defense-related manufacturers. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement Friday that the review of the jet fighter and plans for Boeing to build new Air Force One presidential aircraft, are consistent with guidance from President Trump to "provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation's defense." U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he believes Mattis is responding to demands by the president, who made his first trip to the Pentagon Friday. "Speaking very bluntly and realistically, he had a visit from his boss today," he said. "One of the president's very few pronouncements on defense policy so far has been to express very emphatically and somewhat impulsively that there needs to be an effort to cut costs and perhaps production of the F-35." A spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, which manufactures the engine, did not immediately comment. Greg Hayes, chief executive officer of parent company United Technologies Corp., told investor analysts Wednesday that it negotiates separately from Lockheed and costs drop by about 12 percent each time production is doubled. A statement from Blumenthal, Sen. Chris Murphy and Reps. John Larson and Joe Courtney, all Democrats, said efforts are already being made to cut costs and improve efficiency and production. "Any review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will affirm what has long been established – no aircraft in production today can compare with the Joint Strike Fighter's stealth and survivability," they said. Blumenthal said Friday he'd be surprised if a review of the F-35 concludes that its numbers should be reduced substantially. He said it is critical to U.S. superiority in the air and on the ground. Michael Gilmore, the recently departed director of the Pentagon's testing office, said in a memo this month to senior Pentagon leaders that the Trump administration should "rigorously and comprehensively review" the F-35. He cited the fighter's "significant, well-documented deficiencies in critical combat capabilities." Trump extracted general promises to cut costs on the F-35 and on the new Air Force One after meetings with the chief executive officers of the companies, which are the two biggest U.S. government contractors. The F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program, at a projected cost of $379 billion, although defense officials under former President Barack Obama maintained that the program's days of unending overruns and delays were past. "We have been responsive in providing information to the Trump administration and we look forward to continuing that dialogue as this process moves forward," Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, said in a phone interview. A Lockheed representative didn't respond to a request for comment. Lockheed closed lower, at $253.50, down less than 1 percent. Boeing also declined less than 1 percent, ending the day at $167.70. For Air Force One, Mattis said the review will identify how to "substantially reduce the program's costs." The Pentagon has budgeted $3.2 billion through fiscal 2021 for research and development, construction and acquisition of two of the aircraft used by presidents, with more spending anticipated after that, according to Kevin Brancato, a government contracting analyst with Bloomberg Government. The plane itself is a relatively small portion of the cost, he said. Air Force One planes are flying fortresses, outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses. In a memorandum on the F-35, Mattis said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to "determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost" of the fighter jet, saying it should begin immediately. Mattis' directive gives Boeing a chance -- even if it's a long-shot -- to reenter a program it lost to Lockheed in 2001, when its candidate for a stealthy fighter was passed over. The new defense secretary ordered a study of whether Boeing's older F/A-18 Super Hornet could be upgraded to provide a less costly alternative to the Navy version of the F-35. The deputy defense secretary "will oversee a review that compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative," Mattis said in his directive. The Navy version of the F-35 is easier to target than those tailored for the Air Force and Marine Corps because it's not scheduled to become operational until February 2019. While the F-35 has advantages over the Boeing plane, such as its greater stealth capabilities, that's not always necessary, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. "The value you get for the F-35 on a maintenance basis and the differentials that you get relative to range, payload and speed don't always warrant it being the first choice," he said in a telephone interview. Connecticut's congressional delegation criticized Trump in December for his tweets condemning the cost of the F-35 and call for an assessment of whether the Super Hornet can be an alternative to the fighter jet. Courtney said then the difference in stealth capabilities "is not even close." Under current plans, the Pentagon is scheduled to increase purchases of the F-35 in the coming fiscal year 2018 budget to 70 from 63 this year. Then, the number would grow to 80 in fiscal 2019. There's also a pending "block buy" of 450 aircraft in the coming years as the Pentagon seeks a total fleet of 2,443, including 1,763 for the Air Force.

Mattis issued the reviews in order to “inform programmatic and budgetary decisions, recognizing the critical importance of each of these acquisition programs,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement Friday. “This action is also consistent with the president’s guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation’s defense.” In December, Trump tweeted that F-35 costs are “out of control,” and this month he boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” without identifying which projects he was referring to. Trump extracted general promises to cut costs on the F-35 and on the new Air Force One after meetings with the chief executive officers of the companies, which are the two biggest U.S. government contractors. “We have been responsive in providing information to the Trump administration and we look forward to continuing that dialogue as this process moves forward,” Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, said in a phone interview.

In a memorandum on the F-35, Mattis said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to “determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost” of the fighter jet, saying it should begin immediately. He also ordered a study of whether Boeing’s older F/A-18 Super Hornet could be upgraded to provide a less costly alternative to the Lockheed fighter, a proposal defense analysts have said is probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. The deputy defense secretary “will oversee a review that compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative,” Mattis said in his directive.

For Air Force One, Mattis said the review will identify how to “substantially reduce the program’s costs.” Lockheed shares reversed gains, dropping 0.5 percent to $253.73 at 1:13 p.m. New York time.

The review of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 program, which President Donald Trump has derided as being too expensive, would have two parts: one looking at how to cut costs, and the other determining whether Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, with improvements, could be an effective, cheaper alternative, the memo said. Costs for Lockheed Martin's F-35 program have escalated to an estimated $379 billion. The program accounted for 20 percent of the company's total revenue of $46.1 billion last year. The chances that the review would cause a major change were low, according to a report published by Byron Callan, an analyst at research firm Capital Alpha Partners. Callan said costs could be cut if requirements and the aircraft's capabilities were also relaxed. In a statement released on Friday afternoon, Lockheed Martin said it stood ready to support Mattis' review of the program, adding that the cost of the F-35 could go down if the United States and other customers committed to purchasing the planes in larger, multi-year batches. The review of the Air Force One replacement, which Trump has also called too expensive, would look at the plane's requirements and systems and identify courses of action to reduce acquisition and sustainment costs. In December, Trump extracted a promise from Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg that the cost of replacing Air Force One would not exceed $4 billion. "We're going to get it done for less than that," Muilenburg told reporters last month, "and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens." On Friday, a Boeing representative said the company has been providing information to the Trump administration for some weeks and was committed to providing equipment to the military as affordably as possible.

It is understood that the Welsh Government, working with Cardiff Airport executives and with the backing of Secretary of State for Wales, Alun Cairns, were bidding to secure the lucrative project, running into hundreds of millions of pounds, to bring all of Boeing’s military plane related maintenance, repair and overhaul activities in the UK to south Wales. Following a long list of possible sites across the UK, it is understood that a site at Cardiff Airport made it to the last two. Cardiff Airport However, while there is still a glimmer of hope, the investment is set to go to the MoD’s Boscombe Down facility in Wiltshire - where Boeing already has a significant presence. Read More New terminal building on the radar of Cardiff Airport Boeing executives in the US are understood be have been hugely impressed at the inward investment bid package compiled by the Welsh Government and the growing strength and skills base of the south Wales aerospace sector. As a result there is a possibility that other Boeing projects in the future could come to south Wales. The Welsh Government declined to comment specifically if it had been in the running for the Boeing project, the location for which has yet to be officially confirmed. However, a spokesman said: “We are constantly looking for opportunities to grow Wales’ economy and are working hard to attract major projects and businesses to Wales. We cannot comment further at this time.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Business Newsletter Follow @BusinessinWales Subscribe to our Business newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Christian Davenport By Christian Davenport January 27 at 1:14 PM Follow @wapodavenport NASA astronauts will be wearing this spacesuit when they voyage to the International Space Station on Boeing's new Starliner space capsule. (The Washington Post) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — They’ll take the elevator 175 feet above the shoreline, then march 15 steps across the platform and 13 down the grated gangplank to the double doors that open to a small white room. There the astronauts will make their final preparations, adjust their spacesuits, check their equipment, before stepping into the spacecraft. This is the walk the astronauts will take as part of the NASA’s effort to restore human spaceflights from U.S. soil by 2018, ending an ignominious hiatus that has endured since the space shuttle was retired in 2011. Now, NASA is depending on two commercial companies — Boeing and SpaceX — to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station, under contracts worth billions of dollars. Both companies have faced technical and design challenges that have forced them to push back the dates of their initial flights — delays that could prove costly. But there are growing signs that the companies are making progress, and this week Boeing provided a glimpse of what’s to come, opening up some of its new facilities here for the first time and unveiling its new spacesuit. The crew access arm extends from the newly built tower at Launch Complex 41. (Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) A new crew tower at Launch Complex 41, the last place on Earth the astronauts will walk before stepping into the company’s Starliner spacecraft, is one example of the company’s progress. It’s a massive structure, made of 1.4 million pounds of steel, that adds yet another point to the cape’s skyline and offers a penthouse-like view of the shoreline. Boeing has also built a new mission control room at the Kennedy Space Center, with rows of computer consoles that will one day monitor the rocket’s health, its communications, fuel and navigation systems. Then there’s the sleek new blue Boeing spacesuit that, at 20 pounds, weighs 10 pounds less than the one worn by shuttle astronauts. It comes with gloves that work on touch screens and lightweight boots designed by Reebok that feel like slippers. Instead of having a huge fishbowl bubble helmet, as the shuttle astronauts’ suits did, the new suit’s helmet slips over the head like a hood. “We like to think this represents the future of what protective space gear will be,” said Chris Ferguson, a former NASA astronaut and ex-Navy fighter pilot who is now Boeing’s director of crew and mission systems. Because it’s so lightweight and flexible, Ferguson said, “it feels a lot more like a flight suit than a spacesuit.” Elon Musk’s SpaceX is designing its own suit that it has not yet been unveiled. But just across the cape, SpaceX has made visible progress with its new launch site, the historic Pad 39A that was used during the Apollo and shuttle eras. A SpaceX processing building sits next to Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Jan. 25. (Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) That launch site, which years ago was rusting away in the salt air, has been completely renovated. Nearby, the company has built a massive rocket hangar that has the SpaceX logo emblazoned across it — a potent symbol of the private sector putting its stamp on the venerable government facility. SpaceX plans to christen the pad within days, launching the first rocket from 39A since the last shuttle mission, some six years ago. The work by SpaceX and Boeing is part of a broader effort to transform Cape Canaveral from an area once dominated by the government to what NASA calls a “multi-user spaceport,” one that is home to several commercial companies. Jeffrey P. Bezos’s Blue Origin is also leasing a launch site here. The company is building a massive 750,000-square-foot facility where it wants to build its New Glenn rocket, which it plans to fly from here by the end of the decade. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Moon Express, which is vying to land a spacecraft on the moon as part of the Google Lunar X Prize, has also had a partnership with NASA to test its lunar lander at the Kennedy Space Center. But nothing will represent the cape’s renaissance more than the return of human spaceflight from its shores. Boeing and SpaceX are competing to see which company will fly first. SpaceX says its first test flight with passengers is scheduled for May 2018. Boeing plans to make its first uncrewed flight in June 2018, with a two-person test flight in December of that year. Both companies, however, have faced delays that the NASA inspector general’s office last year warned could force NASA to buy more seats from the Russians, who currently take U.S. astronauts to the space station. The inspector general found that Russia’s price for ferrying U.S. astronauts jumped 284 percent over the past decade, growing from $21.3 million in 2006 to $81.9 million last year. In its report, the watchdog said it believed that neither company would “achieve certified, crewed flight to the ISS until late 2018.” In the past, funding shortfalls led to the delays, the inspector general said. But “technical challenges with the contractors’ spacecraft designs are now driving the schedule slippages,” it said. Boeing’s spacecraft, the Starliner, has had problems with its mass and the effects of vibrations during launch. SpaceX’s delays came when it changed its capsule design to land in the water instead of on land, it said. Boeing’s Ferguson said that “turning from the design effort to the manufacturing effort became more of a challenge than we anticipated.” The company has “slogged through some of the real engineering challenges, and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it’s time to get on to the rubber meeting the road,” he said. Astronaut Sunita Williams stands on the roof of the newly built tower at Launch Complex 41. (Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) Sunita Williams, one of four NASA astronauts chosen to fly on the first commercial flights, said she is “pumped” by the prospect of launching again from American soil. “We’re getting closer and closer,” she said. But she acknowledged that the companies still have “a long road and they have a lot to do. But I am really encouraged and excited at the pace at which both companies are taking this challenge. … Things are ticking along. It’s going to happen.” Correction: An earlier version of this post said the amount Russia charges to ferry U.S. astronauts had jumped 384 percent. It is 284 percent.

Airports and communities also court these new services. There are dozens of changes to airline routes each month. Here's a look at some of the most interesting from January. Southwest finally comes to Cincinnati Cincinnati and the Cayman Islands are in. The Ohio cites of Dayton and Akron-Canton are out. That was the shakeout as Southwest rolled out its summer flight schedule and extended its booking schedule through Aug. 14. Southwest's Cincinnati and Grand Cayman flights will each start on June 4. From Cincinnati, which had long been the biggest metro area that Southwest did not serve, Southwest will offer non-stop service to its bases at Baltimore/Washington and Chicago Midway. Southwest’s Grand Cayman service will operate from its base in Fort Lauderdale. Southwest will end all of its service to Dayton and Akron-Canton on June 3. Those destinations joined Southwest’s network after its 2010 merger with AirTran.

But Emirates’ Newark flights will not operate non-stop to its main hub in Dubai, but rather to the Greek capital of Athens. The flights will continue on to Dubai, operating with a stop in Athens in each direction. The Newark-Athens route launches March 12 and will become Emirates' second between the USA and Europe. It also flies from New York JFK to Milan. Those flights are in addition to the four daily round-trip flights Emirates operates between JFK and Dubai. FULL REPORT: Emirates to add non-stop Newark-Athens flights | ALSO ONLINE: Emirates shows off its Airbus A380 superjumbo at Washington Dulles Emirates’ U.S. rivals Delta and United each already fly non-stop to Athens from New York, but only seasonally during the summer. United serves Athens from its hub at Newark Liberty while Delta flies to Athens from its hub at New York JFK. Emirates’ non-stop connections between the USA and Europe are allowed under “fifth freedom” aviation rights granted to airlines in countries with which the United States has a liberal “Open Skies” aviation pact. Those rights allow an airline to carry passengers between two foreign cities as long as the flight continues as one-stop service to that carrier’s home-country. A number of other airlines fly fifth freedom routes from the USA, including Singapore Airlines' route between Houston and Manchester, England, and Cathay Pacific's non-stop service between New York and Vancouver.

The carrier will fly one daily round-trip flight on the Haneda route on Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Narita is Tokyo’s primary international gateway while Haneda’s route map is more heavily tilted toward regional flights. For many travelers, Haneda is the preferred Tokyo airport because of its proximity to the city. JAL was able to add the route at slot-controlled Haneda airport by freeing up slots from another route. To make that happen, JAL’s Honolulu-Haneda route will be shifted to Narita, according to the airline. FULL REPORT: Japan Airlines to launch NYC-Tokyo Haneda flights Washington to Delhi, no stops Washington’s Dulles International Airport will get a non-stop flight to India. The Air India service would begin in July, with the state-owned national carrier planning non-stop service from Delhi. The capital-to-capital route is expected to operate three times a week on Boeing 777 aircraft, The Times of India reports. Washington Dulles will be Air India’s fifth U.S. destination, joining Chicago O’Hare, New York JFK, Newark Liberty and San Francisco. Air India would be the only carrier offering non-stop service to India from Washington.

Delta adds 7 more Seattle routes The “battle for Seattle” shows little sign of slowing down. Delta Air Lines announced plans for seven new routes from Seattle, all of which will go head-to-head with service offered on Seattle-based Alaska Airlines. The new routes will give Delta's Seattle customers non-stop access to Austin; Eugene, Ore.; Lihue, Hawaii; Milwaukee; Nashville; Raleigh/Durham; and Redmond, Ore. Three of Delta’s new routes – Milwaukee, Nashville and Raleigh/Durham – match service that Alaska Airlines has added just since 2015. FULL STORY: Turf war? Delta adds 7 more Seattle routes | MORE: Delta optimistic Trump will deal with airports, Mideast rivals With the new service, Delta says its Seattle schedule will increase to 160 peak-day flights to 49 destinations. Delta also will increase capacity on existing Seattle service, adding either more flights or bigger planes on six other Seattle routes. Delta’s latest Seattle expansion continues an ongoing turf war between it and Alaska Airlines. The carriers were close partners earlier this decade, though they announced in December that they’d formally terminate their codeshare and frequent-flier pacts.

Elements of this image furnished by NASA. (Shutterstock/Marc Ward)    5447326 Boeing unveiled its new NASA spacesuits Wednesday, and they look like something our of “Star Trek.” The new “Boeing Blue” spacesuits for the Starliner capsule weigh about 20 pounds each with all of their accessories, which is 10 pounds less than Space Shuttle suits. The suits are designed not for spacewalks, but to keep astronauts safe in the event of an emergency. “It is a lot lighter, more formfitting, and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing,” Eric Boe, a NASA astronaut, said in a statement. “Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” WATCH: Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg pledged in October that his company will beat billionaire Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX to Mars. Musk plans to send the first unmanned missions to Mars in 2018 or 2020. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at a conference.“That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will. The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.” Boeing was deeply involved in NASA’s Apollo program, which sent astronauts to the moon, and is currently developing the space agency’s Space Launch System, which will eventually send U.S. astronauts to Mars. The aerospace giant is also working to build out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine.

The noticeably slimmer looking space suit is part of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, an under-construction capsule designed to transport crew to the International Space Station. SPACE CITY: NASA to display space vehicle during Super Bowl LI festivities For more than a decade, NASA has relied on Russia to transport crew to the ISS, paying roughly $70 million per seat to hitch a ride on the Soyuz spacecraft.  NASA astronauts and passengers that plan to travel to the ISS with Boeing now have a good idea of what they'll be sporting.  According to Boeing, the new space suits are about 40 percent lighter than previous suits, have touchscreen-friendly gloves, and a wide polycarbonate visor with a built-in headset. THE RED PLANET: The coolest photos from Opportunity rover's 13-year Mars mission "Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle," said Chris Ferguson, Boeing's director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems and a former NASA astronaut, in a prepared statement.

Investors Should Listen To This Company's Outlook Rockwell Collins' outlook creates mixed conclusions for the industry. Here's what management said. Lee Samaha (TMFSaintGermain) Jan 27, 2017 at 10:13AM One of the largest aerospace and Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) suppliers, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE:COL), has released its first-quarter earnings and discussed its outlook for the aviation market in 2017. Let's take a look at what was said and what it means to the aviation industry and for Boeing. Rockwell Collins in 2017 Management maintained the guidance it gave in October, so no surprises there. That's all well and good, but in reality Rockwell Collins' near- to mid-term outlook will be heavily influenced by its pending acquisition of B/E Aerospace Inc. (NASDAQ:BEAV), a maker of aircraft seating and cabin interiors. Since the guidance doesn't include any assumptions regarding B/E Aerospace, the new outlook doesn't say much that investors don't already know about Rockwell Collins. Aside from the inherent uncertainty with the acquisition, there's also likely to be some competitive changes now that key rival Zodiac Aerospace has been bid for by fellow French company Safran. Bridging the gap between production of the 777 and the 777X is a key priority for Boeing Co. Image source: Boeing Co. Business jet market Turning to the industry outlook, CEO Kelly Ortberg remarked that the troubled business-jet market -- a highly cyclical industry affected heavily by business confidence -- "hasn't got any worse" but also hasn't started "to turn" as yet. However, he pointed out that customers are "generally reporting a pretty good fourth quarter" in contrast to last year. In other words, the underlying conditions are there for a business aviation recovery, and if President Trump spurs economic growth, then a turnaround could come. Commercial-jet market However, the nuance in Ortberg's outlook for the commercial aerospace cycle will greatly interest Boeing and aviation customers. Otberg expressed a "feeling" that the current order cycle won't "convert into an overall delivery cycle," meaning that the backlog created by strong commercial aircraft orders in 2013 and 2014 (see the following Boeing chart) will mean deliveries won't fall dramatically in line with the reductions in orders in 2015 and 2016. Narrow-body aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737, "are fine." Wide-body aircraft, such as Boeing's 777 and 747-8, will see continued softness, and the industry will "probably continue to see higher levels of retirements of the legacy wide-body aircraft." Conditions will improve for wide-body aircraft when the 777X (Boeing's replacement for the 777, which is expected to have its first delivery in 2020) comes "into the marketplace." Data source: Boeing Co presentations. Chart by author. What it all means Otberg's business-jet outlook isn't much of a surprise. It's a cyclical industry, and clearly the economy needs to see more growth before business confidence grows enough to encourage new business-jet orders. However, the commercial-jet outlook is interesting, because it creates mixed conclusions as the narrow-body aircraft market is set to do better than the wide-body market. On one hand, it's positive that Otberg sees sustained growth in deliveries and strength in the narrow-body aircraft market. This comes as Boeing's orders appeared to have peaked in 2014 (see the preceding chart) and as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that global airline net-tax profits will fall to $29.8 billion in 2017 from $35.6 billion in 2016. Data source: IATA. Chart by author On the other hand, Otberg's commentary with regard to continued softness in the wide-body aircgraft market would put some more pressure on Boeing if it proves to be accurate. Boeing is facing a challenge as it tries to bridge the gap between production of the 777 and the 777X. Boeing generated just 17 net orders for the 777 aircraft in 2016, forcing the company to cut to production on the 777 to five a month in August 2017, down from a rate of 8.3 a month in 2016. Given that the 777 is a highly cash-generative aircraft for Boeing, and the 777X faces increased start-up production costs, any further pressure on 777 sales could create challenges, not least for Boeing's plans to increase cash flows in the coming years. Looking ahead All told, Rockwell Collins' company-specific outlook is positive, but its year will largely be defined by how events unfold with B/E Aerospace. Meanwhile, the industry outlook is broadly positive but contains some question marks for Boeing. The aviation giant releases its earnings Jan. 25, and investors would be well advised to listen for analyst questions on 777 production and whether Boeing can grow cash flow as it prepares for the debut of the 777X in 2020.

That all changes now, and it’s thanks to Boeing’s stylish new space traveler gear. The suits are a complete rethinking of the personal life support system that astronauts have worn for decades, and they also happen to be really, really cool looking. Don't Miss: T-Mobile changes customer’s name to ‘IDIOT IDIOT’ after billing dispute Boeing’s new space suits, which the company reportedly nicknamed “Boeing Blue,” are a lot less bulky than the ones typically used by modern astronauts, and a great deal more flexible. The material used in their construction is lighter and new “joint patterns” have been engineered to facilitate more nimble movement. The traditional round dome helmet is long gone, and Boeing’s suit uses a hooded design and a pressurized zipper to provide the protection needed but with less clunkiness than the current designs. According to NASA, the new suit also has a few other tricks, including a venting system that allows water vapor to pass through while retaining air pressure, making it cooler to wear. Additionally, the integrated gloves feature touchscreen-compatible fingertips, and the new boots — which are more like athletic shoes than ever before — have been designed by the footwear gurus at Reebok. The all-new suits are expected to find their way into space in 2018 when astronauts head to the International Space Station via Boeing’s new Starliner space capsule, assuming they pass whatever tests NASA has in store between now and launch.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio January 26, 2017 A military program has created an Android-based super secure smartphone that goes with the office of the President. Is Trump using it? Among the privileges and cool stuff that come with being the president of the United States is a highly modified Boeing Black smartphone, an encrypted device certified to handle Top Secret data. The Defense Department Information Systems Agency, or DISA, developed the phone with help from Boeing and other partners, the phone “goes with the office” of the President. But is Donald Trump using it — or his old and far less secure Android phone? The DISA phone emerged from the agency’s Mobility Classified Capability program. A fact sheet says the program uses “commercial mobile devices (smart phones and hotspot devices) and commercial mobile architecture components” such as commercial virtual private networking. The sheet describes the phone as “NSA-approved,” and lists “Top Secret” communication capability as “coming soon.” (The fact sheet does not mention the Boeing Black, but when Defense One asked DISA if the two were separate, an official replied, “no.”) As of November 1, DISA had handed out at least two of the phones, to President Obama and to Cyber Command leader Adm. Mike Rogers, according to DISA chief Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn, who spoke at the Milcom conference in Baltimore. Lynn was initially coy when asked who helped DISA make the device: “I don’t want everyone to know who’s making good stuff for me because there’s a lot of partners. I don’t want to just highlight one. Although I’m sure the question might have come from that one.” A moment later, he softened. “I’ll tell you who worked on the Top Secret one, Boeing did. Boeing Black is the device we’re working with.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. He added that DISA was “just now in the test phase of it.” Since then, DISA has become a bit shy in discussing the device. When we asked whether Obama’s Boeing Black phone had been given to Donald Trump, a DISA official, speaking on background, said only that the phone “goes with the office of that position.” Officials with White House Communications Agency, the DISA department that handles communications for the White House but is operationally independent, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A bit about the phone: In 2014, Boeing filed required paperwork with the Federal Communications Commission, and received FCC ID H8VBLK1. The filing details an Android-based, dual-sim-card phone that can switch between civilian and classified and civilian networks, including WCDMA, GSM, and LTE networking at 3G. The phone’s most important and famous feature: when you try to break it open, it self-destructs. According to the FCC filing: “Any attempt to break open the casing of the device would trigger functions that would delete the data and software contained within the device and make the device inoperable.” Boeing would not discuss how the phone has changed since those 2014 filings. But Lynn talked a bit about the agency’s numerous modifications. Almost no data resides on the phone itself, which he described as being “close to a VDI,” a virtual desktop infrastructure. That means that the phone is little more than a window into another computer somewhere else. In addition, there is “a large amount of encryption tied into it.” Is Trump using the phone that DISA made for the President? Boeing referred inquiries to DISA, who referred us to the White House, who did not answer. On Jan. 20, the Associated Press reported that Trump had surrendered his insecure Android-based Samsung Galaxy to security services. But on Thursday, the New York Times reported that the President was still using an unsecured phone: “Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their 10-year-old son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television — and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides — to keep him company.” This worries at least some security experts.  “This is a consumer device, and it’s going to have security vulnerabilities,” Bruce Schneier writes. “He’s at risk from everybody, ranging from lone hackers to the better-funded intelligence agencies of the world. And while the risk of a forged e-mail is real — it could easily move the stock market — the bigger risk is eavesdropping. That Android has a microphone, which means that it can be turned into a room bug without anyone’s knowledge. That’s my real fear.” Patrick Tucker is technology editor for Defense One. He’s also the author of The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move? (Current, 2014). Previously, Tucker was deputy editor for The Futurist for nine years.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) NASA unveiled its brand new blue spacesuit and it's a nod to the future. The new gear is Boeing-designed. "Lightweight. Highly mobile. Minimalist. Innovative," Boeing said of the new technology in a statement. The spacesuits will be worn by astronauts who will be on NASA mission aboard the Boeing-designed 'Starliner' spacecraft. "The 'Boeing Blue' suit will be worn by all Starliner crew members during launch, ascent and re-entry and will be customized for each crew member to maximize protection, capability and comfort," the Boeing statement added. NASA said the spacesuit is lightweight, flexible and reportedly comfortable, and includes features that will enable astronauts to use touch screen technology thanks to sensors in the finger areas of the suit. Similar to its predecessor, the suit is built with a bulb to be worn over the head that enables it to become pressurized in the event of an emergency, giving 'Boeing Blue' the iconic space exploration look.

The bulky NASA ones of the days of the space shuttle are now a thing of the past, as Boeing has unveiled a new model. The sleeker, more flexible piece of spacecraft tailoring is part of the aeronautics company’s Starliner system, a next-generation piece of kit designed specifically for astronauts to wear on journeys to and from the International Space Station, and maybe even beyond. The brains behind the new suit design come from former astronaut Chris Ferguson, the director of Boeing’s Starliner Crew & Mission Systems programme, and lead designer Shane Jacobs. “Astronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn’t need that,” Ferguson explained in a Boeing video. “We’ve simplified the suit. It’s lightweight.” Advancing astronaut apparel During the era of the NASA’s space shuttle programme, running from 1981 to 2011, a typical space suit weighed almost 15kg, while Boeing’s new model shaves off almost two thirds of that, coming in at 5.4kg. Other features include gloves enabled with touchscreen-sensitive material, a helmet and visor built into the design, and greater mobility at the elbows and knees. Vents in the suit also allow water vapour to escape, but keep oxygen in, meaning the internal temperature won’t rise like in the previous designs. The suits are specifically designed to be worn in Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which will see its first test flight take off in 2018.

The spacesuits will be worn by astronauts who will be on NASA mission aboard the Boeing-designed 'Starliner' spacecraft.

This satellite, ABS-2A, joins ABS-3A as Boeing’s second all-electric propulsion 702 satellite for ABS. Boeing is the first satellite manufacturer to build and deliver all-electric propulsion satellites. “We have completed our three-satellite build investment in launching three satellites in three consecutive years, including ABS-2 in 2014 as well as Boeing’s ABS-3A in 2015 and ABS-2A in 2016,” said Tom Choi, CEO of ABS. “ABS-2A is the latest high-capacity satellite providing expansion and continuity of satellite services at ABS’ prime gateway over the Indian Ocean region. It is located with ABS-2 at our premium neighborhood at 75°E optimized for video services for growing television community access and direct-to-home businesses.” All-electric satellites can be launched as pairs, as ABS-2A was in June 2016. This improves efficiency and affordability for the customer. “This latest delivery reaffirms our leadership with all-electric propulsion,” said Mark Spiwak, president, Boeing Satellite Systems International. “Our ability to stack and join the satellites using our patented design enables our customers to minimize the costs associated with launching a single satellite.” See other recent news regarding: Boeing, Satellite.

Eric Berger - Jan 27, 2017 2:41 pm UTC Enlarge / SpaceX revealed its Dragon V2 spacecraft in May, 2014. It's still a ways from the launch pad. SpaceX reader comments 44 Share this story This week Boeing made a public splash by debuting a new blue spacesuit for astronauts to wear aboard its Starliner spacecraft. What the company did not dwell on as it rolled out “Boeing Blue,” however, was when the lighter, more modern-looking flight suits might be put into action with crewed flights into orbit. That is because much work remains to integrate all of Starliner’s various systems, including qualifying them for flight, ensuring their compatibility, and writing and testing software that will make for smooth flying. And Boeing is not alone; its “commercial crew” competitor SpaceX also faces similar technical hurdles with the Dragon V2 spacecraft and the Falcon 9 rocket that will launch it into space. Further ReadingBoeing releases snazzy new blue spacesuits for Starliner fliers Boeing has set a “no earlier than” date of August 2018 for its first crewed test flight, and SpaceX has targeted May 2018. But those dates seem optimistic. Ars spoke to a handful of sources familiar with the commercial crew program this week, and all expressed pessimism about the public timelines the companies have for reaching the launch pad. According to this unofficial analysis, even a single crewed test flight in 2018 by either company now appears unlikely, as teams from both Boeing and SpaceX continue to work through significant technical issues. Space really is hard There is an old cliché in the aerospace industry that is nonetheless entirely true—space is hard. Only Russia, the United States, and more recently China have ever launched humans into orbit. Now two private companies, funded by NASA, are seeking to do the same. That no one else has yet done this speaks to the challenge. In the early part of this decade, a skeptical Congress hindered the commercial crew program by under-funding it, which caused initial delays from 2015 to 2017. Last year, for the first time, Congress more or less provided every penny NASA requested for its contracts with Boeing and SpaceX. In September, NASA Inspector General Paul Martin reported that delays beyond 2017 were largely due to technical issues. NASA, too, bore some of the blame for its lumbering evaluation and review processes as Boeing and SpaceX developed their spacecraft, Martin said. NASA, of course, desperately wants the private companies to succeed. Since the Space Shuttle’s retirement in 2011, the space agency has relied on Russia and its aging Soyuz family of rockets and spacecraft to transport its astronauts to the International Space Station. And in the meantime, Congress has groused about paying an increasingly steep price for Soyuz “seats.” Further ReadingAs leadership departs, NASA quietly moves to buy more Soyuz seats NASA currently has contracts with Russia through 2018 to get its astronauts to the station. However, a delay of test flights into 2019 would necessarily push the first “operational” commercial crew flights into spring or summer of 2019 at a minimum. So, earlier this month, NASA revealed a clever plan that would allow it to procure additional Soyuz seats for 2019 while also reducing the threat of political blowback. Officials within the ISS program, based in Houston, helped broker a deal for Boeing to acquire the “rights” to sell three Soyuz seats in 2019. Boeing received these rights from Russia's Energia as compensation for the settlement of a lawsuit involving the Sea Launch joint venture. In essence, then, when NASA tells the White House and Congress it needs to buy additional seats for 2019 due to commercial crew delays, it will be asking for money to buy them from Boeing—an American company—rather than Russia. Crew assignments NASA has therefore bought some more time for its commercial crew partners. As we get deeper into 2017, there are some clues that can help us track whether Boeing and SpaceX are making good progress. Foremost is the actual assignment of crews to the first missions. The space agency has previously designated four veterans as its commercial crew astronauts—Bob Behnken, Sunita Williams, Doug Hurley, and Eric Boe—who have since been familiarizing themselves with both new vehicles. These four astronauts are unlikely to be assigned to Boeing or SpaceX until such time that crews are formally announced, not only for the initial two-person test flights, but also for the subsequent operational flights. So there would potentially be two two-person crews named (one for each Boeing and SpaceX), as well as two larger crews, which would include astronauts flying to the station for a regular, multi-month increment. The timing of these announcements is critical, as they would have to occur at least 18 months before the operational flights begin. This would allow the astronauts flying to the station for long-duration missions time to prepare for all their work aboard the ISS. Ars understands the naming of these crews won’t occur before at least June or July of this year—probably later. Rocket concerns Both companies are having trouble with not only their spacecraft, but their rockets as well. The Starliner will launch on the highly reliable Atlas V rocket, but wind-tunnel tests have shown some problems with aeroacoustic issues when the Starliner is stacked atop the Atlas V during launch. Boeing may need to perform additional tests this year to demonstrate that it has moved beyond these issues. For SpaceX, it will be critical to watch the company’s development of its Falcon 9 rocket. With two failures in 18 months, the company needs to prove to NASA that its booster is safe. The issue is complicated by the fact that SpaceX continues to work toward a “final” version of its Falcon 9 rocket—Block 5—which founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk said will fly by the end of this year. The Block 5 variant of the Falcon 9 is being designed for optimal safety and easier return for potential reuse. It will also be the variant upon which the crewed Dragon spacecraft ultimately flies. Further ReadingSpaceX is about to launch one of its final expendable rockets NASA will want to see multiple flights of this Block 5 version before it allows astronauts on top of it. Among those flights will be an uncrewed test flight of the Dragon V2 spacecraft, which will likely dock with the space station. As part of its milestones for Dragon V2, SpaceX nominally plans to conduct this uncrewed test flight in late 2017. However, because it now seems unlikely that the Block 5 version of the Falcon 9 will make its maiden flight before late this year, the Dragon V2 test flight will almost certainly slip into 2018. How much it is delayed into 2018 should provide some clues as to how overly optimistic the rest of SpaceX’s commercial crew targets remain. Promoted Comments Statistical Ars Praefectus et Subscriptor jump to post Space is hard. Cliche but true. Delays are all but inevitable. They were inevitable in Apollo and they are inevitable now. That Congress created necessary political delays on top of the real technical delays you know were coming is just stupid. Still even if they don't fly crews until 2019, the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, which includes both Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply, will be an amazing success. The development portion of COTS funding was $800M for resupply and $3.3B for crew (~$1.5B in development and $1.8B for certification flights). That includes funding for the spacecraft not selected as well. So for roughly $4B NASA got (or will get) three independent resupply vehicles and two independent crew transfer vehicles. That is just insanely low when you consider historically how much it has cost to develop a single new spacecraft. Plus those vehicles use a variety of launchers which means the entire fleet should never be grounded due to a fault in one launcher. The services portion of COTS is up to $3.5B for resupply for up to 20 supply runs to the ISS and up to $5.0B for crew to provide up to twelve round trip crew flights (at least 4 astronauts per flight). The services portion is paid on a per mission basis so the numbers represent the max awards if NASA opts to use the maximum number of launches allowed by the contract. Most of this hasn't been paid yet. 9930 posts | registered 9/27/2010 Eric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 aviation Latest update : 2017-01-27 Flight MH370: Families of missing passengers search for the truth Tweet It’s a unique case in the history of modern aviation. Nearly three years after its disappearance, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a Boeing 777 with 239 people on board, has still not been found. The official search has now been called off and no satisfactory conclusion has been reached to lessen the families’ immense pain. Some suspect the authorities are hiding the truth from them and have decided to carry out their own investigation. Our reporters followed them in their search efforts. On the night of March 7-8, 2014, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 took off from a runway in Kuala Lumpur, heading for Beijing. It was a regular scheduled flight, like thousands of others every day, with nothing special about it. On board were 12 crew members and 227 passengers, 153 of them Chinese nationals. But at 00:41 local time, as the plane prepared to enter Vietnamese airspace, all communications were cut off. The aircraft suddenly disappeared from radar screens. A few days later, the official version established that the 777 turned around, flew over the Malaysian peninsula and followed the Indonesian and Thai borders. Then, based on data provided by Inmarsat satellites, it apparently continued its path towards the south of the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel. According to the satellites, it eventually crashed somewhere out at sea, in a vast area off Australia. Very quickly, Malaysia, China and Australia began search operations. But the surface to be covered was huge – over 60,000 square kilometres – and the weather hostile. Radars, sonar technology and submarines were deployed for this unprecedented exploration effort. But after nearly three years of combing the seabed, no part of the Boeing has been located and almost 200 million dollars have been spent. On Tuesday January 17, Malaysia, Australia and China announced they were suspending their search, for lack of convincing results, fuelling the resentment of the families, be they Chinese, Malaysian or French. An American investigator in Madagascar Isolated and lacking official support, the relatives of the victims are clinging to a few fragile pieces of airplane debris found washed up on beaches in the Indian Ocean. In particular, fragments of a plane’s wing were found on Reunion Island in 2015 and in Tanzania the following year. Other pieces of wreckage have been recovered off Mauritius and Madagascar. There are around 30 in total, but only three of these fragments have been authenticated as belonging to the doomed Boeing. Meanwhile, the investigation entrusted to the Malaysian authorities is moving too slowly for the families’ liking. The leads first envisaged are ruled out one after the other: pilot suicide, a technical fault, a terrorist hijacking… Exasperated, the families’ representatives have now decided that they themselves will take part in the search for debris on the coasts of Madagascar, where some wreckage has already been found. In Antananarivo, the capital, they met up with an American private investigator, Blaine Gibson. For more than a year, this adventurer has decided to spend his own money to crisscross the Indian Ocean in a bid to find debris. He says he has collected around 15 pieces of wreckage just by himself. Our reporters Renaud Fessaguet and Pierre Chabert accompanied the families of victims in this hunt for debris against the odds. It's a painstaking task which may, one day, finally lead to the truth.

News Week In Review: Dow Hits 20K On Trump Rally; Boeing Hot, Google Iced The Dow industrials hit 20,000 as the Trump rally fueled infrastructure and financial stocks. (Adobe) IBD STAFF 1/27/2017 Reprints The Dow Jones industrial average hit 20,000 as the major averages rallied to fresh record highs on President Trump's early policy moves. Earnings reports generally were positive, but Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) were among those with disappointing results. M&A deals, buzz and rejections were rife. Dow Industrials Hit Milestone As Banks, Infrastructure Stocks Lead The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% for the week, topping 20,000 for the first time. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also hit record highs, up 1.9% and 1%, respectively, amid a slew of earnings, including Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA) and Boeing (BA). President Trump authorized a border wall and two key oil pipelines, lifting a wide variety of construction and materials related firms such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), but not steel makers. Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) broke out, joining other FANG+ stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield rose, lifting bank stocks. Alphabet Earnings Fall Short Google parent Alphabet said Q4 earnings per share minus items rose 8% to $9.36, below views for $9.64. Total revenue rose 22% to $26.1 billion, topping forecasts for 25.26 billion. Revenue growth slowed from 28% in the prior-year period. The internet search and advertising giant faced tough comparisons with the prior-year quarter, when it launched new advertising products. Capital spending soared 46% to $3.1 billion, which much of that related to its cloud computing efforts. Marketing costs for Google's new Pixel smartphones also were heavy. Alphabet shares fell 1.4% on Friday after hitting record highs earlier in the week. RELATED: Alphabet Q4 EPS Misses Expectations Microsoft Expands As Cloud Business Booms Fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9% to 83 cents a share while revenue climbed 2% to $26.07 billion, beating views for 79 cents and $25.30 billion. Credit a booming cloud computing business, including Azure. Microsoft guided Q3 revenue forecasts higher. Microsoft shares rose nearly 5% for the week, hitting record highs. RELATED: Microsoft Beats Q2 Targets On Cloud Computing Strength Intel, Other Chip Earnings Strong The chipmaker's EPS rose 4%, topping views, while its 10% sales growth was the best in four years. Intel also gave bullish guidance. Intel shares rose 1.1% Friday after breaking out of a base earlier in the week ahead of earnings. Texas Instruments (TXN) also reported strong earnings, while Samsung Electronics credit memory chip gains for its overall Q4 profit revival. Microsemi (MSCC) also had good results, along with chip gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). But mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), facing FTC charges and Apple lawsuits over its licensing practices, reported mixed results. RELATED: Intel Q4 Earnings, Sales Top Expectations, Revenue Guidance Also Beats U.S. Economic Malaise Hits 11 Years The economy expanded at a 1.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, below views for 2.2% and not much more than half of Q3's 3.5% gain. For 2016, U.S. GDP grew just 1.6%, the 11th straight year below 3%. Meanwhile, durable goods orders unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in December. New-home sales tumbled to a 10-month low, though several homebuilders remained bullish after reporting solid earnings. Starbucks, McDonald's Revivals Doubted Starbucks (SBUX) reported its weakest earnings growth in five years, though that met views. Sales missed forecasts with customer traffic down 2%. The coffee shop giant, which also cut its revenue outlook, said its mobile order and pay was so popular that it created bottlenecks at order pick up, turning off some patrons. Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out. McDonald's tested key support levels initially but closed the week up 0.5%. RELATED: Too Much Of A Good Thing? This Weighed On Starbucks' U.S. Performance McDonald's Stock Tests Key Support Amid Turnaround Doubts Judge Blocks Aetna-Humana Deal A federal judge ruled that the $37 billion Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) merger would violate antitrust laws by unduly reducing competition among health insurers. Aetna, which owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, may appeal. The deal also throws into doubt the proposed $48 billion Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger deal, which the Justice Department also opposes. RELATED: Aetna's $37 Billion Deal For Humana Blocked By Federal Judge Steel Stocks Break 50-Day Lines, Try To Recover Several steel makers sold off during the week, breaking below their 50-day lines as earnings reports failed to support stocks after a postelection run, even as President Trump touted various infrastructure plans and signaled more protectionism. AK Steel (AKS) topped views Tuesday, but shares reversed sharply lower on a weak pricing outlook. Steel Dynamics (STLD), which had decent earnings late Tuesday, tumbled Wednesday. Larger peers U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), which both report on Jan. 31, also sold off. But many of the steel makers rebounded Thursday and Friday. On the upside, specialty steel firm Allegheny Steel (ATI) delivered stellar earnings Tuesday, sending shares up 31% that day. RELATED: Steel Stocks Break Key Support Even As Trump Rally Resumes AK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both Ways Boeing Flies, Lockheed Falters Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. but is bullish about President Trump's tax reforms and regulations. Boeing reported Q4 EPS and revenue above analyst views. Its guidance was cautious, but its 787 Dreamliner is now cash flow positive,which bodes well for future stock buybacks and dividend increases. Boeing shares broke out of a base, hitting record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported Q4 earnings and revenue above analyst views with aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, soaring 23% to $5.41 billion. It expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year. But Lockheed gave weak guidance amid continued concerns about F-35 costs, sending shares lower. Northrop Grumman (NOC) beat on Q4 views while Raytheon (RTN) fell short. Like Boeing and Lockheed, they gave weak guidance. General Dynamics (GD) reported strong earnings and gave bullish long-term guidance.

Verizon reported a mixed Q4, with revenue falling 5.4% but beating estimates while EPS was light. Wireless margins missed. Management pushed back its goal of returning to wireless service growth to 2018. The close of Verizon's purchase of Yahoo (YHOO) will be delayed until Q2 as regulators look into its data breaches. AT&T (T) reported in-line Q4 EPS, with revenue and EBITDA slightly below consensus. AT&T again lost wireless postpaid phone subscribers. AT&T remained upbeat on regulatory approval of its Time Warner (TWX) acquisition. Comcast (CMCSA) Q4 earnings topped views amid solid subscriber gains. The cable TV firm plans to buy back $5 billion in shares in 2017, hiked its dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Comcast plans to launch its wireless service buy midyear. Comcast rose 3% for the week to new highs. RELATED: Verizon Stock Falls; EPS, Revenue Outlook More Of The Same Verizon, Charter Talks Heating Up?

J&J Makes Big Buys As Pharma Results Mixed Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) agreed to pay $30 billion for Swiss biotech Actelion. J&J reported weak sales and guidance earlier in the week. Celgene (CELG) missed on sales even after preannouncing Q4 results. Biogen (BIIB) stock popped despite light sales on "better-than-feared" 2017 guidance following its hemophilia unit spinoff. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) missed on earnings and gave weak EPS guidance amid weaker lung cancer drug prospects. RELATED: Johnson & Johnson Will Buy Actelion For $30 Billion Bristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O Competition Celgene Aims To Hurdle Revlimid Patent Loss Fast Times For Hard Drives Disk drive makers Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX) both reported quarterly results that topped views. Along with bullish guidance, the results suggested a multiyear slump disk-drive shipments may have bottomed. Both companies are also investing heavily in flash-based chip storage, following market needs. Seagate shares shot up 22% and Western Digital 9%, both setting 15-month bests. RELATED: Western Digital Gets Positive Reviews On 'Crisp Execution' Alibaba Soars On Strong Q3 Alibaba (BABA) revenue rose 54% in local currency to $7.67 billion, with EPS rising 30% to $1.30 above views. Revenue from its cloud computing unit rose 115% to $254 million. Shares of the e-commerce giant rose more than 6% for the week, as Alibaba builds the right side of a base. RELATED: Alibaba Crushes Earnings Estimates, Raises Guidance Ford: U.S. Plants 'Appropriate' Ford (F) topped fourth-quarter results expectations, and sees a sluggish 2017. CEO Mark Fields said the automaker has the right amount of U.S. plants it needs, despite President Trump's call days earlier for the Big 3 to build more U.S. factories. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), meanwhile, said net income doubled, helped by cost savings, while revenue ticked up 1% to $31.4 billion. Ford CEO Says U.S. Plants 'Appropriate'; Q4 Profit Meets, Sales Top Cisco Buys Almost-IPO AppDynamics For Hefty Premium Cisco Systems (CSCO) late Tuesday announced it would buy AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, a day before the latter was expected to price an IPO with a top target valuation of $1.7 billion.

Think Goldman, Boeing and IBM January 27, 2017, 05:00 AM By Marley Jay The Associated NEW YORK — Dow 20,000 wasn’t exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They’re so optimistic that they’re buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it’s trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company’s stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.     Tags: goldman, index, stocks, companies, they, stock, Other stories from today: Indexes drift down; Dow ekes out gain How did the Dow get to 20,000?

Image: Boeing The brilliant white suits of the NASA Apollo missions are looking quite old in comparison to the new, bright blue spacesuits of the future, recently revealed by Boeing. It has been nearly 50 years since the Apollo 11 astronauts became the first humans to walk on the moon in their bulky spacesuits, but even by today’s standards, it would appear that not much has changed. Boeing has revealed its ‘Boeing Blue’ spacesuit, which aims to bring astronauts into the 21st century when they travel aboard the company’s Starliner spacecraft for trips to and from the International Space Station. Compared with previous spacesuits, the Boeing Blue will be 40pc lighter, offering the astronauts greater pressurised mobility, which should not only make it more comfortable, but better prepared in the event of an emergency. The suit is also designed to keep the astronaut cooler by emitting water vapour, while the boots are breathable and slip-resistant. With touchscreen-friendly gloves, they will be to interact with the capsule’s tablets. Some familiar zippers have also been placed on the torso area of the suit to make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing. The suit’s communications systems have been upgraded with a smaller, more powerful set-up in the helmet, which should make it easier to keep in touch with crews on the ground. The familiar visor on an astronaut’s spacesuit that prevents them from the blinding and irradiating sunlight is now made from polycarbonate, to give astronauts aboard the Starliner better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space. These spacesuits, which look more like something from 2001: A Space Odyssey than anything else, will likely be available by the end of 2018. Boeing’s Chris Ferguson. Image: Boeing Will likely see action in 2018 Similar to its competitor SpaceX – which has made huge leaps in reusable rocket technology – the Starliner crewed capsule won’t begin any testing with humans until at least August 2018. “To me, it’s a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we’ve been,” said Chris Ferguson, the director of crew and mission systems for Boeing. “The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft.” Testing the Boeing Blue in the Starliner.

Boeing has unveiled a new line of spacesuits for future astronauts under its endeavours, with a few unique touches. The suits, coloured in Boeing’s signature blue tone, have been designed specifically to be worn aboard their Starliner spacecraft, built to ferry astronauts between the Earth and International Space Station. Weighing approximately 9 kilograms, 40 percent less than NASA’s current space suits, Boeing’s design isn’t meant for protection against micro particle impacts and drastic temperature changes during spacewalks. Instead, it’s only a preemptive measure in case of a fire or hull breach during the Starliner’s launch, ascent, and re-entry. With strategically placed zippers, a soft helmet, and wide visor, the Boeing suit keeps the wearer cooler than NASA’s standard fare, and also features special touchscreen-friendly gloves compatible with the Starliner’s built-in tablets. “It’s more aesthetically appealing and it's not as bulky,” Boeing Starliner director Chris Ferguson told media. Even the boots are lightweight and foldable, thanks to a design collaboration with Reebok, Ferguson added. The suits have been designed with simple Earth-to-ISS transit in mind, a journey that could take anywhere between six hours on optimal launch day, to 24 hours. Consequently, Boeing’s design is fitted together as a largely singular piece, meaning astronauts will unfortunately have to wear adult diapers as bathroom breaks will be non-existent. Boeing built the CST-100 Starliner under NASA’s Commercial Crew program, an initiative to launch NASA’s astronauts into space aboard capsules manufactured by private companies. The first expected Starliner launch is expected to take place in August 2018, which means it’ll be more than a year before astronauts actually strap into the new space suits.

Unveiled today (Jan. 25), the new "Boeing Blue" spacesuits for the Starliner capsule weigh about 20 lbs. (9 kilograms) each with all of their accessories, compared to 30 lbs. (13.6 kg) for the old space shuttle suits, NASA officials said. Other advances include touch-screen-sensitive gloves, more-flexible material and soft helmets that are incorporated into the suit (rather than the hard, detachable helmets of the shuttle era). [See photos of the new Boeing spacesuits] Former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson tries on the "Boeing Blue" spacesuit, a private suit for astronauts flying on Boeing's new CST-100 Starliner space capsule. NASA will use Boeing's Starliner vehicles as private space taxis for American astronauts. Credit: Boeing "It is a lot lighter, more formfitting, and it's simpler, which is always a good thing," NASA astronaut Eric Boe said in a statement. "Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." Boe is one of four NASA astronauts currently training to fly aboard the Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which the two companies are developing to provide taxi services to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Both vehicles should start flying crewed missions in the next year or two, NASA officials have said. Chris Ferguson wears the brand new spacesuit from Boeing and David Clark. Credit: Boeing The Boeing Blue suit, and the one that SpaceX develops, will help keep astronauts safe in the event of an emergency during trips to and from orbit. The suits are not designed for spacewalks; the large, bulky "extravehicular mobility units" that astronauts use for this latter purpose are already aboard the ISS. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life-support systems," Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits in NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in the same statement. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." A look at the spacesuit astronauts will wear aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule. Credit: Boeing Since the space shuttles' retirement in July 2011, NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to get American astronauts to and from orbit, at a cost of about $70 million per seat. Starliner and Dragon will end this foreign dependence, if all goes according to plan. That plan is getting closer and closer to reality, said former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson, who is now director of crew and mission systems for Boeing. "To me, it's a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we've been," Ferguson said of today's spacesuit unveiling. "The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft."

But Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier across the Atlantic, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. Norwegian will receive the first Max 8 in May, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said Thursday, with flights starting as early as June. Boeing Co. Southwest made its bones as the low-cost carrier that famously flies only one airplane family. As Boeing’s largest customer for the 737, it’s been involved in the redesign, which included outfitting the workhorse with a more powerful engine. In 2011, the Dallas-based airline placed the first order for the 737 Max, followed by Norwegian and Indonesia’s Lion Air. Yesterday, Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said his airline will get the first of its 200 737 Max’s by July—two months earlier than expected, but two months after Norwegian.  The Max’s sprightly release clip has prompted delivery questions for both Southwest and Boeing, given that an aircraft’s launch customer typically gets—and flies—the new plane first. This sort of arrangement has been upended before, when Airbus A320neo, destined first for Qatar Airways Ltd., didn’t arrive as planned. Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker last year balked over glitches in the A320neo’s engine software and refused to take the first plane, which went instead to Lufthansa. There’s more to being a launch customer than bragging rights—although that's a large part of the appeal of being the first to market with a shiny new jet. Aircraft makers also promise that their newest models boast lower fuel and maintenance costs than prior airplanes, providing an immediate bottom-line boost to airlines. “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery,” Southwest CEO Kelly said of the Max. His chief operating officer, Mike Van De Ven, said Thursday that “we’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it's operating as everyone intended.” Boeing’s Max development is on-budget and ahead of schedule.

And this is the sticking point: Southwest must first retire those old planes before it can accommodate new ones, a conundrum that traces back to pilot training issues. About 10 of Southwest’s 737 Max planes will be finished by the time the carrier is ready to begin flights in October, Van de Ven has said. The carrier is in talks with Boeing about what to do with those planes between July and October, because several are now parked at the periphery of Boeing’s 737 factory in Renton, Wash. Norwegian, meanwhile, plans to take delivery of a half-dozen new 737 Max this year and then deploy them for trans-Atlantic service, though it hasn’t revealed which routes or a time frame. The European carrier has been focused on smaller airports in the Northeast U.S., bypassing the large metropolitan hubs. —With Julie Johnsson in Chicago.

Boeing shows off the spacesuit astronauts will wear on the Starliner Posted yesterday by Devin Coldewey 0 SHARES Next Story Tell wants you to eat like a celebrity chef The commercial spaceflight industry is doing a great job creating new rockets, launch vehicles and all that good stuff, but spacesuits have seen few alterations. Until now. Boeing has publicly debuted what astronauts on its Starliner craft will be wearing, and it looks like a big improvement. Chris Ferguson, former astronaut and now leader of Boeing’s Starliner Crew and Mission Systems, showed off the suit for the cameras yesterday. This one isn’t for doing spacewalks, but rather for getting the astronaut from the staging area of the launch to the relative safety of the space station, and vice versa. It still needs to be airtight and resistant to extreme temperatures and other “extremis” situations — just not to hard vacuum and cosmic radiation. But there was definitely room to improve on the bright orange Advanced Crew Escape Suits made by NASA since the 1990s. “We’ve simplified the suit,” Ferguson said in a Boeing video. “Astronauts formerly had these relatively bulky heavy suits with thick neck rings, and we learned throughout the years maybe we didn’t need that.” 32141923950_c6a9a6069f_k 32141926980_3eb9cf5061_k starliner_gallery14_960x600 starliner_gallery13_960 starliner_gallery15_960 31677346374_c95e07194f_k starliner_gallery17_960  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Related Articles SpaceX successfully lands its first-stage Falcon 9 rocket on drone ship A new private space race as Boeing CEO says he'll beat SpaceX to Mars Elon Musk says he'll start digging a tunnel from SpaceX HQ next month The “Boeing Blue” suits weigh 12 pounds to the ACES’ 30, and are more compact while still building in plenty of functionality. They’re cooler inside, more flexible, have comms built into the helmet and lack the big metal neck ring — instead, the helmet attaches with a zipper and hangs back like a hood when not in use. The shoes, designed by Reebok, are more like giant soft runners than boots, and the gloves come with that all-important 21st-century feature: they’re touchscreen-friendly. Boeing plans to send its first commercial crew up on the Starliner CST-100 launch vehicle in 2018, and they’ll be wearing these suits. Now the question is, will SpaceX leapfrog Boeing with an even cooler suit? Chances are we’ll find out soon — they can’t afford to let Boeing hog the spotlight for too long. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase The Boeing Company Founded 1916 Overview The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures and sells fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, rockets and satellites and provides leasing and product support services.

Cooper to Boeing? Plot thickens By Erik Lacitis, The Seattle Times Published: January 26, 2017, 10:39 PM A   A SEATTLE — You know the stories exploring whether D.B. Cooper was a Boeing employee? Never mind. Time for a new speculation. Now the attention of the “Citizen Sleuths” on whose research all those viral headlines were premised are pointing at another Pacific Northwest company as D.B.’s possible employer: Tektronix, out of Beaverton, Ore. Not quite the name recognition as Boeing, but it’s well-known in the electronics industry. The Boeing connection is still there, said Tom Kaye, of Sierra Vista, Ariz., who identifies himself as the principal investigator of CitizenSleuths.com. It’s just that now the group believes the titanium particles found on D.B.’s tie came from Tektronix, which may have been doing contract work for Boeing back in the 1960s through 1971 (when the project was canceled) on the supersonic transport jet, better known as the SST. The group was given access to the tie by the FBI and used an electron microscope and X-ray spectroscopy for its work. Kaye now believes that D.B. “was an engineer or manager type who was going back and forth between Boeing and Tektronix.” Boeing understandably said that “we have no comment on these reports.” It’s trying to sell jets, not be associated with D.B. speculation. As for Tektronix, it was founded in 1946 and holds 697 patents. It makes oscilloscopes and optical modulation analyzers. Last week, Amy Higgins, spokeswoman for the company, said it didn’t have employment documentation in its database that would go back some five decades. So it really couldn’t add much, she said. She also said if Tektronix had been doing work on the SST, it was likely “a confidential relationship.” It’s been 45 years since “Dan Cooper” hijacked that Northwest Orient Airlines jet, and somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Nev., parachuted out with $200,000 in $20 bills. His legend is the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to stories we can’t help but read. There was the woman who had undergone transgender surgery and claimed to have been D.B. as a way to get back at the industry that kept her from becoming a pilot. There was the Minnesota man who believed his late brother was D.B. when the family discovered unaccounted-for money in the brother’s bank accounts. And there are more potential D.B.s who have made the news but then not been linked to the case by the FBI. The agency suspended active investigation in July. It’s that black clip-on J.C. Penney tie found on the seat cushion 18E, the same seat assigned to Cooper, that has been at the heart of these latest speculations. D.B. had that now-retro look down pat. It was the look you often would see with the engineers and management at Boeing.

News Treasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform Boeing paid a 27.7% federal tax rate in 2015 but could get a check from Treasury under Republican tax reform. (Boeing) JED GRAHAM 1/27/2017 Reprints Boeing (BA) is going to bat for the BAT — the border adjustment tax that is a central part of the GOP plan to cut the corporate tax rate. The controversial Republican tax-reform plan, which would slap a 20% tax on imports but make exports tax-free, has gotten off to a rough start in the court of public opinion. The National Retail Federation has warned that it would raise prices and cause consumer spending to decline, while analysts have said that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) could suffer major hits to profitability. House Republicans, with the help of economists, have countered that an anticipated 20% appreciation of the dollar would neutralize those negative effects, while removing what they call a "Made in America" tax. Now big exporters including Boeing and General Electric (GE) are reportedly gearing up to help House Speaker Paul Ryan make that case, and it's not hard to understand why. Consider Boeing: The company paid an effective federal tax rate of 27.7% in 2015, when it had a current tax bill of $2.1 billion, but would have had negative tax liability under the House plan. In 2015, 59% of company revenue came from non-U.S. customers. Given that Boeing does almost all of its manufacturing and sourcing within the U.S., it has limited exposure to the 20% import tax. Meanwhile, the House GOP tax plan exempts exports from any tax. Companies would be taxed on their cash flow, basically the total cost of (non-imported) goods, labor and capital outlays minus U.S. revenue. In effect, Boeing's U.S. cash flow, as far as the GOP tax plan is concerned, would have been dramatically negative once its $56.7 billion in non-U.S. revenue was excluded. IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in December that some big exporters "may pay little or no federal taxes — and may even accrue tax benefits in the form of net operating losses." Yet some tax experts say the only way to make the House plan work as intended would be for the federal government to write a check to exporters with negative liability. The border adjustment tax would effectively become a trade barrier, doing more to keep out imports than to facilitate exports "unless cash refunds were provided," wrote American Enterprise Institute scholar Alan Viard. William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, wrote that while it may create a "serious optics problem" for Treasury to write checks to big corporations, the issue is just one of perception. Because of the exchange-rate adjustment, the House plan shouldn't affect the after-tax profitability of either exporters or importers, he wrote. President Trump initially sounded wary of Ryan's tax reform approach, calling it "too complicated" and the wrong medicine for a dollar that is already "too strong." But he may have put those concerns aside: White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that Trump would pay to build a wall on the Mexican border with funds generated by a 20% border tax as part of tax reform. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus later said a 20% tax is just one option. The outcome of this rhetorical and political battle may be critical in deciding whether Trump can deliver on his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to a range of 15% to 20% from a statutory rate of 35%, among the world's highest. Without the $1.1 trillion in revenue that would come from the border-adjusted tax, analysts say a tax rate of 25% may be the best Trump can do.

DAVID MOSHER, BUSINESS INSIDER 27 JAN 2017   NASA isn't thrilled about having to pay Russia billions of dollars to launch US astronauts on Russian rockets inside of Russian spacesuits. But that's the current spaceflight pickle the space agency finds itself in; there's really no other option unless you're China. However, two aerospace companies - SpaceX and Boeing - are working hard to fulfil contracts for NASA to build and launch astronauts to low-Earth orbit as soon as 2018 (a delay of about three years). SpaceX is working on its Dragon spacecraft while Boeing is developing and testing its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft.   To that end, on Wednesday, Boeing for the first time publicly unveiled a crucial new piece of its Starliner system: a spacesuit to protect the next generation of astronauts as they launch toward the International Space Station, and eventually more exotic destinations like an asteroid, or even Mars. Behind the new suit is former astronaut Chris Ferguson, director of Boeing's Starliner Crew and Mission Systems program, and lead designer Shane Jacobs. "Astronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn't need that," Ferguson said in a Boeing promotional video. "We've simplified the suit. It's lightweight." Typical space shuttle suits weighed about 33 lbs (15 kilograms), while Boeing's new suit weighs about 12 lbs (5.4 kilograms) - roughly a few Macbook laptops' worth of mass. The suit, according to Boeing, is also much cooler than typical spacesuits. Below the shoulder material, for example, is a mesh that allows passive airflow to the suit.   "You can pretty much lay there without any external cooling. It's that comfortable," Ferguson said. The suit also features a helmet that comes on and off with a large zipper, and smaller and less bulky gloves (which, yes, are made with material that allows them to interact with touchscreens). Here are some of the first public views of Boeing's new spacesuit. This is the new CST-100 Starliner spacesuit that was designed and built by Boeing: Boeing Here's former astronaut Chris Ferguson, one of its designers, wearing the device. The gloves are compatible with touch screens. Boeing The helmet is attached with a thick, air-tight zipper - no heavy or bulky neck ring required. NASA astronaut Eric Boe is the guy in the suit.

Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Dow 20,000 wasn't exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

(AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Dow 20,000 wasn't exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Being the first to take possession of the new jetliner is a sign of the fast-growing carrier's increasing stature among the world's airlines. "Norwegian will now be the first airline to take delivery of the Boeing (BA) 737 Max and we will be the first airline in the world to operate this brand-new aircraft type," an airline spokesman said in an email. Norwegian said it will take delivery of the first of its Max jets in May and "then it will take a little time before it enters operation," the spokesman added. The airline has ordered 100 of the jets. But being the first comes with added challenges, as the first operator typically works out the early kinks of a new design. When Norwegian first took its 787 Dreamliner in 2013, its early operations were repeatedly disrupted by reliability issues with the advanced long-range airliner. Related: Boeing chases airlines for stretch 737 Norwegian plans to use the single-aisle 737 Max, with its increased range, to fly between Europe and smaller cities in the U.S. The low-cost airline's long-haul operations from Europe are flown today with larger 787 Dreamliners. A rendering of Norwegian Air Shuttle's soon-to-be-delivered 737 Max jetliner. The airline has been at the center of a fierce controversy with U.S. airlines and their labor unions over the Department of Transportation's approval of the carrier's ability to fly from Ireland to the U.S.. The unions claim Norwegian will undercut wages for U.S.-based pilots and cabin crews or hire less expensive non-U.S. crews while flying to America. Related: Richard Quest flies around the world on low-cost airlines Southwest Airlines (LUV) was the first carrier to place a firm order for Boeing's updated single-aisle jet back in December 2011 and has long been expected to take the first jet from the plane maker. Southwest said Thursday that it won't take its first Max until July and it will start flying passengers on October 1. Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that the Max, which has been in testing since January 2016, will deliver during the second quarter, but did not say which airline would take the first jet. Related: American Airlines eliminating in-seat screens on new 737 jets Southwest has faced obstacles getting the Max into its fleet, first facing a now-settled labor dispute with its pilots over pay on the aircraft and the compatibility of the fourth generation aircraft into its all-Boeing 737 fleet. Southwest is the largest operator of 737 jets in the world, and was the first airline the last time Boeing introduced a new generation of its workhorse airliner in 1997. Boeing holds orders for more than 3,400 737 Max jets, which feature a pair of new engines and aerodynamic updates to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

EVERETT — Boeing just lost 7 percent of its unfilled 747 orders. A Nigerian carrier, Arik Air, swapped its order for two 747-8s for two 787-9 Dreamliners. That drops the number of unfilled orders for the 747-8 passenger version to seven. Boeing also has 19 orders for the more popular 747-8 freighter. The cancelled 747s came as no surprise. Indeed, that Arik Air even ordered the jumbo jets was far more surprising. It’s a small carrier with two long-haul routes: Lagos-London and Lagos-New York. It also flies to Johannesburg, South Africa. Most of its flights are short-haul hops to its West African neighbors or domestic flights in Nigeria. The U.S. Air Force likely will place the next — and last — order for a 747 passenger version when it goes ahead with replacing its aging Air Force One presidential jets, said Scott Hamilton, an aerospace industry analyst based on Bainbridge Island. Boeing’s delivered 41 747-8 Intercontinentals — the name for the passenger version — and has seven unfilled orders. So, there just aren’t many passenger versions in the air. The 747-8 freighter has been far more popular, with 88 orders placed, including 19 unfilled ones. The low numbers make it harder to get spare parts and to service the aircraft, which means higher maintenance and operational costs. Those costs go up for passenger airlines, because freighters and jetliners often fly different routes, Hamilton said. “Anywhere you fly a 737, you can walk across the tarmac and get a spare if you have a good relationship with other airlines,” he said. For 747-8 International operators, it’s a much longer walk for spares. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com; Twitter: @dcatchpole.

Think Goldman, Boeing and IBM By MARLEY JAY January 26, 2017 4:35 pm Share NEW YORK (AP) — Dow 20,000 wasn’t exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They’re so optimistic that they’re buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. Hiring freeze result of Trump team's review of federal agencies The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it’s trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. Advertisement It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company’s stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Being the first to take possession of the new jetliner is a sign of the fast-growing carrier's increasing stature among the world's airlines. "Norwegian will now be the first airline to take delivery of the Boeing 737 Max and we will be the first airline in the world to operate this brand-new aircraft type," an airline spokesman said in an email. Norwegian said it will take delivery of the first of its Max jets in May and "then it will take a little time before it enters operation," the spokesman added. The airline has ordered 100 of the jets. But being the first comes with added challenges, as the first operator typically works out the early kinks of a new design. When Norwegian first took its 787 Dreamliner in 2013, its early operations were repeatedly disrupted by reliability issues with the advanced long-range airliner. Norwegian plans to use the single-aisle 737 Max, with its increased range, to fly between Europe and smaller cities in the U.S. The low-cost airline's long-haul operations from Europe are flown today with larger 787 Dreamliners. The airline has been at the center of a fierce controversy with U.S. airlines and their labor unions over the Department of Transportation's approval of the carrier's ability to fly from Ireland to the U.S.. The unions claim Norwegian will undercut wages for U.S.-based pilots and cabin crews or hire less expensive non-U.S. crews while flying to America. Southwest Airlines was the first carrier to place a firm order for Boeing's updated single-aisle jet back in December 2011 and has long been expected to take the first jet from the plane maker. Southwest said Thursday that it won't take its first Max until July and it will start flying passengers on October 1. Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that the Max, which has been in testing since January 2016, will deliver during the second quarter, but did not say which airline would take the first jet. Southwest has faced obstacles getting the Max into its fleet, first facing a now-settled labor dispute with its pilots over pay on the aircraft and the compatibility of the fourth generation aircraft into its all-Boeing 737 fleet. Southwest is the largest operator of 737 jets in the world, and was the first airline the last time Boeing introduced a new generation of its workhorse airliner in 1997. Boeing holds orders for more than 3,400 737 Max jets, which feature a pair of new engines and aerodynamic updates to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

Playing in background? A really loud tv ad "800-588-2300 EMPIRE! TODAY!" And, the Triavgo guy. pic.twitter.com/ofaUpzEoFK— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) January 26, 2017 President Trump on Thursday praised Air Force One, calling it “beautiful” and a “great plane” in his office aboard the aircraft. “That’s a good one too, but this is a very special plane for a lot of reasons,” he told reporters when asked how Air Force One compares with his personal jet. Trump sat in his on-board office with a navy blue Air Force One jacket slung over his desk chair, pool reports said, before telling assembled journalists he had met the vehicle’s pilot. ADVERTISEMENT The then-president-elect harshly criticized Boeing last month over the cost of a new Air Force One plane, calling for the company’s contract to get canceled. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” he tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016. "Cancel order!” Trump clarified his stance later that morning, accusing Boeing of “doing a little bit of number” with the aircraft’s “ridiculous” price tag. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” he joked in Trump Tower in New York City. Boeing initially won a contract to replace the current Air Force One jets — which have been flying since the early 1990s — from the Pentagon in January 2016. The defense contractor's initial contract was worth $25.8 million, but the Air Force planned on spending as much as $1.65 billion on two new planes. A Government Accountability Office report from March 2016, meanwhile, estimated the cost of the vehicles at roughly $3.2 billion before their scheduled completion in 2023. Boeing’s CEO said last Tuesday his company has made in-roads with Trump on shrinking the cost of the next generation of Air Force One planes. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Dennis Muilenburg told reporters after meeting with Trump Jan. 17. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I’m pleased with the progress there." “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business. We’re all on the same page here. Our objective is to provide the best capability for our country most affordably."

The airline has been at the center of a fierce controversy with U.S. airlines and their labor unions over the Department of Transportation's approval of the carrier's ability to fly from Ireland to the U.S.. The unions claim Norwegian will undercut wages for U.S.-based pilots and cabin crews or hire less expensive non-U.S. crews while flying to America.

Southwest said Thursday that it won't take its first Max until July and it will start flying passengers on October 1. Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that the Max, which has been in testing since January 2016, will deliver during the second quarter, but did not say which airline would take the first jet. Related: American Airlines eliminating in-seat screens on new 737 jets Southwest has faced obstacles getting the Max into its fleet, first facing a now-settled labor dispute with its pilots over pay on the aircraft and the compatibility of the fourth generation aircraft into its all-Boeing 737 fleet. Southwest is the largest operator of 737 jets in the world, and was the first airline the last time Boeing introduced a new generation of its workhorse airliner in 1997. Boeing holds orders for more than 3,400 737 Max jets, which feature a pair of new engines and aerodynamic updates to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

New Delhi: Jet Airways, which plans to enhance its services on the US routes, may ask its strategic investment partner Etihad to return two of its Boeing-777 planes which are currently on lease with the Gulf-based carrier. The private carrier has leased out seven wide-bodied planes to Etihad, which holds 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways, including five Boeing 777-300 ERs which are used for ultra long-haul operations. "Jet Airways may ask Etihad to return two of the five Boeing 777s, which it has leased to the Gulf partner," sources said in New Delhi. Under a commercial cooperation agreement, the two airlines had plans to connect Mumbai to Newark, Bangalore to Chicago and Delhi to New York, through Jet Airways overseas hub at Abu Dhabi. Etihad had announced the launch of its second flight to New York from Abu Dhabi with a Jet Airways' Boeing 777-300ER plane from March last year. As per the original plan, Jet Airways was to operate this flight from May 1, 2014 but the plan failed to take off after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) downgraded India's aviation safety rating. The move disallowed Indian carriers from either expanding their operations to the US or entering into any code share agreement with the airlines there. The FAA restored the aviation safety rating back to Category-I early this month, paving the way for Indian airlines to enhance their presence in the US skies. At present, only two domestic carriers, Air India and Jet Airways operate flights to the US. When contacted, a Jet Airways spokesperson said the airline was exploring all the opportunities and final decision on all such issues would be taken by its board. "We are currently evaluating the opportunities and any final decision will be taken only after discussion and approval by the Board," the spokeperson said in a statement to. Restoration of India's safety rating to Category-I by the FAA allows us to explore opportunities to enhance and optimise our presence in the United State, the statement said, adding any business opportunities will be evaluated with stringent adherence to these objectives. According to FAA annual aviation projections, presented last month, US airlines are expected to transport 1-billion passengers per year by 2029 and a total of 1.5 billion by 2035. In the period between 2014-2035, US carrier passenger will grow by an average 2.2 per cent every year, the forecast had said. Jet Airways currently operates from New Delhi to Newark in the US.

Alexandre de Juniac, chairman and CEO of Air France-KLM, which on June 24 launched a 500 million aircraft upgrade project called BEST AND BEYOND with the inaugural flight of an advanced Boeing 777 on the Paris-New York route, says flyers from India can look forward to top-of-the-line seats by the end of 2016. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with TOI's Surendra Singh: India being one of the largest economies in Asia, what are the new services Air France-KLM is planning to start in the country? Air France-KLM operates 20 weekly flights from India to Paris and 14 weekly flights from India to Amsterdam. We will launch upgraded B777 with top-class seats both for the business and economy classes in India by 2016. Our A330 fleet, which majorly caters to India, will also be upgraded by the end of 2016. Will you extend your business class promotional fares for Europe/UK tours for Indian flyers. Are you going to come up with more such attractive offers? Yes, we will. We will certainly come up with new offers. By the way, we are the only airline in the world to provide free champagne to our customers in all classes. Like the code share pact with Jet Airways, is AF-KLM planning any such partnership with domestic carriers? No plan at the moment. However, the code sharing pact with Jet Airways enabling flyers of both airlines seamless travel across destinations is working very well. Alexandre de Juniac. Will you elaborate on La Premiere segment? When are you going to launch the luxury cabins in Asia, particularly in India? La Premiere, ultra modern cabin with 4 suites in Boeing 777, will provide flyers home comfort in the air. A fully flatted bed, 24-inch high definition TV screen, personal wardrobe, hi-tech entertainment system and cabin with curtains will provide flyers a feel of 'cocoon in the sky'. Top-of-the-line cutlery, woven fabrics, cushions, adjustable curtains have been given a French touch. Flyers will get an escort to and from plane. Initially, 19 Boeing 777s are being equipped with La Premiere and the first aircraft will be launched on the Shanghai route in September. If the demand for the La Premiere increases, we will launch the product in India. Is it justified for AF-KLM Martinair Cargo to drop Delhi, the national capital, as a destination for full freighter operations? We have shrunk full freighter operations as our passenger aircraft are carrying 80% of the cargo load in their belly. Moreover, our new aircraft are coming with bigger bellies and can take extra load. It's cost-effective. How seriously are you taking competition with Gulf and Chinese carriers? Gulf carriers are eating into the Indian aviation market. The upgrade plan is to provide top-class product to our customers and give a tough competition to Gulf airlines. At the same time, we have an agreement with Etihad in order to understand and capture the market in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Seychelles. What target have you set for annual passenger capacity? Our annual passenger capacity is nearly 80 million. We haven't set our target but with better service and upgrade, we expect our annual passenger capacity will only grow. Why have you changed the slogan from 'Making the sky the best place on earth' to 'Air France, France in the air'. We want our customers to get a feel of France in the air. Service with a French touch. Air France-KLM is undergoing transformation. By 2017, we plan to invest 1 billion in our fleet in order to become a global player.

Some day soon, private companies are expected to take over the task of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX and Boeing are leading the pack, with their first crewed flights slated to take off in 2018. Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon will come with their own matching outfits, and Boeing just unveiled its new spacesuit. The "Boeing Blue" suit is intended to keep astronauts safe when they launch to the ISS and return to Earth inside a Boeing capsule. If something goes wrong during launch or re-entry, the pressurized suit can provide a backup life-support system for each astronaut. Astronauts will still use NASA's heavy-duty spacesuit when they go on spacewalks outside of the ISS. NASA Space shuttle astronauts wore a much bulkier suit during launch and re-entry. Boeing's suit and its accessories weigh about 20 pounds, which is almost 10 pounds lighter than NASA's most recent launch suit. To help astronauts stay cool, special layers allow water, but not air, to leave the suit. Zippers around the joints provide more flexibility, while touchscreen-friendly gloves help the astronauts operate the Starliner's control panels. The shoe is specially designed by Reebok, and looks more like a running shoe than NASA's clunky paratrooper-type boots. It certainly looks a lot less bulky than NASA's Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES), which was used from 1994 until the space shuttle was retired in 2011. NASA may use a modified version of the ACES suit to send astronauts to an asteroid in the Orion spacecraft in the 2020s. There's quite a noticeable difference in colors, here, too. NASA's glaring "pumpkin suit" is so-colored to help rescue crews find the astronauts in water if there's an emergency ocean landing. That task may not be so easy in Boeing Blue, although the color is admittedly still very distinct (and a little easier on the eyeballs). SpaceX hasn't yet revealed its own spacesuit design, but we have good reason to believe it will be badass. Boeing Boeing tests their suit inside a Starliner capsule mockup.

X Corporate America divided over import tax reform plan Walmart among US firms claiming tax changes would force up consumer prices Thu, Jan 26, 2017, 18:40 Barney Jopson, Ed Crooks President Donald Trump: rift in business community threatens his pledge to overhaul the tax code by undermining a blueprint House Republicans are drafting for the White House. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst         Dozens of US exporters including GE and Boeing are squaring off against Walmart and other retailers as a radical Republican plan to tax imports divides the giants of corporate America. The rift in the business community threatens President Donald Trump’s pledge to overhaul the tax code for the first time in 30 years by undermining a blueprint that House Republicans are drafting for the White House. GE, Boeing and several dozen manufacturers are in advanced talks over forming a coalition to lobby in favour of the import tax, just as Walmart and other big importers, including the billionaire Koch brothers, mobilise against it. Walmart sent its top tax executives to meetings on Capitol Hill this week to warn officials that the proposal would have a dramatic impact on its business, potentially forcing the retailer to raise prices for shoppers, according to two congressional aides. The “border adjustment” tax regime, which would penalise imports and encourage exports, is central to the plans of House Republicans initiating tax legislation. But visceral divisions over the idea do not bode well for its prospects. US companies have spent years urging policymakers to fix a “broken” tax code only to see previous efforts fail on Capitol Hill. A post-election rally in the US stock market has been driven partly by hopes of a cut in the tax rate, but the outlook has been clouded by the import tax furore. The stakes for both sides in the battle are high. Helping exporters GE is known as one of the sharpest tax planners in US industry and Jeff Immelt, its chief executive, said of border tax adjustments in December that “things that help exporters are a good thing for GE”. GE and Boeing are among the companies negotiating the formation of a coalition to lobby for the proposal by Kevin Brady, the chief tax policymaker on Capitol Hill, according to three people familiar with the talks. ADVERTISEMENT The coalition is likely to be launched in a matter of weeks and one person said 27 businesses had already agreed to join it while dozens more had expressed an interest. The companies are in talks over hiring a political consulting firm called Cavalry to manage the campaign. The firm was founded by two former aides to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, who will help decide whether the import tax survives in the Senate. More crucial to the idea’s fate will be the stance taken by Mr Trump, who has equivocated on it. Lobbyists predict that it will only prevail if he embraces border adjustments as part of his “America first” agenda – and comes up with a better slogan for the tax policy. Border adjustments would work by not letting US companies deduct the cost of foreign inputs from their revenues for tax purposes, while giving a rebate to exporters by allowing them to exclude revenue from foreign sales from their taxable income. Mr Brady, who is writing the tax plan as an ally of House speaker Paul Ryan, says the import tax would make US exporters more competitive overseas. Foreign-made goods Retailers that sell a high proportion of foreign-made goods say the import tax threatens to wipe out a large chunk of their profits. The Walmart officials visiting Capitol Hill said the company estimated conservatively that it would have to raise the prices consumers pay for clothing and electronics by 20 per cent, said one congressional aide. Scot Ciccarelli, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, divided retailers into four groups according to the impact of border adjustment and placed Walmart among those likely to suffer the most, alongside Best Buy and Williams Sonoma. They would experience “sizeable drops in net income and more limited ability to pass through price increases, materially raising future earnings risk”, he wrote this month, citing the price sensitivity of Walmart shoppers as a barrier to asking them to pick up the cost. With 98 per cent of clothes sold in the US made overseas, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, says the import tax could inflate the tax bills of some fashion chains to three to five times their pre-tax profits, jeopardising their solvency. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Donald Trump Doug Holtz Eakin Jeff Immelt Kevin Brady Mitch Mcconnell Paul Ryan Scot Ciccarelli Best Buy Boeing Cavalry Ge WalMart Williams-Sonoma Read More John FitzGerald: Expanding capacity of building sector takes time Mixed signals for Dublin’s economy as consumer morale dips Exporters urged to exploit Asian market after Brexit Consumers drive Britain’s economy, repulsing Brexit hit Central Bank downgrades growth forecast amid Brexit fears Planet Business: alternative facts and a dash of Musk How much did Airbnb hosts in Dublin earn last year?

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Saturday January, 28, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower revenue from defense business By David Koenig, AP  January 27, 2017, 12:06 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ DALLAS -- Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts' forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. The shares rose more than 4 percent in afternoon trading. On a call with analysts and reporters, Boeing executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump's tweets and comments last month about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Boeing and European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitably among major world airlines, and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Both big plane makers have order backlogs that will last for years. However, they are likely to face more competition in the next few years for sales of their workhorse models, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Canada's Bombardier and Russia and China are in various stages of delivering similar-sized, single-aisle jetliners. Boeing will counter by delivering the first of a new, upgraded 737 in a few months. And Boeing's government business could come under increasing cost pressure. Boeing predicted that 2017 revenue from its defense and space business could fall by up to 5 percent, including a drop in sales of military jets, which the company blamed on the timing of some aircraft deliveries. Boeing took another write-down on a key tanker program that has been plagued by design issues including problems with the refueling boom. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Pentagon and congressional support for Boeing's key defense programs remains solid. And he said he welcomed Trump's comments last month about one of the company's most familiar products. Boeing is in the design stage of work on customizing 747 jumbo jets to replace the current Air Force One fleet. Trump tweeted "costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion. Cancel order!" That led to a meeting between Muilenburg and Trump at Trump Tower. "We had some targeted discussions, well-publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft," Muilenburg said. "I think those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we're providing best capability ... at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers. We're exactly on the same page there." 1|2|Next Page>> SHARE CLOSE Blogger Google+ Live Journal Plurk Stumble Upon   Tweet PREVIOUS ARTICLE Court to rule if Nigeria Shell claims can proceed NEXT ARTICLE Rolling robots could soon be making deliveries in Virginia Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Delta Air reportedly will stop serving Taiwan in May 2 Asus unveils ZenFone with Daydream, Google Tango 3 McDonald's sells China operations to consortium for US$2.08 billion 4 Debate resurfaces in wake of assault 5 Japan's Takeda in US$5.2 billion deal for US cancer drugmaker 6 Mobile payment market to reach US$780 bil. in 2017: firm 7 Hon Hai not to withdraw China investments 8 Taiwan sends coffee procurement delegations to Central America 9 Trump's 'America First' could affect Taiwan's exports: MOEA 10 Trump in Asia: Region poised for change as new era dawns Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. Advertisement New York. US aerospace giant Boeing projected higher commercial aircraft deliveries in 2017 compared with last year, and reported a 59 per cent surge in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday. Boeing said it expects commercial deliveries to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. While Boeing has described commercial aircraft as generally robust, in December it announced plans to cut production on the long-range 777 plane due to slackening demand. The company also beat expectations with earnings jumping to $1.6 billion in the final quarter of 2016, compared to the same period a year earlier, due partly to an uptick in commercial aircraft that helped offset lower profits from Boeing’s military division. But the comparison to the prior year was boosted by a large charge in the fourth quarter of 2015. “With solid fourth quarter operating performance and a sharp strategic focus, we extended our aerospace market leadership in our centennial year and positioned Boeing for continued growth and success in our second century,” chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said. For 2017, Boeing projected revenues between $90.5 billion and $90.2 billion, down $94.6 billion last year. The firm reported $23.3 billion in revenues in the latest quarter, down 1.2 percent. Boeing shares rose 0.8 per cent to $161.83 in pre-market trading.

In some cases, the kind of fantasies only dreamed of in science fiction have now become real-life breakthroughs. Take our smartphones, for example, which are now akin to the communicator and tricorder from Star Trek – all in one bundle. Or the fantastic advancements in robotics that resemble the droids from Star Wars. Now, the newest mind-blowing innovation  comes from Boeing (BA). The company has patented an incredible invention that could one day protect our troops from two of the most dangerous threats they face on the battlefield. Combating the Shock(wave) When an explosive device is detonated right on its intended target, the effects are devastating. But even when they don’t hit the bull’s eye, they can still cause untold damage. Explosives in air or water create shockwaves that travel faster than the speed of sound. The force can destroy buildings and overturn vehicles. These shockwaves also carry shrapnel and other debris from the explosion, which can cause serious injury or death, and damage equipment. Paradoxically, the very protective clothing designed to protect soldiers from the initial blast can actually increase the damage from the shockwave. Boeing has a better, ingenious solution for dealing with these shockwaves and shrapnel injuries… May the Force (Field) Be With You! It’s made a force field! Boeing’s patent application proposes the ultimate high tech in order to protect soldiers – using lasers, ionizing pellets, or even projectiles to place a high-energy electric arc between the shockwave and the target – e.g., ground forces, a vehicle carrying troops, or a battleship. How does it work? In its simplest terms, the electric arc superheats the air in the protection area, essentially creating a shockwave that moves in the opposite direction. This “anti-shockwave” deflects and dissipates the incoming shockwave and accompanying shrapnel so that what reaches the intended target is a pale shadow of the previously devastating shockwave. That’s the practical part. But in order for Boeing’s force field to work at all, the company has had to develop a way to detect incoming shockwaves in the first place. The system needs to find out where the wave is coming from… then aim and deploy the lasers and other elements that create the electric arc… and then actually make the arc. Oh, and the whole system needs to work in just a few milliseconds! The Military’s Greatest Weapon Ever With a system this complicated and high tech, it will take time for Boeing to push its force field technology from patent application to deployment. But the fact that it’s working on such a breakthrough means there could come a day when the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to our troops is vastly diminished. The future of this system could hold even greater potential, too. For example, while you think that this IED-fighting system is just another example of the Pentagon (or its contractors, in this case) “fighting the last war” with ground troops, the technology could be expanded. Imagine if every military vehicle had a virtually bulletproof shield installed. Or Navy ships had superheated force fields so large and strong that they could deflect missiles and torpedoes. Boeing’s force field isn’t quite the full-on force field of science fiction – yet. But its patent application could be just the beginning of an entirely new way of protecting our troops in battle. To living and investing in the future, Greg Miller Greg Miller has spent over 20 years in the financial industry, working up from analyst, to portfolio manager, and eventually to an institutional investor, where he managed over $400-million worth of assets in mutual funds and private accounts.

Net earnings for the quarter to end December came in at $1.63 billion on total revenue of $23.3 billion, which was a slight revenue drop of 1 percent from 4Q15. Net earnings for the full year fell 5 percent to $4.89 billion on a revenue drop of 2 percent to $94.57 billion. Boeing delivered three more commercial aircraft in the fourth quarter at 185, but full year deliveries dropped from 762 to 748. That was still enough to easily beat rival Airbus who delivered 688 planes. Revenue from commercial aircraft was $65.1 billion for 2016, one percent lower than the previous year. “We led the industry in commercial airplane deliveries for the fifth consecutive year,” chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said. For 2017, Boeing said revenue should come in between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion, with an expected increase in commercial deliveries to between 760 and 765. In line with 2016’s cost savings, capital expenditure for 2017 is expected to decline by approximately $300 million to $2.3 billion. "Looking forward, our team is intent on accelerating productivity and programme execution to deliver increasing cash and profitability from our large and diverse order backlog of nearly $500 billion…, and capturing an even greater share of the the growing global aerospace market," Muilenburg said in a company release.

Large orders have been placed for the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX. Boeing has announced its design for a further stretch of the MAX and is preparing to see the first of the MAX family enter service this year. Neos and Bombardier CSeries aircraft will continue their in-service momentum. The widebody market, however, has hit the doldrums. Orders have slowed, Airbus and Boeing have both announced production rate cuts and there is talk­—some of it already confirmed—of order deferrals.  But it would be wrong to cast a gloomy outlook for the industry as a whole or for the widebody market in particular. Projections are for another profitable year for the world’s airlines in the order of almost $30 billion. And the trend-line for air passenger growth continues its upward climb. Passenger numbers are expected to reach almost 4 billion this year, which will be a record. Reflecting that appetite to fly, airlines increased the number of unique city-pair connections in 2016 by more than 700 to over 18,000. By 2036, IATA forecasts that 7.2 billion passengers will travel by air annually, almost double the 3.8 billion who flew in 2016.  While narrowbodies—especially in the low-cost sector—will play a crucial role in delivering those billions of new fliers to their destinations, it must not be overlooked that those numbers cannot be met without the indispensable widebody. Airlines that invest in a widebody fleet are playing a long game — it’s an investment in anticipated passenger growth and in new destinations. People don’t just want to travel; they want to go far away places. China’s outbound international market is booming. China and India will both eclipse the US as the world’s largest air traffic markets by 2029. The widebody is the only way to satisfy that demand, particularly on large hub-to-hub routes. And while the new generation of narrowbodies is eminently capable of carrying people farther, there are operational and customer service advantages to the widebody that the narrowbody cannot easily deliver on long-haul flights. Twin aisles are quicker to board and deplane; they offer more bin space and lavatories, larger galleys and greater IFE options, as well as crew rest areas. They also offer more ways for airlines to customize and differentiate their product; that’s important in an increasingly competitive market. Yes, there will be some order deferrals and yes, in some long-haul markets today there are airlines with a lot of capacity chasing the same passengers. But the upward trend in air travel demand is undeniable. The widebody is how that demand will be fulfilled.  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Charlie Wood Staff | @walkingthedot January 26, 2017 —Astronaut is probably the last job anyone could call uncool, but Boeing is trying to make it stylish too. The aerospace company unveiled its vision of astro-fashion this week, a new spacesuit to complement its upcoming Starliner space taxi. Replacing the iconic orange "pumpkin" flight suits of the space shuttle era, the sleeker, lighter "Boeing blue" suits feature a number of upgrades improving safety and convenience. The company hopes to begin bringing Earthlings to the International Space Station in late 2018. Nowhere is the "less is more" design philosophy more true than flight suit development. Astronauts spend hours sitting in the cockpit during and after takeoff, and need to be constantly ready to spring into action in case something goes wrong. Any excess bulk restricts their ability to respond. "The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive," astronaut Eric Boe said in a statement from NASA. "It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it's simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." The new suits facilitate that readiness with a number of simplifications over the last generation pumpkin suits. At 30 to 60 percent lighter, depending on accessories, the sleeker outfit allows astronauts considerably more freedom. Updated shoulder cuffs provide additional flexibility, even when pressurized. Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Developers hope, however, that like a backup parachute such features will never be fully put to the test. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life support systems," said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." Despite being hailed as a space suit, Boeing blue shares more DNA with the flight suits worn by high-altitude pilots than the iconic white extravehicular mobility units used for spacewalks, Wired reports. While those mini-spacecraft have to regularly provide extended life support as well as the ability to get around while shielding astronauts from radiation, the new suits are intended only to get astronauts through a pinch, as revealed by their Apollo-era nickname, the "get me down quick suit." In addition to a simplified design, the new suit sports various technical upgrades as well. Reebok upgraded built-in booties, and the old bowl-shaped helmet has been replaced with a soft hoodie made from the same knitted nylon as the rest of the suit. Tablet and smartphone friendly gloves will allow astronauts to operate the touchscreen controls that have replaced many of the switches and dials of yore. NASA retired the space shuttle program in 2011, after which America has relied exclusively on the Russian Soyuz capsule to access the International Space Station. To end this dependence on foreign toil, NASA has signed contracts with Boeing and SpaceX to develop the capacity to get astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. Like the Starliner, the SpaceX's Dragon development has taken longer than expected, but the aeronautics newcomer hopes to start flights in 2018, two years before the date Russia has threatened to stop shuttling Americans to the ISS. SpaceX's own space suit is also under development and is expected to have a similarly heroic look. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

The Boeing Blue spacesuit is 40% lighter than previous suits and features touchscreen-friendly gloves. The spacesuit is designed for use in missions to and from low-Earth orbit and is equipped to protect astronauts during launch and return. “Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle,” said Boeing director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems Chris Ferguson. Boeing’s new spacesuit will be worn by the crew of its Starliner spacecraft, which can accommodate seven passengers and is designed for missions in low-Earth orbit – including ferrying passengers to and from the International Space Station.

News 3 0 0 January 25, 2017 Dow Jones Industrial Average Hits Stock Market Record High Of 20,000: Why Are People Freaking Out? Amanda Katherine People are freaking out right now because the Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 20,000 points for the first time in stock market history. According to Mic, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is considered to be a snapshot of where the stock market is headed because the index includes a lot of the country’s largest and most profitable companies like McDonald’s, General Electric, and IBM. Finally. #dow20k pic.twitter.com/B0LnxCEX9Z — Sara Eisen (@SaraEisen) January 25, 2017 The index first topped 19,000 on November 22. The past month and a half or so have been the second fastest 1,000 point run in Dow Jones Industrial Average’s history. However, the Dow does only include 30 companies, which is a fairly small sample size. Many of the stocks within the Dow are considered to be predictable and “boring.” [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] The best performing Dow stocks over the last month or two have been Goldman Sachs, Disney, and Boeing. Spikes in Caterpillar, Boeing, JPMorgan, and Travelers helped push the Dow over the 20,000 market on Wednesday. Chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, Jeff Kleintop, said that the election has definitely impacted the Dow. Cramer: To get to the next level, we need Trump’s tax breaks 1 Hour Ago | 01:50 Wall Street’s bull should keep running even after its race to Dow 20,000 from its last thousand-point milestone, but it’s much more likely to slow to a trot before it reaches 21,000. The Dow crossed 19,000 on November 22 and continued to gain, as the Trump trade swept the market higher. The best performing Dow stocks since then are Goldman Sachs, Disney, and Boeing. Gains in Caterpillar,Boeing, JPMorgan, and Travelers helped push the Dow across the 20,000 marker on the opening Wednesday. “Individual investors have started buying again, really since the election. “A psychological number like 20,000 helps to continue that trend, helps to bring in investors that have been sitting in cash and it really helps to keep the money flow coming in. “We see this as a positive year, largely because of the individual investor, and not just corporations buying back stock any more.” People are also at odds because the Dow weighs stocks with a high share price more heavily than its modern competitors like the S&P 500, which is more representative of the broader market and contains 500 stocks. A stock’s share price is pretty meaningless without taking into account the number of outstanding shares. ALERT: Dow Jones Industrial Average comes within 44 points of striking the 20,000 level https://t.co/kmLAoeL2sc pic.twitter.com/NjPIi4FZxf — CNBC (@CNBC) January 6, 2017 The 20,000-point stock market rise has been expected for a while now. Of course, not everyone is excited or obsessed over the five-figure milestone. Investor and financial writer Douglas Kass called the buzz surrounding the stock market points “asinine” on Twitter. In one word – the DJIA 20k watch is … Assinine. Stated simply. — Douglas Kass (@DougKass) January 6, 2017 Some market watchers are becoming concerned that stocks are getting too expensive and that the post-election gains have come way too fast. “Expensive” stocks have a share price that is higher than what you would expect, given the company’s profits, earnings, or whatever else. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio (CAPE) was developed by economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE is beginning to dance around the danger zone. Right now, the CAPE is around 28. The CAPE has only been this high a few times in history: before the 1929 stock market crash, the 2000 internet bubble crash, and the 2007 housing market crash. Other financial skeptics believe that the market is pricing in enthusiasm over some of President Donald Trump’s policies, including business tax breaks. However, other potential risks, like the increased possibility of a trade war or even nuclear war, have been ignored. It is likely that it will be a slow trot before the Dow reaches 21,000 points.

[Photo: Flickr/NASA on The Commons] Recent posts Here Are The 5 Scariest Revelations From Pew’s New Cybersecurity Survey Do We Need An “Unbiased” Cable News Network? Why Other People Wreck Brainstorms (And How To Stop Them) Why A CEO's Success Might Depend On Their Experience Of Board Diversity Neal Ungerleider 01.26.17 9:00 AM Earlier this month, SpaceX delivered 10 new Iridium satellites to orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket in a flawless launch from California, and then landed one of the rocket stages on a ship. It was the company's first flight since its disastrous launchpad accident in Florida this fall, which destroyed a rocket and $200 million in equipment. But the success came just days after a NASA report to Congress that again raised questions about the risks that the company's fueling procedures could pose to astronauts. The new annual report, by NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, raises concerns about SpaceX’s "load-and-go" rocket-fueling process, which calls for the fueling of super-chilled liquid oxygen to be conducted after astronauts have boarded the spacecraft, in order to keep the fuel as cold as possible. The approach is a break from conventional wisdom about space travel—typically rocket fueling occurs before a crew is aboard—and the report indicates possible challenges to that plan within NASA. This isn't the first time the panel has expressed concerns about the fueling method. After the SpaceX explosion in September, which took place during routine fueling procedures, the panel called for renewed attention to the issue, which it had raised at least once before. Even determining the level of risk posed by the rockets is challenging, according to the panel. "Despite testing at the component and subassembly level, systems often display 'emergent' behavior once they are used in the actual operational environment. We are concerned that any determination of risk associated with 'load and go' would have significant uncertainty," it said. In a statement to Fast Company, a SpaceX spokesperson reiterated the company's commitment to making its approach "the safest and most reliable possible" through its NASA-led certification process for upcoming launches, and to incorporate lessons learned through its investigation into the September explosion. The ASAP report does not comment on those lessons because it was completed before the conclusion of SpaceX's accident investigation. According to SpaceX's findings, which were issued two weeks ago and accepted by the Federal Aviation Administration, the explosion was caused by a bad reaction between liquid oxygen in the fuel tank and one of three small vessels containing very cold helium that are used to maintain pressure in the tank. The company also said it had identified "controls" against potential safety hazards and that these had been approved by NASA’s Safety Technical Review Board in July 2016. Fueling Issues SpaceX’s "load-and-go" approach to fueling, which fuels rockets only a half-hour before launch, is risky, critics say. SpaceX’s fueling technique uses a special kind of liquid oxygen; it also requires crews to board Dragon rockets before fueling begins. NASA is particularly sensitive to safety concerns: Both the Columbia and Challenger disasters resulted in the deaths of two Shuttle crews, as well as exhaustive investigations and holds on future space shuttle flights. Given past incidents, some at NASA are worried that incidents at private space travel companies could not only result in tragedy but potentially derail future public-private manned space travel partnerships. The private space contracts demand that the new capsules keep crews safe in 99.6% of missions. By that math, NASA believes that 1 out of every 270 missions could fail. In the past, NASA flew astronauts into space on its own. Since the end of the Shuttle, the U.S. has sent missions to the International Space Station by renting seats aboard Russian-flown Soyuz rockets, at around $80 million apiece. Next year, NASA intends to begin relying on SpaceX and Boeing to deliver astronauts to the ISS at a cheaper price, and to extend its relationship with other space firms like Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. Earlier this month, NASA ordered four additional flights from SpaceX and Boeing, tripling the companies' contracted missions to the ISS. The flipside of NASA’s work with the private sector, however, is less control over the inner workings of private vendors. This shift shows up in NASA's contracts. When NASA had direct control over the Space Shuttle's design specifications, they gave contractors between 10,000 and 12,000 requirements that they had to meet. By comparison, in NASA's Commercial Crew contracts, Boeing and SpaceX only have to meet 280 design requirements. The same contracts also assume a certain risk of things going catastrophically wrong; they demand that the new space capsules keep their crews safe in 99.6% of missions. By that math, NASA believes that 1 of every 270 missions could fail. NASA has to account for everything—even the mathematical likelihood of fatal incidents. NASA’s reports also raised concerns with fault tolerances on Boeing’s new Centaur rockets, which are expected to be used in NASA’s commercial crew program. In an email, Boeing spokesperson William Barksdale told Fast Company that the "ULA [United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin partnership] and Boeing are committed to mission success and flying crews safely aboard the CST-100 Starliner that will launch atop the Atlas V. The Atlas V with a Centaur upper stage has a proven track record of 100% mission success, with 68 single-engine launches. Though not all components are fault tolerant at the individual component level, the Atlas V design is robust, and can compensate for anomalies, should they occur, due to overall system redundancies and margins, to ensure mission success." In the text of the report, NASA’s panel also spoke in unusually tough language about the need to pore over investigations of SpaceX’s 2016 launchpad accident with a fine-toothed comb: "We strongly encourage NASA top management to scrutinize this issue and ensure that any decision to accept additional risk or novel risk controls with large uncertainties is justified by the value that will be gained. The decision should not be unduly influenced by other secondary factors such as schedule and budget concerns." In addition to the safety controls SpaceX is implementing, the company spokesperson also cited the Crew Dragon launch abort system, which is designed to eject astronauts to safety at the instant an anomaly is detected. CEO Elon Musk has said that the system would have been able to save any astronauts had they been aboard the rocket that exploded in September. "SpaceX has designed a reliable fueling and launch process that minimizes the duration and number of personnel exposed to the hazards of launching a rocket," said the spokesperson. "Over the last year and a half, NASA and SpaceX have performed a detailed safety analysis of all potential hazards with this process . . . As needed, any additional controls will be put in place to ensure crew safety, from the moment the astronauts reach the pad, through fueling, launch, and spaceflight, and until they are brought safely home." The company said it also recently met with the International Space Station Advisory Committee, and its chair, Maj. Gen. Thomas Stafford, "to provide them detailed information on our approach and answer a number of questions." The report arrived the same week that the Wall Street Journal published leaked SpaceX financial numbers from 2015, showing a $260-million loss following another incident, the explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket shortly after its launch in 2015, as well as big expectations for its satellite-based internet service. It also came days before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, whose administration has signaled an interest in public-private space collaborations and who has invited SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to be an advisor. On Tuesday, Musk met with Trump and other CEOs for a third time. In an investor note last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described the benefit of the "important line of communication" Musk has with Trump. "We believe this level of coordination with the new administration could actually evolve into greater strategic value than with the prior administration," Jonas wrote. SpaceX's next two launches—a commercial satellite scheduled for January 30th and a resupply mission to the International Space Station in February—will occur at Kennedy Space Center's historic Launch Complex 39A. It will mark the first use of the launch pad that sent humans to the Moon since the days of the Space Shuttle. Never miss a story.

Four years later, Ed White completed the first US spacewalk in a puffy white jumpsuit that made him look like the Michelin Man. In the space shuttle era, astronauts wore bright orange “pumpkin suits.” Effective and protective, but not terribly stylish. Boeing hopes to change that with a cobalt number called Boeing Blue. Astronauts will wear the sleek suit as they rocket to the International Space Station aboard the Boeing Starliner next year. The bright blue onesie does away with the fishbowl helmet in favor of a hoodie secured with a pressurized zipper. The gloves work on touch screens. Even the booties got an upgrade from Reebok. The Boeing Blue is designed for intra-vehicular activity, meaning it’s meant for wearing inside the spacecraft. It offers a measure of protection in the event of a serious problem like sudden depressurization or a fire. Unlike a suit designed for extra-vehicular activity, it can’t shield astronauts from micro meteoroids or keep them from being baked like a potato by solar radiation. They’ll wear it primarily during launches and re-entries, when they face the greatest risk of something going wrong. “The nickname for it in the Apollo era was the ‘get me down quick suit,’ says Nicholas de Monchaux, who wrote Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo, a book about spacesuit design.

Boeing worked with David Clark, the aerospace firm that built pressurized suits for wartime fighter pilots and astronauts in the Gemini, Apollo, and shuttle missions. The goal this time around was the same—create a suit capable of protecting astronauts from fire and sudden changes in pressure—but make it lighter, sleeker, and more comfortable. Besides the hoodie, gloves, and more flexible boots, the 20-pound suit is 10 pounds lighter than the pumpkin suit. It’s less fussy too, with fewer zippers and buckles and such to make it easier to get in and out of. And the material was designed to allow water vapor out while keeping air in, making the suit cooler. Spacesuits have an annoying habit of trying to look like anything other than a spacesuit when pressurized. “It wants to be like a basketball,” de Monchaux says. In the 1950s, David Clark found a solution while knitting on an airplane: link-net, a knitted nylon material acts like a flexible cast, helping the suit retain its shape. Boeing Blue features a similar technology that features extra material at the joints to allow greater range of motion. The suits must face a battery of tests before they’re certified for launch next year, an important reminder that a spacesuit, no matter the material, color, or fit, must do one thing: Make sure astronauts reach space and return home safely.

(Courtesy Boeing) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Space Business January 26, 2017 Athleisure for astronauts? Boeing has unveiled new lightweight spacesuits that could make their launch-pad debut as early as next year, when the aerospace company’s CST-100 Starliner space capsule is scheduled to take its first manned test flight and, eventually, carry astronauts to the International Space Station. CST-100 Starliner Space Suit (Courtesy Boeing) Unlike the bulky, white spacesuits worn on missions past, these suits more are much slimmer. In fact, Boeing says the suits weigh around 12 lbs (5.4kg)–about 40% lighter than previous suits. “We’ve simplified the suit,” said former astronaut Chris Ferguson, who helped design it. The suits come with touchscreen-friendly gloves and a soft hood-like helmet that easily can be zipped off. The fabric is water-resistant and fiber-retardant, and the suit features zippers along the sides to “make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing,” Boeing says. And say goodbye to clunky footwear. Boeing’s uniform designer, a Massachusetts-based company called David Clark, worked with Reebok to come up with a new kind of astronaut shoe that looks remarkably like a running sneaker. That’s by design, so astronauts can quickly exit the capsule if there’s an emergency. “We wanted a hybrid of a runner and a sandal and a wrestling boot and an aviator boot,” said Shane Jacobs, one of the designers at David Clark. These boots have an outer shroud that’s the same material as the spacesuit and the sole is “more like a running shoe.” They run up to the middle of the calf. Perhaps it’s a look we’ll see more often as space tourism becomes more and more of a reality.

Reuters/Benoit Tessier Qantas has planned to add Perth to London flight in March 2018 using Boeing's Dreamliner aeroplane 787, which is expected to be the longest route in operation. Boeing Regional Director of Product Marketing Justin Hale was confident in saying that the Dreamliner could cover 17-hour flight because the airline installed 236 seats instead of the usual 300 seats. The Dreamliners comes with improved cabin features that provide experience to the passengers. Windows become larger and which can be dimmed or brightened electronically. Overhead lockers become bigger that can easily swallow up carry-on luggage. The ride becomes less bumpy due to the smooth ride technology. Vice President and General Manager of Boeing’s 787 program Mark Jenks said that creating faster models are not the priority right now as fuel-efficient aircraft are the focus of the company. He said that their customers are more concern in the amount they spend on fuel as it is a huge part of their operating costs. Jenks said that Dreamliner models helped some routes to be economically viable which made the aeroplane visible in many parts of the world. He said that even in a not-so-big place like San Jose, California, the 787 model was visible flying from San Jose to Narita, Japan. Boeing cater to other airlines including Jetstar and Air New Zealand. Jetstar has been flying 787-8s since 2013, while Air New Zealand is using models of 787-9s since 2014. Boeing and its rival Airbus has been hit by a worldwide downturn in aircraft orders where Boeing sold 100 fewer aircraft in 2016. The sales were down 305 for the Airbus. Although there was a decline in sales, Jenks said that air traffic is increasing and they still feel very good about where the aircraft industry is going. He said that the market's basic dynamics did not change.  Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related British Airways to lower fare by adding 52 seats on Boeing 777 flights beginning 2018 Qantas CEO Alan Joyce shares plans for non-stop flights on Sydney-Paris & Melbourne-Rome routes using Boeing 787 Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Australian Open 2017: Boris Becker predicts Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal final 0 Shares 2 ‘Better Call Saul’ season 3: Return of another ‘Breaking Bad’ character confirmed 0 Shares 3 'Days Of Our Lives' spoilers for Jan. 23: Hope fights for her life; Chloe comes clean to Brady but refuses to give up the baby 0 Shares 4 Dell XPS 15 vs Apple MacBook Pro 2016 0 Shares 5 Golden State Warriors vs Miami Heat live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Mr Willoughby cast 0 Shares 7 'Outlander' season 3 will be like a 'wee treasure hunt' 0 Shares 8 Rafael Nadal vs Grigor Dimitrov live stream: Watch Australian Open 2017 semi-final online, start time, betting odds 0 Shares 9 ‘Vikings’ season 4 episode 19, 20 leaked reportedly 0 Shares 10 ‘The X-Files’ season 11 expected to premiere in 2018 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Optus closes $75 million deal with Flight Centre Dreamworld tragedy: Weak attendance at theme parks affecting Village Roadshow Pumpkin Patch to shutter all stores by mid-February OpenText director reveals user context is key to achieving workplace efficiency Qantas order Boeing 787 Dreamliner for long flights Australia's houses and apartments below $1 million More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance 5-year-old dies from suspected methadone overdose Bourke St tragedy: Friends, family come together to honour the victims Sydney weather: few more warm nights ahead Police officers attacked, taken to hospital while arresting carjackers in Qld Claremont serial killings: Bradley Edwards appears in court for second time One dead, seven injured after bus crashes, rolls over on NSW highway More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Los Angeles Lakers vs Utah Jazz live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time NBA Trade News: Cavaliers rebuff Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Love swap WWE WrestleMania 33: Eight matches already booked, Possible WWE Royal Rumble 2017 winner Roger Federer vs Stan Wawrinka live stream: 2017 Australian Open, where to watch live, start time, preview, betting odds NBA Trade News: Clippers likely to acquire Carmelo Anthony without losing Big 3 Rafael Nadal vs Grigor Dimitrov live stream: Watch Australian Open 2017 semi-final online, start time, betting odds More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'The Last Of Us 2': Politics to reflect Neil Druckmann's views 'Grand Theft Auto 6' update: Map and protagonist possibilities 'Kingdom Hearts 3': Game artist promises high quality for next chapter 2017 Year of the Fire Rooster: Meaning, characteristics of Fire Rooster ‘Pokemon Sun and Moon’ & Nintendo 3DS keep fans busy ‘Pokemon GO’ big update anytime soon More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Days Of Our Lives' spoilers for Jan. 26: Death knocks on a Salemite’s door; things heat up between two couples ‘Neighbours’ spoilers for Jan. 26: On Australia Day, a kidnapping horrifies Ramsay Street; Paige gears up to reveal her baby’s father 'General Hospital' spoilers for Jan. 26, 2017: Liz reveals her suspicions on Tom’s murder; Sonny offers words of wisdom to Nelle 'The Young and the Restless' spoilers for Jan. 26, 2017: Reed opens up to Nikki; Cane and Billy square off; Paul fears the worst for Dylan ‘Westworld’ season 2 to reveal what really happened to Ford ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for Jan. 26: Quinn makes Ridge an offer he can’t resist; Thomas jumps into the fray More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

The blue suits, which were revealed today, combine a retro flare with a modern feel. Image: Boeing In fact, the suits look just like a smoothed out version of the blue spacesuit in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here's still from the movie: Image: MGM And here's former astronaut Chris Ferguson showing off the new Starliner spacesuit: Image: Boeing Pretty close! The major difference is that the 2001 suits had bigger helmets with sloping visors, while the new Starliner suits feature the badass domed glass visor that's reminiscent of the Apollo era. But it's not just about looks. "The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive," astronaut Eric Boe said in a press release. "It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it's simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." Image: Boeing While there's no telling how the suits would hold up against a maniacal robot, they're more than equipped to handle the conditions of the Starliner, which will bring astronauts to the International Space Station in 2018. New features include an upgraded helmet, which is incorporated into the spacesuit, touchscreen-sensitive gloves, and built-in ventilation. Image credit: NASA / Boeing Boeing was fastidious about the suit's details. Astronauts were instructed to do some sort of jazzercise ritual in and out of a Starliner mockup to test comfort and flexibility. Alas, it worked. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life support systems," Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA's Commercial Crew Program said. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." Image: Boeing The new suits won't negate the need for their bulkier older siblings — the launch-and-entry suits — but at least they look cool. Just watch astronauts strut in their new suits to the stylings of Boeing's space age EDM: Comments CaptSiD @mrsid Jan 26, 2017, 11:07pm I've always thought the NASA suits were ridiculously bulky. These ones are more like what you'd expect at this stage of the 21st century. Adam Savage is going to have kittens about these suits too! Also that 2nd image is from the sequel 2010: Odyssey Two. Reply 0 dissapointedfather Guest Jan 27, 2017, 11:41am The only thing they have in common with 2001 suits is the color. And only one of the 2001 suits is close to that color. Evident by the horrible comparison photo you've posted. Come on, Post the two full suits side by side, i dare you. Your click baity title be damned. There were much better ones you could've chosen. "These newly designed space suits are outta this world" "You wont believe how these new suits will save astronauts lives while keeping them mobile" Reply 0 Join the discussion!

But Boeing has already clinched a much more important title: creator of the world’s jazziest spacesuit.  Astronauts riding the firm’s Starliner spaceship will be kitted out with a striking blue suit fitted with some pretty incredible features.  The suit is among the lightest ever developed, despite boasting an incorporated helmet and visor, trainers, touchscreen-sensitive gloves and cooling vents. Boeing The tailor-made clothing, which resembles a high-tech onesie, lets water vapour pass out, but keeps air inside, keeping the astronauts cool and safe. In the unlikely event that the Starliner loses pressure, the vents close up, pressurising the suit immediately. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” NASA The final design is the result of weeks of testing, with astronauts climbing in and out of a mock-up Starliner to ensure the suit is flexible enough to accommodate every possible position and stretch. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Boeing NASA Boe and fellow astronauts Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams are training for flight tests using spacecraft under development for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, slated for launch next year. The astronauts will board both the Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon systems over several flights, but it’s not yet clear which will be first off the launch pad.

Billings slipped by 18% at Boeing Military Aircraft, by 8% at the Network & Space Systems division and by 8% at Global Systems & Support. In all, the three units billed just USD6.9 billion compared to USD7.8 billion during the same period last year. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO, elected to paint a brighter picture in a conference call with analysts on 25 January, during which he focused on the division's performance for the entire year, which he characterised as "solid." Boeing officials highlighted the US State Department's approval of pending international sales of F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait respectively, as well as CH-47 Chinooks and AH-64 Apache helicopters to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Science / Boeing shows off spacesuit of the future Boeing shows off spacesuit of the future Jon Martindale 2 days ago Science Boeing has debuted a new design for spacesuits to be worn by astronauts aboard its planned Starliner crew capsule. They are a fancy blue colour, hence the name, “Boeing Blue,” and are much lighter, whilst also being more flexible and still capable of pressurising in the event of an emergency. The ascent and entry suit is an important part of any ship that’s travelling to or from Low Earth Orbit. It doesn’t need to be as capable or protective as suits designed with spacewalks in mind, but must still provide protection and functionality. Boeing suggests that these new suits are just as capable as older designs, whilst improving their wearer’s ability to operate within the crew capsule. The new Boeing Blue design is said to be 40 per cent lighter than its predecessor, features zips for added flexibility at the waist and makes it much easier for wearers to stand, sit and then stand again (thanks Ars). The visor features a larger field of view to improve peripheral vision and the gloves built into the suit are touch-screen compatible, which will be a necessity in the new Starliner crew capsule. While the suits might be ready to go though, the Starliner itself isn’t. As it stands Boeing plans its first crewed test flight of the capsule towards the tail end of 2018, with first operational flights not slated for any earlier than December that year. Since it has already seen delays, nobody would be surprised if that happened again. However it is competing directly with Elon Musk’s Space X. While that company’s Dragon 2 capsule has also seen delays – and explosions of its Falcon 9 rocket haven’t helped – the fact that it could begin ferrying astronauts to the ISS before Boeing could help encourage the Starliner’s development. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE. KitGuru Says: What do you think of the new spacesuits? They seem much more in keeping with contemporary space travel. Much less so than the overly bulky suits of yesteryear.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Blue suit Boeing Blue news Spacesuit Starliner Previous Facebook Messenger to begin displaying adverts Next Ghost Recon Wildlands beta coming next week Check Also TransPod partners with railway expert IKOS for Hyperloop development TransPod, the startup that plans to become the leading Hyperloop developer in the world, has … Polls Which system memory next?

The suits are customised for every astronaut, use cutting edge materials to make them as light as possible, and have gloves that can be used with modern touchscreen devices. The new spacesuits have convenient zippers to change the configuration, and can be pressurised in an emergency. The suits are improvements on the launch and entry suits worn by Space Shuttle astronauts. The suits designed by Boeing are 4.5 kg lighter than the suits used by Nasa so far, and weigh only 9 kg. The suits are lighter and more flexible because of the use of newer materials and different joint patterns. The materials used in the elbow and knee pads allow for more flexibility. The helmet, visor and boots are integrated into the suit itself, and are not detachable. The old shuttle suits used by Nasa. This is the STS-126 mission by the Endeavor Shuttle. Image: Nasa. There are vents to cool the astronaut, and the water vapour build up within the suit is removed without removing the air. The cooling mechanism keeps the astronauts from overheating, without compromising on their safety. The astronauts have been training in mockups of the Starliner, to ensure that they can perform all the required operations while wearing the suits. As part of the preparations, the astronauts climb in and out of the suit repeatedly and try out different positions. Eric Boe testing the new suit in a cabin mockup of the Boeing Starliner. Image: Nasa. Astronaut Eric Boe said, “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive. It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Eric Boe, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Sunita Williams are the astronauts preparing for commercial missions to man the International Space Station. An Astronaut stand-in being fitted with the communications systems. Image: Nasa. The Commercial Crew Program by Nasa will use spacecraft from private companies to man the space station. The Dragon spacecraft from SpaceX and the Starliner from Boeing are currently part of the Commercial Crew Program. The spacecraft can take up four astronauts at a time to the space station, allowing for a total crew of seven at any single point of time. This will allow more scientific experiments to be conducted. Flight tests for the Starliner with astronauts on board are expected to be begin in 2018.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Space Boeing reveals light and stylish spacesuit for Starliner astronauts David Szondy 6 pictures Former astronaut Chris Ferguson in the Boeing Blue spacesuit (Credit: Boeing)View gallery - 6 images When the Boeing CST-100 Starliner takes to space in 2018, its passengers and crew will be a little more stylish and a little cooler than their NASA predecessors. The company has unveiled its Boeing Blue spacesuit, which will be worn by astronauts flying to and from the International Space Station and features numerous innovations to improve both the comfort and protection of modern space travelers. The Boeing Blue isn't intended for anything as ambitious as going on spacewalks or strutting around on the surface of Mars. Instead, it's an emergency suit similar to the bulky orange suits worn by the Shuttle astronauts to protect them in the event of a sudden cabin depressurization. However, Boeing is keen to point out that its new suit is not only a bit more stylish, but is very much a state-of-the art suit for the 21st century. According to Boeing, the Blue is 40 percent the weight of current NASA suits, coming it at only 12 lb (5.4 kg) as opposed to 30 lb (13.6 kg). Part of these savings is from eliminating the hard helmet and neck ring in favor of a smaller soft version secured by a zipper and sporting a wider polycarbonate visor for better visibility when pressurized. In addition, there is an integrated communications system in the helmet to keep the astronauts in touch with mission control and one another. Under the blue outer covering is a new layered fabric that includes a more breathable design for the suit and boots to keep astronauts cool without the need for external cooling systems under normal conditions. There are also zips in the torso to allow the wearer to move from sitting to standing comfortably. Since this is the digital age, the lighter gloves of the Boeing Blue also include touchscreen-friendly surfaces to allow the astronauts to use their devices and touch displays in space. "Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle," says Chris Ferguson, Boeing director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems and a former NASA astronaut.

Poseidon Agreement Strengthens U.S., U.K. Maritime Aviation Cooperation - Irish Sun Issue 028/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Poseidon Agreement Strengthens U.S., U.K. Maritime Aviation Cooperation U.S. Defense Department Thursday 26th January, 2017 WASHINGTON, Jan. 25, 2017 - Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work today signed a P-8A maritime patrol aircraft declaration with British Defense Minister for Procurement Harriett Baldwin to further strengthen the uniquely close defense relationship between the U.S. and the U.K., according to a Defense Department news release. The British Royal Air Force is purchasing nine Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to be based in RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland. Pictured here, a P-8A Poseidon aircraft departs Boeing Field in Seattle, heading to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla., Nov. 20, 2014. The aircraft joined other Poseidon aircraft as part of the War Eagles of Patrol Squadron 16, the Navy's first operational P-8A squadron. This flight marked the delivery of the 19th long-range maritime patrol aircraft to the Navy. The multi-mission aircraft, based on the next-generation Boeing 737-800 platform, provides anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and will replace the Navy P-3 Orion fleet.

U.S. Navy photo Download Image Image details page Delivering on the commitment of the 2015 Strategic Defense and Security Review, the U.K. is purchasing nine Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to be based in Royal Air Force Lossiemouth, Scotland, the release said. The aircraft will add to the U.K.'s surveillance capabilities, including conducting anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, search and rescue and intelligence gathering. In 2019, the U.K. will receive delivery of its first P-8A Poseidon aircraft and both nations have committed to deepen their defense cooperation when operating in the North Atlantic region, according to the release. U.S.-U.K. Security Partnership Work said in the release, "Today's signing of the declaration on P-8A Poseidon bilateral cooperation exemplifies the importance and strength of the U.S.-U.K. partnership. This cooperation agreement ensures and deepens our interoperability and maritime patrol capabilities. Together, the U.S. and U.K. will continue to deter regional threats and maintain a robust military posture." Through seeking opportunities to share logistics and support bases and optimize the use of P-8A aircraft, particularly in Europe, the declaration should ensure increased value for money and operational effectiveness, the release said. Baldwin said, "The United States is our pre-eminent ally in global defense and collective security. This declaration is further evidence of how our two countries continue to cooperate and build mutual security, particularly in the North Atlantic region. Backed by a rising defense budget and a [$224 billion] equipment plan, the P-8A program will provide us with enhanced surveillance capabilities." NATO Alliance As leading members of NATO, the U.K. and U.S. are committed to the collective defense of each other and their allies, the release said. The two nations also have pledged to deepen defense cooperation, bilaterally and within the alliance, to further improve the ability to operate together in exercises and operations. The declaration provides a new opportunity to maximize value for money for the taxpayer and continue to strengthen U.S.-U.K. interoperability, and to pursue efficiencies in operations and support, including at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, where the P-8A will bring some 400-plus jobs. The Defense Department and the U.K. Ministry of Defense plan to cooperate closely on operation of their P-8A aircraft in the North Atlantic to ensure a coherent approach to maritime partrol aircraft activity, the release said. The RAF has ensured that the U.K. has maintained the skills needed to operate the P-8As through the 'seed-corn' program, which has embedded former RAF military patrol aircraft operators within the maritime patrol aircraft squadrons of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S, the release said. Air Commodore Ian Gale, the senior responsible owner for the U.K.'s Poseidon P-8A program, said, "This agreement will enhance the U.K.'s maritime patrol capability and further strengthen U.K.-U.S. defense relations. The arrival of the Poseidon P-8A in 2019 will provide the U.K. with significantly increased capabilities and bring hi-tech employment to Scotland and the wider U.K." This agreement follows British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon's recent visit to Norway, where he also committed to cooperate on maritime patrol aircraft operations, ensuring that the U.K. will continue to play a key role in delivering collective maritime security across the globe, according to the release.

Featured Story Brexit dampens predictions of Irish growth DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Bank has cut down the growth forecast for this year despite the country showing resilience to Brexit. This is due to the fact that risks lie ahead as hard Brexit deal looms large.  Moreover, Irish-owned manufacturing industries had witnessed a slackening of demand even before the sharp slump in the Sterling. According to the Central Bank, it has received 100 inquiries from U.K.-based banks and investment funds that were considering relocation to somewhere else in the EU. It has been revealed that Barclays Bank had decided that Dublin will be its main hub inside the EU after Brexit.  The bank also plans on adding about 150 staff to its operations here, in case U.K.-based finance companies lose easy access to the EU market.  This however, could lead to a rise in house prices, as foreign employees seek homes in Ireland. Chief economist at the Central Bank has noted that an influx of foreign bank personnel could affect house prices because there is a shortage of supply.  Ireland would need more than 25,000 new homes a year to meet demand. The Chief Economist said that the outlook for the Irish economy was a “mixed bag” as more jobs and wage increases would raise domestic demands, despite risks from a hard Brexit deal. The bank cut its GDP forecast to 3.3 percent from 3.6 percent because of the effect of slower global growth on Irish exports.  The bank further predicts growth to slow to 3 percent in 2018. The chief economist noted that it was “implausible” for the Irish economy to fare worse than U.K. under a hard Brexit.  Meanwhile, Barclays is making its contingency plans so it can continue serving EU clients in the case that Theresa May fails to strike a deal preserving London’s access to EU’s markets. Barclays has hired staff for positions of senior managers, derivatives specialists, currency traders, compliance and human resources staff in Dublin. Additionally, Merrion Capital reported that it is more cautious of stocks overall because of the huge rally by stock markets after the election of Donald Trump.  According to the company, U.S. tax cuts could lead to a rise in earnings of U.S. companies, however, Trump’s ‘America First’ policy may lead to higher tariffs.

Its innovative layers will keep astronauts cooler as well. The touchscreen-friendly gloves allow astronauts to interact with the capsule's tablets while the boots are breathable and slip resistant".   "Zippers in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing. In addition to protecting astronauts during launch and the return to Earth, the suit also helps connect astronauts to ground and space crews through the communications headset within the helmet", they continued. Adding: "The suit's hood-like soft helmet sports a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space".   NEWS SOURCES:Boingboing.net Recommended for You Your smartphone could soon detect cancer, thanks to...

PHOTO: REUTERS RIYADH: Saudi Arabia flaunted its new F-15SA fighter jet at an airshow in Riyadh on Wednesday, demonstrating that it has begun receiving items purchased six years ago in the priciest-ever US arms sale to a foreign country. King Salman and his son, Defence Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, watched the spectacle as graduates of the King Faisal Air College performed military marches and fighter jets swooped overhead. The Obama administration approved the $60 billion deal in 2010 amid mounting US and Saudi tensions with Iran. The deal dwarfed previous multibillion-dollar sales to Saudi Arabia, which for years has been the biggest US arms buyer. In addition to the 84 Boeing F-15SA fighters, the deal included orders for upgrades to Saudi Arabia’s 70 older F-15s, HARM AGM-88 Anti-Radiation Missiles, Laser JDAM and Enhanced Paveway munitions and related equipment and services. The sale was a major win for Boeing, which has faced competition from Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter. Boeing also clinched weapons sales to Qatar and Kuwait last year. Saudi Arabia unveils next-generation F-15 warplane “The F-35 was displacing all other players. But fourth generation production models, especially Boeing F-15s, are going to have a longer life than predicted,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group. Riyadh placed its order for the fighter jets to support its chief foreign policy goal of rolling back Iranian influence around the region, according to statements by US officials at the time. Six years later, questions linger about how such expensive hardware will help the kingdom win wars in places like Yemen, where it has struggled to confront what it sees as Iranian expansion since intervening in the civil war in March 2015. Riyadh accuses Iran of backing Yemen’s Shia Houthi rebels, who ousted the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital over two years ago. Despite a near-daily campaign of air strikes, Saudi Arabia has yet to impose its will on its southern neighbour. The Houthis and allied forces continue to control Sanaa and much of the rest of Yemen’s north. The rebels regularly attack Saudi soldiers at border checkpoints and fire missiles that sometimes reach deep into Saudi territory. “There’s no question that impressive equipment has been a boon to the Saudi-led coalition,” said Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “But ultimately, state of the art weaponry is one thing and the situation on the ground is another.” Read more: Boeing , F-15SA fighter jet , Saudi Arabia Read full story Recommended Stories Saudi Arabia unveils next-generation F-15 warplane A missile was attached to the belly of the plane displayed against the backdrop of a giant Saudi flag IS ties : 13 Pakistanis among 16 held in Saudi Arabia In late October, Saudi authorities said they had arrested eight extremists Saudi finance ministry says no fees on remittances Shura Council was considering a proposal to impose a 6% levy on expat remittances Facebook Conversations Reader Comments (4) All Comments Reader's Recommendations Munir Akram Jan 26, 2017 - 11:56AM Reply Buying bomber to kill poor Yemeni children and women and not protecting Palestinians against Israeli aggressions from time to time raises a question as to who Saudi regime belongs to !Recommend Salman Jan 26, 2017 - 1:18PM Reply Time for Iran to get a 100 Su-35 fighters from Russia.Recommend curious2 Jan 26, 2017 - 1:47PM Reply Seems like overkill against Iran which is still flying planes from the 70’s.Recommend FAZ Jan 26, 2017 - 5:34PM Reply Professionalism in any armed force, cannot be bought.

They went from riding horses to flying aeroplanes. But the sky is no longer the limit for Boeing Article Photos By Thomas Shambler Thursday, 26 January 2017 9:34 AM The Wright brothers helped popularize barnstorming, stunt flights that showcased both pilot skills and aircraft strength. In 1914, William Boeing took his first plane ride in one of these barnstormers. 1917 When the US entered World War I, Boeing shipped modified Model C's to the US Navy. It was the start of a relationship with the military that continues today. 1927 The Boeing Model 40A – which was specifically designed for the purpose of mail– began delivering post between San Francisco and Chicago. 1936 The Douglas DC-3 became the first aeroplane that turned a profit purely through passenger transport. When it was delivered, it set a standard of luxury for both United and American Airlines. 1939 Boeing was a critical asset for US forces during World War II. the P-51 Mustang was known for escorting bombers that damaged the Axis infrastructure, as did the B-29 Superfortress – which carried multiple remotely operable weapons systems. 1957 For the first time, air travel exceeded travel by rail and sea for the first time. This was helped by the introduction of the Boeing 707, a large reliable and safe passenger and cargo aircraft. 1970 A crew of 50,000 employees designed and constructed the first Boeing 747 in less than 16 months. When it went into service, it became the largest civilian aircraft in the world. 1981 The Space Shuttle Orbiter – the world's first reusable spacecraft – made its debut, and was fundamental to the construction of the ISS. 2009 After its first flight, the 787 Dreamliner reached 1,000 orders faster than any aeroplane in history, by offering more space to customers while consuming 20 percent less fuel than comparably sized planes.

Zippered helmets? Boeing reboots the spacesuit for Starliner by Alan Boyle on January 25, 2017 at 5:24 pmJanuary 25, 2017 at 5:33 pm Comments  5 Share  144 Tweet Share  12 Reddit Email Read GeekWire's weekly sports newsletter! Boeing’s Chris Ferguson, a former astronaut, models the Starliner spacesuit. (Boeing via YouTube) The spacesuit designed for astronauts riding Boeing’s Starliner space taxi makes a fashion statement for the 21st century, from its touchscreen-sensitive gloves to its color-coordinated shoes. And all of it in Boeing blue. The spacesuit made its public debut today during a media extravaganza at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson as one of the emcees. “I was essentially the model for this as they built the suit around me,” said Ferguson, who commanded the final space shuttle mission in 2011 and now serves as Boeing’s director of crew and mission systems. The CST-100 Starliner is being developed as a transport vehicle for NASA crews heading to and from the International Space Station. There’s a chance that Ferguson could take a ride as a Boeing test pilot, but for now, the composition of the initial crews is up in the air. NASA has tapped four current astronauts – Eric Boe, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams – to train for the first round of commercial flights on the Starliner as well as on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. All four of those astronauts have been involved in testing the Starliner suit, which is designed for use inside the spacecraft during launch and entry. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” Boe said in a NASA report on the unveiling. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” At less than 20 pounds, the suit weighs about 10 pounds less than the traditional orange launch-and-entry suit used during the shuttle era. The material lets water vapor pass through to keep astronauts from getting drenched in sweat, while retaining the air inside the suit. NASA’s graphic highlights design features of the Starliner spacesuit. The launch-and-entry suit can’t be used during spacewalks. Extravehicular activity requires a much bulkier suit that weighs about 280 pounds. “This is really something used internally, in the spacecraft only,” Ferguson explained. The suit, designed by David Clark Company for Boeing, is meant to be pressurized in the event of an in-flight emergency. “The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft’s redundant life support systems,” said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don’t need a spacesuit. It’s like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed.” ICYMI: Watch #Boeing–@WashingtonPost Facebook live reveal of #Starliner Spacesuit + go inside mock-up: https://t.co/VWWf8PJ2Io pic.twitter.com/Ri4qGIQlUB — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) January 25, 2017 A lightweight helmet and visor are incorporated into the suit, and hang back like a hood when not in use. When the helmet’s needed, the wearer pulls it down over his or her face and simply zips it up. The suit comes with twist-on, twist-off gloves, with fingertips that are touchscreen-sensitive so that astronauts can operate the Starliner’s streamlined displays. The integrated shoes look like cross-trainers, and come in a stylish color scheme that fades from deep blue to white. Boeing and NASA will continue putting the adjustable blue suits to the test over the months of training to come. The current schedule calls for the first Starliner test flight to the space station to take place during the summer of 2018. Boeing’s Chris Ferguson stands tall in the Starliner suit.

F-15SA fighter jets are seen during a graduation ceremony and air show marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of King Faisal Air College in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser Reuters/Faisal Al Nasser By Katie Paul RIYADH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia flaunted its new F-15SA fighter jet at an airshow in Riyadh on Wednesday, demonstrating that it has begun receiving items purchased six years ago in the priciest-ever U.S. arms sale to a foreign country. King Salman and his son, Defence Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, watched the spectacle as graduates of the King Faisal Air College performed military marches and fighter jets swooped overhead. The Obama administration approved the $60 billion deal in 2010 amid mounting U.S. and Saudi tensions with Iran. The deal dwarfed previous multibillion-dollar sales to Saudi Arabia, which for years has been the biggest U.S. arms buyer. In addition to the 84 Boeing F-15SA fighters, the deal included orders for upgrades to Saudi Arabia's 70 older F-15s, HARM AGM-88 Anti-Radiation Missiles, Laser JDAM and Enhanced Paveway munitions and related equipment and services. Advertisement The sale was a major win for Boeing, which has faced competition from Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter. Boeing also clinched weapons sales to Qatar and Kuwait last year. "The F-35 was displacing all other players. But fourth generation production models, especially Boeing F-15s, are going to have a longer life than predicted," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group. Riyadh placed its order for the fighter jets to support its chief foreign policy goal of rolling back Iranian influence around the region, according to statements by U.S. officials at the time. Six years later, questions linger about how such expensive hardware will help the kingdom win wars in places like Yemen, where it has struggled to confront what it sees as Iranian expansion since intervening in the civil war in March 2015. Riyadh accuses Iran of backing Yemen's Shi'ite Houthi rebels, who ousted the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital over two years ago. Despite a near-daily campaign of air strikes, Saudi Arabia has yet to impose its will on its southern neighbour. The Houthis and allied forces continue to control Sanaa and much of the rest of Yemen's north. The rebels regularly attack Saudi soldiers at border checkpoints and fire missiles that sometimes reach deep into Saudi territory. "There's no question that impressive equipment has been a boon to the Saudi-led coalition," said Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "But ultimately, state of the art weaponry is one thing and the situation on the ground is another."

Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. Company executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump’s recent comments about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Hyundai Motor’s Profit Tumbles 39 Percent on Weak Car Sales SEOUL, South Korea (AP) – Hyundai Motor Co. reported Wednesday a 39 percent drop in its fourth-quarter income, hit by weak demand in South Korea and the United States and higher costs from strikes and sales incentives. The South Korean automaker said its net profit was 1 trillion won ($859 million) for the period, compared with 1.6 trillion won a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were anticipating 1.5 trillion won of net income. Sales fell 1 percent to 24.5 trillion won ($21 billion). White House, Trump Organization Name Ethics Advisers NEW YORK (AP) – President Donald Trump and his hotel and real estate business on Wednesday separately named ethics counselors, the latest attempt to address conflicts-of-interest concerns that arise from his decision to maintain financial ties to his company. President Trump selected Washington attorney Stefan Passantino as his White House ethics adviser. Trump’s company tapped a former George H.W. Bush campaign lawyer and a longtime company executive as in-house ethics monitors. But ethics experts, including the head of the Office of Government Ethics, have criticized the plan, saying it doesn’t do enough to ensure that Trump won’t make decisions as president that personally benefit himself, his family or his company. Contractor Says Trump Refusing To Pay for Work at D.C. Hotel WASHINGTON (AP) – An electrical subcontractor who worked on the Trump International Hotel in Washington has sued a company owned by President Donald Trump for more than $2 million, alleging it was not fully paid. AES Electrical filed its lawsuit in the District of Columbia Superior Court, the latest in a string of lawsuits involving Trump’s renovation of the historic Old Post Office building a few blocks from the White House. AES alleges that it bore increased expenses last year because of change orders and other demands from Trump’s staff. It also said it was told to accelerate the pace of work so Trump could hold a “soft opening” prior to the election.

January 25, 2017, 4:52 PM A   A Boeing shares reached an all-time high as the 787 Dreamliner emerged from a decade of losses to help the company post rising profit and weather a turbulent market for wide-body jetliners. The world’s largest planemaker is counting on the marquee carbon-fiber jet and higher output of its single-aisle 737, a workhorse with discount airlines, to bolster results this year. Boeing forecast higher cash and earnings on Wednesday, while predicting a sales decline as it makes fewer 777 aircraft. Investors, focused on Boeing’s potential cash bounty, responded favorably. The stock was the top performer among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the index climbed past 20,000 for the first time. The shares closed up 4.24 percent, or $6.81, at $167.36. The quarter’s results also were a relief compared with last year, when the company caught investors off-guard with a forecast of fewer 737 deliveries. “We think this release is pretty boring — and boring is good,” Robert Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients. Boeing has pledged to return all of its cash flow to investors, repurchasing shares and bolstering its dividend as a near-record order backlog shelters the manufacturer from market shocks. The Chicago-based company is counting on improving Dreamliner profitability, resurgent defense spending and a new family of 737 narrow-body jets to counteract rising trade tensions with China and a glut of older twin-aisle planes. Boeing’s record share price also reflects a stock buyback binge last year, as the company repurchased 7 percent of its shares, said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. While the manufacturer generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations, it spent $7 billion on stock, $4.6 billion on research, $2.8 billion on dividends and $2.6 billion on property, plants and equipment. “They can’t keep spending this way and not continue to dwindle cash balances,” Ferguson said. Still, revenue will fall to a range of $90.5 billion to $92.5 billion this year, Boeing said, as the company slows production of the 777 this month and in the third quarter because of an order shortfall. Analysts had expected annual sales of $93 billion. While the cuts will mean fewer deliveries of one of Boeing’s main profit drivers, total shipments will rise as Boeing cranks up production of the 737, its main source of profit. Boeing expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial airplanes, an increase from last year’s 748. Operating cash flow will be about $10.8 billion, up from the $10.5 billion generated in 2016. Earnings adjusted for pension expenses will probably be $9.10 to $9.30 a share this year, compared with the $9.24 predicted by analysts. To keep its cash machine humming, Boeing is counting on a smooth debut for the upgraded 737 Max while it speeds output by 12 percent at its factory in Renton to a record 47 jets a month. Boeing also benefited as deferred production costs for the 787 Dreamliner fell $215 million to $27.3 billion, according to the company’s website. The planemaker reached the crossover point last year where unit costs for the cutting-edge jetliner finally fell below its sales price. Since then, the balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing’s factories. The jetliner is the first built of spun carbon-fiber composites rather than aluminum and entered commercial service in 2011, more than three years late. Fourth-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.47 a share, despite an $312 million accounting loss for an aerial tanker program, the company said. That was 15 cents more than analyst had expected. Revenue fell 1.2 percent to $23.3 billion, compared with analysts’ projection of $23.1 billion. Free cash flow was $2.23 billion, while analysts had expected $2.02 billion.

Image: AP By Brett Williams2017-01-27 23:28:04 UTC Over the past few days, some of the biggest questions about our national cybersecurity have centered on one device: President Donald Trump's phone.  Shortly after he reportedly traded in his main Twitter machine, an old-model, unsecured Android phone, for a "secure, encrypted device approved by the Secret Service," the famously tech averse executive appeared to still be using the unsecured device. This made waves in intelligence and security circles, as the risks of the president of the United States using a potentially vulnerable device are extensive.     We know about Trump's Android fixation — but what about the specialized presidential handset he might be stiffing? SEE ALSO: Trump's cyber advisor didn't know about Signal According to an exclusive report from Defense One, that device is a modified Boeing Black, a super secure Android device for Top Secret data designed to self-destruct at the first sign of tampering. The presidential model was developed by Boeing and the Defense Department Information Systems Agency (DISA) and “goes with the office,” per DISA officials speaking to Defense One on background. The phone has limited functionality, opting instead for a locked-down, heavily encrypted user experience. When Boeing filed plans for the Black with the FCC in 2014, the device supported two SIM cards and functionality on GSM, WCDMA and LTE networks, along with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.  According to statements made by DISA chief Lt. General Alan Lynn, the presidential version of the Black "has a large amount of encryption tied to it" and is “close to a VDI,” or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. This means the phone acts more like an extended viewer of another device, displaying the data kept there rather than storing any potentially vulnerable information itself.  Defense One's sources claim that two of the secure devices were in the hands of high-level personnel, then-President Obama and Cyber Command head Admiral Mike Rogers. It's not a stretch to imagine its the device that Obama described as a toy phone in an interview with Jimmy Fallon (jump to the 2:30 mark in the clip). If President Trump is in fact still tweeting from a personal device (as evidence from his timeline and reports seem to corroborate), it's unlikely he has adopted the Boeing Black full time. After all, that type of secure system won't run Twitter — and the president has made it clear he will continue using the platform no matter what, even if he destroys it.   Maybe that's the only way to get Trump on a secure network: If you can find a way to support Twitter, he might just pick it up.

5 Menu Close Data TribTalk Directory Projects Newsletters Events Legislature Donate Pentagon launches review of costs of F-35, largely built in Texas Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Thursday reportedly ordered a review of costs associated with the F-35 fighter plane, a key economic driver in the state of Texas. by Abby LivingstonJan. 27, 2017 12:51 PM   Fort Worth residents posed for photos on Dec. 21, 2016, with a model of the F-35 fighter plane, which is manufactured at a Lockheed Martin plant in the city. Abby Livingston WASHINGTON — Newly installed Secretary of Defense James Mattis ordered on Thursday a review of costs associated the F-35 fighter plane, a key economic driver in Texas.  In a memorandum to a subordinate, Mattis wrote that the F-35 "warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated costs," according to a memo obtained by Defense One News. He further ordered a review to compare the F-35 to another aircraft, the Boeing-manufactured Super Hornet.  The F-35 is vital to the economy of Fort Worth, where a massive Lockheed Martin plant assembles the plane. But it has also long been an incredibly controversial military project.  Budget hawks in recent years have painted the plane as an example of government and defense contracting excess, deriding it a boondoggle with cost and schedule overruns.   The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. But F-35 advocates fiercely defend the plane, calling it a modern marvel of military technology. They argue the F-35 is essential to maintaining American air superiority over Russia and China and that current military planes are aging and a danger to personnel. And comparisons to Boeing's Super Hornet make the F-35 backers bristle.  The directive comes after weeks of drama over the plane emerging from then-President-elect Donald Trump's Twitter account. Since December, he's met with the leaders of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.  Mattis praised the plane during his Senate confirmation hearing, but the memorandum is in line with several of Trump's pronouncements of reining in costs.  The F-35 has enormous political support from Texas. U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, is the committee chairman charged with congressional oversight of the Pentagon. U.S. Rep.

But that tone was in stark contrast to his messaging on Twitter and at a pre-presidential news conference, where he targeted some businesses for attack and embraced others. Trump assailed the pharmaceutical industry at his Jan 11 news conference, saying drug companies “are getting away with murder.” Key drug stocks immediately plummeted. The following day, Trump tweeted that Americans should “Buy L.L. Bean,” after thanking an L.L. Bean board and family member for her political support. With his tweet, he put an iconic Yankee company in the crosshairs of a polarized national discourse. Whether Trump has been testing messages to use as president or launching a regular practice, he has used his own “bully pulpit” to put some businesses on notice and to commend others. This approach is raising questions about what some economists call “crony capitalism” and also about quid-pro-quo politics, and it’s shaking up company executives who might otherwise be optimistic about pledges of economic growth. Seven years ago, the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision freed companies to engage in political spending. The cost of elections keeps surging with the 2016 presidential cycle nearing $7 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2012. Today, how will U.S. companies respond to rising concerns about bullying or favoritism in federal government intervention, and will Trump’s L.L. Bean endorsement provide a greater incentive to engage politically? U.S. corporate leaders from Carrier (HVAC manufacturing) to Boeing (aircraft manufacturing) and Ford (auto manufacturing) have been among those targeted by Trump as he presses his job-growth agenda. On Jan. 11, the nine top pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 by market cap lost a staggering $24.6 billion in 20 minutes during Trump’s press conference, according to one analysis. Trump said the drug companies charge the government too much for medicines. On Jan 12, Trump tweeted about L.L. Bean, which an anti-Trump group called Grab Your Wallet had added to its list of companies targeted for boycotting. An L.L. Bean official quickly reminded inquiring news media that the company makes “no political endorsements or contributions,” despite the fact that board member Linda Bean donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported Trump. A dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system requires a level playing field in which companies focus on how best to compete in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. A number of economists believe crony capitalism brings harmful uncertainty to U.S. companies. And there is academic research suggesting an association between government-induced risk and companies’ increased political donations. How, then, would U.S. companies respond to a new president’s bully pulpit? When he urges millions of Twitter followers to buy a company’s products in the wake of its board member’s political contributions, will business leaders see it as a quid-pro-quo endorsement? Or will they listen instead to the skeptical Trump who boasted on the campaign trail of giving money to politicians to get them to “do whatever the hell you want them to do,” while calling the existing campaign finance system “broken”? These aren’t idle questions, given what we’re seeing in company contributions to the Trump inauguration. According to news reports, Trump-target Boeing pledged $1 million. Chevron, which has a deep stake in the incoming administration’s energy and regulatory policies, gave $500,000. And AT&T, which is seeking to merge with Time Warner, has acknowledged that it contributed. It’s too early to tell what factors the new president and new Congress will take into account in making decisions about businesses. In the meantime, in the interest of promoting economic growth along with their own protection, businesses can take concrete steps to protect themselves, shareholders and our democracy. Being transparent about when they give political money and adopting clear policies for this spending are two of the most significant safeguards companies can adopt at a time when one of Citizens United’s central promises has not been fulfilled. In his Citizens United opinion for the court’s majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy unshackled companies to engage in almost unfettered political spending while asserting that modern technology has the potential to make “disclosures rapid and informative.” The latter promise has not been met. In large part due to Citizens United and other court rulings, the U.S. election cycle in 2016 broke spending records. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups not formally connected to either political party, including organizations not required under U.S. law to disclose their donors. These latter groups’ secretive political funds often are called “dark money.” Because these organizations may keep their donors anonymous, they are particularly attractive to like-thinking corporations and others who want to keep their donations under the radar. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, a powerful business trade association, is allowed under U.S. law to keep the sources of its political spending hidden. It spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races. So-called “social welfare” groups run ads about hot issues, sometimes attacking candidates, and they are also permitted to hide donor identities. All told, political dark money was projected to add up to at least $132 million in 2016. Unfortunately, the promise of broad, effective disclosure that the Supreme Court embraced in Citizens United still seems remote. It is impossible to measure the total largesse of rivers of corporate political giving intended to influence elections. It is possible, however, by looking at disclosed spending, to get a sense of scale of corporate political engagement at another level: in the states, where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups spent $137 million. When companies are transparent about their political contributions, they can protect against payments that might cause a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate, or an ill-considered payment that can damage their reputation. A clear policy on political spending can protect them against public or private pressure from a political candidate, allowing them to cite company policy in order to say “no.” These steps are getting mainstream traction from companies acting on their own. According to a recent nonpartisan report examining the S&P 500, 305 of these companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 had placed some level of restriction on their political spending. It looks like Trump will continue to use his bully pulpit to shame and blame companies, and concerns about crony capitalism will keep growing. If this happens, companies can protect themselves and their integrity by following guidance from Business Roundtable, which encourages company boards to oversee political spending and consider adopting a policy on disclosure. It’s modest advice, but it may help companies in the eye of Trump’s next storm. (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

January 2017 Norwegian will consolidate its position as one of the world’s fastest growing airlines when they use their new Boeing 737 Max. The company told CNN that they will receive the planes in May, 2017. ‘Norwegian will be the first airline to receive delivery of the Boeing (BA) 737 Max, and we will be the first airline to put this brand new aircraft type to use’, said the company in a statement. Norwegian has a total of 100 call options for this aircraft type, referred to as the next generation of short and medium distance flight aircraft. They say it will take some time before the new type is operational. To be first is not necessarily an advantage, since that would also make Norwegian the first to detect any weaknesses in the new model. Norwegian have already experienced that when they began using the Dreamliner aircraft in 2013. Norwegian plan to put 737 Max aircraft in flights on routes between Europe and smaller cities in the United States.   Source: NTB scanpix / Norway Today Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Related SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Next post Related Articles Finance Opportunities for Norwegian oil companies in Iran Finance Norway lacks 1.200 billion pension News The Government will provide the unemployed with more targeted assistance News Afghan asylum seekers are fleeing from Norway Be the first to comment on "Norwegian will be first on the wing with new 737 Max aircraft" Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Why Analysts Are Still Chasing Caterpillar By Paul Ausick January 27, 2017 2:01 pm EST Print Email Tweet Among the 30 DJIA stocks, only The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), up 7.7%) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM), up 7.27%, are having a better 2017 than Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT). And only by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (NYSE: DD) matches Cat’s 6.31% share price rise. Caterpillar beat quarterly and full-year earnings estimates, but came up a bit short on revenues when it reported results on Thursday. The company also lowered its earlier 2017 forecast to account for a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The company now expects full-year revenues of $36 to $39 billion ($37.5 billion at the midpoint of the range) and profit per share of $2.90, excluding restructuring costs of about $500 million. Analysts had forecast 2017 EPS at $3.04 and revenues of $37.99 billion. The revenue miss and the soft forecast has not slowed the bulls, however. The company’s December retail sales, though still down, are rising and infrastructure spending from the Trump administration is judged to herald better sales for the company’s heavy construction equipment. Analysts at Wells Fargo raised the company’s rating from Market Perform to Outperform and maintained its valuation range. Other analysts made similar moves: Baird raised its price target from $94 to $97 with a Neutral rating Barclays raised its price target from $96 to $100 with a rating of Equal Weight Citigroup raised its price target from $98 to $100 with a Neutral rating Deutsche Bank raised its price target from $104 to $108 with a Buy rating RBC raises price target from $82  to $85 Caterpillar traded at $98.51 early Friday afternoon after posting a new 52-week high of $99.46 earlier in the day. The 52-week low is $59.80 and the consensus analyst target price is $90.07.

Mattis asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to conduct a review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to find ways to "significantly reduce" the costs. He said the review should compare the F-35 with the F/A-18 Super Hornet and determine if an upgraded Hornet could be a cost effective alternative that also meets requirements. Mattis also asked for a review of the presidential aircraft program -- known as Air Force One -- to identify cost savings. Boeing is slated to build two new planes to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. The new aircraft would go into service around 2024. Mattis' orders come after Trump's tweets in December revealing that he asked Boeing to "price-out" a comparable Super Hornet became of cost overruns in Lockheed Martin's F-35. The stealthy F-35 has a nearly $400 billion price tag. Three versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy are being built, and other countries, including Israel, are buying the fighter jet. Despite the huge cost, the program has strong bipartisan support in Congress, where lawmakers view the aircraft as essential to U.S. national security. Trump also tweeted last month that the costs of the new Air Force One were "out of control." He demanded: "Cancel order!" Last March, the Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. The Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at about $4 billion, when research and development, construction and future maintenance were included. The Air Force has pressed for a faster replacement schedule, saying the aging current Boeing 747s are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. While Mattis, Trump and the Pentagon can push for deep cuts or even try to cancel the program, Congress controls the government's purse strings and makes final budget decisions.

Mattis Takes Lead on Cost-Containment Effort The review will "determine opportunities" to cut F-35 costs "significantly" while "meeting requirements." While many berate Trump for looking into upgrades of the F/A-18 Super Hornet as a comparable alternative to the fifth-generation F-35, Mattis said that the review will investigate to what extent the Boeing-made Super Hornet can provide certain capabilities at reduced levels of military expenditure. The review will look into potential F/A-18 upgrades as well. © AP Photo/ Paul Beaty Boeing CEO Promises Trump Air Force One Will Be Less Than $4B Lockheed Martin and Boeing shares were both down Friday as of 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time. One official from the General Services Administration, which deals with procurement, told Sputnik News that research and development expenses are always factored into the price of an aircraft. The $100-$135 million price tag generally refers to just the production cost of an F-35, and this is usually what gets reported across media outlets, including here on Sputnik. In 2015, lawmakers authorized approximately $55 billion for research, development, and testing, in addition to $1.1 trillion for operations and maintenance. Lockheed Martin and Trump are "very close to a deal" Sputnik has reported that despite Trump’s claims to personally oversee “beautiful” cost-cutting measures, the price of the F-35 was already slated to drop in 2017. An executive from one of the anti-missile designers, private UK defense firm Chemring Group Plc, remarked that cost reductions were "a given, regardless of Trump," due to economies of scale. Officials leaked that the Pentagon and Lockheed would reach an accord on the tenth order of F-35s by the end of January. In a recent earnings call, Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said "President Trump recognizes the F-35 is a very large program—the largest in the Department of Defense," but promised shareholders and investors that lower F-35 costs would not contribute to "slashing our profit." © Photo: Youtube/arronlee33 China Prepares Secretive H-20 Strategic Stealth Bomber According to Hewson, the Joint Strike Fighter program is a "growth engine" for the defense mammoth. "We continue to see growing international demand for it," she said. Norway Will Ditch Old F-16 Fighting Falcon Fleet For F-35 Arrival Norwegian air squads will decommission a fleet of at least 50 aging F-16 Fighting Falcons to pave way for the arrival of new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Norwegian pilots have been training on F-35s at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona since 2015. This year, the highly-anticipated fifth-generation F-35s will make their debut in Norwegian air space. The Ministry of Defense is hoping that the move to scrap the F-16 squadron will pay off financially and politically. The politics of selling the F-16s to another party may be too complex, and Oslo does not prefer to front expensive maintenance costs to keep the F-16s as a reserve fighting fleet. The F-16 has been touted as the most combat-proven fourth generation fighter by its manufacturers, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. While officials cope with “out of control” costs of the F-35, which Trump hopes to lock-in for less than $100 million per aircraft, it is worth noting that, in the late 1990s, the price of an F-16 hovered between $14-$19 million. Three F-35s will be delivered to Norway this year, prompting the air force to lay the F-16 fleet to rest, Ministry of Defense officials said. Some F-16s will remain in operation until 2021 as more of the 52 F-35As ordered by Oslo make their way across the Atlantic Ocean.  © AP Photo/ Japan Finally Acquires First Beleaguered F-35 Joint Strike Fighter The Kingdom of Norway, instituted in 1905, has engaged in several armed conflicts since World War II. But Oslo has totaled just 10 casualties during these conflicts, all of which occurred during the War in Afghanistan, in which Oslo has supported US and NATO efforts against the Taliban. Oslo also contributed forces when NATO swooped into the Libyan Civil War. ...

(July 8, 2016) - Boeing's KC-46 air refueling tanker resumed testing with assistance from F-16 fighting falcons assigned to the 416th Flight Test Suadron at Edwards Air Force Base. (U.S. Air Force photo by Christopher Okula) Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk January 26, 2017 Boeing’s KC-46 refueling tanker program for the Air Force added a $312 million charge last quarter, bringing the total program cost overrun to $2.3 billion, according to the company’s 2016 final-quarter earnings report. The Chicago-based aerospace giant’s defense unit took a $69 million pre-tax charge for the quarter, while the commercial side retained a $243 million pre-tax charge, the report said.  After deducting the costs in taxes, the additional penalty totals $201 million, Defense News reported.   “We are disappointed with the tanker charge we took in the fourth quarter, but it’s well understood and defined,” CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Wednesday. “I will say that the nature of the risk on the program is clearly changing as expected, and we moved now from the development program into the initial production program,” he said. The Air Force awarded the Boeing a fixed-price $4.9 billion contract in 2011. Boeing is responsible for any cost overruns. The cost stemmed from problems with initial production, Muilenburg said.   “The charge we took in the fourth quarter was around the previously defined configuration changes, the wiring changes that you’ll recall from last year, now implementing those at the detail level in the initial production aircraft,” he said. WATCH: Air Force Looks Back on Six Decades of KC-135 Service “We have some job categories that are just taking longer than planned in terms of hours per job, and that’s what you see in the charge in the quarter. This is not new work,” Muilenburg said.   The program has suffered a handful of setbacks beginning in 2014. Known as the Pegasus, the aircraft experienced wiring issues, developmental and system problems, including a design flaw in the modified 767-based tanker’s refueling boom that came to light in 2016, causing the program to miss a major contract deadline with the Air Force. Still, Muilenburg said he remains hopeful for the program’s future. “We’ve completed all of the boom envelope testing as part of the development program, and we’ve closed out that risk. We’ve got five aircraft in flight test. We’ve completed more than 1,500 hours of flight testing, and we are steadily knocking out test points every day. So while we still have flight testing to go, it’s very clear now that we are not discovering new technical risks. It’s now about getting the first 18 aircrafts delivered,” he said. The Air Force last year awarded a $2.8 billion contract for the first 19 KC-46A. The service announced earlier this month it hopes to move 24 KC-46A tankers to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, and Travis Air Force Base, California, to replace current tanker fleets. Yet without a solid timeline for when the first KC-46 may be delivered, the Pegasus won’t even begin to join the Air Force’s fleet until at least 2019. Boeing plans to build 179 tankers for the service. Previous post About the Author Oriana Pawlyk Oriana Pawlyk is a reporter for Military.com. She can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

Add to My Group(s) View Ratings | Rate It opednews.com Headlined to H2 1/27/17 Senior Editor Become a Fan   (83 fans) - Advertisement - David Swanson (image by David Swanson)   License   DMCA   Details My guest today is blogger, peace activist activist, author, David Swanson. Joan Brunwasser: Welcome back to OpEdNews, David. We last spoke a few weeks before the election. I just read your new piece, Why Impeach Donald Trump? When you posted this, the guy had been in office two days. He clearly isn't widely liked but aren't you jumping the gun a bit? David Swanson: Speaking for myself and not for colleagues or organizations, much less George Soros from whom I've never received a dime ever (though apparently connecting him to some activist campaign serves some people as a refutation of its demands), I'd say we waited much too long. Some impeachable offenses were guaranteed on Day 1, but we didn't have to wait until Day 1 to know that. Under the Constitution, the president is not allowed financial gains or business favors from the U.S., state, or foreign governments. Trump's lease of the Old Post Office Building violates an explicit clause in the General Services Administration lease contract. Since 1980, Trump and his businesses have brought in $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies from New York State. China's state-owned bank is the largest tenant in Trump Tower. It is also a major lender to Trump. These are a few examples of many. Now, days later, Trump has discriminated against Muslims in a new way with his ban on immigration from certain countries. And he's carried on the outrages of his predecessors with drone murders, bombing campaigns, and occupations. He's even apparently threatened to send troops into Chicago. So, I think the impeachable offenses are beginning to pile up. Chicago skyline (image by romanboed)   License   DMCA   Details - Advertisement - JB: Send troops into Chicago? I live in suburban Chicago. What did we do to deserve troops? DS: @RealDonaldTrump tweeted and @POTUS retweeted: "If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!" I tried hoping this meant lawyers, but everyone I asked assumed it meant soldiers. In addition Trump has announced an executive order to "target sanctuary cities" with Chicago chief among them. The details are unknown. He gets the corporate news coverage first, then tells you what the hell it actually is after. By the way, in Chicago you should do this peace essay. And sign this petition: Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago Must Divest from Weapons Dealers. - Advertisement - JB: Thanks for the suggestions and the links. Well, in all fairness, Trump is not wrong that the constant shootings are appalling. It would be nice if he came up with something real and substantial and potentially constructive. Are we going to turn the poor areas into policed camps? Yikes! Back to the impeachment argument. Why Trump? Is he a target because he's so disliked? Is he worse than others before him? JB: I can't speak for all supporters of impeaching Trump. Most of them will have bad reasons, as most people have bad reasons for everything. Personally, I favor impeaching him for many of the same offenses, as noted above, for which I favored impeaching Obama and Bush. But the charges brought at http://ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.orgare unprecedented. His predecessors could not have been impeached for the same thing. Is his offense morally worse than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton taking Saudi government and Boeing funds into her family foundation, and then working to waive legal restrictions on Boeing selling weapons to Saudi Arabia -- weapons now being used to slaughter innocents? I don't think so. But it's in the same league and likely to be at least as deadly. Still, for everyone asking me if Trump's worse than those before him, there are 10,000 shouting at me that he's better than the guy who would come after him -- which, as with Cheney, misses the problem that Pence is already involved and seeing his agenda acted on. But the question of who is worse, Trump or Pence, is a very different question from this one: Who is worse, President Trump in an era of total unchecked power and immunity, or President Pence in an age of popular sovereignty with the threat of impeachment looming behind every high-crime-and-misdemeanor that comes up for consideration by the White House? I believe changing the office of the presidency into one that can be lost for substantive crimes and abuses -- a radical change from its current state -- would be more significant than the personality, ideology, or party of the presidents who come next. I believe part of that significance would derive from the benefits of building the movement that imposes impeachment on a corrupt and partisan and reluctant Congress. Cultural change comes principally from movement building, and very little from the personalities of elected officials. If Chicago, for example, passes a resolution demanding Trump's impeachment, it will be because a lot of people learned what was wrong and how to fix it. They won't forget that the moment Pence or someone else swears to uphold the Constitution as president. Donald Trump's current address (image by ThatMattWade)   License   DMCA   Details JB: Let's talk pragmatically. How does one go about impeaching a president? And, politically speaking, with the Republicans holding both houses of Congress, how likely is it? They're on a power trip of their own. DS: Not too many days ago people told us asking for clemency for Chelsea Manning was pointless. Nothing looks possible until after it's done. But no past impeachment has been strictly partisan, though the nonsense impeachment of Bill Clinton (who should have been impeached for legitimate reasons) came close. And even in today's world of Absolute Partisanship there hasn't been a Republican that the Republicans would be more willing to impeach than Trump. But if they think what follows will be corporate power and a docile public, they'll be as wrong as were all the Democrats and all the television networks who thought promoting Trump as a candidate would be a really clever way to elect a really unpopular former Secretary of State. Activism is not prediction. Making predictions and making demands are at odds with each other. I'm only involved in making demands here. And if we succeed, everyone will say it was inevitable, so having made predictions won't be worth much anyway. our nation's capital (image by szeke)   License   DMCA   Details JB: You make an excellent point. Social change only looks inevitable when we look back in time. Let's say that I agree with you. How to proceed? What's the next step? Sign the petition: http://ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org Read my FAQ: http://firedonaldtrump.org Share widely. Take flyers to events. Contact your Congress member. Ask your town or city to pass a resolution. Ask your organizations to support. Women's March on Washington DC (image by Mobilus In Mobili)   License   DMCA   Details JB: There were massive marches across the nation and worldwide the day after Inauguration Day. The turnouts everywhere were unprecedented, the largest we've ever seen in this country. What, if anything, does that add to the mix? DS: Well, it shows opposition to Trump and to certain of his policies. It's also full of flaws, failure to support the few good things he does, failure to oppose some of the worst things, and way too much support for the Democratic Party. But on the whole it is a very good sign, as is resistance within the EPA, the National Park Service, and various city governments. We just need to use this opposition wisely, including promoting a positive vision of where we want to be. JB: How would the marches "support the few good things he does, failure to oppose some of the worst things"? How do marches pinpoint like that? And should they? Also, how did the marches demonstrate too much support for the Democratic Party? You lost me there, David. DS: Speakers at the marches called him names, insulted his appearance, threatened violence, cheered for Democrats. Speakers included Debbie Wasserman Schultz who did more than anyone else to nominate the only Democrat who could have lost to Trump. This is a crowd much of which proclaims that ending the TPP had nothing to do with Trump, rather than encouraging him to do the same to NAFTA, but announces that restarting the DAPL and Keystone XL was entirely Trump with zero role by the previous president who left the door open. Many of these people want every anti-Russia/anti-Trump claim produced by the CIA taken on faith even as it undermines the idea of fact-based politics and even as it stirs up dangerous hostility between the US and Russian governments. Torture prisons? The CIA is never wrong. Trump is never right. But they both want 'em. Aaaaarggh! What to think? Better ask the Democrats! No. What we need is principled, policy-based activism that ignores party and personality and insist s on facts and accountability across the board, crediting the worst people when they do right and condemning the best when they do wrong. JB: Got it. By the way, I wasn't referring to the speakers at the marches. For the most part, no one could hear them anyway. I'm talking about the energy of the millions who came out not because they're DNC or Washington apparatchniks. Anything you'd like to add before we wrap this up? Imagine a movement to hold the U.S. government to account in the absence of the impeachment provision in the Constitution. Then imagine that one day we were granted the magical power to insert impeachment into history and into U.S. law. Wouldn't we jump at it? JB: What a tantalizing question! I enjoyed talking with you, David. You always make me stretch. Thank you. *** FireDonaldTrump.org David says: If I've persuaded you, or if you already agreed, please sign this petition .

Common take on the word "impeach" is about removing an official, but it's not. Trump could stay for years unless Removed From Office for cause...multiple causes actually. Linguistically related....not a day goes by without Trump being called "commander in chief" or preposterously even "OUR Commander in Chief". Wrong. A president is only commander in chief of most, not even all, of the military. And, god forbid anyone point out that there is no such country called "America"...except colloquially, as a nickname for The United States OF America.....that "America" referring to the whole continental mass from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego. Words are important.

President Donald Trump. (Flickr / Gage Skidmore) President Trump on Friday announced plans to create a council of business leaders as part of a new “Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Tesla head Elon Musk and General Electric’s Jeff Immelt will join 25 other executives and labor leaders on the group. One series of meetings has already taken place, The White House said. The initiative focuses on “how to best promote job growth and get Americans back to work again,” according to the White House statement. On Wednesday’s earning call, Boeing’s Muilenburg said he was encouraged by Trump’s engagement with business executives and that he’s had excellent conversations with the President. “I give a lot of credit here to reaching out and directly engaging,” Muilenburg said. “President Trump has to have business leaders at the table. He is listening. He is engaging and making decisions that will help us grow the economy and ultimately grow U.S. manufacturing jobs. So, I’m encouraged by that dialogue, and I think having direct, open dialogue is productive and very good for the future.” Seattle business leaders are noticeably absent from initiative. Earlier this month, Amazon announced it would create 100,000 new full-time jobs in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the announcement came after Trump met with several tech executives and “urged them to keep their jobs and production in the United States.” Much of Trump’s campaign focused on keeping and jobs in the United States, and, while the council will focus mainly on job growth, the White House said the agendas will likely change session to session.

NASA unveiled a new spacesuit this week. It was designed by Boeing for use on its Starliner spacecraft, which astronauts will use on missions to and from the International Space Station. Here’s a video showing it off: It’s been met with general interest and approval across the internet, though some have raised questions about where Boeing got the inspiration. A classic sci-fi movie perhaps? Looks as if @Boeing tapped ACC (or maybe SK) as design consultants for it’s new spacesuit. #space #nasa #science #exploration #2001 #kubrick pic.twitter.com/Jy7lF9nLzP — Roger (@RTAlderson) January 27, 2017 For those in need of a little culture, the image on the right is a blue version of the spacesuits in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 movie, “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Or maybe they drew their inspiration from something more whimsical? Something about @NASA‘a new spacesuit design … looks kind of familiar. https://t.co/0ue0dTSKxA #SPACESHIP pic.twitter.com/9zZquJ365i — Gray (@gray) January 26, 2017 Topics: All News Boeing FedFeed International Space Station NASA Leave A Comment Home » FedFeed » #FedFeed - NASA unveils… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS Fed Photo of the Day Photos of the amazing, moving, important and amusing things happening in the federal community.

Jan. 27 (UPI) -- South Korea has finished deploying new Apache helicopters. The Boeing AH-64E, which features digital cockpit avionics and powerful engines, would be used to target incoming North Korea military tanks. A South Korean military official said on Friday all 36 new helicopters were acquired in early January, deployed and are ready for combat operations, Yonhap news agency reported on Friday. "These helicopters were organized into two battalions of the Army Air Operations Command," the official said. The helicopters would contribute to defending South Korea in the case of an attack. North Korea is believed to retain more than 1,000 tanks, including the Songun-915 and the Pokpungho, also known as the M-2002. The Apache helicopters can be deployed quickly to critical areas of South Korea, including the Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong Islands on the western coast of the peninsula, near the North Korea maritime border. There are now a total of 84 Apache helicopters operating on the Korean peninsula, including 48 helicopters under the supervision of U.S. Forces Korea. The AH-64E can exercise a powerful blocking effect against North Korea armored units and incoming air-cushion vehicles. The helicopter has a maximum speed of 145 knots and has been rated as the highest-performance attack helicopter. The Apache can carry up to 16 Hellfire laser designated missiles and can be equipped with up to 4 Stinger air-to-air missiles.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 167.70 -1.42 -0.84% Southwest Airlines Co LUV ▼ 52.70 -1.22 -2.26% Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA NWARF ▲ 33.25 +1.25 +3.89% But Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier across the Atlantic, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. Norwegian will receive the first Max 8 in May, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said Thursday, with flights starting as early as June. Southwest made its bones as the low-cost carrier that famously flies only one airplane family. As Boeing’s largest customer for the 737, it’s been involved in the redesign, which included outfitting the workhorse with a more powerful engine. In 2011, the Dallas-based airline placed the first order for the 737 Max, followed by Norwegian and Indonesia’s Lion Air. Yesterday, Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said his airline will get the first of its 200 737 Max’s by July—two months earlier than expected, but two months after Norwegian.  The Max’s sprightly release clip has prompted delivery questions for both Southwest and Boeing, given that an aircraft’s launch customer typically gets—and flies—the new plane first. This sort of arrangement has been upended before, when Airbus A320neo, destined first for Qatar Airways Ltd., didn’t arrive as planned. Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker last year balked over glitches in the A320neo’s engine software and refused to take the first plane, which went instead to Lufthansa. There’s more to being a launch customer than bragging rights—although that's a large part of the appeal of being the first to market with a shiny new jet. Aircraft makers also promise that their newest models boast lower fuel and maintenance costs than prior airplanes, providing an immediate bottom-line boost to airlines. “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery,” Southwest CEO Kelly said of the Max. His chief operating officer, Mike Van De Ven, said Thursday that “we’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it's operating as everyone intended.” Boeing’s Max development is on-budget and ahead of schedule. All this good news, as far as production is concerned, is a rarity in an industry renowned for being late to everything. Southwest plans to put its first Max into service later this year, once it retires its 87 remaining 737-300 Classics, the oldest planes in the fleet. And this is the sticking point: Southwest must first retire those old planes before it can accommodate new ones, a conundrum that traces back to pilot training issues. About 10 of Southwest’s 737 Max planes will be finished by the time the carrier is ready to begin flights in October, Van de Ven has said. The carrier is in talks with Boeing about what to do with those planes between July and October, because several are now parked at the periphery of Boeing’s 737 factory in Renton, Wash. Norwegian, meanwhile, plans to take delivery of a half-dozen new 737 Max this year and then deploy them for trans-Atlantic service, though it hasn’t revealed which routes or a time frame. The European carrier has been focused on smaller airports in the Northeast U.S., bypassing the large metropolitan hubs. —With Julie Johnsson in Chicago.

While the stock looks constructive through an intermediate-term lens, it now has to prove whether the recent multi-month gains are here to stay. This week on Jan. 25, Boeing reported its latest financial results; the company came in with earnings-per-share of $2.47, beating analyst estimates of $2.34. Investors liked the news and outlook, and BA stock followed with a technically sound move higher. But the warnings signs I am starting to see in Boeing stock, at least for the near-term, have to do with the rate of change of the stock’s incline, which looks unsustainable through a multi-week/month lens. In discussions with institutional investors this week, much focus was around the ‘honeymoon’ phase that the stock market still seems to be in with the new Trump administration. While I do think there is much hope from a growth perspective around the plans from President Trump, as always, it comes back to a question on timing, or time frame. The first two weeks of the new President have been filled with signing bills and putting plenty of changes in motion. Soon, however, the focus could begin to shift to a focus on ‘execution’ of these changes, which is where stocks may see a hiccup, i.e., a cause for a pause in the rally. BA Stock Charts Looking at BA stock through a multi-year lens we see that the longer-term up-trend remains well intact and that the yellow-50 week and blue-100 week moving averages over the past couple of months have once again begun to curl higher after a 12-month hiatus. Click to Enlarge This simply mirrors a renewed leg higher in price, but it also gives investors better technical parameters to risk manage their positions by. This week’s rally in Boeing stock has pushed it cleanly past its previous all-time highs from 2015, causing the weekly MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart to reach overbought readings last seen at the 2015 highs.

The DJIA is trading over 20,000 points for the first time, the latest milestone in a record-setting drive for the stock market. The market has been marching steadily higher since bottoming out in March 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. The Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time Wednesday, the latest milestone in a record-setting drive for the stock market. The other major U.S. stock indexes were also moving higher in morning trading, led by banks and other financial companies. Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies drove the rally, extending gains from the day before. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow gained 162 points, or 0.8 percent, to 20,075 as of 11:04 a.m. Eastern Time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,296. The Nasdaq composite index added 47 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,648. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each closed at record highs on Tuesday. DOW MILESTONE: The market has been marching steadily higher since bottoming out in March 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The rally continued after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last fall. The Dow first closed above 10,000 on March 29, 1999. Most professional investors are skeptical the Dow at 20,000 will have much effect. They more often look to the S&P 500 index as a benchmark, because they consider it better representation of the broad market. THE QUOTE: “In and of itself, it is just a number,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But what it does is it lifts market expectations, in essence, to continue moving higher.” FLYING HIGH: Boeing rose 4.1 percent after the aircraft manufacturer beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow, rising $6.63 to $167.18. REMEMBER THIS: Seagate jumped 20.8 percent after the data storage company posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that exceeded financial analysts' forecasts. The stock was up the most among companies in the S&P 500, adding $7.78 to $45.22. STRONG RESULTS: Rockwell Automation climbed 7.5 percent after the company reported strong quarterly earnings. The stock picked up $10.60 to $152.63. SOLID QUARTER: Logitech vaulted 15.1 percent after the computer gaming and accessories maker's latest earnings beat Wall Street's expectations. Its shares added $3.80 to $28.90. ROUGH ROAD: Textron slumped 9.9 percent after the defense contractor's fourth-quarter revenue missed financial analysts' estimates. The company also announced it is buying snowmobile maker Arctic Cat in a deal valued at about $247 million. Textron was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $4.89 to $44.50. FALLING SHORT: Mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell 4.3 percent after it served up quarterly results that missed analysts' forecasts. The stock slid 74 cents to $16.28. MARKETS OVERSEAS: In Europe, Germany's DAX was up 1.8 percent, while the CAC-40 in France was 1.2 percent higher. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.4 percent. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent after Japan's government said that the nation had a trade surplus in 2016, its first in six years. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.1 percent. ENERGY: Oil prices were little changed. Benchmark U.S. crude was essentially unchanged from the day before at $53.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $55.33 a barrel in London. TREASURY YIELDS: Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.50 percent from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 113.62 yen from 113.89 on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0736 from $1.0723.

January 27th 2017 a day ago /video/video.news.com.au/Business/ Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Picture: Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP Frank Chungnews.com.au@franks_chung Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend OPTIMISM about the business-friendly policies of Donald Trump has boosted US stocks to record highs, but experts warn there could be a “nasty pullback” on the way. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, soared past 20,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday, largely off the back of Goldman Sachs, Boeing and IBM. The stock market rally since Trump pulled off his shock election win in November has defied economists’ pre-election predictions of five, 10 or even 15 per cent falls in US and global markets. source: tradingeconomics.com US stocks have instead risen around 8 per cent, and the Dow Jones more than 10 per cent, with Trump’s policies — which include personal and company tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation — spurring investor confidence. “What keeps this rally and widens it is continuous signals that the Trump administration is moving on deregulation, on tax reform and on infrastructure. And that is the fuel for the rally — it has been and will continue to be,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, told Fox News. AMP Capital chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said while the Dow hitting 20,000 “may generate a bit of excitement”, it was “just an arbitrary round number”. “Good earnings, breadth and growth indicators are more important,” he tweeted. Speaking to Sky News, Dr Oliver said while many people “take fright” at Trump, investors weren’t. “He’s talking about lower taxes, he’s talking about deregulation — he’s approving the Keystone XL pipeline, that means jobs — those sorts of things have a sort of Reagan-esque element to them, supply-side economics,” Dr Oliver said. “[But] a lot of people say everything is Donald, and that’s why we’ve seen this rally. But if you look right around the world, business conditions have improved. The PMIs, purchasing managers indicators [which indicate] business confidence, in Europe they’re running around five-and-a-half, six-year highs.” Wall Street was fairly flat on Thursday but the Dow Jones held above the historic 20,000 mark for the second day. The broader S&P 500 index shed 0.1 per cent, while the tech-focused Nasdaq also fell slightly. “The market is probably taking a breather after yesterday,” Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates, told AFP. Early fourth-quarter US corporate earnings have boosted sentiment and are expected to show growth of seven per cent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. “If all the economic data is good, if the earnings are good and the market doesn’t really seem to think anything [Trump] says or does is negative, I don’t see any downside,” Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, told Reuters. But while the VIX Index, also known as the “fear index”, has fallen to its lowest level in two-and-a-half years, one top Wall Street strategist is warning of a looming pullback of between 4 to 7 per cent. Tony Dwyer, senior managing director and chief market strategist at Canaccord Genuity, said heightened investor optimism, record low levels of implied volatility and a high percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above their moving averages should sound warning bells. “So it’s kind of a combination of all these things that creates an environment that’s ripe for just kind of a nasty little pullback,” Dwyer told CNBC. “It’s just a market that’s ripe for an out-of-nowhere kind of news item that talking heads like me can’t predict.” Financial commentator Peter Switzer argues that the “Trump phenomenon has been built on ‘expect the unexpected’, so despite US stocks being up 8 per cent and the Dow up over 10 per cent, this rally could easily surprise to go higher”. “[But my] educated guess is that a sell off is very possible in February or March,” he wrote. “However, as long as economic and company profit readings are positive, which I expect, and Donald Trump makes policy decisions that are better than his tweets, then any market sell off will be a good time to buy stocks.” HOW DID THE DOW GET TO 20,000? Associated Press Dow 20,000 wasn’t exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They’re so optimistic that they’re buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalisingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it’s trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $US200 to $US201, or one half of one per cent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $US30 to $US31, which would boost that company’s stock price by more than three per cent. Other indexes like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since November 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Scoot Pte., a unit of Singapore Airlines Ltd. that flies medium-haul routes, has had to pull some of its Dreamliners from flying while it carries out additional checks on engines. Scoot didn't specify the exact nature of the engine problem or how many of its dozen jets were affected. In the meantime, Singapore Airlines will operate a daily return flight to Sydney for Scoot from Feb. 1 to Feb. 13 using a Boeing 777-200 as Scoot faces "tighter than usual" aircraft utilization during the Lunar New Year holiday period, according to a Scoot spokeswoman. Scoot said it has informed its customers about the change. "Scoot has an ongoing engine maintenance and check program in place with Rolls-Royce to proactively monitor the condition and technical reliability of our fleet," the company spokeswoman said. Boeing said it was aware of the engine issues but would refer queries to the airline. Rolls-Royce declined to comment on an "individual customer's operations and engine maintenance programs." Dreamliners started commercial flights at the end of 2011. The planes have been plagued by problems such as battery fires in 2013. All Nippon Airways discovered problems with turbine blades in its Dreamliner Rolls-Royce engines last year. ANA said blades in the engines were cracking because of what Rolls-Royce determined was premature corrosion. Rolls-Royce vies with General Electric Co. GE, -1.02% for engine orders on Dreamliner planes.

Wednesday, Boeing Co. on Wednesday reported a fourth-quarter net income of $1.63 billion. DALLAS (AP) — Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. On a call with analysts and reporters, Boeing executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump’s tweets and comments last month about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Boeing and European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitability among major world airlines, and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Both big plane makers have order backlogs that will last for years. However, they are likely to face more competition in the next few years for sales of their workhorse models, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Canada’s Bombardier and Russia and China are in various stages of delivering similar-sized, single-aisle jetliners. Boeing will counter by delivering the first of a new, upgraded 737 in a few months. And Boeing’s government business could come under increasing cost pressure. Boeing predicted that 2017 revenue from its defense and space business could fall by up to 5 percent, including a drop in sales of military jets, which the company blamed on the timing of some aircraft deliveries. Boeing took another write-down on a key tanker program that has been plagued by design issues. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Pentagon and congressional support for Boeing’s key defense programs remains solid. Boeing said Wednesday that net income in the fourth quarter was $1.63 billion, up 59 percent from a year earlier. Excluding certain pension expenses, the company said it earned $2.47 per share from its core businesses. Revenue fell 1 percent to $23.29 billion. Copyright 2017 Associated Press.

MONEY The Dow Hits 20,000 for the First Time Ever Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies bolstered the Dow Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are also on track to set record highs. Alex Veiga, Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time Wednesday, the latest milestone in a record-setting drive for the stock market. Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies helped push the Dow past the threshold early on. U.S. stocks closed solidly higher, lifting the Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs of their own for the second day in a row. Banks and other financial companies led the gainers, which included technology and industrials. Real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks lagged the broader market as bond yields rose. "It's a psychological event to get through that big hurdle, that big round number," said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It's really symbolic of what's going on with investor sentiment becoming much more positive, and that's going to drive stock prices higher." The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, gained 155.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 20,068.51. The S&P 500 index rose 18.30 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,298.37. The Nasdaq added 55.38 points, or 1 percent, to 5,656.34. Small-company stocks also rose. The Russell 2000 picked up 13.23 points, or 1 percent, to 1,382.44. The market has been marching steadily higher since bottoming out in March 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The rally continued after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last fall. The Dow first closed above 10,000 on March 29, 1999. Wednesday's rally came against a backdrop of optimism on Wall Street that executive actions and policy goals announced by the Trump administration this week on trade, manufacturing and business deregulation will be good for corporate America. "Whether it's tax reform or infrastructure spending, any of those tend to be optimistic conversations for the markets currently," said Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "We have to wait and see how they play out, obviously. The danger here, if there is one, is that the market gets ahead of itself a little bit." Most professional investors are skeptical the Dow at 20,000 will have much effect on the market. They more often look to the S&P 500 index as a benchmark, because they consider it better representation of the broad market. "In and of itself, it is just a number," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "But what it does is it lifts market expectations, in essence, to continue moving higher." If the Dow reaching 20,000 has any impact, it will likely be a psychological one. Investors have been leery of the stock market for years, unable to stomach the prospect of losing more than 50 percent of their money for a second time if another financial crisis hits. That trepidation has caused them to pull money out of stock funds -; even as the Dow made its march toward 20,000 -; and depend instead on safer bond investments. Last year, investors pulled a net $27.1 billion out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar. A year earlier, they yanked $66.5 billion. Over the same time, investors plugged a total of $218.6 billion into taxable bond funds. Anyone who resisted the urge to dump their stock investments through all the tumult of the last decade is now seeing the full benefit of a market with the Dow at 20,000. A $10,000 investment in the largest U.S. stock mutual fund made a decade ago, before the Great Recession began, would have dropped below $5,000 by March 2009. But investors who held on even through the worries of another recession hitting, U.S. debt downgrade, the euro crisis and uncertainties over Britain's departure from the European Union would now be sitting on nearly $20,000. This is expected to be the busiest week for corporate earnings news, with about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 reporting quarterly results. Several companies rose on results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Boeing was the biggest gainer in the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer climbed $6.81, or 4.2 percent, to $167.36. Seagate's latest quarterly snapshot drove its shares 14 percent higher, to lead all other companies in the S&P 500. The stock added $5.23 to $42.67. Investors also bid up shares in Rockwell Automation, which rose $10.98, or 7.7 percent, to $153.01, and Logitech, which vaulted 15.5 percent. The computer gaming and accessories maker's shares added $3.90 to $29. Some companies posted earnings that failed to impress investors. Textron slumped 5.4 percent after the defense contractor's fourth-quarter revenue missed financial analysts' estimates. The company also announced it is buying snowmobile maker Arctic Cat in a deal valued at about $247 million. Textron was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $2.65 to $46.73. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell 3.1 percent after it served up quarterly results that missed analysts' forecasts. The stock slid 52 cents to $16.50. Major stock indexes in Europe moved higher. Germany's DAX rose 1.8 percent, while the CAC-40 in France gained 1 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent after Japan's government said that the nation had a trade surplus in 2016, its first in six years. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.1 percent. Energy prices mostly declined. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 43 cents to $52.75 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid 36 cents at $55.08 a barrel in London. Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.52 percent from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 113.60 yen from 113.89 on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0743 from $1.0723. Among metals, the price of gold slid $13, or 1.1 percent, to $1,197.80 an ounce. Silver fell 21 cents to $16.98 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.71 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.52 a gallon, while heating oil slid 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.33 per 1,000 cubic feet. --AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed to this report. Published on: Jan 25, 2017 Advertisement

Since cofounding EKOS 20 years ago, I have worked with great companies including Alaska Airlines, Boeing, Coca Cola and REI on helping to develop their first and early Sustainability Reports. The first generation of sustainability metrics was provided mostly by voluntary self-reported data designed primarily for Wall Street Socially Responsible Investors, employees and stakeholders. Now, a second generation of more rigorously defined metrics is being developed by both government-related and non-governmental organizations.  How can we transition our companies towards a disclosure landscape that is less confusing, more consistent, and more empowering? How can we greatly expand the coverage of companies that disclose? Download the Sustainable Brands New Metrics full presentation to learn more. Cynthia Figge is a forerunner and thought leader in the corporate sustainability movement who co-founded EKOS International in 1996, one of the first consultancies integrating sustainability and corporate strategy. Cynthia is COO and Cofounder of CSRHub. Cynthia has worked with major organizations including BNSF, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Dow Jones, and REI to help craft sustainability strategy integrated with business. She was an Officer of LIN Broadcasting/McCaw Cellular leading new services development, and started a new “Greenfield” mill with Weyerhaeuser. She serves as Advisor to media and technology companies, and served as President of the Board of Sustainable Seattle. Cynthia has an MBA from Harvard Business School.

(AP) Comments Share Tweet Share Share After President Donald Trump announced his 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, industry experts started checking whose pocket books are about to feel lighter. Aerospace was one such industry to react to news of the Mexico tax, and Boeing was at the center of the discussion. Related: Trump trade war among top concerns of economists, Washington Aviation reporter Stephen Trimble quickly went to Twitter and noted the Mexican aerospace industry exported $7.6 billion worth of goods last year. About 90 percent of that went to the United States. Trump’s 20 percent tariff would “cost US aero industry about $1.38 billion,” Trimble wrote. CNN’s aviation editor Jon Ostrower soon followed up. According to Ostrower, “Every single wire on a 787 Dreamliner comes from a Mexican factory.” Those wires contribute a lot to the jets. According to Boeing: On an airplane, the electrical system produces, controls and distributes power to all the other systems that need it — flight deck displays, flight controls, in-flight entertainment and more. It’s much like the electrical system in your house, which carries electricity throughout the rooms to power your lights, television and so forth. Beyond that, airplanes produce their own energy, so there’s wiring and electrical systems for that as well. Overall, the Dreamliner is composed of about 2.3 million parts. A majority of parts come from suppliers in the United States, but Boeing sources about 30 percent of parts come from foreign sources. The Mexico tax and Washington Many news reports are noting that the Mexico tax will essentially be paid for by American consumers. But when it comes to countries importing goods locally to Washington state, Mexico is eighth on the list. Side note: Canada is no. 1, and China is no. 2. The total value of imported goods from Mexico has dramatically spiked in recent years. In 2012, Washington state imported about $556 million from south of the border. In 2015, that figure was about $1.3 billion. Concerns over Mexico-Washington trade go beyond what enters the United States. There is a concern that if the US imposes a Mexico tax on imports, Mexico may do the same to American businesses. Washington state exported about $1.9 billion worth of goods to Mexico in 2015.

A navy blue Air Force One jacket was draped over the back of his chair, the Associated Press reported. Asked for his impressions, Trump said Air Force One was special for a lot of reasons. Last month, Trump had complained about the cost of a replacement fleet of Air Force Ones, now in Boeing’s design phase. Trump tweeted “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” That led to a meeting between Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and Trump at Trump Tower. During Boeing’s earnings call Wednesday, Muilenburg said he welcomed Trump’s comments. “We had some targeted discussions, well-publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg said. “I think those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we’re providing best capability … at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers. We’re exactly on the same page there.” If you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device click here. var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); Tags:  Photo Galleries Trump Administration Bay Area News Group Subscribe Today!

Last month, Trump had complained about the cost of a replacement fleet of Air Force Ones, now in Boeing’s design phase. Trump tweeted “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” That led to a meeting between Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and Trump at Trump Tower. During Boeing’s earnings call Wednesday, Muilenburg said he welcomed Trump’s comments. “We had some targeted discussions, well-publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg said. “I think those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we’re providing best capability … at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney American Airlines eliminating in-seat screens on new jets by Jon Ostrower   @jonostrower January 25, 2017: 3:23 PM ET Delta has healthier food. But does it taste good? American Airlines says it dropping seat-back screens from its in-flight entertainment on its 100 new Boeing 737 Max jets because most passengers carry their own screens. In a statement Tuesday, American Airlines (AAL) said 90% of its passengers bring their own devices aboard. American contends that smartphones, tablets or laptops do a better job than the airline's individual screens. The new single aisle 737 Max will debut on American Airlines routes later in 2017. As the new planes start arriving, the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is adding satellite-based high-speed internet connectivity to its planes from Gogo (GOGO) and Via Sat (VSAT), a major upgrade from its existing sluggish air-to-ground cellular network. The broadband connection will enable video streaming from services like Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30). "It makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years," the company said in a statement. Related: American introduces basic economy fare United Airlines (UAL) is also skipping the screens on its single-aisle jets in favor of a wi-fi connection. While American will charge for streaming and internet surfing, it will move its live TV channels and stored TV episode and movie libraries from the seat back screen to an on-board streaming server to access much of the same content to your device. American uses the workhorse 737 on routes all over the U.S. The 737 Max promises 14% better fuel efficiency over Boeing's jets today and removing the screens, wiring and power boxes from around 160 seats means less weight and lower fuel consumption. American plans to keep the screens on its current-generation 737s which are still streaming out of Boeing's factory and the Airbus A321s it uses on the competitive routes connecting New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The airline will also keep the screens for its twin-aisle Boeing 777s, 787s, Airbus A330s, and A350s, its biggest and longest-range airplanes that operate the vast majority of its international flights. Related: Top exec out at American Airlines is new president at United The move by American is the latest in the ascent of high-speed internet as an on-board amenity as airlines race to duplicate the living room experience in the sky. JetBlue Airways (JBLU) said earlier this month its entire fleet was outfitted for free high-speed internet access for flights over the continental U.S., and Alaska Airlines (ALK) said it now offers free access to its wi-fi for Apple iMessage, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users. Delta Air Lines (DAL), too, is adding high-speed internet connections on board, but has kept its seat back screens on its new deliveries of single-aisle aircraft like its 737 and Airbus A321s and other aircraft that fly longer domestic routes.

Three stocks led rally Think financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing and consulting company IBM. By MARLEY JAYAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — Dow 20,000 wasn’t exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. A screen at a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is juxtaposed with the Goldman Sachs booth. The Dow climbed to the 20,000 mark because of three stocks. Associated Press/Richard Drew Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They’re so optimistic that they’re buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it’s trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company’s stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: While a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Boeing developed the Starliner spacesuit for use aboard the company’s CST-100 spacecraft, NASA’s eagerly awaited replacement for the Space Shuttle. It was officially unveiled at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday. The full suit weighs about 20 pounds (about 9 kilograms), some 10 pounds lighter than the suits worn by the shuttle crews. Its material allows water vapor to pass through but retains air, making the suits cooler and more comfortable. Materials used for the elbows and knees allow for a wider range of movement, while astronauts can adapt the shape of the spacesuit when seated or standing by using “strategically located” zippers, NASA said. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Four current NASA astronauts – Boe, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams – have been training with the new suit, which also features gloves that allow the wearer to interface with touchscreen displays and controls inside the CST-100. “I was essentially the model for this as they built the suit around me,” said former astronaut Chris Ferguson, who commanded the final Space Shuttle mission in 2011 and now works for Boeing as the director of crew and missions systems. © NASA Visually, the outfit is strikingly similar to spacesuits featured in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the 1968 science fiction film by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. The CST-100 was designed to carry up to seven passengers into low-Earth orbit, and be reusable up to 10 times with a six-month turnaround, according to Boeing. NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract for the Starliner in 2014, as part of its Commercial Crew Transportation Capability program. The spacecraft is scheduled for unmanned testing in June 2018, with a crewed test following in August. If all goes well, the CST-100 will deliver two astronauts to the International Space Station in December 2018. Currently the only spaceship capable of transporting crew to the ISS is the Soyuz, a modernized Soviet design operated by the Russian space agency Roscosmos. In addition to Boeing’s CST-100, NASA is hoping to use SpaceX’s Dragon 2 ship, due for a crewed orbital test in May 2018.

It’s not clear if her office will allow the search of the presidential Blue House. If her impeachment is upheld, she will become the first democratically elected leader to be removed from office in South Korea. Park, 64, is still protected from prosecution as she remains in office although she has been stripped of power. Boeing 2016 net profit down 5%; revenue to decline again in 2017 For the quarter, the aerospace company posted adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.47 on revenues of $23.29 billion. Reilly Financial Advisors LLC increased its stake in shares of Boeing Company (The) by 22.9% in the third quarter. Millions of people took to the streets of Seoul and other cities late a year ago to protest against corruption and also what they say was poor leadership during the sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014, which left more than 300 dead or missing.MS Choi has also been alleged for making corruption and gaining favors from country’s big firms including electronics giant Samsung. “Do you think she should be treated well while being investigated?” the woman shouted.”Not unless she wants to reveal something in favor of her criminal trials, it is most likely that she will keep her mouth shut or refuse to answer during the interrogation”, a lawyer with knowledge of the state probe told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity because the case is still on going. Jose Mourinho talks up Man Utd prospect Axel Tuanzebe United could play as many as 32 more matches, excluding replays, this season given their involvement in four competitions, including the Europa League. The interview marks a fightback by Ms Park, daughter of the late dictator Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated in 1979, and his wife Yook Young-soo, who was assassinated in 1974.The list had almost 10,000 people on it, including Park Chan-wook, director of the well known mystery thriller Oldboy.Ms Park denies involvement in the blacklist. The independent counsel looking into an influence-peddling scandal revolving around the president and Choi executed an arrest warrant issued against Choi, who is at the center of the scandal. Cavs not interested in Kevin Love-for-Carmelo Anthony swap, sources say Team president Phil Jackson already has been credited with helping turn the Cavaliers into a championship team by dealing J.R. I’m in a different situation than him. “I don’t think I’m the only playmaker in the National Basketball Association “. The political turmoil that erupted in October has brought huge numbers onto South Korea’s streets for weekly protests to demand Park’s immediate departure from office.

The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Freed is president of the Center for Political Accountability. Charles E.M. Kolb is a member of the CPA board. Kolb was president of the Committee for Economic Development from 1997 to 2012 and served as deputy assistant for domestic policy to President George H.W. Bush from 1990 to 1992.) By Bruce F. Freed and Charles E.M. Kolb Jan 26 In a meeting with automakers on the fourth day of his presidency, Donald Trump appeared eager to cooperate with executives. But that tone was in stark contrast to his messaging on Twitter and at a pre-presidential news conference, where he targeted some businesses for attack and embraced others. Trump assailed the pharmaceutical industry at his Jan. 11 news conference, saying drug companies "are getting away with murder." Key drug stocks immediately plummeted. The following day, Trump tweeted that Americans should "Buy L.L. Bean," after thanking an L.L. Bean board and family member for her political support. With his tweet, he put an iconic Yankee company in the crosshairs of a polarized national discourse. Whether Trump has been testing messages to use as president or launching a regular practice, he has used his own "bully pulpit" to put some businesses on notice and to commend others. This approach is raising questions about what some economists call "crony capitalism" and also about quid-pro-quo politics, and it's shaking up company executives who might otherwise be optimistic about pledges of economic growth. Seven years ago, the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision freed companies to engage in political spending. The cost of elections keeps surging with the 2016 presidential cycle nearing $7 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2012. Today, how will U.S. companies respond to rising concerns about bullying or favoritism in federal government intervention, and will Trump's L.L. Bean endorsement provide a greater incentive to engage politically? U.S. corporate leaders from Carrier (HVAC manufacturing) to Boeing (aircraft manufacturing) and Ford (auto manufacturing) have been among those targeted by Trump as he presses his job-growth agenda. On Jan. 11, the nine top pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 by market cap lost a staggering $24.6 billion in 20 minutes during Trump's press conference, according to one analysis. Trump said the drug companies charge the government too much for medicines. On Jan. 12, Trump tweeted about L.L. Bean, which an anti-Trump group called Grab Your Wallet had added to its list of companies targeted for boycotting. An L.L. Bean official quickly reminded inquiring news media that the company makes "no political endorsements or contributions," despite the fact that board member Linda Bean donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported Trump. A dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system requires a level playing field in which companies focus on how best to compete in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. A number of economists believe crony capitalism brings harmful uncertainty to U.S. companies. And there is academic research suggesting an association between government-induced risk and companies' increased political donations. How, then, would U.S. companies respond to a new president's bully pulpit? When he urges millions of Twitter followers to buy a company's products in the wake of its board member's political contributions, will business leaders see it as a quid-pro-quo endorsement? Or will they listen instead to the skeptical Trump who boasted on the campaign trail of giving money to politicians to get them to "do whatever the hell you want them to do," while calling the existing campaign finance system "broken"? These aren't idle questions, given what we're seeing in company contributions to the Trump inauguration. According to news reports, Trump-target Boeing pledged $1 million. Chevron, which has a deep stake in the incoming administration's energy and regulatory policies, gave $500,000. And AT&T, which is seeking to merge with Time Warner, has acknowledged that it contributed. It's too early to tell what factors the new president and new Congress will take into account in making decisions about businesses. In the meantime, in the interest of promoting economic growth along with their own protection, businesses can take concrete steps to protect themselves, shareholders and our democracy. Being transparent about when they give political money and adopting clear policies for this spending are two of the most significant safeguards companies can adopt at a time when one of Citizens United's central promises has not been fulfilled. In his Citizens United opinion for the court's majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy unshackled companies to engage in almost unfettered political spending while asserting that modern technology has the potential to make "disclosures rapid and informative." The latter promise has not been met. In large part due to Citizens United and other court rulings, the U.S. election cycle in 2016 broke spending records. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups not formally connected to either political party, including organizations not required under U.S. law to disclose their donors. These latter groups' secretive political funds often are called "dark money." Because these organizations may keep their donors anonymous, they are particularly attractive to like-thinking corporations and others who want to keep their donations under the radar. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, a powerful business trade association, is allowed under U.S. law to keep the sources of its political spending hidden. It spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races. So-called "social welfare" groups run ads about hot issues, sometimes attacking candidates, and they are also permitted to hide donor identities. All told, political dark money was projected to add up to at least $132 million in 2016. Unfortunately, the promise of broad, effective disclosure that the Supreme Court embraced in Citizens United still seems remote. It is impossible to measure the total largesse of rivers of corporate political giving intended to influence elections. It is possible, however, by looking at disclosed spending, to get a sense of scale of corporate political engagement at another level: in the states, where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups spent $137 million. When companies are transparent about their political contributions, they can protect against payments that might cause a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate, or an ill-considered payment that can damage their reputation. A clear policy on political spending can protect them against public or private pressure from a political candidate, allowing them to cite company policy in order to say "no." These steps are getting mainstream traction from companies acting on their own. According to a recent nonpartisan report examining the S&P 500, 305 of these companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 had placed some level of restriction on their political spending. It looks like Trump will continue to use his bully pulpit to shame and blame companies, and concerns about crony capitalism will keep growing. If this happens, companies can protect themselves and their integrity by following guidance from Business Roundtable, which encourages company boards to oversee political spending and consider adopting a policy on disclosure. It's modest advice, but it may help companies in the eye of Trump's next storm. (By Bruce F. Freed and Charles E.M.

Chris Christie in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandalMore >    By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Dow 20,000 wasn't exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Freed and Charles E.M. Kolb Jan 26 (Reuters) - In a meeting with automakers on the fourth day of his presidency, Donald Trump appeared eager to cooperate with executives. But that tone was in stark contrast to his messaging on Twitter and at a pre-presidential news conference, where he targeted some businesses for attack and embraced others. Trump assailed the pharmaceutical industry at his Jan. 11 news conference, saying drug companies "are getting away with murder." Key drug stocks immediately plummeted. The following day, Trump tweeted that Americans should "Buy L.L. Bean," after thanking an L.L. Bean board and family member for her political support. With his tweet, he put an iconic Yankee company in the crosshairs of a polarized national discourse. Whether Trump has been testing messages to use as president or launching a regular practice, he has used his own "bully pulpit" to put some businesses on notice and to commend others. This approach is raising questions about what some economists call "crony capitalism" and also about quid-pro-quo politics, and it's shaking up company executives who might otherwise be optimistic about pledges of economic growth. Seven years ago, the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision freed companies to engage in political spending. The cost of elections keeps surging with the 2016 presidential cycle nearing $7 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2012. Today, how will U.S. companies respond to rising concerns about bullying or favoritism in federal government intervention, and will Trump's L.L. Bean endorsement provide a greater incentive to engage politically? U.S. corporate leaders from Carrier (HVAC manufacturing) to Boeing (aircraft manufacturing) and Ford (auto manufacturing) have been among those targeted by Trump as he presses his job-growth agenda. On Jan. 11, the nine top pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 by market cap lost a staggering $24.6 billion in 20 minutes during Trump's press conference, according to one analysis. Trump said the drug companies charge the government too much for medicines. On Jan. 12, Trump tweeted about L.L. Bean, which an anti-Trump group called Grab Your Wallet had added to its list of companies targeted for boycotting. An L.L. Bean official quickly reminded inquiring news media that the company makes "no political endorsements or contributions," despite the fact that board member Linda Bean donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported Trump. A dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system requires a level playing field in which companies focus on how best to compete in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. A number of economists believe crony capitalism brings harmful uncertainty to U.S. companies. And there is academic research suggesting an association between government-induced risk and companies' increased political donations. How, then, would U.S. companies respond to a new president's bully pulpit? When he urges millions of Twitter followers to buy a company's products in the wake of its board member's political contributions, will business leaders see it as a quid-pro-quo endorsement? Or will they listen instead to the skeptical Trump who boasted on the campaign trail of giving money to politicians to get them to "do whatever the hell you want them to do," while calling the existing campaign finance system "broken"? These aren't idle questions, given what we're seeing in company contributions to the Trump inauguration. According to news reports, Trump-target Boeing pledged $1 million. Chevron, which has a deep stake in the incoming administration's energy and regulatory policies, gave $500,000. And AT&T, which is seeking to merge with Time Warner, has acknowledged that it contributed. It's too early to tell what factors the new president and new Congress will take into account in making decisions about businesses. In the meantime, in the interest of promoting economic growth along with their own protection, businesses can take concrete steps to protect themselves, shareholders and our democracy. Being transparent about when they give political money and adopting clear policies for this spending are two of the most significant safeguards companies can adopt at a time when one of Citizens United's central promises has not been fulfilled. In his Citizens United opinion for the court's majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy unshackled companies to engage in almost unfettered political spending while asserting that modern technology has the potential to make "disclosures rapid and informative." The latter promise has not been met. In large part due to Citizens United and other court rulings, the U.S. election cycle in 2016 broke spending records. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups not formally connected to either political party, including organizations not required under U.S. law to disclose their donors. These latter groups' secretive political funds often are called "dark money." Because these organizations may keep their donors anonymous, they are particularly attractive to like-thinking corporations and others who want to keep their donations under the radar. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, a powerful business trade association, is allowed under U.S. law to keep the sources of its political spending hidden. It spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races. So-called "social welfare" groups run ads about hot issues, sometimes attacking candidates, and they are also permitted to hide donor identities. All told, political dark money was projected to add up to at least $132 million in 2016. Unfortunately, the promise of broad, effective disclosure that the Supreme Court embraced in Citizens United still seems remote. It is impossible to measure the total largesse of rivers of corporate political giving intended to influence elections. It is possible, however, by looking at disclosed spending, to get a sense of scale of corporate political engagement at another level: in the states, where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups spent $137 million. When companies are transparent about their political contributions, they can protect against payments that might cause a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate, or an ill-considered payment that can damage their reputation. A clear policy on political spending can protect them against public or private pressure from a political candidate, allowing them to cite company policy in order to say "no." These steps are getting mainstream traction from companies acting on their own. According to a recent nonpartisan report examining the S&P 500, 305 of these companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 had placed some level of restriction on their political spending. It looks like Trump will continue to use his bully pulpit to shame and blame companies, and concerns about crony capitalism will keep growing. If this happens, companies can protect themselves and their integrity by following guidance from Business Roundtable, which encourages company boards to oversee political spending and consider adopting a policy on disclosure. It's modest advice, but it may help companies in the eye of Trump's next storm. (By Bruce F. Freed and Charles E.M.

New Delhi: Air India is seeking offers from banks and financial institutions to raise USD 110 million for making the advance payment for six Dreamliner (Boeing 787-8) aircraft which the carrier has to acquire during the next fiscal. Air India is seeking these funds on floating as well as fixed interest rates or both, said the Invitation of Offers document posted on its website on Friday. The state-run airline currently has 21 Dreamliners in its fleet. Air India had in January, 2006, placed orders for 68 aircraft with Boeing 27 Dreamliners and 41 B-777s and B-737-800s. As per the agreement, the airline is required to make an advance of 10 per cent of the gross cost of the aircraft 12 months prior to its scheduled delivery. According to the Boeing Company website, the listed price of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft was USD 218.3 million in 2014. Air India has a fleet of 114 planes, comprising Boeing, Airbus, ATR and regional jets.

Being the first to take possession of the new jetliner is a sign of the fast-growing carrier’s increasing stature among the world’s airlines. “Norwegian will now be the first airline to take delivery of the Boeing 737 Max and we will be the first airline in the world to operate this brand-new aircraft type,” an airline spokesman said in an email. Norwegian said it will take delivery of the first of its Max jets in May and “then it will take a little time before it enters operation,” the spokesman added. The airline has ordered 100 of the jets. But being the first comes with added challenges, as the first operator typically works out the early kinks of a new design. When Norwegian first took its 787 Dreamliner in 2013, its early operations were repeatedly disrupted by reliability issues with the advanced long-range airliner. Norwegian plans to use the single-aisle 737 Max, with its increased range, to fly between Europe and smaller cities in the U.S. The low-cost airline’s long-haul operations from Europe are flown today with larger 787 Dreamliners. The airline has been at the center of a fierce controversy with U.S. airlines and their labor unions over the Department of Transportation’s approval of the carrier’s ability to fly from Ireland to the U.S.. The unions claim Norwegian will undercut wages for U.S.-based pilots and cabin crews or hire less expensive non-U.S. crews while flying to America. Southwest Airlines was the first carrier to place a firm order for Boeing’s updated single-aisle jet back in December 2011 and has long been expected to take the first jet from the plane maker. Southwest said Thursday that it won’t take its first Max until July and it will start flying passengers on October 1. Boeing’s chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that the Max, which has been in testing since January 2016, will deliver during the second quarter, but did not say which airline would take the first jet. Southwest has faced obstacles getting the Max into its fleet, first facing a now-settled labor dispute with its pilots over pay on the aircraft and the compatibility of the fourth generation aircraft into its all-Boeing 737 fleet. Southwest is the largest operator of 737 jets in the world, and was the first airline the last time Boeing introduced a new generation of its workhorse airliner in 1997. Boeing holds orders for more than 3,400 737 Max jets, which feature a pair of new engines and aerodynamic updates to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

New Delhi: Budget carrier SpiceJet has made a part payment of its dues to the state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI) and also signed an agreement with aircraft leasing firm BBAM to settle out of court the dispute over Boeing rentals. "SpiceJet has paid a part payment of Rs 25 crore to the Airports Authority of India towards the dues it had accumulated due to the cash crunch last year," sources said on Wednesday. The AAI received the part payment of around Rs 300 crore dues on Tuesday, they said. Meanwhile, the airline said that aircraft leasing firm BBAM has agreed in-principle to settle out of court the dispute over aircraft rentals. "SpiceJet has entered into an in-principle understanding with its five lessors managed by BBAM Aircraft Leasing and Finance with regard to five aircraft operated by the company," SpiceJet said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. Under the understanding, the lessors have agreed to suspend court proceedings, including winding these up, and the de-registration process of aircraft, subject to SpiceJet satisfying the terms of settlement and parties executing definitive agreements, the airline said. SpiceJet was dragged to court by several aircraft leasing firms including BBAM after it had failed to pay rentals for some of its Boeing 737 aircraft due to financial crunch last year. A single judge bench of the high court had on March 19 directed the DGCA to de-register six Boeing 737 aircraft given to the carrier. But on March 23, another of its lessors Wilmington Trust SP Services (Dublin) Ltd decided to withdraw the court proceedings and de-registration process of aircraft after the parties reached an agreement on the issue. Currently, the budget carrier has a fleet of 32 aircraft, of which 27 are Boeing 737 and the rest Bombardier Q400s. The airline plans to add seven more such planes between this month and May.

Incidentally, they’re also icy-blue. Image credits Boeing. The suits were designed to be lighter, more comfortable, and less cumbersome than their earlier counterparts. The agency reports that the whole shebang weighs in at about 20 pounds (9 kg) with all accessories. That’s a full 33% lighter than the orange launch-and-entry suits you see astronauts wear on TV. Another feature bound to make crewmembers really happy is that the Starliner suits allow water vapor to pass through, away from the astronauts, while remaining airtight. No more stuffy suits! A new architecture and material composition for the knee and elbow sections as well as re-vamped joint patterns throughout the suit makes them much more flexible too. The helmet and visor are now part of the suit so you don’t have to worry about misplacing them. Several zippers can be pulled up or down to make the suit more form-fitting during sitting or walking. Finally, touchscreen-sensitive fingertips tie it all together. Image credits Boeing. But there’s only one thing you really need your space suit to do, and these blue babies definitely deliver: Advertisement “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Astronauts have already had the chance to get a feel for their new threads inside a Starliner mock-up, to learn how best to use both. They repeatedly climbed in and out of the mock-up, interacted with all the buttons, screens, or knobs around, and of course tested the suits at that all important space-going activity — sitting. Houston, we have a-comfortable. Image credits Boeing. “The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft’s redundant life support systems,” said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don’t need a spacesuit. It’s like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit.

By Larry Light MoneyWatch January 26, 2017, 2:05 PM How much credit does Donald Trump deserve for Dow rally? Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email President Donald Trump’s election coincided with a big rally in the stock market, culminating in the Dow Jones industrial average topping the 20,000 mark on Wednesday. But is the entire surge attributable to Mr. Trump? Maybe half of it, but not the entire thing. For sure, the post-election run-up has been solid. The Dow, from Election Day on Nov. 8 through Wednesday, gained 9.5 percent, and from the election to last Friday’s inauguration, 8.6 percent. Before that, the rise was less robust: for 2016 up to Election Day, 5.2 percent. And to deliver that much, the Dow had to struggle through a first half beset by worries about China’s lagging growth, low prices for oil and other commodities and Great Britain’s surprise voted to leave the European Union.  Play Video CBS This Morning What Dow's 20,000 milestone means for U.S. economy On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will open above 20,000 points for the first time in history. It marks a major milestone since a ... The “Trump bump,” as it’s known, actually has had three phases. From the election to mid-December was the bulk of the advance, about six weeks. The Dow crept up close to 20K -- but then the rally stalled. Only in recent days, since Mr. Trump took the oath of office, has the market revived again. The Dow crossed the 20,000 line, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite touched new records.  At the same time, other influences were at work that had little or nothing to do with the new president: Corporate earnings, negative since 2015, turned positive again. Oil prices, which tumbled from $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to $26 in early 2016, rebounded to over $50 by fall -- good news for battered energy companies and their stocks. The Federal Reserve served notice that it would raise interest rates, a boon for financial companies, which saw shares ascend. Meanwhile, numerous economic indicators perked up.  Let’s sketch out the dynamics of the post-election rally, to see which stemmed from Mr. Trump and which from other factors: Trump euphoria. Pre-election, numerous analyst projections held that a Trump victory would spell stock market catastrophe, because they feared he would start a trade war against China and other nations, balloon the national debt with his massive tax cuts and infrastructure build-out and further polarize the U.S.  The opposite happened in the market. Investors greeted Mr. Trump’s win as a near-guarantee that his proposals -- which they viewed as “pro-growth” -- would be enacted. Gus Faucher, PNC deputy chief economist, wrote in a research note: “The improvement in the stock market is based on expectations for stronger economic growth under the Trump administration, which would boost corporate profits, and expected lower taxes on those profits.”  Lower corporate and individual taxes, lighter regulation and presumably business-friendly policies will lead to an economic boom, the reasoning went. “Trump’s message is clear,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank. “America is open for business. And if you sell it here, you better make it here.”  Many of the Dow components began rising. While post-election rallies are not that remarkable, this one had a special oomph. Financial services stocks, held in low regard since the 2008-09 crisis, benefited from talk that Mr. Trump would revoke or at least diminish the Dodd-Frank law, which placed regulatory burdens on many of them following the widespread economic carnage from the financial crisis. A big beneficiary was Goldman Sachs (GS), the largest stock in the Dow at an 8 percent weighting. Unlike many other indexes that use market valuation in their weightings, the Dow measures its 30 members by stock price alone. So Goldman, as its only stock over $200, has the most heft. Goldman is up 30 percent since the election. Another winner was the defense sector, because Mr. Trump has vowed to bolster military spending. Take Boeing (BA), which has enjoyed a 17 percent lift since the election. Boeing’s climb came despite a brief drop in early December, when Mr. Trump criticized the aerospace company for profligate spending on construction of two new presidential aircraft. Indeed, according to Bespoke Investment Group, Mr. Trump’s transition period had the second largest Dow increase in history, behind Herbert Hoover’s. Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and George H.W. Bush weren’t too far behind Mr. Trump. The pause, and the uptick. In mid-December, though, the rapid tempo slowed to a plod. Partly, that was due to fatigue; even the most rampaging bull run needs a pause. And some of the initial market surge was plain old relief that “the uncertainty of who would be in charge was lifted,” said Nicholas Atkeson, a managing director at US Capital Wealth Management, an asset manager in San Francisco. That emotion can last only so long, he said. In addition, Mr. Trump seemed to be spending much of his time during the transition as a national scold, which likely helped slow market momentum. He kept up his campaign on Twitter and in person to slam his perceived foes. For New Year’s, for instance, he tweeted these wishes: “Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. Love!” A CBS News poll in December showed that 53 percent of Americans were either concerned or scared about his plans as president.  “His personal style became distracting,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark, a financial consulting firm in Concord, Calif. “People began asking: Where is he going to get that $1 trillion” for infrastructure.  Great! #Dow20K https://t.co/wXFhXBLgag— President Trump (@POTUS) January 25, 2017 But it’s significant that the Dow, which had been flirting with the 20,000 mark from December into January, finally got there just a few days after Mr. Trump’s swearing in. That’s because, once he assumed power, he had the ability to turn talk into action, said Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles private equity firm. “This is the Dow Trump index,” he said. Mr. Trump himself did not give much analysis to the Dow’s milestone, other than to tweet it was “Great!” Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci, a financier, tweeted: “Stock market performance in 6 weeks following President Trump’s victory is best among all elections since 1900,” using Bloomberg numbers. Using that six-week measure, of course, cuts off the market doldrums period that began in mid-December.  In his first week in office, Mr. Trump froze new or pending regulations, removed Obama administration-imposed roadblocks to two oil pipelines, formally withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (which he says would lead to more American job losses) and signed an order streamlining federal approvals for infrastructure projects. Those steps, in addition to several on the conservative wish list -- like starting to roll back Obamacare and saying he would announce his right-leaning pick for the Supreme Court next week -- signaled to the market that Mr. Trump was getting things done. Before his inauguration, it was “hypothetical,” Schiffer said. “Now he is showing not telling, and firing on all cylinders.”  The other factors. Corporate earnings, a key driver of market performance, have been doing well lately. “This has really encouraged investors,” asset manager Atkeson said, adding that better profits have nothing to do with the president and his program, at least at the moment.  Earnings had been declining since 2015, owing to problems ranging from weak global growth to a strong dollar (which makes U.S. overseas sales worth less to American multinationals) to a collapse in oil prices, which slammed the energy industry badly. Lately, however, many of those headwinds have ebbed.  Then came the profits turnaround. In 2016’s third quarter, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, earnings grew 5.2 percent. Companies are just now starting to report their results for last year’s final quarter, and FactSet researchers project they will come in at 3.6 percent.  Play Video CBS Evening News Federal Reserve announces interest rate hike The Federal Reserve voted unanimously Wed. to raise interest rates one quarter of one percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen cited falling unemployment ... The economy is doing fairly well. something that started during Barack Obama’s presidency. The expansion isn’t spectacular, to be sure -- gross domestic product growth has averaged around 2 percent yearly since the Great Recession, and numerous forecasts say it will stay at that tepid pace over the next two years. But GDP and other economic measurements are  progressing well enough to stir optimism among investors and uncleash what legendary economist John Maynard Keynes called “animal spirits.”  The Federal Reserve, which has been holding off on raising interest rates out of fear that would squelch growth, felt positive enough about the economy’s prospects to boost them last month -- and plans for three more hikes in 2017. Numerous economic indicators, though hardly all, show a brighter picture nowadays. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index posted strong increases in November and December. Similarly, the Institute for Supply Management’s tally of manufacturing orders jumped in December.  Amid strong wage growth, the unemployment rate in December was 4.7 percent, a level that the Federal Reserve terms “full employment.” Last month, hourly pay rose 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the largest increase in more than seven years. Also last month, wages rose a further 10 cents to $26 after sliding 2 cents in November.     Should Mr. Trump get his economic program through Congress, then the market may well continue to take heart and climb higher. None of that, however, is a sure thing. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Minister for Defence Procurement Harriett Baldwin discussed the MOD's joint initiative with Boeing International President Marc Allen. Crown Copyright The MOD and Boeing are working together to build UK prosperity, growth, and exports across the country. As part of their commitment to the UK, Boeing signed the UK aerospace industry’s Supply Chain Competitiveness Charter, which is designed to strengthen relationships between companies and their suppliers, so that they work together more effectively to raise UK productivity and competitiveness. Highlights of the joint initiative so far include: A new commercial airline hangar to be constructed at Gatwick airport, supporting more than 100 jobs Collaboration on a new £100m P-8A operational support and training base at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, creating more than 100 new jobs Boeing facilitated a visit to Seattle for 37 UK suppliers to deepen their relationships with Boeing driving enhanced prosperity in the UK Training courses for UK suppliers on how to win additional business with the company, further enhancing the competitiveness of the UK supply chain Education partnerships with the Royal Academy of Engineering and the RAF Air Training Corps in Northern Ireland, which reached more than 5,000 young people in the UK last year Minister Harriett Baldwin said: Britain’s defence industry plays a key role delivering an economy that works for everyone. Across the UK, Britain’s defence companies provide highly skilled, well-paid jobs with world class manufacturing exports. Boeing expects to increase their UK workforce by 50% by 2020. This joint initiative is a prime example of the cutting edge, high-skilled, job-creating investment that our industrial strategy seeks to harness to make Britain one of the most competitive places in the world to innovate, build businesses and deliver secure, long-term prosperity for all. The government’s Industrial Strategy will seek to make fresh choices about how the UK shapes its economy and presents an opportunity to deliver a bold, long term Industrial Strategy that builds on strengths and prepares for the years ahead. Following a period of consultation, the government intends to publish an Industrial Strategy white paper in 2017 that will set out the plan for full and long term delivery.  Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, said: Boeing’s partnership with the UK, which dates back to the 1930s, goes from strength to strength today. Boeing values the UK’s aerospace and defence capabilities. In both 2015 and 2016 Boeing in the UK hired, on average, a new employee per day and our relationship with the UK supply chain today has more than doubled in value since 2011. This growth continues in 2017 and beyond, with further significant announcements to follow in the future, building on our initiative’s achievements already in place. There is much more to come from the strategic prosperity initiative. During their meeting Minister Harriett Baldwin and Marc Allen looked ahead to the next six months of collaboration: Boeing will increase bid opportunities for UK suppliers and work with the government to enhance UK competitiveness. The aim is for UK companies to double their supply work with Boeing and win higher proportions of content on future Boeing aircraft. Boeing will make the UK its European base for training, maintenance, repair and overhaul across its defence fixed-wing and rotary platforms. Boeing will make the UK a base for defence exports to Europe and the Middle East, increasing UK employment and investment.

Israel entered a new era in air defense today. After years of research and development, the Ministry of Defense Homa Administration (Israel Missile Organization), part of the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure, and the US Missile Defense Agency delivered the first new Arrow 3 advanced air defense system interceptors to Israel air force air defense units. 17 years after the Arrow system was first made operational, the Arrow 3 is extending and upgrading Israel's air defense. It provides Israel with new capabilities in intercepting ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads while these are still far away from us in outer space. In other words, Arrow 3 interception is not the Iron Dome interception of a Grad missile. Regardless of how much you gaze skyward, you will hear no boom and see no smoke. Today's ceremony at the Palmachim air force base means that if someone in Iran or any distant country presses the button tomorrow, the interception office on duty in the air defense system can launch the Arrow 3 at the missile threat. The advantage of the Arrow 3 is not merely its ability to intercept missiles bearing evil payloads far away from Israel's borders, while preventing complications caused by poisonous and hazardous fallout liable to be emitted following the explosion. Operationally, these missiles are designed to significantly increase the interception opportunities available to Israel when needed. If the first Arrow 3 interceptor fired misses its target missile, and that can happen, the interception officer at one of the Arrow 3 batteries will have enough time to launch another Arrow 3 interceptor at the missile threat. RELATED ARTICLES Israel's US missile defense grant could rise to $600m Israel's Arrow 3 aces test by striking missile in space Even if interception does not take place, Arrow 2 interceptors, which have undergone a series of upgrades, revisions, and adaptations since being made operational by the air force, will also be directed at the target missile. The Arrow 2 Block 4 missiles currently possessed by the air force are extremely advanced and up-to-date. They are capable of intercepting all the missiles and heavy rockets in the arsenal of Israel's enemies when the day of decision comes. Even though Arrow 3 missiles have smaller dimensions than Arrow 2 missiles, and there is a significant difference in their interception method, compared with the older Arrow missiles, they can be launched against enemy missiles using the existing infrastructure. A senior Homa source says that declaration of the new missiles as operational requires no substantial changes in the deployment of the missile batteries. These batteries operate from two sites, Palmachim and Ein Shemer, and are connected to the Oren Adir (Magnificent Pine) radar system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. (IAI) (TASE: ARSP.B1) subsidiary Elta Systems. "The entire Arrow system is able to work together, and speaks the same language," the source stated. "New and important capabilities have been added to the command and control center and to the radar detection system, whose capabilities against the future threats expected in this area have been upgraded." IAI is the chief contractor in the Arrow 3 program, and US company Boeing is the senior partner. Components linked to the new missiles system are produced in Boeing's US plants, imported to Israel, and assembled in Israel at IAI's Malam factory. With the delivery of the new missile interceptors to the air force, other defense companies can also pat themselves on the back for this achievement and take part in the celebratory occasion by opening several bottles of pink champagne. One of these is Elbit Systems Ltd. (Nasdaq: ESLT; TASE: ESLT), which, together with its Elisra Group subsidiary, developed the missile's firing management system, called Golden Citron. Another is Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI), which produced the engine. A significant milestone Although the Arrow 3's operational status is an accomplished fact, and constitutes a real milestone on the way to completion of Israel's multi-layer defense system against missiles and rockets, more trials of the weapons system are expected in the future. The Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 array can now provide a complete solution to any threat to Israel posed, and possibly that will be posed in the future, but it needs updates and adjustments from time to time. While Israel is further tightening its defense capabilities, senior missile industry figures, in Iran for example, are burning the midnight oil in an attempt to devise a way of challenging Israel, despite all its missile interceptors. "We're looking many years ahead, and this is definitely a project of predicting the future. Yes, there's a lot of work ahead of us, because we're building our capabilities according to the development of the threats," says a senior Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure source. That source, incidentally, does not completely rule out the idea that someone will one day also celebrate the air force's procurement of missile interceptors called Arrow 4. "At our Administration, there are always ideas and thoughts, and we're constantly examining technologies of various types that will be suitable in another 10 or 15 years," he says, without elaborating. IAI VP and Program Director for Air & Missile Defense Systems Boaz Levy adds, "The Arrow 3 system, a product of a development effort lasting many years, based on a multi-atmosphere solution invented by IAI, is today becoming a reality. This is a milestone for the defense establishment and the defense industry in Israel. The air force is receiving an additional air defense layer for high-altitude interception in outer space. Together with the Arrow 2, it is creating the best anti-ballistic missile defense solution. Many industries participated in the development by taking part in key building blocks in the project. These included IAI subsidiary Elta, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., IMI, and Elisra." On a personal note, Levy added, "Today's delivery of the system to the air force constitutes the closing of a circle and the completion of a dream for me as the person who accompanied and led the development and planning of the system for many years."

"Clarity is the markets' oxygen." Advances in shares of Boeing and those of Caterpillar, up 4.8 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively, led the gains in the Dow. Shares of Boeing rose to a record high after the plane maker offered a better-than-expected outlook on earnings. It forecast operating cash flow to rise to about US$10.75 billion in 2017, up from US$10.5 billion the previous year. "With solid fourth quarter operating performance and a sharp strategic focus, we extended our aerospace market leadership in our centennial year and positioned Boeing for continued growth and success in our second century," Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement.
