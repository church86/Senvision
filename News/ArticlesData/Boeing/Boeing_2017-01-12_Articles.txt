'I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform, and we have to get it at the lowest possible price,' Hewson said to reporters in Trump Tower. Hewson had previously assured Trump she would drive down the cost of the company's fighter jet, after he tweeted last month that he was asking rival aerospace company Boeing Co whether it could offer a cheaper alternative to the F-35, based on its existing F-18 Super Hornet. Trump has threatened and rebuked some of America's largest companies, creating a new business risk for those who have been or fear being targeted. Deal: Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said after meeting with Trump: 'I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform.'

Mad Dog Mattis is on his way to the Pentagon: Congress votes... Share this article Share Costs for Lockheed's F-35 program had escalated to an estimated $379 billion. The program accounted for 20 percent of the company's total revenue of $46.1 billion last year. Boeing's F-18, the plane Trump floated as a possible alternative, is an older generation aircraft that lacks the stealth capabilities of the F-35. Hewson also said Lockheed plans to increase jobs at its Fort Worth, Texas, facility by 1,800, which she said would add 'thousands and thousands of jobs' across the supply chain in 45 U.S. states. Lockheed shares were up 1 percent after her comments on Friday. HOW DOES IT COMPARE WITH ITS 1970S PREDECESSOR, THE F-16 JET?  F-35 Role:  Stealth multirole fighter First flight:  December 15, 2006 Unit cost (not including engine):  F-35A - $98million F-35B - $104million F-35C - $116million  Number built: 115 (as of November 2014)  Length: 15.67m Wingspan: 10.7m Height: 4.33m Max speed (F-35A): 1,930kph Armament:  One of the most highly-anticipated features of the F-35 armament is the Small Diameter Bomb II (SBD II).The bomb is able to guide towards its target using laser, imaging infrared or radar homing. It can hit moving or stationary targets in any weather, or at night, with unprecedented reliability and accuracy. The 'super weapon' is predicted to be the most versatile air-to-ground munition in the Pentagon's air combat inventory. The cost per SDB II is said to be around $250,000 and the US military plans on buying as many as 17,000 of them.  F-16 Role:  Multirole fighter  First flight: January 20, 1974 Unit cost: F-16A/B - $14.6million F-16C/D - $18.8million  Number built: 4,540+  Length: 15.06m Wingspan: 9.96m Height: 4.88m  Max speed (F-16C): 2,120kph Combat history:   The F-16 has served in the Air Forces of 26 nations, including the U.S., Israel, Egypt, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. During Operation Desert Storm, the 1991 assault on Iraq, F-16s flew over 13,000 operations, more than any other Coalition aircraft. The U.S. has employed the F-16 in operations over the Balkans, Afghanistan and Libya.   At its production peak in 1987, the F-16 team in Fort Worth was also making history, by producing 30 F-16s in just 30 days.  Thanks to frequent upgrades improving and incorporating new technologies into the cockpit, avionics, sensors and weapons, the aircraft has become more reliable over its 40 years.

SpiceJet, which currently has just 49 planes, said the order would enable it to boost its domestic operations and potentially expand into long-haul international flights. India’s aviation market is growing at double the pace of China’s, as an emerging middle-class takes to the skies. “This is the largest deal for SpiceJet, it’s one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India,” SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh told journalists as he announced the deal. “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations.” The deal marks a major turnaround for SpiceJet, whose planes were briefly grounded in 2014 after suppliers refused to refuel them due to unpaid bills. It has a 13-percent share of the Indian market, behind rivals Indigo, Jet Airways and Air India. – Vast potential – The Indian market is seen as having vast untapped potential with fewer than 100 million of India’s 1.2 billion citizens flying on domestic routes last year. Train travel remains slow and demand for low-cost flights has boomed in the past decade. The latest industry figures from the International Air Transport Association show India’s domestic air traffic grew 22.3 percent year-on-year in November, followed by Russia at 15.5 percent and China at 14.9 percent. But most of the country’s airlines are still loss-making and laden with debt, while state carrier Air India has long relied on government support. Analysts say lower fuel prices and a rise in economic growth have boosted the sector, with domestic traffic up 21 percent last year. “The airline has done really well from being almost on the brink of closure to nearly seven quarters of profit,” said industry analyst Kapil Kaul. “The new aircraft order is on expected lines and gives them long-term direction. A positive and long-term story is likely to emerge with this order.” SpiceJet, the only Indian low-cost carrier with a Boeing fleet, said the first of the new planes would arrive in early 2018. It currently has just 49 aircraft, putting it well behind the market leader Indigo, India’s only consistently profitable carrier, with 400. Singh said the deal included 100 737 jets from Boeing’s new Max family of aircraft, which he said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. It also includes the option to buy 50 wide-body aircrafts suitable for long-haul flights. The airline currently only flies short-haul international routes. SpiceJet put the value of the planes at $22 billion at list prices, although it will likely pay less as discounts for large orders are customary. The company’s shares have more than tripled since December 2014. The deal is a boost for Boeing in India, where rival manufacturer Airbus has traditionally dominated. “India needs 1,850 planes worth $265 billion in the next 20 years,” said Boeing India President Dinesh Keskar. “We do expect more orders out of India.” Air India Ajay Singh Boeing planes International Air Transport Association SpiceJet Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The aircraft are Boeing’s new MAX 737. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the US company’s only major customer among the low-cost airlines that now dominate the country’s air industry. Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers. Analysts expect passenger numbers to more than triple in Indian over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. Enhanced ability SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. “This is an extremely competitive market,” Ajay Singh, SpiceJet’s chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. “What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs,” said Singh, whose airline has about 13 percent of the Indian passenger market, while market leader IndiGo has 40 percent. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation’s IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India.

Hewson told reporters after the meeting that she shares Trump’s desire to reduce the costs of the stealth fighter jets, produced by Lockheed through a contract with the Pentagon, down to “the lowest possible price.” “So I'm glad I had the opportunity to tell him that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft,” Hewson said, describing it as a “great meeting.” Hewson added that the company plans to add 1,800 more jobs in Fort Worth, where the company assembles the jets. As of now, the F-35 program provides 38,900 jobs to Texans either directly or indirectly, according to Lockheed, and contributes an economic impact of $3.4 billion to the state. Trump first began publicly complaining about the F-35 costs in December on the platform he uses to air many of his grievances: Twitter. The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 The president-elect bemoaned that costs for the program are “out of control” and vowed to save billions of dollars once he takes office. A couple of weeks later, Hewson joined Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg in a trip to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where she offered Trump a “personal commitment” to reduce the costs. "We're just beginning — it's a dance," Trump told reporters after that meeting. "It's a little bit of a dance. We're going to get the costs down. And we're going to get it done beautifully." The president-elect said he asked Boeing to determine the price for a “comparable F-18 Super Hornet” to potentially replace the F-35. But, as experts noted, the two planes are not comparable because an F-18 is not a stealth jet. Trump targeted the F-35 again this week at a news conference in New York. "It's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget," Trump said. "I don't like that. ... We're going to do some big things on the F-35 program and perhaps the F-18 program. We're going to get those costs way down." Each time Trump has put the F-35 in his crosshairs, Lockheed Martin's stock has tumbled. Shares for the defense contractor fell more than 1 percent after Trump's most recent criticism in the news conference and 2 percent after his initial December tweet. But the F-35 program received a boost this week when Rep. Kay Granger, a Fort Worth Republican and key ally for Lockheed on Capitol Hill, was selected to chair the powerful House defense appropriations subcommittee, which oversees the Pentagon budget. Lockheed congratulated Granger, a longtime defender of the F-35 program, on landing the role, describing her as “a champion for our armed forces.” The F-35 assembly plant is in Granger’s district. Granger told The Dallas Morning News this week that she expects Trump will come to appreciate the importance of the F-35 program, which she describes as “huge,” once he takes office and deals with the issue on a more sustained basis. But she said she has no problem with Trump’s intention to “watch every penny we’re spending.” “I don’t think he ever said we shouldn’t have it, but it should be an affordable price,” Granger said. “Lockheed certainly doesn’t want to lose that contract; no one wants to lose that contract. But he has to be satisfied that it’s a price that makes sense.” The Fort Worth Republican said she has been invited to the White House just once during President Barack Obama’s eight-year tenure, a trend she expects to shift dramatically with Trump. Because Trump is using some members of Congress as liaisons with his incoming White House team, Granger said she knows some of them well. “And they’ll take my calls probably faster with the chairmanship assigned to it,” she added. The F-35 program has its detractors in Congress, too. Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee, is a frequent critic of the program. When the Department of Defense told him this week that there would be another schedule delay and cost overrun, McCain described it as “the poster child for acquisition malpractice.” A spokeswoman for New Jersey Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the broader House appropriations committee and Granger’s predecessor, said he “supports the F-35 program, but, like many, has serious concerns about the cost.” But if push comes to shove and Republicans on Capitol Hill end up differing with Trump on the program’s future, congressional aides note that Congress — not the president — has funding authority. In another boon for Fort Worth this week, the Air Force selected a naval air base in the North Texas city to receive one of the first squadrons of F-35 Lightning II fighter jets, scheduled to begin arriving in the mid-2020s. Democratic Fort Worth Rep. Marc Veasey, a member of the House Armed Services committee, calls the F-35 program “the most important defense project we’ve seen in many generations.” “In order for us to continue to have the superior air capability and strike capability that we need going into the future to evade any new radar detections that are out there, we have to have F-35,” Veasey told The Dallas Morning News this week. “If we don’t have it, we’re going to be putting ourselves at very vulnerable risk,” he added, “and [Trump] should be more responsible with his tweets and the things he says because he’s affecting the livelihoods of 14,000 workers in the North Texas area and many more elsewhere.” Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Trump's choice for defense secretary, lauded the F-35 program in his Senate confirmation hearing this week, and several senators have said that Mattis gave them a "clear commitment" that he would continue the program.  In an op-ed for The Dallas Morning News, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas praised Mattis for telling him that he plans to ensure "the successful completion of a fifth-generation air-superiority platform."

Alaska Airlines announced free in-flight access to three popular messaging apps. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Apple’s iMessage will now work on GoGo Wi-Fi-equipped planes without charge, the airline said. “As a frequent traveler, it’s a nice perk to be able to stay connected with people either on the plane, or on the ground,” says retail technology executive Eric Belzer. “It will be very handy for people coordinating travel during unexpected changes." The new free service is available when accessing in-flight Wi-Fi with a smartphone. In addition to complimentary chat, Alaska Airlines is rolling out previously-announced premium economy service, and additional meal options. The carrier finalized a merger with Virgin America last month that made it the nation’s fifth-largest airline. The free chat option will be available only on Alaska Airlines-branded flights, but Alaska Airlines hinted that feature -- as well as other recent upgrades -- could expand. "Though these products are currently limited to flights operated by Alaska Airlines, customer response and feedback will inform future cabin enhancements and offerings on Alaska Airlines, Virgin America and Horizon Air-operated flights," the company said in a statement.

MSMEs are upbeat especially in the wake of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) signed during the summit that would lead to further opportunities in the aerospace and defence component manufacturing. For instance, several companies based of Gujarat, especially Saurashtra region who already supply precision components to aircraft manufacturers as well as defence and space agencies including ISRO are anticipating a rise in business by anywhere between 25 per cent and 40 per cent in the next 2-4 years. "With the likes of Airbus and Boeing signing MoUs in Gujarat, there is now an increased scope for precision component suppliers like us. We anticipate double-digit growth in business opportunities since the foreign OEMs are already familiar with India-based component manufacturers, even MSMEs," said Ashok Surelia, managing director of Surelia Wire-Cut Pvt Ltd. The defence and aerospace sector has seen at least over Rs 10,000 crore worth of MoUs being signed during VGGS. Among these, Reliance Defence and Deepak Fertilizer signed MoUs worth Rs 2,500 crore and Rs 3,000 crore for manufacturing set-ups in the state. On the other hand, Rajkot-based Jaivel Aerospace signed a MoU with Boeing for setting up a defence specific training centre under the Skill India program. "Amidst growing opportunities in the defence and aerospace sector, there will be need for trained manpower as well in future. The MoU has been signed keeping this requirement in mind," said Praveen Koti, head-business development of Jaivel Aerospace Ltd. The component manufacturers are also upbeat over union minister of defence Manohar Parrikar hinting at a possibility of government company setting up a unit in Gujarat that could also bring business for the former. While stating that around 20 companies have been granted licenses in defence manufacturing units in Gujarat, Parrikar also said that the minister would later visit the state to discuss possibilities of a defence PSU's foray here.

On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing's tally of 668 for the year released a week ago. Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight. While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country. It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions. Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing's planes will be delivered from 2018. Neither planemaker gave any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the U.S. planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources, who declined to be named, said the company's year-end numbers had been strictly audited. Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the U.S. export licences needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on U.S. parts. People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received U.S. export licences for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies. Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival's presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of U.S. Republican political opposition. During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran. The Iranian orders offer valuable respite from a slowdown in demand for both planemakers, with their combined new orders falling below deliveries for the first time since 2009. Boeing posted a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89 for 2016. This would be at exactly 1 if the Iranian deal were included, with 748 orders and just as many deliveries, company data shows. Airbus would fall below that threshold without the Iran order. Analysts said such margins show how relatively thin orders have become after a decade of mostly rampant growth, coinciding with growing indicators that the aerospace cycle is weakening. Airbus sales chief John Leahy warned this week orders would stay weak in 2017, but said deliveries which drive profits would continue to grow for some time on the back of older sales.

Carry on: Boeing's 737 orders, Airbus' late 2016 surge, new routes and more Nevil Gibson Friday January 13, 2017 Share B737 MAX 8 in Travel Service's livery Play NBR radio on Boeing snares 80-plus new 737 orders Boeing has kicked off the year with orders for more than 80 of its single-aisled aircraft. The largest is 75 B737 MAX 8 aircraft for GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the commercial aircraft leasing and financing arm of General Electric. The order, booked in December, is valued at $US8.25 billion at current list prices. The follow-on order increases the GECAS firm order book for the 737 MAX to 170 airplanes, the largest of any aircraft leasing company.  Travel Service, the Czech airline company that operates scheduled flights under the SmartWings brand, has finalised an order for five 737 8 MAX airplanes, valued at $US550 million at current list prices. Travel Service corporate charter planes fly to more than 300 airports on four continents. To date, the 737 MAX has accumulated 3419 orders, making it the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing history. South Korean budget carrier Jeju Air has ordered three Next-Generation 737-800s, valued at nearly $US300 million at current list prices. The aircraft are the first to be direct-purchased from Boeing. Jeju operates an all-Boeing fleet of 26 Next-Generation 737-800s. The new 737-800s feature the Boeing Sky Interior used in the 787 Dreamliner cabin, providing passengers a greater sense of spaciousness with decorative sculpted sidewalls, larger window reveals, LED mood lighting and larger pivot overhead stowage bins. Airbus beats Boeing in 2017 Meanwhile, Airbus posted an 8% rise in deliveries last year, beating its own forecasts by a comfortable margin to set a company record. It also pulled off a last-minute surge in orders to beat Boeing in the race for new orders. But Airbus warns of a further slowdown of industry orders in 2017 as the aerospace industry turns its attention to producing what it already has on its order books, following an extended order boom. Airbus says it delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with its most recent forecast of 670. Deliveries rebounded sharply at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. The first 2017 order has come from India’s Wadia Group, whose budget carrier GoAir has firmed up a contract for 72 A320neo aircraft. This doubles GoAir’s firm order book for the aircraft type to 144. GoAir now operates a fleet of 23 aircraft and with the new aircraft will expand its domestic network. It is the first airline to use an A320neo in the Spaceflex configuration with 186 seats without compromising on passenger leg room and comfort. To date, nine A320neo aircraft have been delivered to three customers. Air Canada, Cathay Pacific to codeshare Air Canada and Cathay Pacific have established a codeshare for flights in Southeast Asia and in Canada. From January 19, this will apply to flights from Hong Kong operated by Cathay Pacific (and Cathay Dragon)  to Bangkok, Cebu, Chiang Mai, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur, Manila  and Phuket. The Cathay Pacific code will also apply to flights operated by Air Canada (Air Canada Express) from Toronto to Halifax, Montréal, Ottawa, Quebec City, Regina, Saskatoon, St. John’s NFLD and Winnipeg; and from  Vancouver to Calgary, Edmonton, Kelowna , Montréal, Toronto and Victoria. Route news of the week – Part I Cathay Pacific will launch its second route to Spain from July 2. Subject to government approval, an Airbus A350-900XWB will operate the Hong Kong-Barcelona route, four times a week on a seasonal basis until October 27. Only a few weeks after introducing a San Francisco-Auckland, United Airlines is pulling back to a seasonal service. This means no flights between April 16 and October 28. However, United will increase its service from seven to 10 weekly in December 2017, tentatively using a Boeing 777-200ER. The route is operated in a joint venture with Air New Zealand. Route news of the week – Part II Qatar Airways has launched a four times weekly, non-stop Doha-Las Vegas service using a Boeing 777-200LR. Qatar is also expanding its A350 operation in Europe. New A350 routes are Doha-Barcelona from August 16, replacing a Boeing 787-8;  Doha-Madrid from September 30, with an increase from one to two-times daily; and  Doha-Zurich from May 2, replacing a B787-8, four times weekly. Emirates plans to resume its Airbus A380 service on the Dubai-Tokyo Narita route from March 26, replacing a B777-300ER. AirAsia X will launch a Kuala Lumpur-Wuhan (China) service from March 22, using an A330-300 aircraft four times a week. Russian carrier S7 Airlines is adding a Vladivostok-Osaka Kansai route from April 28. This will operate twice a week (once a week on selected periods) using an A320.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 3:20 AM, January 14, 2017 Updated: 8:00 AM, January 14, 2017 PARIS - Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus <AIR.PA> and Boeing <BA.N> have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market. On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing's tally of 668 for the year released a week ago. Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight. While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country. It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions. Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing's planes will be delivered from 2018. Neither planemaker gave any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the U.S. planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources, who declined to be named, said the company's year-end numbers had been strictly audited. Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the U.S. export licenses needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on U.S. parts. People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received U.S. export licenses for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies. Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival's presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of U.S. Republican political opposition. During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran. The Iranian orders offer valuable respite from a slowdown in demand for both planemakers, with their combined new orders falling below deliveries for the first time since 2009. Boeing posted a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89 for 2016. This would be at exactly 1 if the Iranian deal were included, with 748 orders and just as many deliveries, company data shows. Airbus would fall below that threshold without the Iran order. Analysts said such margins show how relatively thin orders have become after a decade of mostly rampant growth, coinciding with growing indicators that the aerospace cycle is weakening. Airbus sales chief John Leahy warned this week orders would stay weak in 2017, but said deliveries which drive profits would continue to grow for some time on the back of older sales.

The AFL-CIO, Air Line Pilots Association, Allied Pilots Association, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and Transportation Trades Department fought Norwegian since the airline applied for approval in December 2013. Norwegian Air International is a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of the largest low-cost carriers in Europe. Unions contend the subsidiary is headquartered in Ireland to undermine labor standards, mirroring the "flag of convenience" strategy that shipping companies use by registering vessels in the least-regulated countries. The airline strongly denies this claim. USA TODAY DOT approves contested Norwegian Air flights The legal dispute centers on language in so-called Open Skies agreements that the U.S. negotiates with other countries to allow unhindered flights between them. The unions note that a provision in the agreement with the European Union states “opportunities created by the agreement are not intended to undermine labor standards.” “The administration’s decision to allow Norwegian Air International to operate in the U.S. is disappointing and undercuts key protections in place for working men and women,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said. USA TODAY Delta optimistic Trump will deal with airports, Mideast rivals But the department ruled there was nothing in the Open Skies agreement to prevent approval of the application. “This case is among the most novel and complex ever undertaken by the department,” Jenny Rosenberg, acting assistant secretary for international affairs, wrote in the nine-page decision. “Regardless of our appreciation of the public policy arguments raised by opponents, we have been advised that the law and our bilateral obligations leave us no avenue to reject this application.” The department declined comment on the appeal because it is pending litigation. For its part, Norwegian has strongly objected to being characterized as cutting corners on safety or labor regulations. The airline contends it will benefit economies on both sides of the Atlantic by ordering $18.5 billion of Boeing aircraft and hiring hundreds of U.S. workers. Anders Lindström, a spokesman for Norwegian Air, called the appeal “a last-ditch effort to stop competition and new service.” But the airline looks forward to launching more flights between the U.S. and Europe, he said. “Other unions have also tried, unsuccessfully, to block similar DOT approvals,” Lindstrom said. “Norwegian remains confident that the D.C. Circuit will uphold DOT’s decision as fully consistent with DOT’s statutory obligations and international legal requirements.” USA TODAY WOW: $69 one-way fares to Europe now on sale IN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn September's #avgeek photo gallery  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Now what?    Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 2:04 PM ET | 01:46 Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson said on Friday the aerospace company is "close to a deal" to bring down the cost of its F-35 program following repeated criticisms from President-elect Donald Trump. "I certainly share [Trump's] views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform. And we need to get it at the lowest possible price," Hewson told reporters on Friday after a meeting at Trump Tower. "I'm glad I had an opportunity to tell him that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft for the next lot of aircraft," she said. "And, moreover, it's going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States. In fact, we're going to increase our jobs in Fort Worth by 1,800 jobs." Hewson's discussions with Trump mark her second such meeting. Trump has been critical of Lockheed's programs' delays and costs. In December, Trump said via Twitter that "billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases" once he takes office in January. During his press conference Wednesday, Trump criticized the F-35 program again and even suggested Boeing's F-18 fighter could be an alternative. "It's way, way behind schedule and many billions of dollars over budget," he said. "There's an attempt here to come to some sort of reconciliation (with Lockheed)," said Richard Safran, Buckingham Research Group director of equity research. He said there's "an expectation or hope on Lockheed's side that they can get the cost down similar to what Boeing promised for the F-18." The analyst said Trump's "heart seems to be in the right place to save taxpayer's money." Safran suggested one way to perhaps save money is to do a multiyear procurement on the F-35 instead of the current low-rate initial production lots. Indeed, if the government were to agree to a large block buy on the F-35 fighter it could change the economics of the aircraft's costs. Analysts say a large block buy could give Lockheed the chance to do a better deal with its partner contractors and supply base through a commitment of several years of production. Since his election, Trump has focused on defense costs. His comments have led to volatility in industry stocks such as Boeing and Lockheed. "This is just classic political posturing on both sides," said Moody's analyst Russell Solomon, who covers the aerospace and defense industry. "It won't have a discernible adverse impact on the company. But it's an indication that everything is in negotiation these days." Added Solomon, "The F-35 is critically important to the country in terms of global defense and NATO partners. A lot of interested parties here in making sure that this program continues and continues to grow as expected so that they can get the operating efficiencies that they've committed to." In a written statement issued after her meeting, Hewson said: "I look forward to continuing to work together with President-elect Trump to drive the costs down on this critical military capability." Hewson said the meeting with Trump was "outstanding" and plans to create "thousands and thousands" of jobs. She also said she gave the president-elect ideas on how to drive the program's cost down further. Lockheed has an earnings call coming up later this month and they will likely get asked by analysts about the outlook for the F-35 given Trump's recent criticism. "The question now is going to be what's your relationship with the president-elect and his transition team," said Safran. According to Safran, Lockheed's CEO has "a very good reputation within government circles. She has very good negotiating skills." Hewson inherited some of the problems with the F-35 from her predecessor. "She had to do a good job of smoothing over some ruffled feathers," Safran said. The F-35 stealth fighter program is expected to cost more than $1 trillion over its projected 55-year life cycle. Lockheed said Wednesday it delivered the 200th operational jet of the F-35 to Japan, one of the nine original partner nations buying the aircraft.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Airbus vs Boeing: Iran deals the difference in plane battle By Reuters Published: 13:46 EST, 13 January 2017 | Updated: 13:46 EST, 13 January 2017 e-mail By Tim Hepher PARIS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus and Boeing have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market. On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing's tally of 668 for the year released a week ago. Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight. While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country. It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions. Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing's planes will be delivered from 2018. Neither planemaker gave any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the U.S. planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources, who declined to be named, said the company's year-end numbers had been strictly audited. Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the U.S. export licences needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on U.S. parts. People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received U.S. export licences for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies. Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival's presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of U.S. Republican political opposition. During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran. The Iranian orders offer valuable respite from a slowdown in demand for both planemakers, with their combined new orders falling below deliveries for the first time since 2009. Boeing posted a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89 for 2016. This would be at exactly 1 if the Iranian deal were included, with 748 orders and just as many deliveries, company data shows. Airbus would fall below that threshold without the Iran order. Analysts said such margins show how relatively thin orders have become after a decade of mostly rampant growth, coinciding with growing indicators that the aerospace cycle is weakening. Airbus sales chief John Leahy warned this week orders would stay weak in 2017, but said deliveries which drive profits would continue to grow for some time on the back of older sales.

Try These 3 Stocks Boeing, Home Depot, and Walgreens are stocks for people with better things to do than constantly look at their portfolios. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Jan 13, 2017 at 12:46PM When it comes to your portfolio, you might not want to follow the advice of the old infomercial to "set it and forget it," but you also don't want to be checking in on your stock's performance obsessively. Following the daily up and down movements of a stock leads to trading in and out of a position -- and that usually leads to losing money. Image source: Getty Images. A better strategy might just be to fill your portfolio with companies whose businesses have healthy, long-term growth prospects that allow you to put them mostly on autopilot, knowing they'll largely treat you right over the long haul. If investing in businesses and not blips on a chart makes sense to you, then take a look at Boeing (NYSE:BA), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), as they should treat you right over the years. A good offense is having a great defense Aerospace and defense contractor Boeing came in for some pointed criticism recently from President-elect Donald Trump over the cost of two 747-8s that will serve as Air Force One. Saying he wanted Boeing to make money -- just "not that much money" -- Trump threatened to cancel the order. While that was likely more an idle threat, since canceling a contract for a plane that has no ready replacement isn't practical, Boeing wisely said it was willing to work with the president-elect on costs. Military aircraft comprise around 14% of Boeing's total revenues, and it's possible it could become a larger percentage if the administration follows through on its promise to rebuild the military, albeit with tighter cost controls in place. Image source: Boeing. Boeing's real moneymaker, of course, is commercial aircraft, which represents more than two-thirds of its revenues, and 2017 is looking as though it could be a record year for deliveries. Although it hit its target for deliveries last year, it came up a little short on orders, which some analysts think may portend an industry slowdown. But Boeing is seeing 737 production rise this year, growing from 42 planes a month to 47, its highest production level ever. It has a total backlog of over 5,700 commercial jets, more than three-quarters of which are 737s. Though Boeing may see 777 production decline, it should be able to soldier on through any period of sluggishness with these workhorse planes to maintain altitude. Building on success There are a few reasons why do-it-yourself home center Home Depot is beating rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). It's geared more toward the professional contractor than its blue-apron competitor, so when homebuilding and construction improves, as it has, Home Depot performs better. Equally important is that it's not as dependent upon big-ticket purchases as Lowe's. Where items like appliances account for 11% of Lowe's revenues, they amount to just 7% at Home Depot. Instead, it derives most of its sales from numerous small-item purchases: indoor garden represents 9% of total revenues (it's largest category) followed by paint, at 8%. That's a more sustainable model for the long term. Image source: Home Depot. Even though the two big-box stores have fairly similar store counts, Home Depot makes more sales per store than does Lowe's, generates more than twice the operating profit, and three times the net profit. While it also has considerably more long-term debt -- $22 billion vs. $14 billion -- its operations indicate it's more than able to service it without issue. Home Depot has had some ups and downs, but the long-running trend has been ever-higher valuations. With analysts expecting it to grow earnings at 13% annually over the next five years, there's no reason to think it won't keep the momentum going. Health and wellness pays With approval of its acquisition of rival Rite-Aid imminent, Walgreens Boots Alliance should continue to perform better than rival CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), which has experienced difficulties in gaining traction and saw its stock lose 10% of its value over the past year. Walgreens didn't set any records itself, but its shares gained 4% during the same period. Image source: Getty Images. Its fiscal first-quarter results saw domestic retail pharmacy sales rise 1.4%, with comparable sales up 1.1%. Pharmacy sales account for 69% of the division's total, and they rose 2.5% from last year as it filled 3.4% more prescriptions than it did a year ago. Its market share in the period for retail prescriptions rose 40 basis points, to 19.5%. Walgreens is expecting profits to jump in the back half of 2017 because it negotiated new deals last year to manage pharmacy benefits on behalf of major insurers and the U.S. government. Higher Medicare Part D volume was partially responsible for its better performance in the first quarter, but it recently signed a deal with the Defense Dept.'s Tricare plans that exclude CVS pharmacies, which will help it maintain its position as the biggest drugstore chain in the country. Find more important things to do These three stocks are great examples of businesses that can be owned without needing to be "helicopter investors," or people who constantly hover over their portfolios. Sure, read through a company's quarterly reports to make sure the long-term investment thesis remains intact, but then use the rest of your time to find other, more meaningful pursuits.   Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Graphic - Boeing aircraft deliveries reut.rs/2j7qSxc Meanwhile Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source familiar with the deal had said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing had already reported an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally, and on Friday confirmed that order to be SpiceJet's. Shares in SpiceJet rose as much as 3 percent on Friday. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of more than 40 planes, will take delivery of the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders."As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," said Singh.He said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt or raising equity to pay for the planes. The new aircraft increases the range of SpiceJet's flights by up to one hour, opening up many more destinations, including international ones, Singh told reporters.He said the additional acquisition rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. Most Indian carriers have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

The multi-billion dollar deal struck after long-drawn discussions will see the airline buying more fuel-efficient 155 Boeing planes, with the delivery slated to start from 2018. With the earlier order for 55 planes and additional 100 new 737-8 MAX aircraft, the no-frills carrier now has firmed up order for a total of 155 planes. SpiceJet will also have the rights to purchase 50 more aircraft comprising B737-8 MAX and wide-bodied ones -- the latter likely to be used for possible "low-cost long haul" operations in future. Announcing the deal here today, SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said the total order of 205 aircraft is valued at Rs 1,50,000 crore (USD 22 billion). "This is one of the largest deals in Indian aviation and the largest for SpiceJet," he said. Currently, the budget carrier has 32 next generation B737s and 17 Bombardier Q400s. In less than a month, this is the second big announcement after rival GoAir firmed up the order for 72 new planes from Airbus that is estimated to be worth over Rs 52,000 crore amid the domestic market growing at the fastest pace in the world. According to Singh, SpiceJet will explore different options for financing the deal. Singh said the induction of the new aircraft, which burn 20 per cent less fuel, will help SpiceJet reduce costs and enhance its ability to compete. After being on the verge of going belly up two years ago, the airline has been in the black for the past seven straight quarters. Delivery of the 155 new planes will start from the third quarter of 2018 and end in 2024. Boeing's Senior Vice-President Sales (Asia Pacific and India) Dinesh Keskar put the cost of the 100 new aircraft at around USD 11 billion. As part of the deal, SpiceJet in collaboration with Boeing will set up a simulator facility -- which is expected to be ready in 2018 -- for pilot training. Incidentally, aviation regulator DGCA has mandated domestic airlines having more than 20 planes to ensure that they have at least one simulator facility in the country.

Incidentally, aviation regulator DGCA has mandated domestic airlines having more than 20 planes to ensure that they have at least one simulator facility in the country.

The Chicago-based group is going to initially supply another 155 of its latest 737 Max 8 jets to the Indian budget airline SpiceJet, which also has the option to buy 50 more. The commitment is the largest ever received by Boeing from an Indian airline and comes at a time when both Boeing and its major rival, Airbus, are seeing a slowdown in sales. It will also help the company to get its own back on Airbus, which already supplies aircraft to several Indian airlines. "We're honored to be here in India in a big way, and this is truly a demonstration of that commitment... to our partners and to the country of India," Boeing vice chairman Ray Conner said Friday. The new planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2024, the two parties said. India is seen as an important emerging market for aircraft manufacturers, with its booming economy and rapidly growing middle class meaning more Indians are taking to the skies than ever before.

Conner, vice-chairman of Boeing Company, at a press conference in New Delhi yesterday. Published: 19:32 January 13, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE New Delhi/Singapore: Boeing Co. won a $22 billion (Dh80 billion) deal from an Indian budget carrier, pulling off a feat in a single-aisle market ruled by its European rival Airbus SE. SpiceJet Ltd. plans to buy 155 planes, of which 55 were carried over from old orders after renegotiations, the airline, based in Gurgaon near New Delhi, said in a statement on Friday. It also has options for 50 more, including wide-body aircraft. The commitment, the largest for Boeing from an Indian airline, comes at a time when both the Chicago-based plane maker and Airbus are facing slowing sales and the highest level of delivery deferrals in at least 15 years following a decade-long shopping spree by jetliners. It will also help Boeing widen its footprint in the South Asian country, where most of SpiceJet’s low-cost rivals fly Airbus planes. “Outside of India, Boeing has been doing reasonably well in Asia, with the exception of China,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “Airbus has enjoyed a strong advantage in India, particularly since Airbus is strongest in single aisles, and the Indian market is heavily weighted towards single aisles.” Though Boeing sold fewer jets than it delivered last year as it navigated a market downturn, demand for the narrow-body planes such as the 737 Max remained strong. India needs 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in 20 years, with single-aisle planes making up a bulk of the new deliveries, according to Boeing forecasts. Asia Pacific will need 15,130 new aeroplanes valued at $2.3 trillion in the next 20 years, as economic growth in the region boosts middle-class population. That’s 38 per cent of the global estimate of 39,620 aircraft, according to Boeing’s outlook. Friday’s deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the Chicago-based plane maker in India. SpiceJet and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in India, while IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt. and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all fly Airbus jets. SpiceJet shares jumped as much as 4.2 per cent after the deal was announced. After knocking off the options, a previously unfulfilled and renegotiated deal for 42 jets and an earlier undisclosed order for 13 planes, SpiceJet’s firm orders are for 100 737 Max 8 aircraft, which at list prices are worth about $11 billion before discounts. Bloomberg News reported on January 6 the carrier was close to signing a deal for at least 92 planes valued at $10.1 billion, and may boost the total if final talks yield substantial discounts and favourable maintenance contracts. Getting it right “We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalising the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft,” Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview, adding deliveries will start July 2018 through 2024. “It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right.” For SpiceJet, the order signals its resurgence after almost collapsing more than two years ago. The expansion will help it compete against IndiGo, which has some 400-odd aircraft pending delivery from Airbus and controls the world’s fastest-growing major aviation market with a 42 per cent share. A representative for Airbus declined to comment. SpiceJet currently operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. It controls 13 per cent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past five years. India, where an emerging middle-class is flying for the first time and passenger traffic is growing at double the pace of nearest rival China, is a crucial market for Boeing and Airbus. In 2015, IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., ordered 250 planes from Airbus valued at $27 billion. That followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes and 180 A320neos in 2011. While the potential for growth is prompting airlines in the country to order more planes, they also have a challenge to tackle: Airport infrastructure that hasn’t kept pace with the times. Limited landing and parking slots mean longer time spent circling above airports such as Mumbai during peak hours, wasting precious fuel. “India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can’t ignore,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order would give Boeing “a lifeline. There’s a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia.” More from Aviation Indian airlines soar but infrastructure lacks Boeing scores a $22b win with SpiceJet deal SpiceJet to buy 100 new Boeing planes Flynas in $8.6b Airbus deal, shareholder says Emirates to launch daily flight to Croatia Boeing jumbo-jet era ending in US SpiceJet in $10b deal with Boeing for 737 jets Thousands of travellers face fog-induced delays tags from this storyIndia follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsIndia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGN FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Indian airlines soar but infrastructure lacks 02US won’t push antitrust case against airlines 03‘Emirates challenging us for future A380’ 04Thousands of travellers face fog-induced delays 05Safest airlines to fly with in 2017 revealed 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 8Images World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi Jan 18, 2010 7Images Keeping Burj Khalifa sparkling Dec 29, 2009 1Image Preparations underway for WEF in Davos Jan 22, 2013 Play How to protect your device from hackers May 26, 2016 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News 9 ways your own home could kill you Manholes being used as warehouses found Sharjah opens new Dh400 million jail How to rent a car by the minute in Dubai ‘Diplomat’ denies kidnap, Dh2m theft Businessman donates Dh370m to charity Revealed: World's most powerful passports Palestinian state only solution: Paris meeting Bahrain executes 3 for killing police officers Close Recommended For You 8 men own half of global wealth: OxfamPUBLISHED ON Jan 16, 2017 Kohli, Jadhav centuries help India beat EnglandPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 9 ways your own home could kill youPUBLISHED ON Jan 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The airline said the order is confirmed for 155 Boeing 737-8 MAX, of which 55 were ordered earlier, and purchase rights for 50 737-8 MAX and wide-body long haul planes that could possibly be used by the airline to launch low-cost international services. The first aircraft of this order will be delivered in the third quarter of 2018 and all aircraft are to be in by 2024. At present, SpiceJet has 32 B-737s and 17 Bombardier Q400s in its fleet. The Indian aviation market is booming with aircraft orders as only on Wednesday, another low-cot airline GoAir announced that it is buying 72 A320neo from Airbus for around $7.7 billion. In November 2015, Jet had announced the order for 75 737 MAX single aisle aircraft from Boeing for $8,250 million while IndiGo in August same year firmed up a $25.7 billion order for 250 A320neo aircraft. While the order shows the growth trajectory of SpiceJet, which was on the verge of closing down in December 2014 following deep financial troubles, it also gives Boeing a boost in India where rival aircraft manufacturer Airbus has a foothold. A buoyant SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said the airline’s turnaround story has been one which has “very few parallels” and that they are “very thrilled” on this “incredible day”. “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations,” Singh said. Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner said it was a “tremendous day” and that the “economics of the 737 MAXs will allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectivity within India and beyond.” Singh believes that the induction of the new aircraft, which burn 20% less fuel, would help SpiceJet reduce costs and enhance its ability to compete.

Companies line up to provide air force's new wings 5:00 AM Saturday Jan 14, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Defence Ministry of Defence New Zealand Politics Royal NZ Air Force Kawasaki P-1. Photo / Supplied Our next military transport could be built by Kawasaki. And the aircraft which patrol our maritime borders could come off the same factory line. The Japanese company is among contenders as the NZ Defence Force prepares to replace some of its oldest and most essential kit. Among them is the Hercules transporter which has been in Royal NZ Air Force service since 1965. The other main aircraft being replaced is the P-3K2 Orion patrol plane, introduced in 1966 although recently refitted with state-of-the-art surveillance systems. Defence chiefs are working through options at the moment but the Japanese government is sounding bullish over its prospects. A Japanese official was quoted in the Nikkei Asian Review saying the contest to replace the patrol plane was a "one-on-one fight with Boeing's P-8 patrol plane". The news agency reported that "representatives from Japan's defense ministry and Kawasaki Heavy are in New Zealand for negotiations". The claim prompted an NZDF spokesman to say: "Defence is not involved in any negotiations with the Japanese Government or Kawasaki Heavy Industries." The pitch by Kawasaki might not yet be at "negotiation" level but the Japanese company is considered a front-runner alongside Airbus, Boeing and the Brazilian company Embraer. The heightened speculation comes after Japan took the opportunity to offer the Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft to survey Kaikoura and affected areas after the November quake. The aircraft was here for the Royal NZ Navy's 75th celebrations. Continued below.

The Hercules is a key component of NZDF's ability to transport troops and supplies across the Pacific. While it is also able to - albeit slowly - move troops and equipment across the world, its primary role is to provide "tactical" airlift in New Zealand's zone of influence. The P-3K2 is a critical component of protecting New Zealand's economic zone, not only providing military support to NZDF but surveillance information to the Ministry of Primary Industries, NZ Customs and Police. While much of the work of the aircraft happens outside the headlines, both the Hercules and Orion often emerge when disaster strikes - needle-in-a-haystack search-and-rescue missions in the Pacific, natural disaster relief and humanitarian missions. The common theme in the Kawasaki and other proposed replacements for the Hercules is a comparable cost, lift and size. The Kawasaki C-2 is believed to cost $115 million each, while the Brazilian Embraer's KC-390 has been priced about $120m. Airbus has developed the Atlas, costing about $220m while Lockheed Martin has updated the Hercules with the C-130J 'Super Hercules' at $140m a piece. There had been speculation NZDF would seek out a C-17 Globemaster, with Parliament's foreign affairs and defence select committee members going for a ride in one in February 2015. The much larger aircraft - of which none are currently believed available for sale - needs much longer runways, carries twice as much cargo and costs about $300m each. The NZDF spokesman said it was considering a number of options to replace the P-3K2 and the Hercules. "A large number of possible suppliers from several countries have responded to the initial Requests for Information (RFI) issued last year, and the ministry expects to get a decision from Government on preferred options and call for tenders mid-2018."

The deal includes 100 new Boeing 737 Max 8 airliners, plus a current order for 42 of the same planes still in production and 13 new 737 Max airliners. The deal includes SpiceJet securing the right to 50 more planes in the future. SpiceJet is India's fourth-largest airliner and flies an exclusive Boeing fleet. "We are honored to build upon more than a decade of partnership with SpiceJet with their commitment of up to 205 airplanes," said Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner. "The economics of the 737 MAXs will allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond, and offer their customers a superior passenger experience." The first of the 737s will be delivered to SpiceJet in 2018, Boeing said. "This is the largest deal for SpiceJet, it's one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India," SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh told the BBC. "We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations."

News Business Business News Donald Trump: New mobile app will alert investors to the President-elect's market-moving tweets Since his election victory the President-elect has sent shares in companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Toyota and Pfizer reeling into the red Zlata Rodionova Friday 13 January 2017 16:01 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Picture: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Every time President-elect Donald Trump tweets, the markets listen. Since his election victory he has sent shares in companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Toyota and Pfizer reeling into the red, shaving off billions of dollars from their market value in minutes with just 140 characters or fewer. Read more Toyota loses $1.2bn in value five minutes after Donald Trump’s tweet While investors can’t do much to predict the President-elect’s next move, one tech company has just launched a special feature on an app that will send users alerts each time Mr Trump tweets about a publically listed company. Trigger, a start-up with staff in San Francisco and London, has launched a feature on its trading app which sends so-called “Trump triggers” alerting traders to the President-elect’s latest comments, based on which they can then trade. “These triggers can help you capture moves or manage your holdings based on the market’s reaction to the future president’s remarks,” the company says on its website. Trigger said it had rolled out the new feature because of the incoming president’s potential to “eradicate billions of dollars in market cap from large companies.” Earlier in January, Toyota became the latest company to face Mr Trump’s wrath. Shares in the Japanese automaker shares plummeted within minutes of a negative tweet from the former Apprentice host, causing the company to lose around $1.2 billion in value.  More about: Donald Trump Toyota Lockheed Martin Boeing Pfizer Twitter app Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

The carrier already has an order for 42 737 MAX 8s on Boeing’s books. The new order, announced Jan. 13, adds a further 100 MAX 8s that were booked at the end of 2016, 13 additional MAXs that Boeing’s had previously attributed to an unidentified customer, plus purchase rights for 50 more aircraft. This takes SpiceJet’s orders and commitments to a total of 205 aircraft. Gurgaon-based SpiceJet already operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737-800 and -900ERs, together with around 20 Bombardier Q400s in service or on order for shorter sectors. “The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began,” SpiceJet chairman and MD Ajay Singh said.  “With the next generation of 737 and the 737 MAX, we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably.” SpiceJet placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation 737s.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UScxBg ALSO READ SpiceJet plans to add Boeing 4-5 aircraft to its fleet SpiceJet to buy 100 planes from Boeing as it prepares for long-haul flights Boeing says its 787 aircraft a big help to Air India Boeing says India needs 1,850 planes Expanding its relationship with Boeing, domestic low-cost carrier SpiceJet has announced a fresh order for 150 aircraft from the American aerospace company. Today's purchase decision, along with an earlier order of 55 aircraft from Spicejet, makes it a $22-billion deal, probably the largest commercial aircraft deal for Boeing in India. Of the total orders placed on Friday, the order for 100 Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft is firm, while the purchase of 50 wide-body long-haul aircraft is purchase rights (optional). MAX aircraft allows a five-hour flight and will allow the company to explore new international destinations. "SpiceJet will have purchase rights for the remaining 50 aircraft, which will be converted depending on the airline's capability to add long-haul aircraft in the future," said Ajay Singh, chairman of SpiceJet. Singh chose Boeing over Airbus for this order. "Boeing gave us an extremely commercial and aggressive offer." Deliveries for the aircraft will begin in the third quarter of the calendar year 2018 and will be completed by 2024. It is not immediately clear how the company will finance the purchase of these aircraft. "There are various financing models available. One of them is the sale-and-leaseback model. The other models available are funding through EXIM Bank and foreign debt, which are cheaper," said Singh. He said the airline would not opt for debt or equity route to fund the purchases. "The new aircraft order is on expected lines and significant directionally. A positive and long-term story is likely to emerge with this order," said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer and director at CAPA, South Asia. Spicejet currently has a share of 12.8 per cent in the domestic aviation market and is looking to expand share. Singh, however, said the company is not after market share and is squarely aiming for profitable operations. "One of the problems of the previous management was that they went after market share, even if by losing money." SpiceJet posted a record profit of Rs 59 crore in the Q2 of FY17. Singh has worked on cost reduction by renegotiating various contracts and streamlining operations. It has beefed up its ancillary revenues from single-digit a year ago to 16 per cent now. Benign fuel prices also helped. Spicejet's stock gained 2.5 per cent to close at Rs 65.5 on the BSE on Friday even as the market ended flat. SpiceJet, which was on the verge of a closure in late 2014 has seen a quick turnaround under Singh. Singh, who took over the company from Marans, grew market share from 9 to 13 per cent in 2016 calendar year. The budget carrier has a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 aircraft and 17 Bombardier aircraft. Singh said the company is looking at adding aircraft in their Bombardier fleet too and is speaking to Bombardier, ATR and Embraer. On Fuel prices We feel that it (crude oil) will still remain in the range of $60-65 a barrel mark, said Singh. The company said it is comfortable and allows the company to pass minor fluctuations. However, beyond a point, the demand gets impacted. "If it crosses $70, it starts hurting." Regarding on time performance "I don't understand what the controversy is all about. This is the same data that had been used by the same airline (Indigo) saying they are number one for years," he said. "I am happy for anybody to evaluate the data. We are only quoting the government data." On FDI Norms No other country allows 100 per cent FDI in aviation and it takes away the level playing field. It creates problems in bilaterals. "We are not allowed the same privilege outside. We hope the government will take an appropriate decision," Singh said.   Read More On Spicejet | Boeing | Max Aircraft | Capa PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements New to the stock market?

Alaska Airlines announced free in-flight access to three popular messaging apps. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Apple’s iMessage will now work on GoGo Wi-Fi-equipped planes without charge, the airline said. “As a frequent traveler, it’s a nice perk to be able to stay connected with people either on the plane, or on the ground,” says retail technology executive Eric Belzer. “It will be very handy for people coordinating travel during unexpected changes." The new free service is available when accessing in-flight Wi-Fi with a smartphone. In addition to complimentary chat, Alaska Airlines is rolling out previously-announced premium economy service, and additional meal options. The carrier finalized a merger with Virgin America last month that made it the nation’s fifth-largest airline. The free chat option will be available only on Alaska Airlines-branded flights, but Alaska Airlines hinted that feature -- as well as other recent upgrades -- could expand. "Though these products are currently limited to flights operated by Alaska Airlines, customer response and feedback will inform future cabin enhancements and offerings on Alaska Airlines, Virgin America and Horizon Air-operated flights," the company said in a statement.

The AFL-CIO, Air Line Pilots Association, Allied Pilots Association, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and Transportation Trades Department fought Norwegian since the airline applied for approval in December 2013. Norwegian Air International is a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of the largest low-cost carriers in Europe. Unions contend the subsidiary is headquartered in Ireland to undermine labor standards, mirroring the "flag of convenience" strategy that shipping companies use by registering vessels in the least-regulated countries. The airline strongly denies this claim. USA TODAY DOT approves contested Norwegian Air flights The legal dispute centers on language in so-called Open Skies agreements that the U.S. negotiates with other countries to allow unhindered flights between them. The unions note that a provision in the agreement with the European Union states “opportunities created by the agreement are not intended to undermine labor standards.” “The administration’s decision to allow Norwegian Air International to operate in the U.S. is disappointing and undercuts key protections in place for working men and women,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said. USA TODAY Delta optimistic Trump will deal with airports, Mideast rivals But the department ruled there was nothing in the Open Skies agreement to prevent approval of the application. “This case is among the most novel and complex ever undertaken by the department,” Jenny Rosenberg, acting assistant secretary for international affairs, wrote in the nine-page decision. “Regardless of our appreciation of the public policy arguments raised by opponents, we have been advised that the law and our bilateral obligations leave us no avenue to reject this application.” The department declined comment on the appeal because it is pending litigation. For its part, Norwegian has strongly objected to being characterized as cutting corners on safety or labor regulations. The airline contends it will benefit economies on both sides of the Atlantic by ordering $18.5 billion of Boeing aircraft and hiring hundreds of U.S. workers. Anders Lindström, a spokesman for Norwegian Air, called the appeal “a last-ditch effort to stop competition and new service.” But the airline looks forward to launching more flights between the U.S. and Europe, he said. “Other unions have also tried, unsuccessfully, to block similar DOT approvals,” Lindstrom said. “Norwegian remains confident that the D.C. Circuit will uphold DOT’s decision as fully consistent with DOT’s statutory obligations and international legal requirements.” USA TODAY WOW: $69 one-way fares to Europe now on sale IN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn September's #avgeek photo gallery  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The commitment, the largest ever for Boeing from an Indian airline, comes at a time when both the Chicago-based planemaker and Airbus are facing slowing sales and the highest level of delivery deferrals in at least 15 years following a decade-long shopping spree by jetliners. It will also help Boeing widen its footprint in the South Asian country, where most of SpiceJet's low-cost rivals fly Airbus planes. "Outside of India, Boeing has been doing reasonably well in Asia, with the exception of China," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. "Airbus has enjoyed a strong advantage in India, particularly since Airbus is strongest in single aisles, and the Indian market is heavily weighted towards single aisles." Though Boeing sold fewer jets than it delivered last year as it navigated a market downturn, demand for the narrow-body planes such as the 737 Max remained strong. India needs 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in 20 years, with single-aisle planes making up a bulk of the new deliveries, according to Boeing forecasts. Asia Pacific will need 15,130 new airplanes valued at $2.3 trillion in the next 20 years, as economic growth in the region boosts middle-class population. That's 38 percent of the global estimate of 39,620 aircraft, according to Boeing's outlook. Friday's deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the Chicago-based planemaker in India. SpiceJet and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in India, while IndiGo, Go Airlines India and the local unit of AirAsia all fly Airbus jets.

(Anurag Kotoky and Julie Johnsson) SpiceJet shares jumped as much as 4.2 percent after the deal was announced. After knocking off the options, a previously unfulfilled and renegotiated deal for 42 jets and an earlier undisclosed order for 13 planes, SpiceJet's firm orders are for 100 737 Max 8 aircraft, which at list prices are worth about $11 billion before discounts. Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 6 that the carrier was close to signing a deal for at least 92 planes valued at $10.1 billion, and may boost the total if final talks yield substantial discounts and favorable maintenance contracts. "We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalizing the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft," Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview, adding deliveries will start July 2018 through 2024. "It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right." For SpiceJet, the order signals its resurgence after almost collapsing more than two years ago. The expansion will help it compete against IndiGo, which has some 400-odd aircraft pending delivery from Airbus and controls the world's fastest-growing major aviation market with a 42 percent share. A representative for Airbus declined to comment. SpiceJet currently operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. It controls 13 percent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past five years. India, where an emerging middle-class is flying for the first time and passenger traffic is growing at double the pace of nearest rival China, is a crucial market for Boeing and Airbus. In 2015, IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation, ordered 250 planes from Airbus valued at $27 billion. That followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes and 180 A320neos in 2011. While the potential for growth is prompting airlines in the country to order more planes, they also have a challenge to tackle: Airport infrastructure that hasn't kept pace with the times. Limited landing and parking slots mean longer time spent circling above airports such as Mumbai during peak hours, wasting precious fuel. "India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can't ignore," said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order would give Boeing "a lifeline. There's a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia." Bloomberg's Julie Johnsson and Debjit Chakraborty contributed. Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Asia India Bloomberg L.P.

With this deal, SpiceJet has enhanced its existing order of 55 aircraft with additional 100 firm B737-8 MAX and 50 purchase rights for B737-8 MAX and wide-body aircraft. An agreement with SpiceJet, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet had placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation B737s and currently operates 32 Next-Generation B737s in its fleet and 17 Bombardier Q400s. Announcing the deal here today, SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said, “Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today and we are proud of it. SpiceJet has achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on-time performance and lowest cancellation rates; a record load factor of over 90% every month for 20 months in a row – a feat that has no parallel in aviation history." “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations,” Singh said. “The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began, with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort. With the next generation of B737 and the B737 MAX we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably,” he added. The B737 MAX incorporates the latest technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets and other improvements to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market. The new airplane will deliver 20 percent lower fuel use than the first Next-Generation B737s and the lowest operating costs in its class – 8 percent per seat less than its nearest competitor. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for plane makers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

SpiceJet placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation B737s and currently operates 32 Next-Generation B737s in its fleet and 17 Bombardier Q400s. Deliveries of the aircraft will start in July 2018 and the entire order will be delivered to Spicejet by year 2024. “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations,” said Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet. Boeing claims that the new airplane will consume 20 per cent less fuel than the first Next-Generation B737s and the lowest operating costs in its class – eight per cent per seat less than its nearest competitor. The deal is major breakthrough for Boeing as currently Airbus dominates the Indian as well as other Asian markets. SpiceJet and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in India, while IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt. and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all fly Airbus jets. Currently, Airbus and Boeing are facing slowing sales and highest level of delivery deferral due to decrease in profit margin of airline companies. It is estimated that India needs 1,850 new aircraft worth $ 265 Billion in next 20 years with small aircraft expected to dominate the market. Aircraft manufacturers from Russia and Japan plan to enter $300 Billion Indian market which is mainly dominated by Airbus and Boeing. Russia wants to introduce Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SSJ100) civilian aircraft in India and has a target to put out at least 50 SSJ100 in the next three to five years. Japan’s ShinMaywa is also exploring the possibilities in Indian Market. In 2015, Airbus had seal a deal worth $ 27 bn with Indigo, India’s biggest budget carrier to deliver 250 aircraft preceded by a deal in 2006 for 100 A-320 planes and 180 A-320neos in 2011.

The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "This is an extremely competitive market," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. "What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs," said Singh, whose airline has about 13 percent of the Indian passenger market, while market leader IndiGo has 40 percent. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. Combined, local airlines like IndiGo, as well as GoAir, have already ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. Graphic - Boeing aircraft deliveries http://reut.rs/2j7qSxc Meanwhile Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source familiar with the deal had said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing had already reported an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally, and on Friday confirmed that order to be SpiceJet's. Shares in SpiceJet rose as much as 3 percent on Friday. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of more than 40 planes, will take delivery of the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders.

He said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt or raising equity to pay for the planes.

SpiceJet plots expansion with order for 100 new Boeing planes NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian budget airline SpiceJet said on Friday it has agreed to acquire 100 new MAX 737 aircraft from Boeing, with an option for 50 more, as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest growing aviation market. By Aditi Shah and Tommy Wilkes NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian budget airline SpiceJet said on Friday it has agreed to acquire 100 new MAX 737 aircraft from Boeing, with an option for 50 more, as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest growing aviation market. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "This is an extremely competitive market," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. "What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs," said Singh, whose airline has about 13 percent of the Indian passenger market, while market leader IndiGo has 40 percent. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. Combined, local airlines like IndiGo, as well as GoAir, have already ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. Graphic - Boeing aircraft deliveries http://reut.rs/2j7qSxc Meanwhile Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source familiar with the deal had said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing had already reported an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally, and on Friday confirmed that order to be SpiceJet's. Shares in SpiceJet rose as much as 3 percent on Friday. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of more than 40 planes, will take delivery of the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. "As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," said Singh.

The buyouts are the first of what's expected to be three rounds of cutbacks, according to the Seattle Times. The company is also planning to layoff engineers in Washington state, where it has a large aerospace presence. The exact number of projected cuts were not announced. The state's largest aerospace company, Boeing employs some 2,750 people in Alabama, with an annual payroll of $264 million. Most of Boeing's Alabama operations are in North Alabama, where the company works with NASA and missile defense. Boeing engineers, managers and executives were reportedly told of the cuts in a memo sent out Tuesday. Other cuts could also be coming to production-level employees. The memo from John Hamilton, Boeing's Vice President of Engineering, said the buyout offers will be sent this week to engineering employees in all divisions of the company. Employees who accept the buyouts will end their employment April 21. The company isn't ruling out involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the buyout offer.

It will be able to expand into long-haul flights. Indian low-cost airline Spicejet announced Friday it was buying up to 205 planes from Boeing in a deal worth $22 billion (20.6 billion euros). The carrier said the contract included 100 737 jets from Boeing's new Max family of aircraft, which it said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. The deal also included the option to buy 50 wide-body planes suitable for long-haul flights. Spicejet, which currently has just 49 planes, said the order would enable it to boost its domestic operations and potentially expand into long-haul international flights. "This is the largest deal for Spicejet, it's one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India," Spicejet Chairman Ajay Singh said in a statement.

According to the airline, the order is worth $22 billion or Rs 150,000 crore at list prices. It was not disclosed whether the budget passenger carrier received any discounts which manufacturers generally dole out on such large orders. The company said that it is looking at various mechanisms to fund the purchase deal, including the sale and lease back option. “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which include both domestic and international routes and destinations,” said Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of SpiceJet. The mega purchase order comes at a time when the country’s civil aviation sector is witnessing a healthy growth rate due to a rise in domestic disposable income, lower jet fuel prices and enhanced services to the non-metro cities. According to the latest data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), passenger traffic during January-November 2016 zoomed by 23.10 per cent to 90.36 million. The robust passenger traffic growth has led several airlines to place mega aircraft orders keeping in mind the future demand scenario. The agreement enhances the company’s earlier commitment to buy 55 aircraft with an additional order for 100 B737-8 MAX. The deal also includes purchase rights to buy 50 more B737-8 MAX and wide-body aircraft in the future. SpiceJet had placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation B737s. “The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began, with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort. With the next generation of B737 and the B737 MAX, we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably,” Singh elaborated. The order was in the pipeline as Singh in an earlier interaction with IANS had made it clear that the decision will not be taken in haste. The deal has ended months of speculation on whether SpiceJet will place an order with Boeing or Airbus. Besides, the order comes more than two years after a financial crisis had led the airline to the brink of closure and subsequent change in management and a dramatic turnaround. The airline’s fleet size during late 2014 stood at 55 before a financial crisis forced it to truncate it to 43 now. This includes smaller aircraft, as the carrier also sees growth in the regional segment. Currently, the airline operates 32 Next-Generation B737s and 17 Bombardier Q400s. On November 25, 2016, SpiceJet reported its seventh consecutive profitable quarter. “Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today and we are proud of it,” Singh maintained. “SpiceJet has achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on-time performance and lowest cancellation rates; a record load factor of over 90 per cent every month for 20 months in a row – a feat that has no parallel in aviation history.” The B737 MAX incorporates the latest technology ‘CFM International LEAP-1B engines’, advanced technology winglets and other improvements to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market. The new airplane type consumes 20 per cent less fuel than the first Next-Generation B737s and the lowest operating costs in its class — eight per cent per seat less than its nearest competitor. The company is expected to receive the first aircraft under the purchase agreement by the third quarter of 2018. In November the airline had the fourth largest domestic market share at 12.8 per cent. At present, SpiceJet operates 336 average daily flights to 45 destinations, including 39 domestic and six international. –IANS rv/vt Tags Ajay Singh cent growth orders CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts Petrol price hiked by 42 paise a litre, diesel by Rs 1.03 Jan 15th, 201702 New Delhi, Jan 16 (IANS) Following the recent spurt in oil prices to well over $50 a barrel, state-run...

REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis/File PhotoMore By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Qatar Airways said on Thursday it was seeking guarantees from a potential new engine supplier after delays to Airbus jet deliveries, but said Boeing was ahead of schedule on its latest version of the 777, leaving scope to bring those jets forward. The comments from one of the industry's toughest buyers reflect the stakes involved in meeting manufacturing targets for large aerospace industry orders after a series of costly delays. Qatar Airways remains in talks with CFM International about supplying engines for an upgraded order for Airbus Group's A321neo medium-haul jets, which it expects to finalise "soon", Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told Reuters. The carrier has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by delayed engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies , and plans to swap the overall aircraft order, which originally covered 50 jets, to the larger A321neo. CFM, owned by General Electric and France's Safran , competes with Pratt & Whitney to power Airbus' medium-haul jets. Al Baker acknowledged Qatar had received competitive launch prices when it originally ordered Pratt & Whitney engines, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees. "It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance," he said in an interview. Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, in which it aims to buy 49 percent. Qatar is also one of the launch customers for the newest Boeing long-haul jet, the 777-9, formerly code-named 777-9X. Boeing plans to deliver the 406-seat jet from 2020, but aviation news site FlightGlobal reported last year it could advance deliveries to late 2019 due to spare cushion in the development schedule. "We have already told Boeing that as they are bringing ahead the (777-)9X deliveries, we would be interested. The 777-9X programme is ahead of schedule and we have no problem if they want to bring our deliveries ahead,” Al Baker said. A Boeing spokesman said: "Development of the 777X programme is progressing to plan and we will deliver to the schedule we committed to our airline customers." FUEL SURCHARGES Al Baker was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, the airline's third such facility abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai. It is also building lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and negotiating space in seven other airports. The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity. Qatar Airways plans to unveil a new premium cabin in March and is investing an unspecified amount to attract passengers "with the right yield," Al Baker said. But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda. "(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up," he said. "Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly." Oil prices have risen 20 percent in three months. Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. The carrier plans to serve Nice five times per week from July and expects to announce a similar service to Lyon soon. It also continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added.

Advertisement Boeing Co. won a $22 billion deal from an Indian budget carrier, pulling off a feat in a single-aisle market ruled by its European rival Airbus SE. SpiceJet Ltd. plans to buy 155 planes, of which 55 were carried over from old orders after renegotiations, the airline based in Gurgaon near New Delhi said in a statement on Friday. It also has options for 50 more, including wide-body aircraft. The commitment, the largest ever for Boeing (IW 500/9) from an Indian airline, comes at a time when both the Chicago-based planemaker and Airbus are facing slowing sales and the highest level of delivery deferrals in at least 15 years following a decade-long shopping spree by jetliners. It will also help Boeing widen its footprint in the South Asian country, where most of SpiceJet’s low-cost rivals fly Airbus planes.

India needs 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in 20 years, with single-aisle planes making up a bulk of the new deliveries, according to Boeing forecasts. 748 deliveries, 668 net orders & a backlog of over 5,700! Check out all of our 2016 numbers here: https://t.co/9f35Mlz4Jv pic.twitter.com/856oPbn6bZ — Boeing Airplanes (@BoeingAirplanes) January 6, 2017 Asia Pacific will need 15,130 new airplanes valued at $2.3 trillion in the next 20 years, as economic growth in the region boosts middle-class population. That’s 38% of the global estimate of 39,620 aircraft, according to Boeing’s outlook. Friday’s deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the Chicago-based planemaker in India. SpiceJet and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in India, while IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt. and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all fly Airbus jets. SpiceJet shares jumped as much as 4.2% after the deal was announced. EXCL Ajay Singh, Chairman, @flyspicejet: Order marks the start of company’s growth phase in India. pic.twitter.com/lA6Ts2fbrn — CNBC-TV18 News (@CNBCTV18News) January 13, 2017 After knocking off the options, a previously unfulfilled and renegotiated deal for 42 jets and an earlier undisclosed order for 13 planes, SpiceJet’s firm orders are for 100 737 Max 8 aircraft, which at list prices are worth about $11 billion before discounts. Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 6 that the carrier was close to signing a deal for at least 92 planes valued at $10.1 billion, and may boost the total if final talks yield substantial discounts and favorable maintenance contracts. Getting Commercial Terms Right “We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalizing the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft,” Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview, adding deliveries will start July 2018 through 2024. “It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right.” For SpiceJet, the order signals its resurgence after almost collapsing more than two years ago. The expansion will help it compete against IndiGo, which has some 400-odd aircraft pending delivery from Airbus and controls the world’s fastest-growing major aviation market with a 42% share. A representative for Airbus declined to comment. SpiceJet currently operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. It controls 13% of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past five years. India, where an emerging middle-class is flying for the first time and passenger traffic is growing at double the pace of nearest rival China, is a crucial market for Boeing and Airbus. In 2015, IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., ordered 250 planes from Airbus valued at $27 billion. That followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes and 180 A320neos in 2011. While the potential for growth is prompting airlines in the country to order more planes, they also have a challenge to tackle: Airport infrastructure that hasn’t kept pace with the times. Limited landing and parking slots mean longer time spent circling above airports such as Mumbai during peak hours, wasting precious fuel. “India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can’t ignore,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order would give Boeing “a lifeline. There’s a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia.” By Anurag Kotoky and Kyunghee Park Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Posted 13 Jan 2017 16:05 Updated 13 Jan 2017 20:00 FILE PHOTO: A SpiceJet Boeing 737-800 aircraft taxis on the tarmac after landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji international airport in Mumbai November 26, 2012. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW DELHI: Indian budget airline SpiceJet said on Friday it has agreed to acquire 100 new MAX 737 aircraft from Boeing, with an option for 50 more, as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest growing aviation market. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "This is an extremely competitive market," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. "What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs," said Singh, whose airline has about 13 percent of the Indian passenger market, while market leader IndiGo has 40 percent. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India . Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. Combined, local airlines like IndiGo, as well as GoAir, have already ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. Meanwhile Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth US$265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to US$22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source familiar with the deal had said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing had already reported an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally, and on Friday confirmed that order to be SpiceJet's. Shares in SpiceJet rose as much as 3 percent on Friday. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of more than 40 planes, will take delivery of the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. "As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," said Singh. He said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt or raising equity to pay for the planes. The new aircraft increases the range of SpiceJet's flights by up to one hour, opening up many more destinations, including international ones, Singh told reporters. He said the additional acquisition rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. Most Indian carriers have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

It will be able to expand into long-haul flights. Indian low-cost airline Spicejet announced Friday it was buying up to 205 planes from Boeing in a deal worth $22 billion (20.6 billion euros). The carrier said the contract included 100 737 jets from Boeing's new Max family of aircraft, which it said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. The deal also included the option to buy 50 wide-body planes suitable for long-haul flights. Spicejet, which currently has just 49 planes, said the order would enable it to boost its domestic operations and potentially expand into long-haul international flights. "This is the largest deal for Spicejet, it's one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India," Spicejet Chairman Ajay Singh said in a statement.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India's fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations. "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort," said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India's booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world's fastest-growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "This is an extremely competitive market," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. "What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs," said Singh, whose airline has about 13 percent of the Indian passenger market, while market leader IndiGo has 40 percent. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. Combined, local airlines like IndiGo, as well as GoAir, have already ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. Meanwhile Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source familiar with the deal had said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing had already reported an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally, and on Friday confirmed that order to be SpiceJet's. Shares in SpiceJet rose as much as 3 percent on Friday. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of more than 40 planes, will take delivery of the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. "As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," said Singh. He said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt or raising equity to pay for the planes. The new aircraft increases the range of SpiceJet's flights by up to one hour, opening up many more destinations, including international ones, Singh told reporters. He said the additional acquisition rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. Most Indian carriers have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India’s fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations. “The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort,” said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India’s booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world’s fastest-growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027.

The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. Asian airlines are driving much of the growth in big planemaker order books, and analysts expect India's market to grow substantially over the next decade as millions fly for the first time each year. Indian airlines such as the biggest, InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, as well as GoAir have collectively ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. SpiceJet said it had signed a deal for buying up to 205 planes from Boeing - worth up to $22 billion at list prices - but the announcement includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source told Reuters on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. It was not immediately clear if the order adds to Boeing's previously announced tally. However, the company previously posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of around 40 planes, will start getting the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. SpiceJet's Singh said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt to pay for the planes. He said the additional purchase rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, has about 13 percent of the Indian air passenger market. That is behind market leader IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Most Indian airlines have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. SpiceJet's Singh said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt to pay for the planes. He said the additional purchase rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, has about 13 percent of the Indian air passenger market. That is behind market leader IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Most Indian airlines have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

The new model, dubbed the 737 Max 10X, would be longer than the slow selling 737 Max 9, currently the biggest version of the single-aisle airliner. By Rishi Iyengar NEW DELHI (CNNMoney) -- Boeing has won a massive deal to sell its new 737 jet into the rapidly growing Indian market. The U.S. plane maker is going to supply another 100 of its 737 Max 8 jets to Indian budget airline SpiceJet, an order Boeing says is worth about $11 billion at list prices. It builds on an earlier SpiceJet order for 55 of the 737 Max model, and the airline has the option of buying 50 more in future. Together, the 205 jets would be worth $22 billion at list prices. The new planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2024, the companies said. The deal boosts Boeing's drive to expand its business in India, which is one of the world's largest and fastest growing aviation markets. Its top rival, Airbus, supplies aircraft to several Indian airlines. "We're honored to be here in India in a big way, and this is truly a demonstration of that commitment... to our partners and to the country of India," Boeing vice chairman Ray Conner said Friday. Boeing's fourth-generation single-aisle Max 8 has two new engines and a new tail section and winglets -- designed to cut fuel consumption by 14%. The Max 8 is the first of four 737 Max models Boeing is designing. Boeing has thousands of orders for the 737 Max, including from China's airlines. It is also seeking buyers for the new 737 Max 10X, a longer plane that aims to compete with the Airbus A321neo. SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh said the airline was considering buying the Max 10X in future. Friday's deal will strengthen SpiceJet's ability to compete in the crowded Indian aviation market, Singh told CNNMoney. He said the low-cost airline is planning to add more routes to destinations in the Middle East, east Asia and eastern Europe. With a booming economy and a rapidly growing middle class, more Indians are taking to the skies than ever before. Air travel grew by more than 20% last year, and India is projected to overtake the U.K. as the world's third largest aviation market by 2026. The 50 Boeing planes SpiceJet has the option of buying also include wide-body aircraft, which would allow it to undertake long-haul international flights. "With this deal," Singh said, "we think we are well placed to take on the world." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India’s fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations. OPM tells DC-area feds how to plan for Inauguration Day “The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort,” said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Advertisement Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India’s booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world’s fastest-growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027.

SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh, who has to his credit bringing back the carrier that was on the verge of closure in December 2014, said it has firmed up plane orders for 155 Boeing 737-8 Max and 50 purchase rights for wide body long haul planes like Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the narrow-bodied Boeing 737s. "This is one of the largest deals in Indian aviation and the largest for SpiceJet," Ajay Singh told reporters. "Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today. We have achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on-time performance (OTP) and lowest cancellations and a record load factor of over 90% every month for 20 months in a row," Singh explained. India’s aviation sector is witnessing over 20 per cent growth since past four years and has become one of the fastest growing market globally attracting the attention of stakeholders globally, mainly the plane makers, for whom India now is a crucial market. For U.S plane maker, Boeing, the SpiceJet agreement will offer it some cushioning in India’s aviation market as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with India’s biggest domestic carrier, IndiGo, and another low-cost carrier, GoAir. While Airbus dominates the domestic short-haul market, which uses narrow-bodied planes, Boeing has dominated the long-haul market in India with wide-bodied passenger aircraft. Airbus commands a two-third market share of aircraft in India. There are 460 narrow- and wide-bodied passenger planes with Indian carriers, and 194 more have been ordered since 2014 excluding the latest orders from SpiceJet. Indian carriers have largely remained with either Airbus or Boeing for narrow- and wide-bodied aircraft, with state-owned Air India as an only exception to have aircraft manufactured by both manufacturers. Airlines benefit by having a fleet of single manufacturer as they have to engage fewer pilots and engineers. Boeing, Airbus or any other aircraft require a different team, which increases an airline’s operational costs. Some of the newer Indian airlines—such as IndiGo—have chosen to buy a single type from a single manufacturer. IndiGo, with a fleet size of 125 aircraft, has all narrow-bodied Airbus, while Jet Airways has largely Boeing, with a few Airbus as well. SpiceJet has a fleet size of 40 aircraft, of which 22 are narrow-bodied Boeing 737-800 and of Bombardiers and turboprops, besides 40 Boeing 737-MAX on order. GoAir has only Airbus planes. In 2015, IndiGo ordered 250 Airbus A320neo planes, Jet Airways ordered 75 Boeing 737 Max planes and Vistara ordered seven Airbus 320neo planes. In 2014, SpiceJet ordered 40 Boeing 737 MAX planes and Air Costa ordered 50 Embraer E-2 jets. In July 2016, GoAir ordered 72 Airbus A320neo. IndiGo, Jet Airways, Air India, Air Asia and other airlines also have deliveries lined up for orders placed between 2011 and 2013, which are adding to their fleet in phases and will be delivered by 2020.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India's fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort," said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India's booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world's fastest-growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027.

Posted 13 Jan 2017 16:05 Updated 13 Jan 2017 20:00 FILE PHOTO: A SpiceJet Boeing 737-800 aircraft taxis on the tarmac after landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji international airport in Mumbai November 26, 2012. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW DELHI: Indian budget airline SpiceJet said on Friday it has agreed to acquire 100 new MAX 737 aircraft from Boeing, with an option for 50 more, as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest growing aviation market. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "This is an extremely competitive market," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. "What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs," said Singh, whose airline has about 13 percent of the Indian passenger market, while market leader IndiGo has 40 percent. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India . Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. Combined, local airlines like IndiGo, as well as GoAir, have already ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. Meanwhile Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth US$265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to US$22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source familiar with the deal had said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing had already reported an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally, and on Friday confirmed that order to be SpiceJet's. Shares in SpiceJet rose as much as 3 percent on Friday. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of more than 40 planes, will take delivery of the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. "As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," said Singh. He said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt or raising equity to pay for the planes. The new aircraft increases the range of SpiceJet's flights by up to one hour, opening up many more destinations, including international ones, Singh told reporters. He said the additional acquisition rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. Most Indian carriers have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

Indian budget carrier SpiceJet said on Friday it had agreed to buy 100 new MAX 737 aircraft from Boeing, with an option for 50 more, as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest-growing aviation market. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "As part of this transaction, they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. Asian airlines are driving much of the growth in big planemaker order books, and analysts expect India's market to grow substantially over the next decade as millions fly for the first time each year. Indian airlines such as the biggest, InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, as well as GoAir have collectively ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. SpiceJet said it had signed a deal for buying up to 205 planes from Boeing - worth up to $22 billion at list prices - but the announcement includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source told Reuters on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. It was not immediately clear if the order adds to Boeing's previously announced tally. However, the company previously posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally. Low-cost long haul?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies SpiceJet- Boeing deal: Low-cost carrier places order for 205 aircraft worth $22 billion With the new order, SpiceJet will overtake IndiGo to become India's largest airline as per fleet size. Kalyani Pandey January 13, 2017 14:41 IST A SpiceJet Airlines plane at Bengaluru airportReuters file In what is said to be one of the biggest deals in India's aviation history, SpiceJet, India's low-cost carrier has confirmed its plan to purchase 205 Boeing jets for $22 billion (about Rs 1.5 lakh crore) from the US-based aircraft manufacturer.  With the deal, SpiceJet is seeking to win the market share from its dominant rival -- IndiGo Airlines. The deal, which includes 100 firm 737 Max 8 jets, will build on an existing order for 55 aircraft, the carrier said in a statement on Friday. Also read: Boeing strikes big deal with SpiceJet for 92 Boeing 737 jetliners Additionally, the airline also has the option to buy 50 more wide-bodied aircraft. With this, the total order stands at $22 billion at the listed price.  "SpiceJet's new order underscores it's drive to compete more effectively in India's cut-throat low cost travel market. The deal for up to 205 737MAXs will certainly put it on par with Indigo for domestic dominance and the added range of the 737MAX fleet will allow SpiceJet to open up routes deeper into Asia and even parts of Europe/CIS states," Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at StrategicAero Research, told the International Business Times, India. The deal is seen as a win-win situation for both the parties: The latest order could help SpiceJet become the largest airline in India (as per fleet size), as it competes with IndiGo, which controls the world's fastest-growing aviation market with 42 per cent market share. For Boeing, this deal could signal the aircraft an entry into the Indian market, which is dominated by Airbus.  Last month, SpiceJet had a market share of 12.8 per cent (according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation). "Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today and we are proud of it. SpiceJet has achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on-time performance and lowest cancellation rates; a record load factor of over 90% every month for 20 months in a row – a feat that has no parallel in aviation history," Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJe, said in the statement. SpiceJet placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation B737s and currently operates 32 of the B737s in its fleet besides 17 Bombardier Q400s. The SpiceJet stock closed at Rs 65.50 on Friday, up 2.50 percent from its previous close on the Bombay Stock Exchange.  Related Air fares set to rise after jet fuel prices increase by 8% in the new year?

A statement said the order was “booked at the end of 2016,” so presumably it was included in Boeing’s count of 534 MAX sales for last year. The order, with a list price of $11 billion, is worth an estimated $5.08 billion based on market-pricing data from aircraft-valuation firm Avitas. The low-cost airline, which was on the financial brink for two years and is rebounding after a 2015 rescue by co-founder Ajay Singh, also obtained purchase rights for an additional 50 planes.

SpiceJet currently operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets. “With the next generation of 737 and the 737 MAX we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably,” Singh said in a statement.

Boeing has won a massive deal to sell its new 737 jet into the rapidly growing Indian market. The U.S. plane maker is going to supply another 100 of its 737 Max 8 jets to Indian budget airline SpiceJet, an order Boeing says is worth about $11 billion at list prices. It builds on an earlier SpiceJet order for 55 of the 737 Max model, and the airline has the option of buying 50 more in future. Together, the 205 jets would be worth $22 billion at list prices. The new planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2024, the companies said. The deal boosts Boeing's drive to expand its business in India, which is one of the world's largest and fastest growing aviation markets. Its top rival, Airbus, supplies aircraft to several Indian airlines. "We're honored to be here in India in a big way, and this is truly a demonstration of that commitment... to our partners and to the country of India," Boeing (BA) vice chairman Ray Conner said Friday. Related: The world's new planes in 2017 Boeing's fourth-generation single-aisle Max 8 has two new engines and a new tail section and winglets -- designed to cut fuel consumption by 14%. The Max 8 is the first of four 737 Max models Boeing is designing. Boeing has thousands of orders for the 737 Max, including from China's airlines. It is also seeking buyers for the new 737 Max 10X, a longer plane that aims to compete with the Airbus A321neo. SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh said the airline was considering buying the Max 10X in future. Friday's deal will strengthen SpiceJet's ability to compete in the crowded Indian aviation market, Singh told CNNMoney. He said the low-cost airline is planning to add more routes to destinations in the Middle East, east Asia and eastern Europe. Related: Business class or private jet? This young Indian entrepreneur can help With a booming economy and a rapidly growing middle class, more Indians are taking to the skies than ever before. Air travel grew by more than 20% last year, and India is projected to overtake the U.K. as the world's third largest aviation market by 2026.

The new model, dubbed the 737 Max 10X, would be longer than the slow selling 737 Max 9, currently the biggest version of the single-aisle airliner. By Rishi Iyengar NEW DELHI (CNNMoney) -- Boeing has won a massive deal to sell its new 737 jet into the rapidly growing Indian market. The U.S. plane maker is going to supply another 100 of its 737 Max 8 jets to Indian budget airline SpiceJet, an order Boeing says is worth about $11 billion at list prices. It builds on an earlier SpiceJet order for 55 of the 737 Max model, and the airline has the option of buying 50 more in future. Together, the 205 jets would be worth $22 billion at list prices. The new planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2024, the companies said. The deal boosts Boeing's drive to expand its business in India, which is one of the world's largest and fastest growing aviation markets. Its top rival, Airbus, supplies aircraft to several Indian airlines. "We're honored to be here in India in a big way, and this is truly a demonstration of that commitment... to our partners and to the country of India," Boeing vice chairman Ray Conner said Friday. Boeing's fourth-generation single-aisle Max 8 has two new engines and a new tail section and winglets -- designed to cut fuel consumption by 14%. The Max 8 is the first of four 737 Max models Boeing is designing. Boeing has thousands of orders for the 737 Max, including from China's airlines. It is also seeking buyers for the new 737 Max 10X, a longer plane that aims to compete with the Airbus A321neo. SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh said the airline was considering buying the Max 10X in future. Friday's deal will strengthen SpiceJet's ability to compete in the crowded Indian aviation market, Singh told CNNMoney. He said the low-cost airline is planning to add more routes to destinations in the Middle East, east Asia and eastern Europe. With a booming economy and a rapidly growing middle class, more Indians are taking to the skies than ever before. Air travel grew by more than 20% last year, and India is projected to overtake the U.K. as the world's third largest aviation market by 2026. The 50 Boeing planes SpiceJet has the option of buying also include wide-body aircraft, which would allow it to undertake long-haul international flights.

Conner (R), Vice-Chairman of Boeing, exchange model planes at a press conference in New Delhi on January 13, 2017. PHOTO: AFP NEW DELHI: Indian low-cost airline SpiceJet said on Friday it would buy up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion as it seeks to strengthen its grip on the world’s fastest-growing passenger aviation market. SpiceJet said the order, the largest an Indian airline has ever placed with the US aerospace giant, would enable it to expand its domestic and international operations. “This is the largest deal for SpiceJet, it’s one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India,” SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh told journalists as he announced the deal. “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations.” Singh said the deal included 100 737 jets from Boeing’s new Max family of aircraft, which he said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. The deal marks a major turnaround for SpiceJet, whose planes were briefly grounded in 2014 after suppliers refused to refuel them due to unpaid bills. It now has a 13-percent share of the Indian market, behind rivals Indigo, Jet Airways and Air India. India’s airline market is growing at double the pace of nearest rival China, as an emerging middle-class takes to the skies. Train travel remains slow and demand for low-cost flights has boomed in the past decade. The market is seen as having vast untapped potential with fewer than 100 million of India’s 1.2 billion citizens flying on domestic routes last year. But most of the country’s airlines are still loss-making and laden with debt, while state carrier Air India has long relied on government support. Air India ranked third-worst airline in the world Analysts say lower fuel prices and a rise in economic growth have boosted the sector, with domestic traffic up 21 percent last year. “The airline has done really well from being almost on the brink of closure to nearly seven quarters of profit,” said industry analyst Kapil Kaul. “The new aircraft order is on expected lines and gives them long-term direction. A positive and long-term story is likely to emerge with this order.” SpiceJet currently has just 49 aircraft, putting it well behind the market leader Indigo with 400. It is the only Indian low-cost carrier with a Boeing fleet. The company’s shares have more than tripled since December 2014. Singh said the deal included an option to purchase wide-body, long-haul aircraft in the future. It put the value of the planes at $22 billion at list prices, although it will likely pay less as discounts for large orders are customary. “We are honoured to be the partner of SpiceJet and to be in India in a big way and this is a demonstration of our commitment to our partners and to India,” said Raymond Conner, vice chairman of Boeing.

The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. Asian airlines are driving much of the growth in big planemaker order books, and analysts expect India's market to grow substantially over the next decade as millions fly for the first time each year. Indian airlines such as the biggest, InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, as well as GoAir have collectively ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. SpiceJet said it had signed a deal for buying up to 205 planes from Boeing - worth up to $22 billion at list prices - but the announcement includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source told Reuters on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. It was not immediately clear if the order adds to Boeing's previously announced tally. However, the company previously posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of around 40 planes, will start getting the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. SpiceJet's Singh said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt to pay for the planes. He said the additional purchase rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, has about 13 percent of the Indian air passenger market. That is behind market leader IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Most Indian airlines have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

With this deal, SpiceJet has enhanced its existing order of 55 aircraft with additional 100 firm B737-8 MAX and 50 purchase rights for B737-8 MAX and wide-body aircraft. An agreement with SpiceJet, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet had placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation B737s and currently operates 32 Next-Generation B737s in its fleet and 17 Bombardier Q400s. Announcing the deal here today, SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said, “Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today and we are proud of it. SpiceJet has achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on-time performance and lowest cancellation rates; a record load factor of over 90% every month for 20 months in a row – a feat that has no parallel in aviation history." “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations,” Singh said. “The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began, with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort. With the next generation of B737 and the B737 MAX we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably,” he added. The B737 MAX incorporates the latest technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets and other improvements to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market. The new airplane will deliver 20 percent lower fuel use than the first Next-Generation B737s and the lowest operating costs in its class – 8 percent per seat less than its nearest competitor. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for plane makers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Boeing Reaches $22 Billion Plane Deal With India's SpiceJet Boeing reached an agreement with India's SpiceJet for more than 200 planes in a deal that could be worth $22 billion at list prices. Martin Baccardax Jan 13, 2017 2:32 AM EST Boeing (BA) said Friday that it has reached an agreement with India's SpiceJet for more than 200 planes in a deal that could be worth $22 billion at list prices.  The fleet sale, agreed Friday in New Delhi, will be booked in the 2016 year, the companies said in a statement, and includes 100 of Boeing's 737 MAX 8 airplanes added to a previous commitment of 42, a shift from an unnamed customer of 13 and an option for SpiceJet to buy and additional 50.  "We are honored to build upon more than a decade of partnership with SpiceJet with their commitment of up to 205 airplanes," said Boeing's vice chairman Ray Conner. "The economics of the 737 MAXs will allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond, and offer their customers a superior passenger experience." Boeing shares closed at $158.29 each Thursday in New York, down 0.67% on the session but still up a firm 18.87% over the past three months.  Last Friday,  Boeing reported 2016 commercial deliveries that hit the company's internal target but fell short of a year prior, and also missed Boeing's goal to match orders with deliveries in what was seen as a year of transition for the aerospace giant. The Chicago-based Dow Jones Industrial Average component said it delivered 748 jets for the year, in line with its forecast of between 745 and 750 deliveries, but fell short of its goal of matching deliveries with new orders. Boeing won 848 orders in 2016 but also had 180 cancellations.

X Boeing wins $22bn plane order from India’s SpiceJet Budget carrier is seeking to claw back market share from leader IndiGo Fri, Jan 13, 2017, 07:57 The deal, which includes 100 737 Max 8 jets, builds on an existing order for 55 aircraft         Boeing won an order for 205 planes from SpiceJet, marking the biggest expansion plan by the Indian budget carrier that is seeking to claw back market share from leader IndiGo. The deal, which includes 100 737 Max 8 jets, builds on an existing order for 55 aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement on Friday. The airline also has the option to buy 50 more, including widebodies. All combined, the order is worth $22 billion at list prices, the airline said, before discounts that are customary for large orders. The order, the largest ever placed by an Indian airline for Boeing aircraft, signals the resurgence of SpiceJet as it competes against IndiGo, which has some 400-odd aircraft pending delivery from Airbus SE and controls the world’s fastest-growing major aviation market, with a 42 per cent share. For Boeing, it marks the widening of its footprint in the South Asian country, where its European rival dominates narrow-body fleets. “We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalising the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft,” company chairman Ajay Singh said. “It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right.” Delivery schedule The planes are for delivery between next year and 2024, he told reporters in New Delhi. The deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the Chicago-based plane-maker in India. The purchase commitment comes at a time when both Airbus and Boeing are facing slowing jet sales and the highest level of airplane-delivery deferrals in at least 15 years, after a decade-long jetliner shopping spree globally. SpiceJet’s order includes a previously unfulfilled and renegotiated deal for 42 jets and an earlier undisclosed order for 13 planes. The airline currently operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. It controls 13 per cent of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past five years. ADVERTISEMENT SpiceJet shares have more than tripled since December 2014, when it ran out of cash and grounded its fleet for a day after oil companies refused fuel credit. The stock rose 3.5 per cent to 66.15 rupees as of 12.38pm in Mumbai, giving the airline a market value of 39.7 billion rupees ($582 million/€545 million). The airline was profitable in each of the past seven quarters and had cash and near-cash items totalling 1.97 billion rupees as of September 30th, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Slowdown risk “The bigger concern, we believe, will be with SpiceJet’s financial backing and the willingness of banks to fund this growth,” Mark D. Martin, founder of Dubai-based Martin Consulting LLC, said by phone. “The bigger concern for aviation in India is on account of the economic slowdown caused by the recent step to demonetise the most popular denominations in use.” Add to that the rise in fuel prices, and the net effect on the cost of travel will be at least 20 per cent, he said. SpiceJet does not need to dilute any equity to pay for the order, Singh said. The carrier has sufficient resources within the company, and has already received interest from lessors and lenders to finance the deal, he said. SpiceJet will expand its international operations once the new planes which have a longer range come in. India, where an emerging middle-class is flying for the first time and passenger traffic is growing at double the pace of nearest rival China, is a crucial market for Boeing and Airbus. In 2015, IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation, ordered 250 planes from Airbus, valued at $27 billion. That followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes and 180 A320neos in 2011. The South Asian country needs 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in 20 years, with single-aisle planes making up a bulk of the new deliveries, according to Boeing forecasts. Airbus dominates the budget airline market in India, with IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt. and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all flying its jets.

Photo: Reuters/Danish Siddiqui BusinessIndia India’s SpiceJet seals US$22 billion Boeing deal Budget carrier agrees to buy 100 new MAX 737 aircraft to boost fleet in expansion plans By Reuters January 13, 2017 4:33 PM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Indian budget carrier SpiceJet said on Friday it had agreed to buy 100 new MAX 737 aircraft from Boeing, with an option for 50 more, ramping up its fleet as it targets expansion in the world’s fastest growing aviation market. SpiceJet said it had signed a deal for buying up to 205 planes from Boeing – worth up to US$22 billion at list prices – but the announcement includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. “As part of this transaction, [Boeing] have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the aircraft going forward,” Ajay Singh, SpiceJet’s chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox A source said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing. Singh said the purchase rights include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost flights over long distances. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the US company’s only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country’s air industry. Indian airlines such as the biggest, InterGlobe Aviation’s IndiGo, as well as GoAir and SpiceJet have ordered hundreds of new planes as they rush to win a slice of the boom in demand for air travel. SpiceJet has about 13% of the Indian air passenger market, behind market leader IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20% annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and under chairman Singh, the company has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said the low-cost airline, which has a 13-per cent share of the Indian market, was expanding both its domestic and international operations. “This is the largest deal for SpiceJet, it’s one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India,” he told journalists as he announced the deal. “We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations.” The deal marks a major turnaround for SpiceJet, whose planes were briefly grounded in 2014 after suppliers refused to refuel them due to unpaid bills. Analysts say the Indian airline sector has been boosted since then by lower fuel prices and a rise in consumer demand, with domestic traffic up 21 per cent last year. “The airline has done really well from being almost on the brink of closure to nearly seven quarters of profit,” said industry analyst Kapil Kaul. “The new aircraft order is on expected lines and gives them long-term direction. A positive and long-term story is likely to emerge with this order.” SpiceJet, whose market share is only lower than Indigo, Jet Airways and Air India, is the only Indian low-cost carrier with a Boeing fleet. “We are honoured to be the partner of SpiceJet and to be in India in a big way and this is a demonstration of our commitment to our partners and to India,” said Raymond Conner, vice chairman of Boeing. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Sterling hammered on Brexit reports, Asia markets sink Job cuts, fewer flights?

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo By Aditi Shah and Tommy Wilkes | NEW DELHI NEW DELHI Indian budget airline SpiceJet said on Friday it has agreed to acquire 100 new MAX 737 aircraft from Boeing, with an option for 50 more, as part of its expansion plans in the world's fastest growing aviation market. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. "This is an extremely competitive market," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. "What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs," said Singh, whose airline has about 13 percent of the Indian passenger market, while market leader IndiGo has 40 percent. SpiceJet, which was briefly forced to ground its fleet in late 2014 when it ran out of cash, is the fourth-largest Indian airline behind InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India [AIRID.UL]. Asia, especially India, is a key market for planemakers, with analysts expecting Indian passenger numbers to more than triple over the next 20 years as millions more people become wealthy enough to fly for the first time. Combined, local airlines like IndiGo, as well as GoAir, have already ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. Meanwhile Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. SpiceJet said altogether it has signed a deal to acquire up to 205 planes from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices, but that total includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source familiar with the deal had said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing had already reported an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally, and on Friday confirmed that order to be SpiceJet's. Shares in SpiceJet rose as much as 3 percent on Friday. LOW-COST LONG HAUL? SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of more than 40 planes, will take delivery of the first of its new jets in the third quarter of 2018, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific & India Sales at Boeing, told reporters. The carrier is expected to have secured a hefty discount from the aircraft list prices, as is common with large orders. "As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward," said Singh. He said he was weighing up various options for financing the new purchase, including sale and leaseback, but he ruled out issuing more debt or raising equity to pay for the planes. The new aircraft increases the range of SpiceJet's flights by up to one hour, opening up many more destinations, including international ones, Singh told reporters. He said the additional acquisition rights also include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost long distance flights. Most Indian carriers have returned to profitability in recent years, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, but challenges remain as carriers struggle to translate surging demand into sustainable profits because of cut-throat competition and high running costs.

NEW DELHI: In one of the biggest aircraft orders by an Indian airline, SpiceJet on Friday announced it will buy up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore). SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh, who brought the airline back from the verge of closure two years back, said the order is a firm one for 155 Boeing 737-8 Max and 50 purchase rights for wide body long haul planes like Dreamliner and the B-737s. "Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today and we are proud of it. SpiceJet has achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on time performance and lowest cancellation and a record load factor of over 90% every month for 20 months in a row," said Singh. The agreement with SpiceJet is a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

The U.S. plane maker is going to supply another 100 of its 737 Max 8 jets to Indian budget airline SpiceJet, an order Boeing says is worth about $11 billion at list prices. It builds on an earlier SpiceJet order for 55 of the 737 Max planes, and the airline will have the option of buying 50 more in the future. Altogether, the 205 jets would be worth $22 billion at list prices. The deal boosts Boeing’s drive to expand its business in India, which is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing aviation markets. Its top rival, Airbus, supplies aircraft to several Indian airlines. Boeing’s fourth-generation single-aisle Max 8 has two new engines and a new tail section and winglets — designed to cut fuel consumption by 14%. The Max 8 is the first of four 737 Max models Boeing is designing. Boeing has thousands of orders for the 737 Max, including from China’s fast-growing airlines.

SpiceJet, which currently has just 49 planes, said the order would enable it to boost its domestic operations and potentially expand into long-haul international flights. India's aviation market is growing at double the pace of China's, as an emerging middle-class takes to the skies. SpiceJet agrees to buy up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion in what is said to be one the largest aviation deals in India ©RAVEENDRAN (AFP/File) "This is the largest deal for SpiceJet, it's one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India," SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh told journalists as he announced the deal. "We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations." The deal marks a major turnaround for SpiceJet, whose planes were briefly grounded in 2014 after suppliers refused to refuel them due to unpaid bills. It has a 13-percent share of the Indian market, behind rivals Indigo, Jet Airways and Air India. - Vast potential - The Indian market is seen as having vast untapped potential with fewer than 100 million of India's 1.2 billion citizens flying on domestic routes last year. Train travel remains slow and demand for low-cost flights has boomed in the past decade. The latest industry figures from the International Air Transport Association show India’s domestic air traffic grew 22.3 percent year-on-year in November, followed by Russia at 15.5 percent and China at 14.9 percent. But most of the country's airlines are still loss-making and laden with debt, while state carrier Air India has long relied on government support. Analysts say lower fuel prices and a rise in economic growth have boosted the sector, with domestic traffic up 21 percent last year. "The airline has done really well from being almost on the brink of closure to nearly seven quarters of profit," said industry analyst Kapil Kaul. "The new aircraft order is on expected lines and gives them long-term direction. A positive and long-term story is likely to emerge with this order." SpiceJet, the only Indian low-cost carrier with a Boeing fleet, said the first of the new planes would arrive in early 2018. It currently has just 49 aircraft, putting it well behind the market leader Indigo, India's only consistently profitable carrier, with 400. Singh said the deal included 100 737 jets from Boeing's new Max family of aircraft, which he said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. It also includes the option to buy 50 wide-body aircrafts suitable for long-haul flights. The airline currently only flies short-haul international routes. SpiceJet put the value of the planes at $22 billion at list prices, although it will likely pay less as discounts for large orders are customary. The company's shares have more than tripled since December 2014. The deal is a boost for Boeing in India, where rival manufacturer Airbus has traditionally dominated. "India needs 1,850 planes worth $265 billion in the next 20 years," said Boeing India President Dinesh Keskar. "We do expect more orders out of India."

A SpiceJet spokesperson refused to comment on the development. The deal is expected to be announced in Delhi on Friday by airline's promoter Ajay Singh. "Negotiations are going on for quite some time. We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year," the spokesperson had said earlier. "It's a good development for Indian aviation that SpiceJet is expanding after going through such a bad time in 2014," said Devesh Agarwal, an aviation analyst. B737 Max are state-of-art fuel efficient planes produced by US-based aircraft manufacturer Boeing in comparison to Airbus's A320 neo planes. Wadia Group-promoted GoAir on Wednesday confirmed an order for 72 A320 neo planes, estimated to be worth over Rs 52,000 crore. This is in addition to the 72 A320 neo ordered earlier, which takes the tally to 144. The airline inducted the first A320 neo in June last year. The airline is expected to start its international operations this year. Similarly, market leader IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation, has ordered 430 A320neo. Experts said it will be interesting to see how SpiceJet, if it inducts B787 Dreamliner, will use the aircraft as at present national carrier Air India uses it for long distance flying including Europe, Australia among others. Air India, a full-service carrier unlike SpiceJet, also uses the Dreamliner on some of its high-density routes like Mumbai-Delhi. "Historically, a low-cost long distance aircraft have not worked profitably. There is a possibility that SpiceJet may just sign an MoU for B787 for later years." The development seems significant as only till around in 2014 that the airline was struggling to run its day-to-day operations as lessors, airport operators and oil companies refused to give further credit as a result of which scores of flights had to cancelled leading to chaos. However, since then things visibly improved with the airline make operating profits since last several quarters, on the back of low fuel cost and better performance. The revival was led by BJP member Ajay Singh, who took the reins of the airline from earlier owner Kalanithi Maran, had not been taking salary till the airline turns profit. In December, the stakeholders approved the proposal to pay up to Rs 15 crore as annual remuneration to Singh. The airline is also mulling offering ESOPs to some of its employees, so to encourage them to stick with the company for a longer time.

The airline expects the Boeing Max aircraft to help save about 20% in fuel costs. New Delhi: Budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd on Friday said it had placed an order to purchase 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, valued at $11 billion, from Boeing Co., in a deal that would help the airline expand operations and result in fuel-cost savings. “This order is a great step for creating a strong foundation for SpiceJet,” airline chairman Ajay Singh said on Friday. Besides the 100 aircraft, SpiceJet has an option to buy 50 more 737 Max planes that it can convert into a firm order later. Taken with a previous order for 55 aircraft, SpiceJet’s total order could rise to 205 planes. Of these, 155 will be delivered to the airline between 2018 and 2024. More aeroplanes would be leased this year to expand SpiceJet’s presence in the country, Singh said, adding that the November-December quarter had been profitable for the airline in spite of the demonetization shock. The airline expects the fuel-efficient Max aircraft to help it save about 20% in fuel costs. SpiceJet has included a clause in the deal that allows it to convert the Max order into wide-bodied planes that can fly to Europe and beyond in future. SpiceJet is also opening a pilot training facility in Delhi on which work has already started, Singh said. “The deal was signed on New Year’s eve,” said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president (sales), Asia-Pacific and India, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We couldn’t have asked for more to end the year.” Singh took over SpiceJet in December 2014, when the airline was facing the possibility of a shutdown due to a massive cash crunch. The airline, Singh said, has made a profit of Rs1 crore on average in the last 680 days, compared with a loss of Rs3 crore a day during the 365 days before that. Helped by a supportive government which did not want to see another airline grounded after Kingfisher Airlines Ltd and a record crash in fuel prices--which account for over 40% of the costs of an airline--Singh managed to steer SpiceJet from a market share of around 7% to 13% currently. To be sure, almost all airlines, including Air India Ltd, posted profits during 2015-16. SpiceJet shares rose 2.5% on the BSE on Friday to end at Rs65.50 apiece on a day when the benchmark 30-share Sensex dropped 0.03% to end at 27,238.06 points. Shares of rival Jet Airways dropped 0.12% to end at Rs390.65, while those of IndiGo fell 0.16% to end at Rs874.90 apiece.

(AFP) PARIS: Qatar Airways is seeking strict guarantees as it talks to CFM International about supplying engines for a revamped order for Airbus narrow-body jets, which it expects to finalize “soon,” its chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said on Thursday. The airline has canceled four A320neo jets powered by alternative Pratt & Whitney engines and expects to swap the overall aircraft order, which was originally for 50 jets, to larger A321neo aircraft. CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and France’s Safran, is locked in a fierce battle with Pratt & Whitney to supply engines for new Airbus medium-haul jets. CFM exclusively supplies engines for the competing Boeing 737 aircraft, which Qatar Airways has also ordered. Al-Baker acknowledged Qatar Airways had received attractive prices when it originally ordered the new Pratt & Whitney engine, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees. “It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance,” he said in an interview. Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy’s Meridiana, where it hopes to tie up a deal to take a 49-percent stake around the end of the month. It has told Boeing it is interested in taking earlier delivery of future 777-9 aircraft, because that program is ahead of schedule, Al-Baker added. Asked if Qatar Airways could take on delivery of aircraft for airlines in which it has stakes, like BA owner IAG and Latam, he said “why not,” but added he believed those airlines would take their planes as planned. He was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-meter business lounge at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport, the airline’s third premium lounge abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai. It is building further lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and is negotiating lounge space in seven other airports, he said. The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity. Qatar Airways, which also plans to launch a new premium cabin at a trade fair in March, is investing an unspecified amount in new product to attract passengers “with the right yield” or average revenues, Al-Baker said. But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda because of a recent rebound in oil prices. “(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up,” he said. “Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly.” Oil prices have risen 20 percent in the last three months. Al-Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. It plans to serve Nice five times a week from July and announce a similar service to Lyon soon. It continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al-Baker added. Facebook STAY CONNECTED Follow @Arab_News Tweets by @Arab_News Download The App!

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) has begun offering airlines a stretched version of its new 737 MAX narrow-body aircraft, according to a report by CNN Money on Thursday. Boeing has said it is talking with customers about adding the bigger plane to its 737 MAX family, which boasts greater fuel efficiency than current-generation 737s. The first 737 MAX is due to enter service this year. The new plane, known as the 737 MAX 10X, would help Boeing head off the runaway sales of Airbus' A321neo, which can carry more passengers and fly farther than the 737 MAX 9. Plane makers typically line up orders from airlines before deciding whether to formally undertake building a new aircraft. Boeing declined to confirm the CNN Money report, which cited three unnamed sources as saying Boeing's board had approved the decision to sell the plane late last year. "We are continuing to work through the business case and talk to customers about a potential 737 MAX 10X," the Chicago-based plane maker said in a statement on Thursday. "Once this process is successfully completed, we will be in a position to share more details."

The comments from one of the industry's toughest buyers reflect the stakes involved in meeting manufacturing targets for large aerospace industry orders after a series of costly delays. Qatar Airways remains in talks with CFM International about supplying engines for an upgraded order for Airbus Group's A321neo medium-haul jets, which it expects to finalise "soon", Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told Reuters. The carrier has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by delayed engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, and plans to swap the overall aircraft order, which originally covered 50 jets, to the larger A321neo. CFM, owned by General Electric and France's Safran , competes with Pratt & Whitney to power Airbus' medium-haul jets. Al Baker acknowledged Qatar had received competitive launch prices when it originally ordered Pratt & Whitney engines, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees. "It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance," he said in an interview. Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, in which it aims to buy 49 percent. Qatar is also one of the launch customers for the newest Boeing long-haul jet, the 777-9, formerly code-named 777-9X. Boeing plans to deliver the 406-seat jet from 2020, but aviation news site FlightGlobal reported last year it could advance deliveries to late 2019 due to spare cushion in the development schedule. "We have already told Boeing that as they are bringing ahead the (777-)9X deliveries, we would be interested. The 777-9X programme is ahead of schedule and we have no problem if they want to bring our deliveries ahead," Al Baker said. A Boeing spokesman said: "Development of the 777X programme is progressing to plan and we will deliver to the schedule we committed to our airline customers." FUEL SURCHARGES Al Baker was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, the airline's third such facility abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai. It is also building lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and negotiating space in seven other airports. The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity.

Oil prices have risen 20 percent in three months. Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. The carrier plans to serve Nice five times per week from July and expects to announce a similar service to Lyon soon. It also continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added.

 Airbus rallies late to take sales crown from Boeing Benjamin Zhang Jan. 12, 2017, 4:32 PM 1,408 facebook linkedin twitter email print Airbus A350-1000 test flight.Airbus Airbus' and Boeing's fight for supremacy of the skies continue into 2016. The two titans of the aviation industry have been going head-to-head with one another every year for the past two decades. Both airplane makers posted solid numbers during the year, but Airbus rallied late to take the sales crown from Boeing with 731 net orders to Boeing's 668. The Toulouse, France-based company booked an incredible 321 net orders in the month of December to take the lead. "We delivered on our objectives in a challenging environment, proving our ramp-up readiness for the future," Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Brégier. "I salute all our teams on this outstanding achievement." As a result, Airbus boasts a backlog of 6,874 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion. However, all was not lost for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The Seattle-based airplane maker delivered 748 planes to its customers during 2016 — 60 more than Airbus. In addition, Boeing still boasts a healthy backlog of 5,715 planes. Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.Boeing As expected the bulk of Airbus and Boeing's orders were for their respective workhorse A320-family and 737-Series narrow body jets. Twin-engine wide-body jets such as the Airbus A330, A350 along with the Boeing 777 and 787 remain popular. However, both manufacturers continue to struggle finding new buyers for its large jumbo jets. Even with low fuel prices, Airbus ended 2016 with zero net orders for the A380 superjumbo. On the other hand, Boeing's venerable 747 jumbo jet had a banner year with 17 net orders — the most in a decade for the program. Sadly, the 747's new orders are driven by demand for the plane's ability to carry cargo rather than passengers. Unfortunately, even with the 747's stellar year, its order backlog is down to just 28 planes.  SEE ALSO: You can now fly from the US to Europe for $70 — but one day it might be free NOW WATCH: Watch Air France's first Boeing 787 get assembled and painted in this amazing time-lapse Loading video...

Northwest Military Archives    Search Newsletter Advertise with Us Home News Military Life Vets Restaurants Music & Culture Travel Guides PROMO Outdoors Travel Attractions Back to Attractions Wheels up Museum of Flight a great visit By J.M. Simpson on January 12, 2017 The SR-71 Blackbird is a favorite attraction at the Boeing Museum of Flight. Photo credit: J.M. Simpson Write to Editor Leave A Comment Read Comments Tweet AM "Tex" Johnston would like the Boeing's Museum of Flight. He was the pilot, who on a Sunday in August 1955, took the Boeing Company's new jetliner prototype, the Model 367-80, and executed two perfect barrel rolls over Lake Washington. The maneuver stunned everyone, including then Boeing president William Allen.   Moments later, fellow aircraft executive Larry Bell turned to Allen and said, "You don't know Tex very well.  He just sold your airplane." The Boeing Company continued to grow as a global industry, and in the process it created a world-class museum. It is a barrel roll of a place to enjoy aviation history while looking at the planes that made it. The museum first taxied out onto the runway of public awareness in 1965 when it opened a 10,000 square-foot space at the Seattle Center. Today, the TA Wilson Great Gallery is a three million cubic foot, six-story, glass and steel edifice housing over 50 full-size historic aircraft. A nine-ton Douglas DC-3 hangs from the space frame ceiling in flight attitude.  Other aircraft join it in flight. Surrounding the Great Galley are the J. Elroy McCaw Personal Courage Wing, the William M. Allen Theater, the Charles Simonyi Space Gallery, the Aviation Pavilion and the Red Barn. From a replica of Orville and Wilbur Wright's aircraft that flew at Kitty Hawk to walking through the cargo bay of a space shuttle, the museum is a flight through aviation history. Knowledgeable and friendly docents interact with visitors, conduct aviation and space-related talks, answer questions, and tell stories. The museum, a nonprofit, attracts over 500,000 visitors annually. One of the most popular attractions is the M-21 Blackbird, a long-range, Mach 3 plus strategic reconnaissance aircraft that played a key role during the Cold War and beyond. Visitors flocked around the aircraft as a docent talked about its history.  Nearby, children could climb into the cockpit of a Blackbird. Not far away were exhibits of helicopters, early bi-planes and a car, the 1968 Taylor Aerocar III, which could fly. For those interested in some of the Boeing Company's history, the Red Barn offers a look back. The birthplace of the Boeing Airplane Company, the two-story Red Barn offers historic exhibits that reflect the early days of aviation as reflected in the post-and-beam architecture and polished wood floors. "That was really neat," one little boy said as he exited the cockpit of a SR-71. Not to be outdone, his sister promptly climbed in and "flew" the plane for the next couple of minutes, including something reminiscent of a barrel roll. Somewhere, Johnston smiled. Plan on wearing comfortable shoes and spending a few hours. There is a gift store and a café.  The museum is ADA accessible. Active-duty and retired servicemembers and their spouses receive a reduced rate on ticket prices. The museum is located at the southern end of Boeing Field at 9404 East Marginal Way South in Seattle.

(NYSE: BA) booked an order for 100 of its 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. According to reports, those planes are destined for India's low-cost carrier SpiceJet and the order has list-price value of $10 billion. Boeing's arch-rival Airbus was not so fortunate in December. The aircraft maker announced a delay in delivery of 12 of its superjumbo A380s to Emirates airline, the company's biggest customer for its biggest jet. The delay likely is the proximate cause for Airbus's decision to cut production of the A380 to just one new plane per month. The SpiceJet order is expected to be announced at a press conference scheduled for Friday in New Delhi, according to unnamed sources cited at Reuters. The order includes at least 42 737s, that SpiceJet agreed to buy in 2014. Airbus has bested Boeing in orders from India's leading low-cost carrier, IndiGo, and another rival, GoAir. The former has placed an order for 410 Airbus A320neos and has already received 100 A320ceos and 14 of the newer aircraft out of a total order of 530. GoAir has ordered 159 A320s, 155 of the A320neo and the rest A320ceos. Because India is the world's fastest growing market for airplanes, an order for up to 100 planes is a significant boost to Boeing's eventual success in the region. Airbus reportedly competed hard for this order, and it is likely that Boeing had to offer a significant discount to the list price in order to win the deal. Depending on the size of the order and the customer's history, discounts typically range from 40% to 60%. For Airbus, the order delay from Emirates may signal a serious problem. The Dubai-based carrier still has 50 A380s on order, but the airline's chief executive, Sir Tim Clark, has said that 2016 was not a good year and 2017 is likely to be no better and could be slightly worse. A significant overhang for Emirates and the other carriers grouped as the "Middle East Three," or ME3 (Etihad and Qatar Airways) is a dispute over the Open Skies agreement that has led to intense pressure from U.S. carriers, particularly Delta Air Lines, that claim the ME3 are the beneficiary of unfair subsidies and their access to U.S. airports should be curtailed. That argument may resonate with President-elect Donald Trump, who may make the claim that the ME3 are threatening U.S. jobs as a result of the subsidies. While Emirates is not Airbus's biggest customer, it is one of the aircraft maker's most important, if for no other reason than without Emirates it may never turn a profit on the A380 program. While Emirates may have to hit the pause button on its long-haul flights carrying 550 passengers or more, the airline is probably in no danger of folding and giving Airbus an even bigger headache. Shares of Boeing traded down about 1.1% early Thursday morning, at $157.60 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.07. The 12-month consensus price target on the stock is $160.11.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Monday January, 16, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Airbus jets past American rival Boeing on new orders, closes gap on deliveries By Sonia Wolf, AFP January 13, 2017, 12:01 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet TOULOUSE, France -- Airbus on Wednesday said it had outstripped its own delivery expectations in 2016, closing the gap with Boeing, and beat its U.S. archrival on orders. The European aerospace company said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, beating its own target which was hiked in November from 650 to 670. The figures were lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. It also booked a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing but showing a significant drop of nearly a third on the previous year when it logged demand for 1,036 aircraft. Last week, Boeing confirmed orders of 668 planes throughout the year, down 13 percent on 2015 when net orders reached 768. "2016 was a year in which we managed to not only achieve our objectives but to surpass them," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. It was the 14th consecutive year in which the firm chalked up record deliveries. Although it remains behind Boeing, which saw deliveries fell modestly to 748 in 2016, the European group is closing the gap. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. Supply Chain Issues "2016, particularly the first six months, was particularly difficult ... we had more (production) difficulties than expected," Bregier said, referring to supply chain bottlenecks with its A350 long-haul jets. But the company almost reached its delivery target for the aircraft, handing over 49 of the 50 planned deliveries, and two more submitted for flight testing. It also delivered 545 of its single-aisle A320 jetliners, 66 A330s and 28 of its A380 double-decker superjumbos, the production of which is due to be halved next year. In July, Airbus said it would cut the production rate of its A380 to one a month from 2018 to reflect reduced demand. In 2015, the manufacturer handed over 27 planes but next year aims to deliver just 12. The group has seen a slowdown in demand for long-distance carriers due in part to falling fuel prices which have impacted on the renewal of ageing fleets, but also as a result of weakening demand from Gulf carriers which peaked in recent years. Airbus ended the year with a backlog of 6,874 planes with a list price of US$1 billion. Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger jets from budget Indian airline GoAir, in a deal worth US$7.8 billion, the aircraft maker said.

Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. (MIke Mozart/Flickr/CC) The stock market has been on quite a roll in recent weeks, but signs of trouble continue to plague the real economy.  Earlier this week, I talked about the "retail apocalypse" now sweeping America. Major retail chains such as Sears and Macy's are closing stores and laying off workers, but I didn't think Wal-Mart would be feeling the pain as well. Unfortunately, that's precisely what is happening. USA Today is reporting that approximately 1,000 jobs will be cut at Wal-Mart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas by the end of this month: Wal-Mart's plan to lay off of hundreds of employees is the latest ripple in a wave of job cuts and store closures that are roiling the retail industry. The world's largest retailer is cutting roughly 1,000 jobs at its corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, later this month, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak about it. The company is saying these cuts are necessary because Wal-Mart is always "looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively." But something doesn't smell right here. You don't get rid of 1,000 employees at your corporate headquarters if everything is just fine. I have driven past Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville a number of times, and it is in a beautiful part of the country. Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. Meanwhile, there are signs of trouble out on the west coast as well. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that there is going to be a new round of engineering job cuts at Boeing. Boeing Co. has internally announced a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide, including in Southern California, and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to aim for further cuts in 2017. And according to Boeing spokesperson Doug Alder, similar job cut announcements are coming for other classes of workers as well. So why is Boeing getting rid of so many employees? Well, the truth is that Boeing's business is way down. The following comes from Wolf Richter: Business has been tough. In 2016, deliveries fell by 14 jets from a year ago, to 748. Net orders dropped 13 percent from an already-rotten level in 2015, to just 668, down 53 percent from 2014. And the lowest level since 2010! When the economy is doing well, air traffic tends to rise, and when the economy is doing poorly, it tends to go down. Needless to say, the fact that Boeing is doing so poorly does not bode well for the future. In addition to Wal-Mart, another major retailer that is letting people go is Petco. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=235269331" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=235269331" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Petco is cutting 180 positions with about 50 at its San Diego headquarters, the pet supply retailer confirmed Wednesday. The company made the cuts across its workforce and include both existing and open positions. Petco has about 650 workers at its headquarters in Rancho Bernardo. It employs 27,000 in the U.S. My wife and I have three cats, and even though Petco tends to be a bit overpriced, we have always appreciated the work they do. Unfortunately, when the economy gets tough, spending on pets tends to be one of the first things to get cut back, and this current trouble at Petco could be a sign that rough sledding is ahead for the entire economy. Of course, your personal perspective on these things is likely to be very heavily influenced by your immediate surroundings. Those who live in wealthy enclaves of major cities such as San Francisco, New York City or Washington, D.C. may be wondering how anyone could possibly be talking about economic trouble right now. But if you live in economically depressed areas of Appalachia or the upper Midwest, it may seem as though the last economic recession never even ended. There have been pockets of economic prosperity in recent years, and this has resulted in some people becoming exceedingly wealthy. Meanwhile, things have just continued to become even tougher for millions of other families as the cost of living always seems to grow faster than their paychecks do. If you are in the top one percent of all income earners, maybe to you it seems as though things have never been better. But most of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and is just struggling to survive from month to month. The following comes from CNN: The rich are money-making machines. Today, the top mega-wealthy—the top 1%—earn an average of $1.3 million a year. It's more than three times as much as the 1980s, when the rich "only" made $428,000, on average, according to economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of the American population earned an average of $16,000 in pre-tax income in 1980. That hasn't changed in over three decades. The workers being laid off at the companies discussed above are real people with real hopes and real dreams. Perhaps many of them will be able to land other employment fairly soon, but the truth is that the job market is really tough in many areas of the country right now. Finding a good job that will allow you to pay the bills and support your family is not easy. You may find that out the hard way if you end up losing your current job during the economic troubles that will come in 2017. Earlier today, I came across an excellent article by Gail Tverberg that detailed a bunch of reasons a significant economic downturn appears to be imminent in 2017. If you would like to read it, you can find it here. She points to many of the same things to which I have been pointing for a very long time. Even though economic conditions were fairly stable throughout 2016, our long-term problems continued to get even worse. So the truth is that we are more primed for a major crisis today than we have been at any point since the last recession. My hope is that things will not be nearly as bad in 2017 as Gail Tverberg and others are projecting that they could be, but the warning signs are definitely there, and it isn't going to take much to push the U.S. economy off the rails.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Fri, Jan 13, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Airbus deliveries increased last year, but new orders fell AP, PARIS A photo provided by Airbus Group shows an A321 with the Iran Air logo landing at Blagnac airport near Toulouse, France, on Wednesday. Photo: Airbus via AP Airbus Group SE delivered a record number of planes last year, despite engine and cabin production problems, even as new orders slumped for both the European manufacturer and its US rival Boeing Co. An unlikely customer provided a big boost to the industry last year — Iran, which on Wednesday took delivery of its first Airbus plane in years as part of a multibillion-dollar deal made possible by a hard-fought nuclear agreement. Airbus executives defended the superjumbo A380, which has not won as many orders as many had hoped, and played down concerns that the industry is facing a downturn after a long-running buying spree by Mideast and Asian carriers. However, they refused to issue forecasts for this year amid signs that China’s slowdown and volatile fuel prices threaten to weigh on aircraft orders. Airbus on Wednesday said it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015 and above the company’s own expectations. Airbus increased deliveries of its long-delayed A350 wide-body to 49 overall. The A320 range — notably the fuel-efficient A321neo — dominated Airbus sales last year, when it won 731 net orders overall, compared with 1,036 the year before. Last week, Boeing said it delivered 748 planes last year and took in 668 net orders, down from 768 in 2015. “I’m confident that we’ll have a new record in deliveries” this year, Airbus commercial planes sales chief John Leahy said on Wednesday in Toulouse, France. However, he added: “That doesn’t mean that orders are going to be strong.” Racing with Boeing for business in post-sanctions Iran, Airbus made the symbolic move of delivering an A321 jet to Iran Air on Wednesday, the first of 100 planes planned in an Airbus deal worth more than US$18 billion at list prices. Iran’s flag carrier signed a similar deal with Boeing, for 80 jetliners that will not start arriving until 2018. Airbus commercial planes president Fabrice Bregier said that the company would continue work on the Iran planes despite concerns that US president-elect Donald Trump could threaten the international nuclear agreement that paved the way for the aircraft contracts. Airbus also shrugged off concerns of protectionist measures threatened by Trump, saying it is manufacturing in the US too — and delivered its first US-assembled plane last year, an A321 made in Mobile, Alabama. While Airbus insists that the world will need bigger planes like the A380 as population and travel grow, many airlines are turning away from major hubs and using smaller, cheaper planes instead. Airbus has scaled back production of the plane to one per month as orders have lagged. Mark Bobbi of IHS Markit forecast slower order rates in Asia and the Mideast after a period of “over-ordering.” A big question mark hanging over the industry is the rising oil price, which is putting pressure on airlines to cut costs — or to invest in newer, more fuel-efficient planes.

A half-century after MLK's death is Baltimore less segregated? Yes and no. Business Boeing plans buyouts and layoffs for engineers Boeing Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images Boeing will offer voluntary buyout packages for engineers in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. Boeing will offer voluntary buyout packages for engineers in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Dominic GatesThe Seattle Times Boeing Co. has internally announced a new round of employee buyouts for engineers companywide, and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to aim for further cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo regarding the job cuts Tuesday to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. Hamilton’s memo states that details of a buyout offer will be sent Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment April 21.

As internships beckoned, she sent in a number of applications... (Samantha Masunaga) The buyout package will be offered to employees in Washington state, Southern California and South Carolina. There are about 3,500 employees in Boeing’s Southern California commercial division. Hamilton’s message went on to say that 60-day involuntary layoff notices affecting only engineering employees in Washington will be sent out Jan. 20, with layoffs effective March 24. Those layoffs will affect employees in the skill classifications that were offered a buyout package last year, he said. This year's buyout offer is going out mostly to employees in different skill classifications. There will be further involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the buyout offer and it falls short of Boeing's cost-saving target. Hamilton said there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. The extent of the additional job cuts “will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition,” he said. “We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition,” Hamilton said. “The decision to lower the production rate on the 777 program announced in late December underscores that environment and what we need to do to help Boeing win.” Best advice for Lockheed on the F-35?

(Samantha Masunaga) Alder said the workforce reductions this year, as last year, will be achieved where possible through attrition and voluntary buyouts before involuntary layoffs. He said the company also will “aggressively reduce overall spending in 2017 in non-labor areas.” Ray Goforth, executive director of Boeing’s white-collar engineering union — the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace — said the process Boeing is following in cutting jobs was worked out in discussions with the union that led to last year’s surprise agreement to a new six-year union contract. “We knew the company was going to lay off significant numbers of people,” Goforth said. “We wanted to make it as painless as possible.” Los Angeles Times staff writer Samantha Masunaga contributed to this report.

(NYSE: BA) booked an order for 100 of its 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. According to reports, those planes are destined for India’s low-cost carrier SpiceJet and the order has list-price value of $10 billion. Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus was not so fortunate in December. The aircraft maker announced a delay in delivery of 12 of its superjumbo A380s to Emirates airline, the company’s biggest customer for its biggest jet. The delay likely is the proximate cause for Airbus’s decision to cut production of the A380 to just one new plane per month. The SpiceJet order is expected to be announced at a press conference scheduled for Friday in New Delhi, according to unnamed sources cited at Reuters. The order includes at least 42 737s, that SpiceJet agreed to buy in 2014. Airbus has bested Boeing in orders from India’s leading low-cost carrier, IndiGo, and another rival, GoAir. The former has placed an order for 410 Airbus A320neos and has already received 100 A320ceos and 14 of the newer aircraft out of a total order of 530. GoAir has ordered 159 A320s, 155 of the A320neo and the rest A320ceos. Because India is the world’s fastest growing market for airplanes, an order for up to 100 planes is a significant boost to Boeing’s eventual success in the region. Airbus reportedly competed hard for this order, and it is likely that Boeing had to offer a significant discount to the list price in order to win the deal. Depending on the size of the order and the customer’s history, discounts typically range from 40% to 60%. For Airbus, the order delay from Emirates may signal a serious problem. The Dubai-based carrier still has 50 A380s on order, but the airline’s chief executive, Sir Tim Clark, has said that 2016 was not a good year and 2017 is likely to be no better and could be slightly worse. A significant overhang for Emirates and the other carriers grouped as the “Middle East Three,” or ME3 (Etihad and Qatar Airways) is a dispute over the Open Skies agreement that has led to intense pressure from U.S. carriers, particularly Delta Air Lines, that claim the ME3 are the beneficiary of unfair subsidies and their access to U.S. airports should be curtailed. That argument may resonate with President-elect Donald Trump, who may make the claim that the ME3 are threatening U.S. jobs as a result of the subsidies. While Emirates is not Airbus’s biggest customer, it is one of the aircraft maker’s most important, if for no other reason than without Emirates it may never turn a profit on the A380 program. While Emirates may have to hit the pause button on its long-haul flights carrying 550 passengers or more, the airline is probably in no danger of folding and giving Airbus an even bigger headache. Shares of Boeing traded down about 1.1% early Thursday morning, at $157.60 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.07. The 12-month consensus price target on the stock is $160.11.

The airline, which was on the verge of going kaput two years ago, is likely to place the order with US aircraft maker Boeing. An official said the deal for around 90-100 new planes is expected to be announced by SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh on Friday. A SpiceJet spokesperson declined to comment. Currently, the airline has 47 aircraft in its fleet comprising 29 Boeing 737s and 18 Bombardier Q400s. The airline is expected to place order for Boeing 737 family and the 2016 list price for the starting model in this category is little over $90 million per aircraft, the official said. On this basis, the anticipated order value would be at least Rs 55,000 crore at current exchange rates. In 2014, SpiceJet — which has remained in the black for seven straight quarters — had agreed to buy around 42 B 737 MAX planes from Boeing under the previous leadership. The Marans sold their entire 58.46 per cent stake in the airline to Ajay Singh in January 2015. Last week, an airline spokesperson said it was expecting to complete negotiations and place orders for new aircraft this fiscal ending March. "Negotiations are going on for quite some time. We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year," the spokesperson had said. For the 2016 July-September quarter, the airline had posted its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 59 crore. In the year-ago period, the same stood at Rs 29 crore.

The airline, which was on the verge of going kaput two years ago, is likely to place the order with US aircraft maker Boeing. An official said the deal for around 90-100 new planes is expected to be announced by SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh on Friday. A SpiceJet spokesperson declined to comment. Currently, the airline has 47 aircraft in its fleet comprising 29 Boeing 737s and 18 Bombardier Q400s. The airline is expected to place order for Boeing 737 family and the 2016 list price for the starting model in this category is little over $90 million per aircraft, the official said. On this basis, the anticipated order value would be at least Rs 55,000 crore at current exchange rates. In 2014, SpiceJet — which has remained in the black for seven straight quarters — had agreed to buy around 42 B 737 MAX planes from Boeing under the previous leadership. The Marans sold their entire 58.46 per cent stake in the airline to Ajay Singh in January 2015. Last week, an airline spokesperson said it was expecting to complete negotiations and place orders for new aircraft this fiscal ending March. "Negotiations are going on for quite some time. We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year," the spokesperson had said. For the 2016 July-September quarter, the airline had posted its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 59 crore. In the year-ago period, the same stood at Rs 29 crore.

NEW DELHI: US aircraft maker Boeing Inc today launched a skill development programme in association with the aerospace manufacturing firm Jaivel to train front-line workers in the MSME segment in aerospace industry. The programme was announced in the presence of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani at the 8th edition of Vibrant Gujarat Summit, a release said. The programme, which is in line with the Skill India initiative of the Narendra Modi-led NDA Government at the Centre, is aimed at accelerating the growth of domestic aerospace industry by establishing a larger pipeline of skilled aerospace workers, Boeing said in the release. Jaivel Aerospace, a micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME), has undertaken work packages as a sub-tier supplier for Boeing's advanced commercial airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 737 as well as defense platforms such as the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, the release said. "This is Boeing's first skill development initiative for aerospace manufacturing in Gujarat to ensure that entrepreneurial Gujarat businesses are ready to compete at a global scale," Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said. Through the new partnership, Jaivel's role in the local and global aerospace sector will expand, as it helps train future aerospace workers, the release said. "This is an important investment by Boeing, not only for us but also for Gujarat's potential to become an aerospace manufacturing hub. This is testament to Jaivel's aerospace team and we look forward to working with Boeing to create an excellent foundation for an aerospace sector in the state,", Jaivel Aerospace founder and chief executive officer Vipul Vachhani said. Apart from forging such partnerships, Boeing has also been collaborating with leading Indian vocational training institutes, Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Indian partners, including MSMEs, to train workers in the aerospace industry, the release added.

Twice the 747’s human capacity over vast distances can be carried by twin-engine wide-body planes such as Boeing 777 and Airbus A350.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement United Airlines is speeding up the retirement of its Boeing 747 jumbo jets, moving its last flight from the end of 2018 to the last quarter of this year. President Scott Kirby dubbed it a “bittersweet milestone” as the 747s — fondly called the “Queen of the Skies” and have been part of the United fleet since its maiden flight between California and Hawaii in 1970 — once symbolized state-of-the-art travel in the air. End Of An Era “Today, there are more fuel-efficient, cost-effective and reliable widebody aircraft that provide an updated inflight experience for our customers traveling on long-haul flights,” Kirby said in a memo released Wednesday. The company promised to honor the 747 with an “unforgettable” send-off for the icon that it is, details of which will be posted in the months to come. The plan to accelerate the retirement comes on the same day the Federal Aviation Administration is projected to issue a directive that urges potentially costly fixes to older jet models, including the kind that the airline flies. The decision heralds the end of an era for U.S. airlines, which have largely relied on the 747 for mass-market air travel since its debut in the 1970. At the same time, it is a show of Boeing’s struggle as it tries to keep the -8, its latest 747 model, flying amid weakening demand for four-engine airplanes. The Chicago-based Boeing, also one of the two private space taxi providers for NASA, which sold 17 of the freighter editions in 2016, today has only 28 unfilled orders. It has expressed intention to end production if more orders do not come through. Shifting To New Jetliner United currently flies 20 of the 747-400 passenger model, which the jetmaker produced from 1988 to 2009. Almost as much as the 747’s human capacity over vast distances can be carried by twin-engine wide-body planes such as Boeing 777 and Airbus A350, and the older jumbos consume around 20 percent more fuel per seat than the latest 777s. In addition, spare parts and special maintenance prove to be a concern, as more airlines retire the jumbo fleets. Delta Air Lines is parking the jumbo jets this year, while other operators such as Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines have put their 747-400s to rest amid the ongoing shift. While it wouldn’t reveal which aircraft would take the place of the renowned jumbo planes, United has received the first of 14 777-300ERs it ordered for long flights and has requested 35 Airbus A350-1000s. Airline pilots and flight attendants assigned to the 747s will be transitioned to other planes, according to Kirby. Many other changes and developments mark the U.S. airline industry today, with JetBlue recently announcing that all its flights within the continental United States now offer free satellite Wi-Fi for its passengers. Called Fly-Fi, the service is touted to provide speedy broadband to allow passengers to remain connected to the internet on similar data speeds they experience on the ground. Other airlines offer similar in-flight internet services, yet none are both free and available on all aircraft.

RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage of Boeing shares at an underperform rating because of the prospect of declining profit margins in its commercial airplane business and the risk of President-elect Donald Trump's trade policy agenda. "We have found a strong correlation between Boeing's commercial operating margins and the average age of Boeing's platforms. ... We see signs that this is already starting to drive commercial margin pressure," analyst Matthew McConnell wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "It is unclear how President Trump will differ from 'candidate Trump,' but following through on the protectionist policies that were central to his campaign could be a headwind to the commercial aerospace sector," he added.

But a reverse effect is also true: When a company gets in Trump's Twitter crosshairs, it immediately sees the rest of the twittersphere join in the attack. Social intelligence firm Brandwatch analyzed corporate Twitter accounts and their community sentiment, both before and after Trump directly took them on. Some recent examples include Boeing, General Motors, Ford and United Technologies' Carrier. Trump's negative tweets inspired many other tweeters to get mad as well. Look at some of these charts measuring the reaction. The day before Boeing was attacked, Brandwatch's data showed 73 percent of mentions were positive. That basically flipped the next day, going to 68 percent negative. Trump posted this tweet: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072?ref_src=twsrc^tfw Boeing's mentions on the social messaging platform soared to more than 241,000 — a massive spike of nearly 5,000 percent. And almost all of it was negative (represented in red below): No different was the trend for GM. After Trump posted this tweet: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/statuses/816260343391514624 ...GM's mentions jumped 452 percent on Jan. 3, again mostly negative: In Ford's case, he tweeted about the automaker on Nov. 17, Jan. 3 and Jan. 4. The same increase in mentions happened. And here's the drop in sentiment between Jan. 2 and 3: Trump posted about Carrier on Dec. 1, including on Instagram, and the company saw another immediate decline in sentiment. Note that in Carrier's case the drop wasn't as dramatic perhaps because Trump had already been attacking the company for months during the campaign season. In all the examples, it's clear how just a few words from Trump can excite thousands of others to pile on. Trump's press conferences tend to jump from topic to topic (on Wednesday, he criticized Lockheed Martin and pharmaceutical companies), but Twitter is a much more limited platform that forces the president-elect to focus on a single subject. As a result, those 140-character messages can pack a lot of punch against an unlucky company. "There was too much subject matter in the press conference to really dwell on his Lockheed and pharma comments," said Kellan Terry, lead analyst for U.S. political data at Brandwatch. "On Twitter, he only has enough characters to call out one subject or brand."

The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which oversees Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport, says travelers should be prepared for additional crowds and congestion from Jan. 19 through Jan. 22. The airports authority says the influx of passengers may produce longer-than-usual wait times at airline ticket counters and security checkpoints as well as congestion on airport roads. The authority says it's also planning to offer all-day parking on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in its garages at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Parking for the day will cost $10. The authority says reservations will be required and are limited to the first 1,200 bookings.

The Gulf airline has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by alternative Pratt & Whitney engines and expects to swap the overall aircraft order, which was originally for 50 jets, to larger A321neo aircraft. CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran, is locked in a fierce battle with Pratt & Whitney to supply engines for new Airbus medium-haul jets. CFM exclusively supplies engines for the competing Boeing 737 aircraft, which Qatar Airways has also ordered. Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker acknowledged Qatar Airways had received attractive prices when it originally ordered the new Pratt & Whitney engine, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees. "It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance," he told Reuters in an interview. Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, where it hopes to tie up a deal to take a 49-percent stake around the end of the month. It has told Boeing it is interested in taking earlier delivery of future 777-9 aircraft, because that programme is ahead of schedule, Al Baker added. Asked if Qatar Airways could take on delivery of aircraft for airlines in which it has stakes, like BA owner IAG and Latam, he said "why not," but added he believed those airlines would take their planes as planned. He was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre business lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, the airline's third premium lounge abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai. It is building further lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and is negotiating lounge space in seven other airports, he said. The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity. Qatar Airways, which also plans to launch a new premium cabin at a trade fair in March, is investing an unspecified amount in new product to attract passengers "with the right yield" or average revenues, Al Baker said. But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda because of a recent rebound in oil prices. "(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up," he said. "Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly." Oil prices have risen 20 percent in the last three months. Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. It plans to serve Nice five times a week from July and announce a similar service to Lyon soon. It continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added.

The new model, dubbed the 737 Max 10X, would be longer than the slow selling 737 Max 9, currently the biggest version of the single-aisle airliner. The Max 10X, if launched, would be the third new or revamped 737 model in as many years and the fifth in Boeing's lineup. The first Max model delivers this year and the Max 9 follows in 2018. Boeing won approval from its board of directors in late 2016 to go out and make deals for the jet with airlines, three people said. If Boeing wins enough airline commitments, the Max 10X would be officially launched as a new Boeing airliner. Boeing wants the jet to be ready for airline use by mid-2020, the people said. The U.S. plane maker's latest design is a defensive move to keep airlines from buying Airbus and giving it more time to cultivate plans for an all-new airliner that would fly 200 to 275 passengers as far as 5,000 nautical miles, according to industry officials. The plans are the latest move in the chess game of one of the world's fiercest corporate rivalries. One industry leader called the Boeing concept "a band aid to take a few percentage points off Airbus market share." United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Airlines (ALK), as well as Air Canada (ACDVF), Indonesian low-cost carrier Lion Air and airlines in China top Boeing's customer wish list, the people said. Many operate the largest 737 model currently flying along side Airbus jets or have ordered the new 737 Max 9. The Max 9 has been losing sales to its rival Airbus's A321neo. Boeing is working with customers "to work through the business case" for the Max 10X, the company said, and "once this process is successfully completed we will be in a position to share more details." United, Delta and Alaska declined to comment. Air Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The world's new planes in 2017 Boeing and Airbus have tried to fill a void left by Boeing's discontinued 757. Neither Boeing nor Airbus have matched its seating or range until recently. By 2018, Airbus' A321neo will be able to carry up to 240 passengers (239 on the 757), or by 2019, fly around 160 to 180 across the Atlantic, according to analyst estimates. Airlines have ordered 1,400 A321neos, compared to around 425 for Boeing's competing models, according to Flightglobal Ascend. That success has given Airbus a nearly 1,500 order lead over Boeing on its newest workhorses. The plane maker wants to end a spate of defections. Korean Air and Norwegian Air Shuttle, traditionally Boeing single-aisle jet buyers, split recent deals with both Boeing and Airbus (EADSF) in favor of the A321neo. Boeing sales decline despite late buying spree To keep costs down on the Max 10X, Boeing is using the same engines from the smaller Max models and only adding five and a half feet to the fuselage length and making changes to the landing gear to improve takeoff and landing performance, the company said. Aviation Week on Wednesday first reported some technical specifications of the Max 10X. The Max 10X won't beat the A321neo on range or seating, but is designed to make Boeing's loyal customers think twice about buying Airbus against its claim of Max 10's lower operating costs. The Max 10X would seat around 190 in two classes or up to 230 in all-economy, 10 to 15 more than its smaller stablemate, said Boeing. Singapore Airlines shops for world's longest jet Boeing is aiming the jet at airlines prioritizing seating over Atlantic Ocean-crossing range. Airlines with first and economy classes could fly around 3,000 nautical miles, enough for U.S. transcontinental flying, according to one person briefed on the jet's performance. Boeing's strategy isn't new. In the late 1990s, Boeing launched a longer and higher capacity model of its twin-aisle 767. Only Delta and Continental Airlines bought, keeping both airlines in Boeing's camp. Boeing launched the all-new 787 Dreamliner, its replacement, in 2003.

The U.S. plane maker's latest design is a defensive move to keep airlines from buying Airbus and giving it more time to cultivate plans for an all-new airliner that would fly 200 to 275 passengers as far as 5,000 nautical miles, according to industry officials. The plans are the latest move in the chess game of one of the world's fiercest corporate rivalries. One industry leader called the Boeing concept "a band aid to take a few percentage points off Airbus market share." United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines, as well as Air Canada, Indonesian low-cost carrier Lion Air and airlines in China top Boeing's customer wish list, the people said. Many operate the largest 737 model currently flying along side Airbus jets or have ordered the new 737 Max 9. The Max 9 has been losing sales to its rival Airbus's A321neo. Boeing is working with customers "to work through the business case" for the Max 10X, the company said, and "once this process is successfully completed we will be in a position to share more details." United, Delta and Alaska declined to comment. Air Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boeing and Airbus have tried to fill a void left by Boeing's discontinued 757. Neither Boeing nor Airbus have matched its seating or range until recently. By 2018, Airbus' A321neo will be able to carry up to 240 passengers (239 on the 757), or by 2019, fly around 160 to 180 across the Atlantic, according to analyst estimates. Airlines have ordered 1,400 A321neos, compared to around 425 for Boeing's competing models, according to Flightglobal Ascend. That success has given Airbus a nearly 1,500 order lead over Boeing on its newest workhorses. The plane maker wants to end a spate of defections. Korean Air and Norwegian Air Shuttle, traditionally Boeing single-aisle jet buyers, split recent deals with both Boeing and Airbus in favor of the A321neo. To keep costs down on the Max 10X, Boeing is using the same engines from the smaller Max models and only adding five and a half feet to the fuselage length and making changes to the landing gear to improve takeoff and landing performance, the company said. Aviation Week on Wednesday first reported some technical specifications of the Max 10X. The Max 10X won't beat the A321neo on range or seating, but is designed to make Boeing's loyal customers think twice about buying Airbus against its claim of Max 10's lower operating costs. The Max 10X would seat around 190 in two classes or up to 230 in all-economy, 10 to 15 more than its smaller stablemate, said Boeing. Boeing is aiming the jet at airlines prioritizing seating over Atlantic Ocean-crossing range. Airlines with first and economy classes could fly around 3,000 nautical miles, enough for U.S. transcontinental flying, according to one person briefed on the jet's performance. Boeing's strategy isn't new. In the late 1990s, Boeing launched a longer and higher capacity model of its twin-aisle 767. Only Delta and Continental Airlines bought, keeping both airlines in Boeing's camp. Boeing launched the all-new 787 Dreamliner, its replacement, in 2003.

The new model, dubbed the 737 Max 10X, would be longer than the slow selling 737 Max 9, currently the biggest version of the single-aisle airliner. The Max 10X, if launched, would be the third new or revamped 737 model in as many years and the fifth in Boeing’s lineup. The first Max model delivers this year and the Max 9 follows in 2018.

File photo   | Photo Credit: Reuters PTI New Delhi January 12, 2017 17:37 IST Updated: January 12, 2017 20:57 IST more-in After long drawn discussions, SpiceJet is all set to announce an order for 90-100 new aircraft estimated to be worth at least Rs. 55,000 crore as the no-frills carrier looks to expand its fleet. The airline, which was on the verge of going kaput two years ago, is likely to place the order with U.S. aircraft maker Boeing. An official said the deal for around 90-100 new planes is expected to be announced by SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh on Friday. A SpiceJet spokesperson declined to comment. Currently, the airline has 47 aircraft in its fleet comprising 29 Boeing 737s and 18 Bombardier Q400s. The airline is expected to place order for Boeing 737 family and the 2016 list price for the starting model in this category is little over $90 million per aircraft, the official said. On this basis, the anticipated order value would be at least Rs. 55,000 crore at current exchange rates. In 2014, SpiceJet — which has remained in the black for seven straight quarters — had agreed to buy around 42 B 737 MAX planes from Boeing under the previous leadership. The Marans sold their entire 58.46 per cent stake in the airline to Ajay Singh in January 2015. Last week, an airline spokesperson said it was expecting to complete negotiations and place orders for new aircraft this fiscal ending March. “Negotiations are going on for quite some time. We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the spokesperson had said. For the 2016 July-September quarter, the airline had posted its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs. 59 crore. In the year-ago period, the same stood at Rs. 29 crore.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology United to retire its Boeing 747s in 2017: Farewell to a Jumbo plane with a Jumbo heart United Airlines is set to retire the Boeing 747 from its fleet later this year. The Jumbo was inspired by vision, kept aloft by ingenuity, and adored by dreamers Dean Williams January 12, 2017 17:16 IST Boeing rolled out its first 747 aircraft in September 1968. In Picture: The Boeing 747, being displayed to the public for the first time.Wiki Commons/ SAS Scandinavian Airlines They say all good things come to an end, beautiful things sooner than most. And the Boeing 747 'Jumbo Jet' is arguably one of the most beautiful things ever to lift off the face of the Earth. She's not beautiful in a sultry 'come hither' way, rather in a manner that defies words: slightly odd-shaped, but powerful and safe; like a nanny that's been around you for decades. Is the iconic commercial aircraft Boeing 747 being retired? United Airlines' recent announcement that they would be retiring the last of their 747s later this year signaled the end; the beginning of which arrived a long time ago. Boeing followed up by stating that should no new orders arise (an increasingly likely scenario) they will call time on production of an aircraft that made the company a household name. Having flown in 747s of various varieties (Classic, 300 Combi, and the 400) for the last few decades, and even had the pleasure of working on a few in an engineering sense, there is a brooding sense of loss. The joy, as a young boy, of watching the giants land at Heathrow through the double-glazed windows of the Skyways Hotel in the early '80s has never been matched. Even the A380 hasn't inspired the feeling of awe I got the first time I walked down the tarmac to the waiting behemoth, tugging at my mother's hand, beseeching her to walk faster so we could get closer... sooner. There she was, glinting in an early evening sun; it's one of my earliest memories, and also my most vivid. And then, of course, there was the upper deck – "stairs in a plane!" – that lofty haven for the business and first class. Above the plebs, higher in the clouds than everyone else. Towering even at 40,000 feet. The only other aircraft, apart from the 747, that have sent tingles down my spine have been the rough and ready, bums on the flame, Mig-21; and the F-14 Tomcat, the swing-wing wonder made all the more thrilling by the fact that it was flown by Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer in Top Gun. But while the Fishbed and the Tomcat had the power and growl to demand your attention, the 747 just stood there. You looked at it, then cocked your head to the side and looked again – nope still looks odd. Those four engines idly rotating on the apron seemed to speak a language all of their own. They could've said anything, but it didn't matter, it was the sound of them speaking that did. Like an airborne Sean Connery or Richard Burton. Boeing may stop manufacturing the Jumbo, but that doesn't mean it's going to disappear from the skies. The Third World will still use this work-horse, with its exceptional safety record, to ferry lives across oceans and continents.  People visiting air and space museums will still marvel at its shape and wonder how on earth they got it off the ground. It will be there whenever you care to look. Over the next few decades, its stature may decline as a generation emerges more in tune with the hi-tech hum of the Airbus family, and Boeing's new line-up. But like a beloved curio that was wrapped up and stored in a closet for years, when you see it on that rare occasion, you will know just why you were in love with it for so long and with such intensity. The Boeing 747 was inspired by vision, kept aloft by ingenuity, and adored by dreamers. For those of us she transported to loves and lives across continents; for those of us she deigned to show her beating heart underneath the cowlings and panels; for those of us who grew up with her: She's the very essence of a glittering moonbeam reflecting off the clouds as you fly above them. Farewell for now old friend, and we'll always look for your contrails as you make your endless journeys, passing over us like an angel with metallic wings. Related It can't get stranger!

Singapore/New Delhi: SpiceJet is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing, two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into the South Asian nation's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for plane makers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs. 737 jets boeing spicejet Recommended For You World RecordSubstitute Bangladesh Wicketkeeper Imrul Kayes Sets World Record Complete List62nd Jio Filmfare Awards: Aamir's Dangal, Alia Bhatt Win Top Honours wedding bellsYogeshwar Dutt's Golden Gesture, Accepts Re 1 as Dowry The Next GalaxySamsung Galaxy S8 Revealed: Price, Specs And Everything Else You Need to Know Oops!Vin Diesel Calls Ranveer Deepika's Boyfriend And Her Smile Just Confirms It!

Airbus did better than it itself expected on delivering planes in 2016, closing the gap with the US's Boeing, which it outstripped in orders. It made a record 688 commercial plane deliveries, beating its own target which was raised from 650 to 670 in November, thanks to a surge in December when it delivered 111. That made 2016 the 14th consecutive year in which the firm has chalked up record deliveries. Airbus also took a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing's 668, but down nearly a third from 2015's 1,036. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger planes from Indian budget airline GoAir. Saudi airline has placed an order worth 8.6 billion dollars (8.1 billion euros), it was reported on Thursday. First delivery to Iran Airbus delivered the first of the Iranian order, which has a list price of about 20 billion dollars (19 billion euros), on Wednesday and marked the event with a ceremony at its factory in Toulouse, south-west France. "It's a new, magnificent chapter and a great day" for ties between Iran and the EU, said IranAir's chief executive Farhad Parvaresh at the ceremony, adding that the "distance between us caused by political adversities have been narrowed by hard work of the international peace keepers". Airbus boss Fabrice Bregier also hailed the renewal of ties with Iran, saying the "renaissance of Iran aviation sector is one of the most important developments for our industry for many years". IranAir has also signed a contract with Boeing, its biggest in 40 years, for the sale of 80 planes for 16.6 billion dollars (15.6 billion euros). Iran needs 400-500 planes over the next decade, according to the Iranian Civil Aviation Authority.   Tweeter Related Iran spends €19 billion on France's … Canadian air force orders 16 Airbus … Poland to invite tenders for … Sport 16/01/2017 CAN 2017 Sport Football Senegal take early control of Group B as Zimbabwe scare Algeria 15/01/2017 CAN 2017 Football Gabon Senegal set to bust the ghosts of Africa Cup of Nations past 15/01/2017 CAN 2017 Algeria Mali Leekens urges Algeria to avoid Zimbabwe trap Press reviews 15/01/2017 French weekly magazines review 15 January 2017 14/01/2017 African press review 14 January 2017 AFP Ghana begin latest Africa Cup of Nations bid, Egypt return Out-of-sorts Halep becomes first major Australian Open casualty Crosby the hero as Green Bay edge Dallas in NFL thriller Pacific 'wave pilot' kept ancient skills alive Mushfiqur felled in New Zealand late charge Eight men own half the world's wealth: Oxfam What changes under Turkey's new constitution plan?

The fourth mission of the program is now underway and just passed 600 days in Earth orbit. Credit: USAF/Boeing The U.S. Air Force's mysterious X-37B space plane has now spent 600 days in Earth orbit on the vessel's latest mission, and is nearing a program record for longest time spent in space. The robotic X-37B lifted off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on May 20, 2015, kicking off the program's fourth space mission (which is known as Orbital Test Vehicle-4, or OTV-4). If the uncrewed spacecraft spends 74 more days aloft, it will break the duration record set during OTV-3, which touched down in October 2014. [The X-37B's Fourth Mystery Mission in Photos] But it's unclear how long OTV-4 will last, or just what the X-37B is doing as it circles Earth; most details about the space plane's missions and payloads are classified. This SPACE.com infographic depicts the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle is an unmanned space test vehicle for the USAF. See how the unmanned space drone works here. Credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com   Milestone record keeping The first OTV mission began on April 22, 2010, and concluded on Dec. 3 of that year, following 224 days of orbit. OTV-2 lifted off on March 5, 2011, and landed on June 16, 2012, after 468 days in orbit. The record-setting OTV-3 mission chalked up nearly 675 days in orbit, circling Earth from Dec. 11, 2012, until Oct. 17, 2014. All three previous OTV missions have come down to Earth at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but that may change for OTV-4's landing, whenever it occurs. Heading for Florida? Progress has been made on consolidating X-37B space plane operations, including the use of NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida as a landing site for the robotic space plane. A former KSC space-shuttle facility known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1 (OPF-1) was converted into a structure that will enable the Air Force "to efficiently land, recover, refurbish and relaunch the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV)," according to representatives of the aerospace giant Boeing. X-37B vehicle development falls under the control of Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems in El Segundo, California, which is Boeing's center for all space and experimental systems and government and commercial satellites. The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office is leading the Department of Defense's OTV initiative, by direction of the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics and the secretary of the Air Force. Fleet size To date, only two reusable X-37B vehicles have been confirmed as constituting the space plane fleet. The current OTV-4 mission is the second flight of the second X-37B vehicle built for the Air Force by Boeing. The U.S. Air Force's X-37B space plane waits in the encapsulation cell of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle on April 5, 2010, at the Astrotech facility in Titusville, Florida. The vehicle launched on the first X-37B mission on April 22, 2010. Credit: U.S. Air Force The military space plane looks like a miniature version of NASA's retired space shuttle orbiter. The X-37B is just 29 feet (8.8 meters) long and 9.6 feet (2.9 m) tall, and has a wingspan of nearly 15 feet (4.6 m). For comparison, the space shuttles were each 122 feet (37 m) long, with wingspans of 78 feet (24 m). The X-37B has a payload bay about the size of a pickup truck bed that can be outfitted with a robotic arm. It has a launch weight of 11,000 lbs. (4,990 kilograms) and is powered in orbit by gallium arsenide solar cells with lithium-ion batteries. Payloads aboard Some payloads aboard the OTV-4 craft have been previously identified. For example, Aerojet Rocketdyne has said that its XR-5A Hall Thruster had completed initial in-orbit validation testing aboard the X-37B space plane. Also on board is a NASA advanced-materials investigation. Such test-bedding of equipment is one of the main purposes of OTV missions, along with the development of reusable-spacecraft technologies, Air Force officials have said.   "It remains a very useful way to test out things," Winston Beauchamp, deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space, told Space.com last September during an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) meeting in Long Beach, California. When asked about adding more X-37Bs to the nation's fleet, Beauchamp said that the current number of vehicles meets the Air Force's needs.

The decision marks the end of an era for US airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. It is also a reminder of the tough task Boeing faces as it tries to keep its newest 747 model, the -8, aloft amid waning demand for four-engine aircraft. The plane maker has just 28 unfilled orders, after closing 17 sales of the freighter version of the jet last year. Boeing has said it would end production if more orders don’t materialise. "It’s a bittersweet milestone – this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel," the United president Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees. Last year, the UK’s Daily Mail reported a former Pan Am 747 passenger plane was being advertised as a "head of state configured aircraft" and thought to be worth in the region of £18 million (Dh81m). It was extensively refurbished in 2004, and the aircraft’s extravagant interior features luxury en-suite bedrooms, ministerial boardrooms complete with conferencing facilities, offices, stylish dining areas and soft furnishing. The 195ft wingspan special performance model plane has been a regular feature at Bournemouth Airport, Dorset, for roughly a decade and is one of only 12 left flying after just 45 of the high end planes were built. It was leased from Worldwide Aircraft Holding in 1995 by the Qatar ruling family the Al Thanis and was painted in the colours of the country’s maroon and white flag soon after. Also last year the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden unveiled their new "tour bus" – a personalised 747 that replaced the band’s previous set of wings, a 757. Frontman Bruce Dickinson is a licensed pilot and Iron Maiden used the jet on their Book of Souls world tour. Dickinson has been flying for over 20 years and previously he was a professional pilot for the now defunct British charter line Astraeus. The eye-catching livery of the plane was applied Sharjah. While it has long been a favourite of celebrities and the mega-rich, the jumbo hit world headlines again when it carried the US Space Shuttle on its back during flight tests. Nasa flew two modified 747s, originally manufactured for commercial use, as Space Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. One is a 747-123 model, while the other was designated a 747-100SR-46 model. The two aircraft were identical in performance as Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA). The SCAs were used to ferry space shuttle orbiters from landing sites back to the launch complex at the Kennedy Space Center and also to and from other locations too distant for the orbiters to be delivered by ground transport. The jumbo carried its last shuttle in 2012. Chicago-based United flies 20 of the 747-400 passenger model, which Boeing manufactured from 1988 and 2009. Delta Air Lines, the other US operator, is also parking the jumbo jets this year. Cathay Pacific Airways, ANA, Singapore Airlines and Air France are among carriers that have retired their 747-400 jetliners this decade amid a shift from four-engine aircraft. Twin-engine wide-bodies suchas Boeing’s 777 and the Airbus A350 can haul almost as many people over vast distances as aviation’s behemoths, the 747 and Airbus’ A380 superjumbo. United’s jumbos burn about 20 per cent more fuel per seat than its newest 777s and require special handling from maintenance technicians. Sourcing spare parts is becoming a headache as more airlines retire their jumbo fleets, according to the airline. The United spokesman Luke Punzenberger would not say which wide-body aircraft would replace the planes that have served as the airline’s workhorses on trans-Pacific routes for two decades. The carrier has taken delivery of the first of 14 Boeing 777-300ERs it has ordered for long-range flying. The airline also has ordered 35 Airbus A350-1000s, but is weighing converting those twin-aisle jets to the smaller 900 variant or the mid-sized A330, the United chief financial officer Andrew Levy said in November. The airline plans to move pilot and flight attendant crews assigned to the 747 transition to other aircraft, Kirby told employees. "Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities," he said. "And of course, we’ll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration." * Agencies Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Embraer on flight path to strong fourth-quarter results Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Lockheed assures Trump it will cut F-35 fighter jet costs Air France-KLM chief sees storm clouds ahead for airline MOST VIEWED Business | All Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Are tourists or visitors allowed to drive Dubai-registered cars?

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Aerospace & Defense | Thu Jan 12, 2017 | 5:35am EST India's SpiceJet to seal $10 billion deal with Boeing for 737 jets: sources A SpiceJet Boeing 737-800 aircraft taxis on the tarmac after landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji international airport in Mumbai November 26, 2012. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui By Anshuman Daga and Tommy Wilkes | SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI India's SpiceJet (SPJT.BO) is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing (BA.N), two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into the South Asian nation's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus (AIR.PA) has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's (INGL.NS) IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

Trump team struggles for cohesion on tougher China policy WASHINGTON The incoming U.S. administration’s tough talk against China has set the stage for showdowns on everything from security to trade and cyberspace, but contradictory signals are sowing uncertainty over how far President-elect Donald Trump is prepared to go in confronting Beijing.

The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus <AIR.PA> has won record-sized orders with IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market, showing double-digit growth in annual passenger numbers thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of the 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

By the Editorial Board / Published: January 12, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A new generation of aircraft, including the Boeing 737Max, have helped open secondary U.S. airports to European routes. (Boeing) The Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport has experienced growth over the last two years for a fundamental reason — passengers have filled planes. Airport Executive Director Carl R. Beardsley noted recently that “load factors,” the percentage of sold seats per flight, average about 85 percent. Local travelers, it seems, have begun to consider the ancillary costs — tolls, time, fuel and lodging — that go with using other airports. The growing service at the airport helps to create more competitive fares. Meanwhile, the Lackawanna and Luzerne county governments that control the airport should examine an intriguing trend. European carriers have begun to establish service at smaller East Coast airports to reduce costs and escape the congestion at major airports. Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier, began service last fall between Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, and Shannon International Airport — a major European gateway. And Norwegian, a discount carrier, plans to begin service to Ireland this year from Stewart International Airport in Newburg, New York, 98 miles from Scranton. T.F. Green Airport, in Warwick, Rhode Island, also is in talks with Norwegian. Because of a new generation of highly fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 737Max and the Airbus 321Neo, carriers profitably can cover longer distances with fewer passengers. The 737Max and 32Neo are single-aisle, two-engine jets that carry 180 to 220 passengers. Larger, two-aisle jumbo jets such as the new Boeing 787 and Airbus 350 usually carry at least 100 more passengers. The smaller passenger loads eliminate the need to funnel hundreds of passengers from many locations through big hubs. Ground services — aircraft maintenance, crew lodging and so on — also typically are much cheaper in secondary markets. As reported by The New York Times, a record 18,000 city pairs were connected by direct air service in 2016. Many of them are major cities, but there has been substantial growth among secondary markets. As new secondary market routes become established, other carriers likely will consider joining the market. AVP should be ready to attract that service.

REUTERS/Danish SiddiquiMore By Anshuman Daga and Tommy Wilkes SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's SpiceJet is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing , two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into the South Asian nation's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus (AIR.PA) has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's (INGL.NS) IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

What we know The whereabouts of the Boeing 777 has remained a mystery since March 2014 By AMANDA DEVLIN 13th January 2017, 11:35 am Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments DOOMED Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared without a trace. Analysis of the plane’s last moments have suggested that it crashed at a high speed without a pilot in control. Alamy 4 Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board (stock image) But investigators remain puzzled over the whereabouts of the missing aircraft, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew when it vanished in March 2014 – with researchers proving that they had been looking in the wrong place. Despite experts never having found the body of any of its passengers, the hunt for MH370 is now set to end after nearly three years. News that the search teams were abandoning their mission saw a series of conspiracy theories resurface – so here are the key facts about the missing plane: What happened on March 8, 2014? Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur carrying 239 people on board. They included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadn’t been home in a year. The plane had recorded 7,525 take-offs and landings as well as 53,420 flight hours when it made its last journey. The MH370 Boeing was seen for the last time on military radar at 2.14am, close to the south of Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca. Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was “Good night Malaysian three seven zero”. Half an hour later, the airline lost contact with the plane. It had been due to land at around 6.30am. The search and rescue: What happened next? Evidence from a military radar suggested the plane had suddenly changed course. Dozens of rescue planes and ships moved their search efforts to the sea west of Malaysia before the country’s Prime Minister Najib Razak claimed MH370 had been deliberately diverted by someone on board. He added that they believed it had continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with air control. In the end, the search spanned to almost three million square mile – which is 1.5 per cent of the earth’s surface. A week after disappearing satellite images of possible debris appeared to suggest that the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, south west of Australia. But the search for the black box in this area was abandoned after nothing was found. Now it seems that the search took place in the wrong location. An international investigation revealed that the search area needs to be extended to an untouched 25,000 kilometre square area in the southern Indian Ocean. Aidan Ellis 4 In total 1.5 per cent of the earth’s surface has been searched for the missing plane When was debris from the plane discovered? On July 29, 2015 – more than a year after the plane’s disappearance – debris was found by volunteers cleaning a beach in St Andre, Reunion. A week later investigators confirmed the debris did belong to MH370, but it did not help to locate the plane as it had drifted in the water. On October 7, 2017  it was announced that two wing flaps found in Mauritius came from missing flight. Some shocked relatives found it difficult to believe that this was genuinely debris from the plane. They said they think their loved ones are still alive and are being held at “an undisclosed location for unknown reasons.” AFP 4 A map showing pieces of debris scattered from the Malaysia Airlines jet that went missing in 2014 What has MH370’s debris revealed? The wing flaps showed that the plane was not in a landing position when it plunged into the ocean, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said. If the pilot was planning a controlled ditching of the plane, the wing flaps would have been configured for landing. As this was not the case, a report by the bureau concluded that the aircraft appeared to be “out of control” during its final journey. Chief search operator Peter Foley said: “You can never be 100%. We are very reluctant to express absolute certainty. “You can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone was in control.” If someone had been controlling the plane it could have glided much further than thought – meaning rescuers could have been searching the wrong area. More than 20 bits of debris suspected or confirmed to be from MH370 have washed ashore on coastlines throughout the Indian Ocean. However, a deep sea sonar search for the main underwater wreckage found nothing. Getty Images 4 This shows a trailing edge section of Boeing 777 left, outboard flap, originating from the Malaysian Airlines aircraft What are the theories about the fate of MH370? 1) Russian president Vladimir Putin was accused of being involved in the hijacking of MH370. by a US Science writer. Jeff Wise claimed Putin “spoofed” the plane’s navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome  so he could “hurt the West”. 2) French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked. A book called Flight MH370 – The Mystery also suggested that it had been shot down accidentally by US-Thai joint jet fighters suring a military exercise and covered it up. 3) Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested that the crash could have been suicide. He said that someone on-board could have taken out a large life insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back money they owed.

An unlikely customer provided a big boost to the industry in 2016: Iran, scheduled to receive its first Airbus plane in years Wednesday as part of a multibillion-dollar deal made possible by a hard-fought nuclear agreement. Airbus executives defended the superjumbo A380, which has not won as many orders as many had hoped, and played down concerns that the industry is facing a downturn after a long-running buying spree by Mideast and Asian carriers. However, they refused to issue forecasts for this year amid signs that China’s slowdown and volatile fuel prices threaten to weigh on aircraft orders. Airbus announced Wednesday that it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015 and above the company’s own expectations. Airbus increased deliveries of its long-delayed A350 wide-body to 49 overall. The A320 range — notably the fuel-efficient A321neo — dominated Airbus sales last year, when it won 731 net orders overall, compared with 1,036 the year before. Boeing says it delivered 748 planes in 2016 and took in 668 net orders, down from 768 orders in 2015. “I’m confident that we’ll have a new record in deliveries” in 2017, Airbus commercial planes sales chief John Leahy said Wednesday in Toulouse. However, he added, “That doesn’t mean that orders are going to be strong.” Fabrice Bregier, president of Airbus commercial planes, said that the first half of 2016 was “unusually difficult from a production perspective.” He said the company managed to speed up output by the end of the year after suppliers fixed problems with engines and cabin equipment. He said Airbus is now focusing on ramping up deliveries and reducing its big backlog — 6,874 planes ordered but not yet delivered. Racing with Boeing for business in post-sanctions Iran, Airbus is making the symbolic move of delivering an A321 jet to Iran Air on Wednesday, the first of 100 planes planned in an Airbus deal worth more than $18 billion dollars at list prices. Iran’s flag carrier signed a similar deal with Boeing, for 80 jetliners that won’t start arriving until 2018. Bregier said Airbus would continue work on the Iran planes despite concerns that President-elect Donald Trump could threaten the international nuclear agreement that paved the way for the aircraft contracts. Airbus also shrugged off concerns of protectionist measures threatened by Trump, noting that it’s manufacturing in the U.S. now too — and delivered its first U.S.-assembled plane last year, an A321 made in Mobile, Alabama. Mark Bobbi of IHS Markit said Airbus is likely to enjoy sustained demand for single-aisle planes this year and remain dominant over Boeing in that market, while the U.S. manufacturer will keep the lead in wide-bodies. However, he warned, demand for wide-bodies is “coming to a slump.” That’s especially bad news for the A380 superjumbo program, which he said is on “life support.” While Airbus insists that the world will need bigger planes like the A380 as population and travel grow, many airlines are turning away from major hubs and using smaller, cheaper planes instead. Airbus has scaled back production of the plane to one per month as orders have lagged. Overall, Bobbi forecast slower order rates in Asia and the Mideast after a period of “over-ordering.” A big question mark hanging over the industry is the rising oil price, which is putting pressure on airlines to cut costs — or to invest in newer, more fuel-efficient planes.

Fred Katayama reports. Video Transcript The race for new aircraft orders in 2016 has ended with Airbus beating Boeing. It posted 731 new orders - 63 more than the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer. The European plane maker also enjoyed an eight per cent rise in deliveries for the year. It beat its own forecasts, although Boeing still won that race with 748. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier: (SOUNDBITE) FABRICE BREGIER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "We have delivered 688 aircraft, which is a new Airbus record, last year was 635 if I remember well. It is another year of growth, we enjoyed 14 consecutive years of production increase." The surge in Airbus orders included a large deal with Iran, which has been on a spending spree after the lifting of sanctions. But there was one down-side - Airbus is planning to cut its A380 output from next year after demand fell. Airbus COO John Leah: (SOUNDBITE) JOHN LEAH, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, AIRBUS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "What's interesting is traffic is doubling every fifteen years and they're not going to build another Heathrow, they're not going to build another Charles-de-Gaulle or JFK. This aeroplane will start dominating the market at least at those 90 percent of long-haul passengers who fly through 55 cities today." Confident talk - but the A380 program took another blow in late December. Emirates delayed some 2017 deliveries because of pressure from the impact of low oil prices. That could put the double-decker back into a loss, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service. Multimedia AUDIO What will be the effect of the new US President on the markets?

Photo / Getty Images United Airlines plans to fly its last Boeing 747 jumbo jet late this year, retiring its largest air planes a year ahead of schedule as the iconic aircraft glides into the sunset. The decision marks the end of an era for US airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. It's also a reminder of the tough task Boeing faces as it tries to keep its newest 747 model, the -8, aloft amid waning demand for four-engine aircraft. The Chicago-based planemaker has just 28 unfilled orders, after closing 17 sales of the freighter version of the jet last year. Boeing has said it would end production if more orders don't materialise. "It's a bittersweet milestone -- this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel," United President Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees Wednesday. The Chicago-based carrier flies 20 of the 747-400 passenger model, which Boeing manufactured from 1988 and 2009. Delta Air Lines, the other US operator, is also parking the jumbo jets this year. Cathay Pacific Airways, ANA Holdings, Singapore Airlines and Air France are among carriers that have retired their 747-400 jetliners this decade amid a shift from four-engine aircraft. Twin-engine wide-bodies like Boeing's 777 and the Airbus A350 can haul almost as many people over vast distances as aviation's behemoths, the 747 and Airbus Group SE's A380 super jumbo. United's jumbos burn about 20 percent more fuel per seat than its newest 777s and require special handling from maintenance technicians. Sourcing spare parts is becoming a headache as more airlines retire their jumbo fleets, according to the airline. Continued below.

The carrier has taken delivery of the first of 14 Boeing 777-300ERs it has ordered for long-range flying. The airline also has ordered 35 Airbus A350-1000s, but is weighing converting those twin-aisle jets to the smaller -900 variant or the mid-sized A330, United Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said in a November interview. The airline plans to move pilot and flight attendant crews assigned to the 747 transition to other aircraft, Kirby told employees. "Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities," he said. "And of course, we'll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration."

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook United Airlines is accelerating the retirement of its Boeing 747 jumbo jets, saying its last flight on the  “Queen of the Skies” will now come this year. Previously, United said its 747s would be phased out by the end of 2018. “As deeply connected as we all are to this iconic aircraft, the time has come to retire our 747 fleet from scheduled service,” United Airlines president Scott Kirby said in a Wednesday memo to workers. “It’s a bittersweet milestone — this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel.” “Today, there are more fuel-efficient, cost-effective and reliable widebody aircraft that provide an updated inflight experience for our customers traveling on long-haul flights,” Kirby added. “For these reasons, we’re saying farewell to the Queen of the Skies, which has been part of our fleet since we first flew the aircraft between California and Hawaii in 1970.” United made no mention of it in its memo, but its plans to accelerate the retirement of its 747s comes the same day the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to issue an airworthiness directive calling for potentially expensive fixes to older models of the jets – including the type flown by United. United’s last 747 flight will now come in the fourth quarter of this year, according to the memo. “We’ll be working with all of you who fly or work on the 747s to ensure a smooth transition to other fleets,” Kirby said. “Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities.” He also promised workers that the company will give the 747 an appropriate send-off. “(O)f course, we’ll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration,” Kirby wrote in the memo, adding “we’ll keep you posted with more details on her final flight in the months ahead.” IN PICTURES: Your Take: Boeing 747 photos from readers FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Your Take: Boeing 747 photos from readers  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The new 777-300ERs will seat 366. United also has a number of other new widebody planes coming into its fleet, including Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 Dreamliner models that seat 219 and 252 passengers, respectively. Many of those planes are already flying for the carrier. And, in 2018, United will begin taking delivery of new Airbus A350 widebody jets. United's acceleration of its 747 retirement also makes it seem likely that no U.S. airline will be flying the iconic jet by the year's end. Delta Air Lines is the only other U.S. carrier that currently uses 747s for passenger service. Like United, Delta also has begun to phase out its models of the jet. The carrier is on record as saying it expects to retire its last 747 by the end of this year. Delta will use several models to replace its 747s. They include new Airbus A330s that already are being delivered to the carrier as well as new Airbus A350s that Delta expects to begin receiving next year. Delta’s 747s accommodate 376 passengers.

By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News  January 12, 2017 United Airlines plans to fly its last Boeing 747 jumbo jet late this year, retiring its largest airplanes a year ahead of schedule as the iconic aircraft glides into the sunset. The decision marks the end of an era for US airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. Advertisement It’s also a reminder of the tough task the Boeing Co. faces as it tries to keep its newest 747 model, the -8, aloft amid waning demand for four-engine aircraft. The Chicago-based planemaker has just 28 unfilled orders, after closing 17 sales of the freighter version of the jet last year. Boeing has said it would end production if more orders don’t materialize. “It’s a bittersweet milestone — this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel,” United president Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees Wednesday.

Sign up for more newsletters here The Chicago-based carrier is the largest US operator of the passenger 747-400 variant, with 20 of the aircraft in its fleet. Delta Air Lines Inc. is also parking its jumbo jets this year. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., ANA Holdings Inc., Singapore Airlines Ltd., and Air France are among carriers that have retired their 747-400 jetliners this decade amid a shift from four-engine aircraft to twin-engine planes, which are more fuel-efficient, cheaper to maintain, and capable of hauling nearly as many people over vast distances. United spokesman Luke Punzenberger wouldn’t say which wide-body aircraft would replace the 747-400s, which have served as the airline’s workhorses on trans-Pacific routes for two decades. The carrier has taken delivery of the first of 14 Boeing 777-300ERs it has ordered for long-range flying. The airline also has ordered 35 Airbus A350-1000s, but is weighing converting those twin-aisle jets to the smaller -900 variant or the mid-sized A330, United chief financial officer Andrew Levy said in a November interview. Advertisement The airline plans to move pilot and flight attendant crews assigned to the 747 transition to other aircraft, Kirby told employees. “Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities,” he said. “And of course, we’ll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration.” Loading comments...

Packages will be made available to employees in Southern California. REED SAXON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Boeing told staff on Tuesday of a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state. Packages will be made available to employees in Southern California. REED SAXON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By DOMINIC GATES / THE SEATTLE TIMES Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Boeing announced internally on Tuesday a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. In November, the company said it would shift some 2,400 jobs away from its Huntington Beach facilities over four years. A consolidation plan would mean the transfer of 300 Huntington Beach jobs to its Seal Beach facility and 1,600 positions to its plants in Long Beach and El Segundo. An additional 500 jobs will move to St. Louis. And 400 will move to Huntsville, Ala., from Huntington Beach and other facilities around the country. A company spokesman at the time said the company expected about 500 jobs would be eliminated company-wide by 2020 as a result of the contraction. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need for more cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo on the job cuts to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. “As we enter 2017, our plan calls for us to reduce our Engineering staff,” Hamilton told employees. “I realize some of this news is unpleasant.” Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. “We’ll be notifying employees as different areas and functions within BCA finalize their plans,” Alder said. Hamilton’s memo says details of a buyout offer will be sent Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment April 21. The buyout package will be offered to employees in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. Hamilton said there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year.

Business Home LBoard Racial politics not welcome in Johor, ruler warns Mahathir FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Airbus jets past Boeing on orders, closes gap on deliveries AFP | January 12, 2017 The figures are lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. TOULOUSE: Airbus on Wednesday said it had outstripped its own delivery expectations in 2016, closing the gap with Boeing, and beat its US archrival on orders. The European aerospace company said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, beating its own target which was hiked in November from 650 to 670. The figures were lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. It also booked a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing but showing a significant drop of nearly a third on the previous year when it logged demand for 1,036 aircraft. Last week, Boeing confirmed orders of 668 planes throughout the year, down 13% on 2015 when net orders reached 768. “2016 was a year in which we managed to not only achieve our objectives but to surpass them,” said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. It was the 14th consecutive year in which the firm chalked up record deliveries. Although it remains behind Boeing, which saw deliveries fell modestly to 748 in 2016, the European group is closing the gap. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. Supply chain issues “2016, particularly the first six months, was particularly difficult… we had more (production) difficulties than expected,” Bregier said, referring to supply chain bottlenecks with its A350 long-haul jets. But the company almost reached its delivery target for the aircraft, handing over 49 of the 50 planned deliveries, and two more submitted for flight testing. It also delivered 545 of its single-aisle A320 jetliners, 66 A330s and 28 of its A380 double-decker superjumbos, the production of which is due to be halved next year. In July, Airbus said it would cut the production rate of its A380 to one a month from 2018 to reflect reduced demand. In 2015, the manufacturer handed over 27 planes but next year aims to deliver just 12. The group has seen a slowdown in demand for long-distance carriers due in part to falling fuel prices which have impacted on the renewal of ageing fleets, but also as a result of weakening demand from Gulf carriers which peaked in recent years. Airbus ended the year with a backlog of 6,874 planes with a list price of $1 billion. IranAir gets first delivery Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger jets from budget Indian airline GoAir, in a deal worth $7.8 billion, the aircraft maker said. Also Wednesday, Airbus delivered the first of an order of 100 planes to IranAir in a deal with a list price of around $20 billion which was finalised after international sanctions on Tehran were lifted. “It’s a new, magnificent chapter and a great day” for ties between Iran and the EU, said IranAir’s chief executive Farhad Parvaresh at a ceremony in Toulouse, where Airbus is based. The “distance between us caused by political adversities have been narrowed by hard work of the international peace keepers,” he said. Bregier also hailed the renewal of ties with Iran, saying the “renaissance of Iran aviation sector is one of the most important developments for our industry for many years.” The jets will bolster Iran’s ageing passenger fleet with the addition of 46 A320 planes for medium-haul routes, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 A350s.

Hamilton’s message went on to say that 60-day involuntary layoff notices affecting only engineering employees in Washington will be sent out on Jan. 20, with layoffs effective March 24. Those layoffs will affect employees in the skill classifications that were offered a buyout package last year, he said. This year’s buyout offer is going out mostly to employees in different skill classifications. There will be further involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the offer and it falls short of Boeing’s cost-saving target. Hamilton said that there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. The extent of the follow-on job cuts “will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition,” he said. “We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition,” Hamilton said. “The decision to lower the production rate on the 777 program announced in late-December underscores that environment and what we need to do to help Boeing win.” Boeing spokesman Alder said the workforce reductions in 2017, as last year, will be achieved where possible through attrition and voluntary buyouts before involuntary layoffs. He said the company will also “aggressively reduce overall spending in 2017.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Indian Budget Airline to Buy 200 Boeing Jets VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory January 14, 2017 08:35 Indian budget airline SpiceJet will buy up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion -- one of the biggest deals in India's booming airline industry, the two companies announced Friday. Boeing had reported an order for one hundred 737 MAX jets in 2016 from an unnamed buyer, confirmed Friday to be India's SpiceJet. The budget airline said the deal was for "up to" 205 planes, but 50 of those are from an earlier deal and 50 more are an add-on option to the initial 100. Boeing 737 MAX airplane is shown parked before an employee-only rollout event in Renton, Washington on Dec. 8, 2015. /AP SpiceJet is India's fourth largest airline by number of passengers carried and holds a 12.8 percent share in the Indian airline market. Indigo is the country's market leader, which also holds the record for the biggest deal, having bought 250 planes worth $26.5 billion from Airbus in 2015. India's booming economy and growing middle class have contributed to a 20 percent increase in Indian airline passengers in 2016, making it the world's fastest-growing air travel market.

Business Lockheed CEO Tells Trump F-35 Cost Will Be 'Significantly' Lower F-35: The fighter that took a decade to get off the ground The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will make its first air show flight this weekend at the Miramar Air Show. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will make its first air show flight this weekend at the Miramar Air Show. AARON GREGGWashington Post Emerging from a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Friday, Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters Friday the Bethesda-based defense giant is close to a new contract deal that would cut the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and also create jobs. "We had the opportunity to talk to [president-elect Trump] about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price," Hewson said. "So I'm glad I had the opportunity to tell him that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft and moreover it's going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States." She went on to say that the company would create 1,800 new jobs related to the program in Fort Worth, Texas as part of the new contract deal. Lockheed Martin estimates the program accounts for 38,900 jobs in Texas, and the plane's supply chain touches 45 states. Lockheed shares climbed nearly 1 percent on the news. "I also had the opportunity to give him some ideas on things we think we can do to continue to drive the cost down on the F-35 program so it was a great meeting," Hewson said. In recent months, the president-elect has not been shy about taking to social media to criticize or heap praise on individual companies and military programs. A Dec. 6 tweet bashed Chicago-based Boeing for what he referred to as the "out of control" cost of the Air Force One presidential airplane. Weeks later he turned in Boeing's favor at the expense of Lockheed, tweeting that he had asked the company to "price out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet" because of the F-35's high costs. Trump mentioned the F-35 fighter jet, which is powered by engines made built by East Hartford-based Pratt & Whitney, during a press conference this week. Pratt is a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp. "We're going to do some big things on the F-35 program," he said. "And we're going to get those costs way down, and we're gonna get the plane even better and we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing." Trump said the program was "way behind schedule and many billions of dollars over budget." "I don't like that," he said. Trump added he was "very much involved" with generals and admirals to work on bringing the plane's cost down. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he hopes Trump's meeting with Hewson "further educates" him about the need for the F-35. Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, dismissed Trump's tweets criticizing the cost of the fighter jet as "140-character simplistic comments" that create unnecessary controversy. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., said Trump is "certainly going to have a far different style and approach" to the military budget. "We're witnessing a new kind of negotiating style by the federal government," he said. Voices on both sides of the political aisle have criticized the F-35 program's cost long before Trump took up the issue. Each plane costs more than $100 million, though Lockheed expects the price to fall as the program matures. The 15-year-old program has been beset by various delays and has never flown in combat. Still, Trump's pick for defense secretary, James Mattis, told lawmakers the president-elect remains a supporter of the program. "Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on the F-35 program and it bonds us tightly together with them," he said during a hearing on his nomination this week. "The president-elect has talked about the cost of [the F-35] but he has in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants the best bang for the buck."

By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Updated: January 14, 2017 1:43 am SpiceJet has topped up its existing order for 55 Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft placed in 2014 with an order for an additional 100 jets. Budget airline SpiceJet on Friday said that it would buy up to 205 new aircraft from Boeing for $22 billion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore) in what will be one of the largest aviation deals. The addition to SpiceJet’s fleet would help it grow market share from the current level of about 13 per cent. The carrier plans to expand its fleet nearly fivefold to 155 aircraft by 2024 from 32 narrow-body planes it currently operates. Watch What Else Is Making News SpiceJet has topped up its existing order for 55 Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft placed in 2014 with an order for an additional 100 jets. It has also secured the purchase rights for 50 more jets along with wide-body aircraft. The conversion of purchase rights to acquisition would be contingent upon market conditions, SpiceJet officials said. Chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said the company will neither dilute its equity nor borrow to finance the deal. “Although the ‘sale and leaseback’ option is a standard practice we could also look at financing from Exim banks as interest rates across the world are low,” Singh added. Singh also said the transaction had built in an option to buy wide-body planes as the airline was mulling operating low-cost, long-haul flights. The model is currently being used by a few airlines including subsidiaries of Singapore Airlines and Air Asia. “The induction of the new aircraft, which burn 20 per cent less fuel, would help SpiceJet reduce costs and enhance its ability to compete,” Singh said. He added the new aircraft would increase the range of flights by up to one hour, opening up many more destinations, including international ones. SpiceJet will receive the first aircraft in the third quarter of 2018, and the rest of the jets would be delivered at an average of 20 every year till 2024. “Acquiring 20 aircraft every year is a manageable task as India needs about 80 aircraft every year to cater to the passenger growth. We would also install a flight simulator to train more pilots for deployment,” Singh said. Currently, the budget carrier has 32 B737s and 17 Bombardier Q400s. According to Boeing’s estimates, India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. The deal is also a boost to the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing as SpiceJet remains the only low-cost carrier to operate these aircraft. Other budget airlines like market leader IndiGo and GoAir have a fleet of Airbus planes.

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo 4/4 By Tim Hepher | PARIS PARIS Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N) have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market. On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing's tally of 668 for the year released a week ago. Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight. While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country. It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions. Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing's planes will be delivered from 2018. Neither planemaker gave any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the U.S. planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources, who declined to be named, said the company's year-end numbers had been strictly audited. Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the U.S. export licenses needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on U.S. parts. People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received U.S. export licenses for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies. Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival's presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of U.S. Republican political opposition. During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran. The Iranian orders offer valuable respite from a slowdown in demand for both planemakers, with their combined new orders falling below deliveries for the first time since 2009. Boeing posted a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89 for 2016. This would be at exactly 1 if the Iranian deal were included, with 748 orders and just as many deliveries, company data shows. Airbus would fall below that threshold without the Iran order. Analysts said such margins show how relatively thin orders have become after a decade of mostly rampant growth, coinciding with growing indicators that the aerospace cycle is weakening. Airbus sales chief John Leahy warned this week orders would stay weak in 2017, but said deliveries which drive profits would continue to grow for some time on the back of older sales.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE A SpiceJet passenger aircraft takes off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel international airport in Ahmedabad, India, on May 19, 2016. Amit Dave/Reuters | Caption Patrick Reilly Staff January 13, 2017 —On Friday, Indian airline SpiceJet announced that it would acquire 100 new 737 MAX airliners from Boeing, with an option to acquire 50 more of the same aircraft. "What this aircraft order does is enhance our ability to be competitive in the future as it helps us reduce costs," the airline’s chairman, Ajay Singh, said in a news conference in New Delhi, as Reuters reported. In the airline industry, trying to reduce costs is nothing new. But India’s carriers have pursued this goal amid a surge in demand: The number of Indian airline passengers grew 37-fold between 1970 and 2015, when 99 million Indians flew. In this huge, fast-growing market, SpiceJet’s decision to buy the narrow-body 737 offers a glimpse at the future of commercial aviation. In the 2000s, airlines and airplane manufacturers saw size as key. On Jan. 17, 2005, Airbus unveiled its double-decker “superjumbo” A380 aircraft to much fanfare. “We’ll sell 700 or 750,” Noel Forgeard, then Airbus’s chief executive officer, confidently said at the time, according to the BBC. Developing countries like India, whose growing middle classes could afford to fly for the first time, were expected to drive this demand. Half a dozen airlines were started to serve India's "fast-growing and flush middle class" after the Indian government opened commercial aviation to increased competition, and "Passenger numbers surged as cheap flights proved an irresistible alternative to long, bumpy train journeys," as The Christian Science Monitor reported in 2009.  How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz These airlines hit turbulence during the 2008-2009 global recession. Eight years later, India’s air travel numbers are rising again. But few, if any, Indians are taking their first flights on an ultra-large jet. Ten years after the A380’s launch, only 207 of the aircraft have been sold – well below the “700 or 750” predicted by Mr. Forgeard 12 years ago. The 737 MAX’s maximum seating of 200 can’t compete with the A380’s 555 seating capacity – or can it? Airbus predicted “increasingly crowded hubs and Asian economic expansion would spur demand for legions of superjumbos across the planet.... Boeing saw things differently, suggesting globalization would demand higher frequencies on trunk routes combined with a multiplicity of new services linking smaller cities,” Bloomberg reported in July. Boeing’s prediction has since borne out, and airlines like SpiceJet are doing most of their business on shorter planes. In 2016, more than 18 million Indians flew internationally, compared with almost 90 million on domestic routes. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × Smaller planes make sense for these shorter routes. With more, smaller aircraft like the 737, an airline can re-deploy aircraft as needed to meet changing demands. SpiceJet already fills its planes at a higher rate than any of its competitors. SpiceJet’s new purchase makes it well-equipped to continue this strategy. It also pushes Boeing’s expectations on which planes could prove most profitable. The Seattle-based aircraft giant believed that both trunk routes and flights between small cities would work best with mid-sized, wide-bodied planes like the 777 and the 787, as Bloomberg reported. But its newest customer, whose domestic routes connect some of the largest cities in the world, is thinking even smaller. Print/Reprints Next Up Test your knowledge How safe is flying?

Business & Tech Picture by Paul Sancya AP/Press Association Images 17:13 13 Jan 2017 Newstalk 2 days ago With €85m of private donations so far, Donald Trump's inauguration has proved to be an attractive way for corporations to set out their stall for America's next commander-in-chief. Mr Trump's inauguration committee has received enough money to pay for the event twice over and money is still flowing in. Most donors remain anonymous and the committee has 90 days to name them. Blue chip donors named so far include aircraft maker Boeing, which has donated €941,000. The company's multibillion-dollar Air Force One contract was last month threatened with cancellation by Mr Trump. Oil and gas giant Chevron has donated €470,500 while AT&T has supplied extra mobile capacity for the National Mall. US taxpayers will provide a considerable share of the budget despite a big share of the inauguration costs being covered by the private donations. Public funds will pay for the €4.7m cost of building a bunting-decorated 10,000 square-foot platform for the swearing-in. The US public also pays security costs for the event, which brings together a big chunk of the US political leadership, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans and a fair share of protesters. This will include a €2.3m overtime bill for the US Capitol police force. Federal funds will also pay for more than 5,000 service members from across the regular armed forces, plus a further 7,500 National Guard reservists. The District of Columbia expects to spend €27.5m, which it will claw back from federal government after the event. All of which leaves an unprecedented and unspent pot of private donations for Mr Trump's inauguration team to spend on pop singers, parades, choirs, celebratory balls, bunting - and more than 1,000 portable toilets. The man who organised America's last two inaugurations asks why donors' money is still coming in and wonders where it is going to go. "We planned the two largest inaugurations in the history of our country and we never spent anywhere near that," said Steve Kerrigan, who led Barack Obama's 2009 and 2013 inauguration events. "I can't imagine how they are going to spend that amount of money - and why they would even keep raising money," he said. Mr Kerrigan’s committee collected €52m for Mr Obama’s first inauguration and €40m for his second. However, Mr Obama's first inauguration team left a surplus, meaning Mr Trump's record-breaking haul of private and corporate donations could have paid for both of his predecessor's events. US government transparency advocates the Sunlight Foundation have said that Mr Trump's lack of disclosure of inauguration donors to date has "set a tone" and has implications for White House transparency and accountability. Donations notwithstanding, Mr Trump’s inaugural planner Tom Barrack has suggested that the 20 January ceremony and celebrations will be more conservative, as they avoid a "circus-like atmosphere" in favour of a "back-to-work" mindset with "soft sensuality". The Trump committee is planning fewer set-piece events, balls, parades and performances for the day. Mr Trump is holding three inaugural balls; Mr Obama had 10 balls at his first inauguration. Mr Trump's team hopes to keep its parade to 90 minutes. The longest inauguration parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than four-and-a-half hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration in 1953. The President-elect's inaugural team has failed to attract the kind of A-list performers who turned out in force for Mr Obama. Artists including Elton John, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion and Charlotte Church have all publicly declined an invitation. Mr Trump's announced headliners are teen singer Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes. Leftover donations will go to charity and other White House events. Spokesman Boris Epshteyn said the inaugural committee is "fully focused on organising world-class events that honour our nation's tremendous history and reach every corner of the globe". Mr Trump has not specified the charities which will benefit from money left over after the event. His past pledges to donate to charity have not always gone ahead as announced. Mr Obama used his excess inaugural dollars to help pay for the annual White House Easter egg roll and other public events. 17:13 13 Jan 2017 Newstalk 2 days ago 4 Related articles Kompromat: How digging up dirt is a Russian way of life Trump's Big Pharma shots another cause for Irish concern Trump hits out at "sleazebag political operatives" in latest Twitter attacks Fed officials warn of economic volatility following initial Trump bounce most popular latest sport The most expensive street in Ireland has been named "I was pissed off": Dublin club footballer fuming that GAA player-coach contract was leaked onto social media Senegal beat Tunisia 2-0 in the African Nations Cup Brendan Rodgers aiming to keep Celtic progressing in 2017 site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

January 16, 2017 0305 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:175658 Publish Date: Fri, 13 Jan 2017 18:35:52 GMT Service: Iran Iran welcomes first new Airbus plane The first of 100 Airbus planes that Iran purchased from the European aviation giant landed in the capital Tehran on Thursday. The Iran Air A321 jet touched down at Mehrabad International Airport after a flight from Toulouse, France, where the headquarters of the European consortium is located. Iran, which has not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, has ordered 100 airliners from Airbus and 80 from Boeing and is close to a deal to buy 20 turboprop aircraft from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica. Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi told reporters at an airport ceremony that the plane would be used for domestic flights. Iran is hoping to rapidly upgrade its fleet now that sanctions have been lifted under the 2015 nuclear accord, in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program. Most of Iran's aging fleet of 250 commercial planes were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and as of June, only 162 were operational, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists a fleet of 43 planes, offers direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London. “We struggled for two years to purchase planes from Airbus,” Iran Air Chief Farhad Parvaresh told reporters at the ceremony. “There were many problems that still remained from the past and we had to go through a very difficult path to finalize the deal with Airbus.” The official emphasized that providing funds to support purchases of planes from Airbus contained various complexities. “This was because Iran had not used the mechanisms to provide foreign funds [for its purchases from overseas supplies] over the past two decades.” Both Airbus and Boeing need US export licenses to deliver the jets because of the number of US parts they contain. The two companies have received licenses but some need to be extended due to the lengthy delivery period and Boeing is expected to point to the Airbus delivery to argue its deal should go ahead. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract,” Parvaresh told reporters in France on Wednesday. Iran’s national carrier hopes to receive at least two more aircraft from Airbus by the end of March and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017. Parvaresh said on Thursday that Iran's Bank of Industry and Mine had financed the purchase of the first plane delivered. Airbus and Boeing are putting up financing help for early deliveries as many Western banks remain wary of doing deals with Iran due to restrictions on the use of the US financial system that remain in effect despite the nuclear deal. According to Reuters, Airbus, initially reported to have backed the first seven deliveries, was now looking at providing finance for a larger number of deliveries and that Boeing planned to finance the first half a dozen jets. Most planes are sold in dollars but Airbus is being paid in euros. Boeing's bankers are looking for ways for the company to get paid for future deliveries without breaking core sanctions, subject to Treasury approval, a person close to the deal said.     KeyWords Iran Airbus first plane   Related News : New Airbus planes to join Iran's fleet by next March Iran starts talks with Airbus on plane purchase contract Airbus to deliver first batch of planes to Iran soon Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, intl. community condemn Bahrain’s execution of three activists Iran favors peace, stability promotion in Balkans: Rouhani Iran supports dialogue to resolve Iraq problems Iraq seeking to improve Iran-Saudi Arabia ties Sri Lanka eager to resume Iran oil imports Iran’s Mehrzad, Rahman Ones to Watch for 2017 Iran, Albania keen on cooperation Nuclear deal bolstered Iran’s global image Iran’s Esteghlal signs Uzbek midfielder Djeparov Iran volleyball skipper faces ban Most Visited Obama extends national emergency on Iran US will 'shoot down' North Korean missiles: Pentagon chief Pentagon deploys 300 Marines to Afghanistan's Helmand www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0756 sec

By Paul Ausick January 13, 2017 7:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Boeing Co.’s (NYSE: BA) Friday morning announcement of a significant order from India’s SpiceJet was expected; the size of the order was not. Maybe it’s all about how Boeing counts things. The company did not actually add any new planes to its order book, even though the aircraft maker said that SpiceJet had made a “commitment for up to 205 airplanes.” Here’s the money paragraph from the press release: Booked at the end of 2016, the announcement includes 100 new 737 MAX 8s, SpiceJet’s current order for 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs which were previously attributed to an unidentified customer on Boeing’s Orders & Deliveries website, as well as purchase rights for 50 additional airplanes. In other words, 155 planes had already been booked and the other 50 are a commitment from SpiceJet to hold its place in line, just in case the airline decides to buy more planes at some future date. The value of the order at list prices has been set at nearly $23 billion, which assumes that all 205 planes are 737 MAX 8s. SpiceJet surely will not pay full list price for the planes. A discount of around 40% to the list price of $110 million for a 737 MAX 8 would not be unusual, and the discount could go higher. SpiceJet narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2014, but the low-cost carrier appears to be fully on its feet again. Its current fleet of 32 Boeing 737s places it among the top carriers in India’s fast-growing market. In Friday’s premarket session, Boeing shares traded up about 0.5%, at $159.00 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.07. Shares closed down about 1.1% on Thursday at $158.29. The stock’s consensus 12-month price target is $158.90.

(BA) aircraft as the carrier seeks to expand in the world's fastest growing aviation market. The deal is valued at $22 billion, based on list prices. According to a joint statement by Boeing and SpiceJet on Friday, the aircraft were booked at the end of 2016. It includes 100 new 737 MAX 8 aircraft, SpiceJet's current order for 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs that were previously attributed to an unidentified customer on Boeing's Orders & Deliveries website, as well as purchase rights for 50 additional airplanes. The deal provides a boost to Boeing in India as its rival Airbus has orders for more than 500 aircraft from SpiceJet's peers, IndiGo and GoAir. SpiceJet, an all-Boeing jet operator, placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation or NG 737s and currently operates 32 737 NGs in its fleet. The carrier is India's fourth-largest airline behind IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market, with the number of Indian passengers rising by more than 20 percent annually amid low prices and rising income. Ray Conner, vice chairman of Boeing Co. said, "We are honored to build upon more than a decade of partnership with SpiceJet with their commitment of up to 205 airplanes. The economics of the 737 MAXs will allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond, and offer their customers a superior passenger experience."

Monday, 16 January 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview No Restriction on Sales of Airbus Planes’ Parts in Iran: Official News ID: 1295456 Service: Economy January, 13, 2017 - 17:16 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – The chairman of Iran Air announced that there is no restriction on Iran to supply spare parts of the commercial planes manufactured by France's Airbus except “a sensitive part” used for air navigation. A license has been given to the Airbus, Boeing and ATR to sell airplanes and their spare parts to Iran, Farhad Parvaresh told the Tasnim News Agency. He said except for “a sensitive part” related to air navigation, Iran has no limitation on the supply of the spare parts of the Airbus commercial planes. The comments came after the first commercial airliner purchased from Airbus following the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers landed at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday. The Plane arrived in the Iranian capital after it took off from Germany’s Hamburg with Iranian pilots on Wednesday. The 189-seat plane, already painted in IranAir’s livery, is the first of 100 ordered from the company. Iran Air is reportedly set to receive the next seven or eight planes from Airbus in 2017. During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. Iran and Airbus intensified business negotiations in October 2016 following the US decision to remove a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers to sell planes to Iran under contracts signed after coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the Group 5+1 (Russia, China, the US, Britain, France, and Germany).

SpiceJet enhanced its existing order of 55 aircraft with additional 100 firm B737-8 MAX and 50 purchase rights for B737-8 MAX and wide-body aircraft. With this, the total order of 205 aircraft is valued at $22 billion (Rs 1,50,000 crore) at list price. SpiceJet had placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation B737s and currently operates 32 Next-Generation B737s in its fleet and 17 Bombardier Q400s. "Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today and we are proud of it. SpiceJet has achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on-time performance and lowest cancellation rates. Also, a record load factor of over 90% every month for 20 months in a row," Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet, said. "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began, with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort. With the next generation of B737 and the B737 MAX, we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably," Singh added. "We are honoured to build upon more than a decade of partnership with SpiceJet with their commitment of up to 205 airplanes," said Ray Conner, Vice Chairman, The Boeing Company. "The economics of the 737 MAXs will allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond, and offer their customers a superior passenger experience," he added. The B737 MAX incorporates the latest technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets and other improvements to deliver efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India's fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations. "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort," said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India's booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world's fastest-growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"The contract to purchase 20 new planes from French-Italian Company 'ATR' is to be signed in near future," Akhoundi said. He noted that as per contracts signed between Iran and the world's big plane manufacturers, Iran Air will receive 200 new planes 100 of which will be purchased from Airbus and 80 from Boeing with another contract to be signed soon for 20 planes from ATR Company. The first Airbus 'A321' landed at Tehran Mehrabad Airport on Thursday afternoon and joined Iranian air fleet. The aircraft was officially delivered to Iran Air by Airbus in a ceremony held in Toulouse. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier announced that with the delivery of the aircraft, cooperation between Iran Air and Airbus officially started, and said, "We hope with delivery of the aircraft, expansion of economic cooperation with Iran will continue more rapidly." Iran Air officials say the plane will be used for domestic flights. Iranian Deputy Transportation Minister Asqar Fakhrieh Kashan announced late last month that Airbus and the ATR companies will deliver 8 new passenger planes to Iran Air by the end of this year. "Based on the contract signed with Airbus, the company will deliver one A320 and two long-range A330 planes to Iran Air by the end of this (Iranian) year (ending on March 20)," Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Iran Air will receive 8 new Airbus and ATR planes by the end of this year," he added. Airbus sealed a contract with Iran Air in December to sell 100 of its passenger planes, worth over $18 billion. The announcement came after Iran Air Managing Director Farhad Parvaresh and Airbus President Fabrice Bregier finalized a deal which was initially signed in Paris back in January 2016. The agreement covered 46 Airbus A320 planes, 38 A330 planes and 16 A350 XWB aircraft, with deliveries due to begin in early 2017. Airbus is the world’s Number 2 jet maker after Boeing, a US-based multinational plane manufacturer. Bregier described the deal as “a significant first step in the overall modernization of Iran’s commercial aviation sector,” saying it also includes pilot training, airport operations and air traffic management. Parvaresh, for his part, expressed delight at cooperation with Airbus, stressing it has paved the way “for more practical steps to follow for Iran Air’s fleet renewal.” "Iran Air considers this agreement an important step towards a stronger international presence in civil aviation. We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration,” he added. The deal with Airbus received the go-ahead from the US Treasury Department in November. Early in December, Iran Air finalized a deal for 80 jetliners from US plane maker Boeing Co., with the planes scheduled to start arriving in 2018. The deals were made possible after the US removed a ban on selling Iran passenger aircraft and spare parts following the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Tehran and the six world powers (the US, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany) hammered out the nuclear accord in July 2015. It went into effect in January 2016 and resolved a long-running dispute over Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.         Related News Airbus Officially Delivers 1st A321 to Iran Air  Iran Receives 1st Airbus 321 Passenger Plane  Japan's Mitsubishi Emerging as New Rival for Boeing, Airbus in Iran's Aviation Industry  Suspicious Object in Iran's Boeing 737 Plane Delays Tehran-Mashhad Flight  Minister: Iran Needs over 500 Airplanes in Ten Years  Boeing to Fix “Dollar Issue” for Iran Plane Deals  Iran, Italy Building Small Planes  Boeing Offers 3 Plane Models to Iran  Iran Invites Boeing for Business Talks  Iran Unveils PK2 Escort Plane  Iranian Official: Drone-Building Industry Indigenized  LATEST STORIES (8) Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed Syrian Army Repels ISIL's Massive Attack on Gov't Positions in Deir Ezzur City Week of Protests Kicks off with Rallies in DC, Chicago, California Libyan National Army's Fight against ISIL in Benghazi Syria: Buses Arrive to Evacuate Civilians and Militants from Wadi Bardi Syria: Aleppo's Famous Bazaar Reopens after Two Years of Closure Iranians Pay Tribute to Late Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani Bahrainis Simmering with Anger over Death Verdicts A Timeless American Tradition: Trump, Syria, and Giving in to Flinching Senior MP Renews Iran's Support for Political Solution to Iraq's Problems Iranian Speaker's Advisor Blasts Bahraini Regime for Executing Youth France Warns US about Serious Consequences over Embassy Relocation Senior Taliban Commander among 21 Killed in Security Operations across Afghanistan Eastern Ghouta: Syrian Army Tightens Up Grip on Terrorists in Wadi Al-Bardi, Recaptures Key Height Local Germans Want US Tanks to 'Get Out' Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed TEHRAN (FNA)- Clashes erupted between police and protesters in Sanabis, Sunday, after news broke that Bahrain had executed three anti-regime activists who were convicted over their alleged role in a 2014 bomb attack.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India's fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations. "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort," said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India's booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world's fastest-growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ In an interview with ET Now, Ajay Singh, Spicejet, and Raymond Conner, VC, Boeing give their take on the deal between the two companies. Excerpts: Ajay Singh: I think that there is no question that India will grow and it is, as you know, the fastest growing aviation market in the world today. The orders that we have placed today are up to 200 aircraft, 155 are firm and 50 aircraft are purchase rights. We feel that in the next few years with only 2% of Indian flying today there is no reason why we should not see many many more Indians fly in the coming years as the GDP grows and as it becomes more accessible, or within the reach of people to fly. Flying as you know is an aspirational commodity in India. Many more people would like to fly if they could and Spicejet intends to assure that many many more Indians get the opportunity to fly. When you say 200 there were already 55 existing so just for the benefit of viewers clarifying that there are 55 existing, you have added a 100 more and then intention to add yet another 50 is that what you are saying here. Ajay Singh: That is right and so the consolidation… And would you want to share the price at which this is being done right now. Ajay Singh: No, of course not but the consolidated order is going to be up to 205 aircraft and this gives Spicejet the ability to grow without a problem for the foreseeable future. These aircrafts will be delivered between 2018 and 2024, so in the foreseeable future we have the ability to grow, and remember that the 50 purchase rights includes our ability to upgrade the aircraft and also consider conceivably wide-body aircraft in the future. If I were to pick your brains you bring the global perspective to this deal and of course you have to deliver all of this between 2018 to 2024 Mr Singh is obviously bullish on what the demand is going to be in India like how do you see it from I mean you have the choice of being a global insider on these things? Raymond Conner: India is just one of the fastest growing markets that we see in the world today outside of the China market I think India is the second fastest growing market in the world and therefore we want to have a huge presence here. Spicejet has been a great partners of ours for many years, since 2005, and particular with the performance that they have shown over the last couple of years has just been terrific and we really valie the partnership and we want to be a big partner so that is why we are here today. I think actually it is a big thumbs up from getting the airlines from the brink of collapse to where it is today and everybody has been talking about Spicejet, but I must talk to you, this is a daunting order, $22 billion the 150,000crore is what we are essentially talking about of course I am not getting into the details and discounts and things like that how do you plan to fund this obviously this is going to be a mix (16:33) I mean how do you plan to go about it going forward? Ajay Singh: There are bunch of options to fund the order, there is sale and lease pact. There will be some aircraft eventually which will be on our books and there is just a variety of options. We already since some news of the order leaked we already have lots of offers on how to finance these aircraft and we are very confident that the resources that we have within the company and the relationships that we have outside the company will make it relatively easy for us to finance the planes. The question is at what rate doe we get to get to finance the planes and our intention will be to reduce the cost of financing the planes and it is incredibly important for Spicejet that we bring down the cost of our operations and we continue to work on bringing down that cost so that we can remain competitive and grow profitably into the future. While one congratulates you on this mega order both you gentlemen, but one wonders why did you not opt for the lease or the dry lease option. So obviously, I get your point that there is going to be a big demand uptick, but why buy is sort of leasing? Ajay Singh: Well typically you buy because you get much better pricing when you talk in terms of volumes, not only on the price of the aircraft itself, but also on the maintenance. It also gives you a certain sense of, an ability to plan for the future. When you know exactly what aircraft are going to come in what year, you have the ability to plan the induction of the aircraft as well as the maintenance of those planes. The sale structure that you need to put in place, the pilots that you need to hire and so on. We feel that it is incredibly important for us to be able to do that and as I said the most critical element for us is that we should have the ability to keep lowering our unit cost so that we can compete effectively in the Indian market and increasingly in the international market as well and for that you have to place significant sized order of aircraft. Raymond Conner: It does not keep from leasing airplanes if you need them. Is this a trend you are increasingly going to see in a market like India where demand is exploding and more and more people will perhaps opt for purchase rather than lease? Raymond Conner: Well I think that is what you have seen as of late. But there has always been a combination as well, then leasing companies can come in, and do the sale leaseback and effectively then they have airplane on their books which then they are leasing back to the airline and so they do it both ways and I think there always will be a combination of lease and buy as you move through the market and the leasing companies have been doing very well. This is just so happened to be that we went for a big order, a direct buy order, but that still does not mean that at some point there might be a need to have more airplanes come in a sooner timeframe and then you lease those. It gives you a lot more flexibility. So this is not just about the order, this will also entail you hiring people, this will also entail many more costs. When do you see pay back on investment of the kind that you are making now? Ajay Singh: We are getting pay back pretty much as soon as we induct a plane. As you know that of the last 21 months, we have had an occupancy of in excess of 92% in each and every month. The company has been profitable for the last seven quarters and so we do not see really a problem and the demand exists, it is a question of how much we can lower our cost and increase our yield. So we continue to work on that and we feel that with these orders that gives us a greater, much greater ability to save on cost not only because of the cost of maintenance and the cost of the plane but also remember that these planes are far more fuel efficient than the older version and therefore it makes our operation hopefully even more profitable than it is today. So while you are speaking about cost, I have a question that follows up right after because we are seeing crude steadily rise but are you willing to share at this stage your delivery schedule? How many aircrafts will come when between 2018 to 2024 because there is intention to buy 205 but there is concrete order for 155 there? Raymond Conner: We will start in third quarter of 2018 and then we will spread out through that timeframe. So it will have a good number of airplanes in each year so they will able to plan and be able to operate airplanes very effectively. Of course, the 737-8 is the most efficient airplane in the market today. It is 8% better on cost per seat basis than any other competition. So he will have a direct advantage right away.

(Reuters photo) - + NEW DELHI - Boeing Co won an order for 205 planes from SpiceJet Ltd, marking the biggest expansion plan by the Indian budget carrier that is seeking to claw back market share from leader IndiGo. The deal, which includes 100 firm 737 Max 8 jets, builds on an existing order for 55 aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement on Friday. The airline also has the option to buy 50 more, including widebodies. All combined, the order is worth $22 billion at list prices, the airline said, before discounts that are customary for large orders. The order, the largest ever placed by an Indian airline for Boeing aircraft, signals the resurgence of SpiceJet as it competes against IndiGo, which has some 400-odd aircraft pending delivery from Airbus SE and controls the world's fastest-growing major aviation market with a 42% share. For Boeing, it marks the widening of its footprint in the South Asian country, where its European rival dominates narrow-body fleets. "We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalising the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft," chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview. "It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right." The planes are for delivery between next year and 2024, he told reporters separately in New Delhi. The deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the Chicago-based planemaker in India. The purchase commitment comes at a time when both Airbus and Boeing are facing slowing jet sales and the highest level of airplane-delivery deferrals in at least 15 years after a decade-long jetliner shopping spree globally. SpiceJet's order includes a previously unfulfilled and renegotiated deal for 42 jets and an earlier undisclosed order for 13 planes. The airline currently operates a fleet of 32 Boeing 737 jets and 17 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, according to the company. It controls 13% of a market that has seen local carriers almost double to 11 in the past five years. SpiceJet shares have more than tripled since December 2014, when it ran out of cash and grounded its fleet for a day after oil companies refused fuel credit. The stock rose 3.5% to 66.15 rupees as of 12.38pm in Mumbai, giving the airline a market value of 39.7 billion rupees ($582 million). The airline was profitable in each of the past seven quarters and had cash and near-cash items totalling 1.97 billion rupees as of Sept 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "The bigger concern we believe will be with SpiceJet's financial backing and the willingness of banks to fund this growth," Mark D. Martin, founder of Dubai-based Martin Consulting LLC, said by phone. "The bigger concern for aviation in India is on account of the economic slowdown caused by the recent step to demonetize the most popular denominations in use." Add to that the rise in fuel prices, the net effect on the cost of travel will be at least 20%, he said. SpiceJet does not need to dilute any equity to pay for the order, Mr Singh said. The carrier has sufficient resources within the company, and has already received interest from lessors and lenders to finance the deal, he said. SpiceJet will expand its international operations after the new planes with a longer range come in. India, where an emerging middle-class is flying for the first time and passenger traffic is growing at double the pace of nearest rival China, is a crucial market for Boeing and Airbus. In 2015, IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, ordered 250 planes from Airbus valued at $27 billion. That followed a 2006 deal for 100 A320 planes and 180 A320neos in 2011. The South Asian country needs 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in 20 years, with single-aisle planes making up a bulk of the new deliveries, according to Boeing forecasts. Airbus dominates the budget airline market in India, with IndiGo, Go Airlines India Pvt and the local unit of AirAsia Bhd. all flying its jets.

SpiceJet said it had signed a deal for buying up to 205 planes from Boeing - worth up to $22 billion at list prices - but the announcement includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. "As part of this transaction have they (Boeing) not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the aircraft going forward," Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. A source told Reuters on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. Singh said the purchase rights include an option to buy wide-body aircraft for long haul journeys as the airline considers launching low-cost flights over long distances. The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the U.S. company's only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country's air industry. Indian airlines such as the biggest, InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, as well as GoAir and SpiceJet have ordered hundreds of new planes as they rush to win a slice of the boom in demand for air travel. SpiceJet has about 13 percent of the Indian air passenger market, behind market leader IndiGo, Jet Airways and state-run Air India.

With the earlier order for 55 planes and additional 100 new 737-8 MAX aircraft, the no-frills carrier now has firmed up order for a total of 155 planes, besides purchase rights for 50 B737-8 MAX and wide body aircraft. Announcing the deal here today, SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said the total order of 205 aircraft is valued at Rs 1,50,000 crore (USD 22 billion). "This is one of the largest deals in Indian aviation and the largest for SpiceJet," Singh said. Currently, the budget carrier has 32 next generation B737s and 17 Bombardier Q400s. "We are honoured to build upon more than a decade of partnership with SpiceJet with their commitment of up to 205 airplanes," Boeing Company Vice Chairman Ray Conner said. According to Singh, SpiceJet would explore different options for financing the deal. Singh said the induction of the new aircraft, which burn 20 per cent less fuel, would help SpiceJet reduce costs and enhance its ability to compete. "This is a composite transaction for purchase of up to 205 aircraft valued at USD 22 billion," Singh said, adding that the focus is on growing the airline in a responsible and profitable manner. After being on the verge of going belly up two years ago, the airline has been in the black for the past seven straight quarters. When asked about financing of the deal and its impact on debt to equity ratio, Singh said there would be no "equity dilution" and the balance sheet would be healthy. In the 2016 July-September quarter, the airline had posted its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 59 crore. In the year-ago period, the same stood at Rs 29 crore.   Tweet Go to Top Related Tweets Videos Volkswagen to pay $4.3 billion VW reaches multi-billion dollar U.S. settlement Nasdaq at record high Gildan gets American Apparel VW looking to regain customer trust after emissions scandal VW faces new legal headaches in U.S., UK "Trump tailwind" helps euro zone investor morale Oil down on Iran surge and U.S. production Samsung addresses exploding phones Videos Priyanka Chopra resting after accident on 'Quantico'...
