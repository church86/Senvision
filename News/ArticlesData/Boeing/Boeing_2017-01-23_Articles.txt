Investors who had feared tough action on drug pricing under a Hillary Clinton presidency believed Trump would be the safer bet. Not so. At Trump’s presser, he announced that “the drug industry has been disastrous,” adding that he planned to create new bidding procedures for drugs to “save billions of dollars” for Americans and would do the same with other industries, sending stocks into a swoon. “We are dealing with a completely unpredictable, absent-minded man who may wake up on any given day and just decide to attack a stock he hates—or praise one he loves—and then turn around and change his mind,” says David Tawil, president of Maglan Capital, a New York event-driven hedge fund. “I don’t like that. Those are 50-50 odds. I would never play that. No one would, unless they had some inside track. The one thing we hate is binary potential.” Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Donald Trump speaks during his press conference at New York's Trump Tower on January 11. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters It’s not so much that Wall Street investors necessarily object to Trump’s plans per se. It’s that the president-elect tends to announce them via highly nontraditional channels and without warning—more often than not, to his 19.7 million Twitter followers at all hours. As a result, major Wall Street traders and everyday investors are racing to find ways to stay on top of his constant tweets, from keywords to algorithms to analytics that track social media. While banks and hedge funds have invested millions of dollars in trading systems that can be tweaked to “Trump-proof” their portfolios, solutions for ordinary investors have been few and far between since Trump won the election. That changed this month. One of the easiest tools to use (and it’s free) is a new app called “Trump Trigger” from Trigger Finance Inc., which offers market information and trading alerts. The app will send a message to users whenever Trump tweets about a stock they own, with options to buy, sell or short. “While it’s no surprise that Trump has been actively tweeting since the election, no one anticipated that a single tweet could potentially eradicate billions of dollars in market cap from large companies,” the company wrote in a blog post last week, introducing the app. Fidelity Investments also offers a feature called “Social Market Analytics” that investors can add to their trading dashboards to track trading signals via Twitter, Facebook and other social media. The analytics tool does this by measuring both positive and negative comments on social media versus the norm. Sentiment indicators culled from social media are increasingly pointing to events before they happen. This was true when Trump complained in a recent tweet about the high cost of F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, sending its stock price lower. In fact, Trump’s Twitter followers goaded him into going after Lockheed after he tweeted in December that he wanted to “cancel” plans for a new Air Force One from Boeing, because “costs are out of control.” Ever the crowd-pleaser, when his followers urged him to attack Lockheed too, that’s exactly what he did. Related: Trump business plan casts spotlight on law firm that worked for Russia What’s interesting is that Twitter sentiment indicators for Lockheed shot into negative territory and the company’s trading volume spiked even before Trump’s tweet, because social media had already gone negative on Lockheed hours earlier. Trump’s tweet was just the coup de grace. One big worry: What if Trump’s tweet storms lead to a market that becomes hopelessly reactive to politics instead of economics? A former “bond king,” Bill Gross, who runs the $1.7 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, alluded to just that. He compared Trump’s penchant for singling out certain corporations and bullying them into changing their practices as redolent of the Italian dictator Mussolini. “Some of these pre-term policies, where [Trump’s] cajoling companies to move production back into the United States, that’s fine, but it reminds me to some extent of policies in Italy long ago associated with Mussolini and government control of corporate interests,” Gross said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. “I don’t want it to go too far.” Of course, it could also go too far in the other direction. “At some point, Trump could lose all credibility, both domestically and internationally, where no one takes him seriously anymore,” a London-based trader tells Newsweek on the condition of anonymity because the trader isn’t authorized to talk to the press. “Being the president-elect might give his tweets weight now, but that won’t necessarily last if he wears out his welcome.” On Thursday, Trump abruptly praised L.L. Bean in a tweet after hearing that the granddaughter of the Maine company’s founder, Linda Bean, had donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported his presidential campaign. Most of Trump’s tweets since winning November’s election, however, have been negative. Among the companies he’s tweet-bombed in addition to Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Motors are Amazon, Apple and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies. With this week’s presser, Big Pharma is now on his hit list. Attention from Trump has not been beneficial for most companies, so many investors are actively shirking the stocks he obsesses over. “I am staying as far away as I can from any sectors that Trump seems to be focused on—financials, pharma and the auto industry’s biggest carmakers, I am staying away from it, consciously, yes,” says Tawil. Karen Finerman, co-founder and chief executive of New York investment management firm Metropolitan Capital, says she’s invested in a number of stocks that could be affected by Trump’s running commentary, including tech issues like Facebook and Google’s holding company, Alphabet Inc. (Silicon Valley largely favored a Clinton presidency over Trump) and financial stocks like Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup. Related Stories Trump Meets U.S. Defense Contractors He Criticized Trump Business Plan Law Firm Also Worked for Russia Trump Takes Aim at the F-35, the Costly Fighter Jet But the stock Finerman is most concerned about is GM, she says, even though the company’s most recent earnings beat expectations. “That’s the one where I am most tweet-vulnerable, so I guess I am a little nervous,” she says. Finerman did well with tech issues, which initially got crushed after Trump’s victory but edged up after he met with Silicon Valley kingpins in the Trump Tower in December. “When the tech stocks fell, we kept buying as they kept getting cheaper,” she says, “so we did well on that." In other words, when companies take a hit due to Trump that are otherwise healthy, it could be a good buying opportunity. Even so, Wall Street will continue to be extremely wary of what traders are calling “the Trump Effect.” “The only way you can truly insulate yourself from any potential fallout,” Finerman says, “is to not own any stocks.

﻿ Ex-Garuda chief, Thai Airways named in Rolls-Royce bribery case - TTG Asia - Leader in Hotel, Airlines, Tourism and Travel Trade News   Saturday .

"It's about the act of an individual,” he stressed, while stating that the carrier will fully cooperate in the investigations.   He added that as a public company, Garuda has its own mechanisms in running businesses, starting from the implementation of good corporate governance to transparency in providing information.   KPK confirmed that this was a personal case and not a corporate one.   And in Thailand, some US$36 million in bribes and incentives had reportedly been paid to intermediaries, including state agents and employees of THAI, to help Rolls-Royce win lucrative engine deals.   THAI released a statement saying it has set up a special task force for investigation of past engine procurement and another for corruption prevention.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a swearing in ceremony of White House senior staff in the East Room of the White House on Sunday. Even after officially becoming President, Trump's Twitter presence remains much the same as it was during his campaign.  (GETTY IMAGES)   By Alex LearyTampa Bay Times Washington Bureau Chief Sun., Jan. 22, 2017 It began at 8:19 p.m. Tuesday, an onslaught in all caps -- “FAKE NEWS — A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” -- that burned into the next morning. 7:13 a.m.: Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is “A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.” Very unfair! 7:31 a.m.: Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA — NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING! 7:44 a.m.: I win an election easily, a great “movement” is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! 7:48 a.m.: Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to “leak” into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany? Article Continued Below Days before being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump is as unpredictable and provocative as ever, and Twitter is his bully pulpit, 140-character bursts of shock and awe. Since winning the election, @realDonaldTrump has fired off more than 300 tweets, at all hours, that have enthralled supporters, alarmed CEOs and lawmakers, drawn rebukes from foreign governments and left just about everyone wondering what’s next. He has suggested tectonic shifts in foreign policy, cast aspersions on the intelligence community, jolted the stock market, repeatedly revelled in his victory and trashed the media. When Saturday Night Live and actor Alec Baldwin lampooned the behaviour, which includes retweeting praise from random people, Trump hit back while the show was still going: “unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can’t get any worse. Sad.” What Trump hasn’t done is heed the advice of his wife and, a new poll shows, most Americans: STOP. “The conventional wisdom has never been accurate when it comes to Donald Trump,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. “We’ll just have to see how it turns out.” Trump, 70, is a grandfather who once said, “I don’t do the email thing.” Yet no one in politics has harnessed the power of social media like Trump, with a Twitter following approaching 20 million. Outspent by rivals, he used Twitter to dominate the conversation. “Like it or not,” said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, “you can’t deny it works for him.” “You could teach an entire course about the Internet through Trump,” said Nikki Usher, a George Washington University professor who has added to her social media syllabus a lesson on the “Tweeter-in-chief.” Trump, she said, is putting a modern spin on a long-running quest by politicians to communicate directly with voters, bypassing the media. Franklin D. Roosevelt had fireside chats. John F. Kennedy harnessed television. Barack Obama employed Facebook and video, and was the first president to assume an official Twitter handle. “We need to remember that a majority of the American public is not active on Twitter,” Usher said. “But Trump’s most fervent supporters and most fervent detractors and the media are all just sitting there waiting for him to say something. It’s been incredible at developing a captive audience that will carry his message.” Any expectation Trump would cool it after winning the election has been squelched, though his first tweet Nov. 9, at 6:36 a.m., carried a unifying tone. “Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before.” A day later he tweeted about a “fantastic” meeting with his predecessor and seemed tolerant of protests that popped up in cities across the country. Finally, observers said, he had achieved presidential decorum. But as demonstrations grew, along with questions of Russian meddling in the election and concerns about Trump’s readiness, the bellicose side re-emerged. “The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!” a Nov. 19 tweet demanded after the vice president-elect was lectured at a Broadway performance. On Nov. 29, the president-elect said flag burners should face jail time or loss of citizenship, stepping on constitutionally protected free speech. His early-morning post, retweeted 74,000 times, came after he apparently saw a Fox News segment about a demonstration at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” wrote @realDonaldTrump on Dec. 6. Immediately after that 8:52 a.m. tweet, Boeing stock tumbled. Similarly, Trump sent Lockheed Martin stocks downward with a tweet about the cost of F-35 fighter jets. He has taken on carmakers, warning that if they take manufacturing jobs out of the country they will face a “border tax.” Auto executives have struggled to push back against the rapid-fire claims. “We need clarity. None of us have had a tweeting president before,” Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters. Still, Trump has prompted action. Days before Christmas, he summoned Boeing and Lockheed Martin executives to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach to discuss bringing down costs. He also took credit for an announcement by Carrier Corp. not to move a plant to Mexico. The morning after House Republicans voted to gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, Trump tweeted his disapproval, helping reverse the move. Other pronouncements, however, have sent shock waves, none more than Trump’s Dec. 22 tweet, sent from his Samsung Galaxy while at Mar-a-Lago: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” Aside from upending decades of policy, the casual use of Twitter made it even more striking. “You wonder what our allies and others think when they see tweets that address very important issues,” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in an interview. The Chinese, the object of numerous Trump broadsides, called on him to quit Twitter. “An obsession with ‘Twitter diplomacy’ is undesirable,” read a commentary this month in Chinese state-run media. “Using tweets is modern day communication, I fully understand that,” said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. “But the way he does it has major consequences. I don’t believe Donald Trump is going to change dramatically. Hopefully, he’ll accept advice more readily before he speaks.” Trump’s advisers seem powerless to intervene. “I do not get a memo,” Sean Spicer, his incoming press sectary, said at a forum last week. “He drives the train on this.” Trump inherited the official @Potus handle, which Obama used sparingly to communicate with nearly 13.4 million followers, but it’s not clear @realDonaldTrump will go away. He has reportedly expressed reservations about giving up his personal phone, as Obama did out of security concerns. A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed 64 per cent of voters think he should not keep a personal account. “I don’t have an issue with him using Twitter. It’s a modern way of communicating,” said Bryan Donathan, 33, an independent voter from Lutz who supported Trump despite lingering reservations. “But there needs to be someone there watching him, telling him, ‘Hey, you shouldn’t say this or you shouldn’t say that.’ It’s sad you have to say that about a president but, unfortunately, that’s the world we live in now.” Read more about: Donald Trump, Saturday Night Live, Barack Obama, Twitter Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

They will likely be piling up rapidly. President Trump did use Day 1 to advise the CIA that the United States should have stolen all of Iraq's oil. But here is a place to start. We already have a president who is violating two clauses in the U.S. Constitution, one forbidding any gifts or benefits from foreign governments, the other forbidding the same from the U.S. government or any U.S. state. This is the result of Donald Trump refusing to separate himself from major business interests as past presidents have done. Those interests will also inevitably involve Trump in violating the STOCK Act which forbids the use of non-public government information to make a private profit. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states: "The President ... shall not receive ... any other emolument from the United States, or any of them." This means that the President cannot receive personal financial gains from the United States government or from the governments of any of the 50 states while he is president. This restriction is absolute and cannot be waived by Congress. Trump is already in violation of it and will be more so with every law, rule, regulation, enforcement, or lack thereof that his subordinates, Congress, or any agency of the federal government enacts to the benefit of Trump's businesses and possessions. For example, Trump's lease of the Old Post Office Building violates an explicit clause in the General Services Administration lease contract which states: "No ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom." The GSA's failure to enforce that contract is an unconstitutional benefit to Trump. Or, to take a state-level example: since 1980 Trump and his businesses have garnered "$885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York." Continuing or increasing those subsidies puts Trump in violation of the Constitution. Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution says that "no person holding any office of profit or trust under [the United States government], shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state." This is essentially the same ban as above, but applied to foreign governments. - Advertisement - The Trump Organization has licensing deals with two Trump Towers in Istanbul. Trump himself says, "I have a little conflict of interest, because I have a major, major building in Istanbul." China's state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the largest tenant in Trump Tower. It is also a major lender to Trump. Its rent payments and its loans put Trump in violation of the Constitution. Foreign diplomats have begun shifting their D.C. hotel and event reservations to Trump International Hotel. The Embassy of Kuwait was reportedly pressured by the Trump Organization to do so. Pressured or not, Kuwait's business at a Trump hotel puts Trump in violation of the highest law of the land. In November, there were reports (denied by Trump) that Trump had asked the president of Argentina for help with a building permit in Buenos Aires. Whether he did or not, and whether he receives that help or not, President Trump will be frequently granted or denied similar approval for his business ventures from numerous foreign and domestic governments. Why punish a successful business man? We can set aside the legality and morality of Trump's business success, and the question of how successful he has been. A campaign to impeach him for his violations of the Constitution can hold the position that Trump is perfectly welcome to keep all of his businesses and loans. He just cannot simultaneously hold an office in which they create gross violations of the U.S. Constitution. Past presidents have sold off their assets or placed them in a blind trust. A blind trust would not, however, be blind for Trump who would inevitably learn of the approval of new towers or the sale of properties. Selling (and using a truly blind trust to do so) was Trump's only option other than not being president. He chose not to take his only Constitutional choice. Is this partisanship? - Advertisement - A great many people do anything political for partisan reasons. As I'm unable to put an end to that, it is inevitable that people will favor or oppose impeaching Trump for partisan reasons. But they need not. The above charges against Trump are unprecedented. They should apply to him and any future presidents who engage in the same abuses, regardless of party. Someone who voted for Trump as a way out of corruption should want him impeached as much as someone who voted against him for the same reason. Trump is now the worst possible "insider" -- using public office for personal greed. Is this morally worse than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton taking Saudi government and Boeing funds into her family foundation, and then working to waive legal restrictions on Boeing selling weapons to Saudi Arabia -- weapons now being used to slaughter innocents? Some will think so and others not, largely along partisan lines. Personally I'm in favor of impeaching Clinton, Obama, and George W. Bush right now and imposing the penalties of a bar on holding future office and a denial of retirement benefits. But those efforts are simply not the same priority today as halting the presidency of the current president. When I advocated for impeaching Bush I explained that if he was not held accountable his successors would expand further the abusive powers he had expanded. When I argued that Obama was in fact doing this and should be impeached, I was generally called worse things than partisan. But the longer presidents are allowed to act without a check on their powers, the more they will expand and abuse them. Numerous government officials and members of Congress would best serve the world by resigning. But the place to start is with an unprecedented and unique form and level of corruption in the single highest office in the land. Is this personal?

The question of who is worse, the president or the vice president, is a very different question from this one: Who is worse, President Trump in an era of total unchecked power and immunity, or President Pence in an age of popular sovereignty with the threat of impeachment looming behind every high-crime-and-misdemeanor that comes up for consideration by the White House? I believe changing the office of the presidency into one that can be lost for substantive crimes and abuses -- a radical change from its current state -- would be more significant than the personality, ideology, or party of the presidents who come next. I believe part of that significance would derive from the benefits of building the movement that imposes impeachment on a corrupt and partisan and reluctant Congress. Cultural change comes principally from movement building, and very little from the personalities of elected officials. Submitted on Monday, Jan 23, 2017 at 3:31:02 PM     (0+)   J.

Submitted on Monday, Jan 23, 2017 at 5:13:08 PM     (0+)   j dial Editor (Member since Nov 9, 2009), 24 fans, 27 articles, 33 quicklinks, 233 comments    While it is true that, should VP Pence ascend to the presidency, the impeachment of his predecessor would have a definite damping effect on any 'high crimes and misdemeanors' he might otherwise hatch. That said, I think that Pence's greatest threats might involve perfectly legal and by some greatly desired actions such as filleting the remains of Planned Parenthood; abolishing legal abortion and demonizing contraception; continuing assaults on unions, minimum-wage workers, immigrants, minorities, and environment; further shredding social-safety nets; further enabling the parasitic and highly unstable financial shenanigans that at some point, if continued, will come crashing down again, and worse ... Does anyone know what Pence thinks about TPP and other inevitably looming 'free-trade' agreements? Mike Pence's biography page is hosted by ALEC. There is no doubt that Donald Trump is at least as corrupt as the congress over which he presides--he even appears to conflate the meaning of 'conflict of interest' with 'ability to multi-task'--but the prospect of empowering a Christian Ayatollah fairly shivers me timbers.

India obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter quartz index about us register log in log out Events Atlas quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu UNDERWATER ROBOTICS IIT students may give the Indian Navy its next big thing: an intelligent unmanned submarine Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Machines with Brains January 23, 2017 Quartz india Matsya 4.0 (AUV-IITB) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Machines with Brains January 23, 2017 Quartz india In a country where schools and universities have long championed rote learning, a team of engineering students is doing pioneering work on “a submarine with a brain of its own.” Since December 2011, students at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay have been working on Matsya, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can control its own movements and execute specific tasks without human intervention. The project, if successful, can change the future of defence in India by making underwater vehicles intelligent enough to understand their surroundings and react accordingly. For now, the unmanned vehicles used by the country’s naval forces are not exactly intelligent machines—they’re piloted remotely. This means they cannot venture into unknown waters and respond to unusual activity or even an enemy submarine by themselves. Matsya’s technology could train machines to act independently. Military forces in the US and China already use unmanned submarines and the global AUV market is on track to more than double from $211.8 million in 2016 to $497.9 million in 2022, thanks mainly to defense demands. India’s foray into the field is fairly new, though. “While space exploration has been unmanned for obvious reasons, development of underwater unmanned vehicles started [in India] only recently,” the IIT project’s 21-year-old team leader, Varun Mittal, told Quartz. Matsya, named after Hindu god Vishnu’s fish avatar, can ensure constant monitoring and immediate intelligent action during military operations, eliminating the room for human error. Using it, ecologists, too, can explore depths hitherto off limits for humans or monitor ocean life more consistently and accurately. Even though Delhi Technological University, IIT-Madras, and other government entities worked on AUVs before 2011, the Matsya team is “aiming to make something no one in our country has achieved ever before.” Their autonomous submarine is intelligent enough to re-attempt a task if the previous try is unsuccessful. Testing new waters 18 members from this year’s Matsya team. (Facebook/AUV-IITB) The AUV-IITB team comprises upto 30 undergraduate students from the mechanical, software, and electronics verticals, who spend late nights—9.30pm to 12.30am—every day after regular classes. On weekends, they work longer. “It’s a challenge to motivate people when doing something related to tech because it can take months or years of hardwork to get results,” Mittal said. Matsya’s initial prototype operated on a simple “single-hull system” that could navigate from one point to another and identify objects underwater. Seven years in the making, its applications have extended to “dropping markers, shooting torpedoes, grabbing objects, listening to underwater sound sources, [and] identifying different colours and shapes all on its own,” Mittal said. Each year, the team recruits freshmen and seniors graduate. Despite the churn, their performance is unaffected: They have won the best Indian team title at RoboSub, an international AUV competition, for four consecutive years since 2012. During RoboSub 2016, when 50 teams from 11 countries faced off in San Diego, Matsya bagged the second place overall despite being penalised for exceeding the 38-kg limit. The top spot went to Caltech University by a slim margin, according to the breakdown of the scores. Last December, the team came out on top at the National Institute of Ocean Technology’s (NIOT) Student Autonomous Vehicle (SAVe) competition held in Chennai. Next up, it is creating a more hydrodynamic fifth-generation prototype for the 20th edition of RoboSub this July. The competition is organized by the US Navy and the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), the world’s largest nonprofit organization with an exclusive focus on advancing unmanned systems and the robotics community. Matsya 4.0 (actual) vs 5.0 (design) (IIT-B AUV) Swimming big Currently, the 3.5-feet Matsya ventures upto 150 feet under water with batteries that last four hours. In comparison, Boeing’s AUV is over 30 feet long and dives as deep as 20,000 metres (6,096 feet). Leena Vachhani, an associate professor in IIT-B’s systems and control engineering department who has been involved with project since it’s inception, describes Matsya as “a mini AUV” designed for shallow-water tasks like “cleaning of water tanks and lakes.” Once the IITians master its functionality, they hope to scale up their “micro-submarine” technology for real world applications. “Each team leader comes up with his vision on his own,” Vachhani told Quartz. The team is in talks with the Indira Foundation to map River Ganga’s dolphin population using Matsya’s hydrophones, an underwater microphone that detects sound waves. The Indira Foundation is an association of IIT-B alumni, providing scholarships and funding student research. IIT-B’s design could prove revolutionary for Indian military operations: autonomously shooting torpedos; placing and monitoring sensors on the seabed; tracking down and destroying enemy submarines by itself. AUVs could also carry out rescue missions, recover remnants from plane crash sites and locate black boxes, Mittal says, like the AUVs looking for the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. Matsya can also conduct routine sub-sea inspections like checking for leaking underwater oil pipelines, while ecologists can use it to monitor flora and fauna and environmental conditions. Funds crunch The IIT students are strapped for funds, though. To build and showcase Matsya at competitions, AUV-IIT needs Rs2.5 million ($36,708) this year, of which more than half the amount goes towards purchasing sensors and cameras. So far, the team has gathered more than Rs1.5 million ($22,025) from the institute and other government sources and it’s still using up a one-time grant of over Rs2.5 million it received from the Naval Research Board (NRB) at the Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 2013. But the team desperately needs more. Unfortunately, private sponsors are reluctant to place their bets on a first-time experiment. “Especially in our country, technology is just starting to boom here,” says Mittal. “So people think a lot before investing.” The only way companies provide sponsorships is in the form of discounted parts for Matsya. “If asked where do we stand now on a scale of one to 10, where one denotes only a prototype and 10 a product of industry level, I would say we are currently somewhere near six or seven,” said Mittal. Although there is no official launch date for Matsya’s defense or ecological deployment, he says an optimised, functioning version of their vehicle could be ready within four years.

The ACT Airlines cargo flight from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Bishkek crashed on Jan. 16 as it came in to land amid bad weather conditions at 7.31 a.m. local time (0131GMT). Saginbek Rahmanov, a 29-year-old Kyrgyz national succumbed to his injuries at the hospital on Sunday, the ministry said, bringing up to 35 the number of Kyrgyz citizens who lost their lives in the crash. The remaining four victims are Turkish citizens including Capt. Ibrahim Gurcan Diranci, co-pilot Kazim Ondul, loading expert Melih Aslan, and flight technician Ihsan Koca. Another 16 people remain hospitalized with injuries sustained in the crash, the statement added. Two black boxes from the cargo plane were sent to Moscow Thursday for investigation, according to the Kyrgyz Prime Ministry. The Prime Ministry Press Office also said in a statement Thursday that experts from the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee would investigate the flight recorders to find the reason for the crash. ACT Airlines operates under the name myCARGO. Based in Istanbul, it flies eight Boeing B747 transport aircraft, according to the company. The firm is 49 percent-owned by China’s HNA Group with the remainder belonging to Turkish interests. In a statement last Monday, the company said it was "deeply saddened" by the incident. It said the crash was not due to technical reasons or overloading and added the real reason would be revealed to the public after an investigation was completed.

Finance Search S&P; 500 CEOs optimistic on TrumpAAP – Mon, Jan 23, 2017 12:41 PM AEDT US President Donald Trump's administration has only just taken over, but already a small parade of S&P 500 companies' chiefs have voiced optimism that his promised tax cuts, stimulus spending and deregulation will boost corporate profits. In the days ahead of Friday's inauguration, senior executives from Morgan Stanley, Delta Air Lines and other major US corporations said the Trump White House had already sparked a brighter outlook for business. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said on Tuesday after his bank reported fourth quarter profit had doubled. He pointed to factors including a surge in consumer confidence after the November 8 election and lower taxes promised by Trump. Just under way, fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is providing a glimpse of what major large companies expect under Trump, and their take is largely positive so far. More than a dozen S&P 500 companies reporting results in the past week have signalled optimism about potential tax cuts, infrastructure spending, employee benefit costs and reduced regulation. With corporate earnings already on the mend after a slump in oil prices and a strong US dollar in 2016, S&P 500 companies are expected on average to grow their earnings by 6.3 per cent in the December quarter and 13.6 per cent in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Since the November election, the S&P 500 has rallied six per cent to record highs, in part due to expectations Trump will pass policies that stimulate the economy. Banks have led gains, with investors betting Trump will roll back regulations passed by President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis, which many investors say went too far. After United Continental Holdings on Tuesday posted lower December-quarter profits, airline president Scott Kirby told analysts on a call: "It feels like we are on a really good path. It felt to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand". Also, upbeat Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian told analysts this month that he was excited about potential infrastructure spending promised by Trump, as well as a chance to make his case about unfair competition from Middle Eastern airlines heavily subsidized by governments. Vince Delie, CEO of F.N.B., which own First National Bank, said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday that he saw more confidence among commercial customers and a potential pickup in lending. "There are at least conversations occurring about larger capex opportunities within our customer base, which didn't happen before," Delie said. Not everyone is over the moon, however. Kansas City Southern's CEO on Friday bemoaned an uncertain environment after the cross-border railroad reported lower quarterly profits, hurt by a slump in Mexico's peso since Trump's election. "Obviously, the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds, and the irony of us reporting earnings on the Inauguration Day of the 45th President is not entirely lost on us," Patrick Ottensmeyer told analysts. Indeed, some business leaders and lobbyists in Washington who were initially enthusiastic about Trump's victory have begun to exhibit some hesitance over his agenda amid confusing messages on healthcare, taxes and trade. Still, while Trump's views on immigration and a range of other issues are at odds with many Americans, most small businesses and consumers do see a brighter future as he launches his presidency. An index of small business confidence in December hit a 12-year high, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The US consumer confidence index in December hit its highest level since August 2001, a month before the September 11 attacks. Following strong stock gains in November and December, many on Wall Street are concerned that Trump may fail to deliver on all of his promises. A Republican-controlled Congress might baulk at infrastructure spending or tax reductions that significantly widen the federal budget deficit. Other investors worry that Trump could follow through on campaign-trail threats to tear up global trade deals and crack down on illegal immigrants from Mexico who provide low-wage labour in agriculture, restaurants and other industries. "Folks are potentially underestimating the degree to which Trump is serious about real reform on trade and immigration," warned Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. "Investors, in general, are hopeful Trump will take a more pragmatic approach on those issues." Over the past two months, Trump has publicly targeted and threatened a range of multinationals, including Ford Motor, General Motors, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin. That may have left CEOs wary of publicly disagreeing with his policies. "You don't want to step on a mine. So the best course of action is to be somewhat optimistic; positive but also somewhat noncommittal so you're not trapped one way or another," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. Trump's frequent use of Twitter to single out companies for criticism or praise has created volatile spikes in trading of their shares, which is good for online brokers including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade. "Each time, it's a new market event and a potential trading opportunity for our clients. Like everyone else, we're watching it with interest," TD Ameritrade Director of Finance Jeff Goeser said on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported an increase in quarterly profits.
