Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) today in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at $1.025 trillion. China becomes the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing’s forecast. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years.” Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Tinseth said the backlog from Chinese customers demonstrates that the new 737 MAX 8 and the current Next-Generation 737-800 are at the heart of the single-aisle market. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year’s forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China’s single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China’s widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Tinseth. Driven by China’s growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters.

The complete forecast is available at www.boeing.com/cmo. Today, Boeing jets are the mainstay of China’s air travel and cargo system. More than 50 percent of all the commercial jetliners operating in China are Boeing airplanes. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the world’s most technologically advanced airplane, the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies.

Starting Oct. 14, Boeing will halt overtime for salaried employees not entitled to overtime pay by law "except in the case of pre-approved production- or mission-critical work," according to an internal memo confirmed by a company spokesman. When such work is needed, "Boeing organizations that pay exempt overtime - and most don't - will pay it only when it is discussed with and approved in advance by the employee's direct manager," the memo said. Pay for Boeing's union employees will follow existing labor contracts and overtime for those workers is already managed. "This new policy is another step in the company's efforts to improve our affordability and competitiveness so that we can better position ourselves to grow sales to customers," spokesman Chaz Bickers said in an email. Boeing is under intense pressure to win sales over rival Airbus, as airlines have slowed buying new jetliners. Weak sales, particularly of twin-aisle jetliners, may make Boeing miss its target of selling about 740 plane sales this year, Boeing's chief executive said on Wednesday. The overtime memo told managers of U.S.-based exempt salaried employees that they should arrange staffing to reduce the use of overtime through such measures as sharing work across similar teams, training employees or using flexible schedules. "By curbing exempt overtime pay, Boeing is challenging leaders and employees to come up with work solutions that curb the need to work overtime," said the memo, which was first reported by the Seattle Times. Boeing's white-collar engineering union said the new policy likely would not affect many of its 19,000 members, since they are governed by labor contracts. Professional engineers receive regular pay plus $6.50 an hour when they work past 40 hours. A group of about 20 pilots do not have that provision. A spokesman for the machinists union said it was not immediately clear what impact the change would have on its 31,000 members.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Sept. 14, 2016 at 3:46 PM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter ST. LOUIS, Sept. 14 (UPI) -- Boeing and its partner Saab have displayed a new production trainer aircraft to be offered to the U.S. Air Force. The aircraft put on display Tuesday is the T-X, designed specifically for the U.S. Air Force training mission. Boeing said the aircraft takes advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," said Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and chief executive officer. The Boeing T-X aircraft is a twin-tailed, single-engine jet with an advanced cockpit with embedded training. "It's an honor to build the future of Air Force training," said Saab President and CEO Hakan Buskhe. "We have created the best solution thanks to great cooperation and a clear strategy since day one." The U.S. Air Force plans to replace its fleet of aging T-38 aircraft. The Boeing-Saab partnership is one of several competitors for the contract.

The plane manufacturer lifted its forecast for China, and said the nation is likely to become the first country with an aviation market exceeding $1 trillion in the next two decades. Chinese airlines are estimated to purchase 6,810 airplanes valued at $1.025 trillion in the next 20 years. Among the new deliveries, Boeing predicts that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total, and China's widebody fleet is to triple in size over the next two decades. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Meanwhile, low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services between smaller cities to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. In the last five years, the number of direct international flights to and from China saw a surge of 150 percent. Direct flights between second-tier Chinese cities and overseas cities have been the main driving force of the growth. Tinseth said the continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new relaxed visa policies and a wide range of wide body airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives Boeing sufficient reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market. Li Xiaojin, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said China is expected to have a surge on international travel volume. By 2020, China is likely to witness 200 million international trips annually. "The trend of airlines to add more international flights between first-tier Chinese cities and second-tier foreign cities, and vice-versa, is likely to continue to grow rapidly, since the direct flights between first-tier cities are nearly saturated, and demand is keeps growing." On the other hand, driven by China's growing e-commerce business－already the largest in the world－air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. In the past five years, the express delivery services saw an average annual growth rate in their total volume of 55 percent, and sales revenues grew by an annual average of 39 percent, according to the State Post Bureau.

Dennis Muilenburg said Boeing also might miss its target of selling about 740 jetliners this year, having booked just 355 net orders so far. Airlines have cooled on buying new planes, especially large twin-aisle models, and some analysts had already factored a sales miss into their forecasts. While Boeing is still aiming for its target, "there's nothing that's driving us with a sense of urgency that we have to hit" it, Muilenburg said at an investor conference hosted by Morgan Stanley. Boeing's near-record backlog of about 5,700 plane orders will keep the factories humming, and Boeing will not cut prices just to generate sales, he said. Still, Muilenburg said Boeing may cut production of 777 jets further than its current projections if sales of the twin aisle model continue to lag. The 777, one of Boeing's most successful and profitable planes, is undergoing a makeover that will add new engines and wings and other refinements. Boeing makes 777s at a rate of 8.3 a month, and had already announced plans to cut output to seven a month next year as it shifts to the new 777X model, which enters production in 2018. But Boeing has sold just eight 777s this year, far short of the 40 to 50 needed to sustain production at those levels. "So, obviously, pressure there," Muilenburg said. "We need to be successful on some (777 sales) campaigns over the next two to three months to hold that seven-a-month rate," he said. "If we don't, we'll have to adjust." Cutting 777 production would "add pressure" to Boeing's goal of hitting its profit-margin target and would reduce revenue, Muilenburg said. But Boeing's ramp up in production of single-aisle 737s, also very profitable, would offset the decline. Defense sales also are expected to be "flattish" next year, he said. But there are signs that U.S. defense spending could rise, and "strong pockets of growth" in Middle East and Asia Pacific regions could help. Cost cutting and streamlining across all of Boeing and its supply chain, and rising deliveries, should keep profits and cash flow rising, he said.

From the point of view of the assailants the attacks were near miracles of logistical calculation, timing, courage in execution and devastation inflicted upon the targets. The Pearl Harbor base containing America’s naval might was thought to be invulnerable, yet in half an hour 2000 were dead, and the cream of the fleet destroyed. This week, within an hour on the morning of September 11, security at three different airports was successfully breached, the crews of four large passenger jets efficiently overpowered, the cockpits commandeered, navigation coordinates reset. In three of the four missions the assailants attained successes probably far beyond the expectations of the planners. As a feat of suicidal aviation the Pentagon kamikaze assault was particularly audacious, with eyewitness accounts describing the Boeing 767 skimming the Potomac before driving right through the low lying Pentagon perimeter, in a sector housing Planning and Logistics. The two Trade Center Buildings were struck at what structural engineers say were the points of maximum vulnerability. The strength of the buildings derived entirely from the steel perimeter frame, designed — so its lead architect said only last week — to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707. These buildings were struck full force last Tuesday morning by Boeing 737s, with fuel tanks fully loaded for the long flights to the West Coast. Within an hour of the impacts both buildings collapsed. By evening, a third 46-story Trade Center building had also crumbled. Not in terms of destructive extent, but in terms of symbolic obliteration the attack is virtually without historic parallel, a trauma at least as great as the San Francisco earthquake or the Chicago fire. There may be another similarity to Pearl Harbor. The possibility of a Japanese attack in early December of 1941 was known to US Naval Intelligence and to President Roosevelt. Last Tuesday, derision at the failure of US intelligence was widespread. The Washington Post quoted an unnamed top official at the National Security Council as saying, “We don’t know anything here. We’re watching CNN too.” Are we to believe that the $30 billion annual intelligence budget, immense electronic eavesdropping capacity, thousands of agents around the world, produced nothing in the way of a warning? In fact Osama bin Laden, now prime suspect, said in an interview three weeks ago with Abdel-Bari Atwan, the editor of the London-based al-Quds al-Araby newspaper, that he planned “very, very big attacks against American interests.” Here is bin-Laden, probably the most notorious Islamic foe of America on the planet, originally trained by the CIA, planner of other successful attacks on US installations such as the embassies in East Africa, carrying a $5 million FBI bounty on his head proclaiming the imminence of another assault, and US intelligence was impotent, even though the attacks must have taken months, if not years to plan, and even though CNN has reported that bin-Laden and his coordinating group al-Qaeda had been using an airstrip in Afghanistan to train pilots to fly 767s. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, when hijacking was a preoccupation, the possibility of air assaults on buildings such as the Trade Center were a major concern of US security and intelligence agencies. But since the 1980s and particularly during the Clinton-Gore years the focus shifted to more modish fears, such as bio-chemical assault and nuclear weapons launched by so-called rogue states. This latter threat had the allure of justifying the $60 billion investment in Missile Defense aka Star Wars. One of the biggest proponents of that approach was Al Gore’s security advisor, Leon Fuerth, who wailed plaintively amid Tuesday’s rubble that “In effect the country’s at war but we don’t have the coordinates of the enemy.” But the lust for retaliation traditionally outstrips precision in identifying the actual assailant. By early evening on Tuesday America’s national security establishment was calling for a removal of all impediments on the assassination of foreign leaders. Led by President Bush, they were endorsing the prospect of attacks not just on the perpetrators but on those who might have harbored them. From the nuclear priesthood is coming the demand that mini-nukes be deployed on a preemptive basis against the enemies of America. The targets abroad will be all the usual suspects: rogue states, (most of which, like the Taliban or Saddam Hussein, started off as creatures of US intelligence). The target at home will of course be the Bill of Rights. Less than a week ago the FBI raided Infocom, the Texas-based web host for Muslim groups such as the Council on Islamic Relations, the Islamic Society of North America, the Islamic Association for Palestine, and the Holy Land Foundation. Palestinians have been denied visas, and those in this country can, under the terms of the CounterTerrorism Act of the Clinton years, be held and expelled without due process. The explosions of Tuesday were not an hour old before terror pundits like Anthony Cordesman, Wesley Clark, Robert Gates and Lawrence Eagleburger were saying that these attacks had been possible “because America is a democracy,” adding that now some democratic perquisites might have to be abandoned? What might this mean? Increased domestic snooping by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies; ethnic profiling; another drive for a national ID card system. Tuesday did not offer a flattering exhibition of America’s leaders. For most of the day the only Bush who looked composed and control in Washington was Laura, who happened to waiting to testify on Capitol Hill. Her husband gave a timid and stilted initial reaction in Sarasota, Florida, then disappeared for an hour before resurfacing at a base in Barksdale, Louisiana, where he gave another flaccid address with every appearance of bring on tranquilizers. He was then flown to a bunker in Nebraska, before someone finally had the wit to suggest that the best place for an American president at time of national emergency is the Oval Office. Other members of the cabinet were equally elusive. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has managed to avoid almost every site of crisis or debate, was once again absent from the scene, in Latin America. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld remained invisible most of the day, even though it would have taken him only a few short steps to get to the Pentagon press room and make some encouraging remarks. When he did finally appear the substance of his remarks and his demeanor were even more banal and unprepossessing than those of his commander in chief. At no point did Vice President Cheney appear in public. The presidential contenders did expose themselves. John McCain curdled the air with threats against America’s foes, as did John Kerry, who immediately blamed bin-Laden and who stuck the knife firmly into CIA director George Tenet, citing Tenet as having told him not long ago that the CIA had neutralized an impending attack by bin-Laden. Absent national political leadership, the burden of rallying the nation fell as usual upon the tv anchors, all of whom seem to have resolved early on to lower the emotional temper, though Tom Brokaw did lisp a declaration of War against Terror. Tuesday’s eyewitness reports of the collapse of the two Trade Center buildings were not inspired, at least for those who have heard the famous eyewitness radio reportage of the crash of the Hindenberg zeppelin in Lakehurst, New Jersey in 1937 with the anguished cry of the reporter, “Oh the humanity, the humanity.” Radio and tv reporters these days seem incapable of narrating an ongoing event with any sense of vivid language or dramatic emotive power. The commentators were similarly incapable of explaining with any depth the likely context of the attacks; that these attacks might be the consequence of the recent Israeli rampages in the Occupied Territories that have included assassinations of Palestinian leaders and the slaughter of Palestinian civilians with the use of American aircraft; that these attacks might also stem from the sanctions against Iraq that have seen upward of a million children die; that these attacks might in part be a response to US cruise missile attacks on the Sudanese factories that had been loosely fingered by US intelligence as connected to bin-Laden. In fact September 11 was the anniversary of George W. Bush’s speech to Congress in 1990, heralding war against Iraq. It was also the anniversary of the Camp David accords, which signaled the US buy-out of Egypt as any countervailing force for Palestinian rights in the Middle East. One certain beneficiary of the attacks is Israel. Polls had been showing popular dislike here for Israel’s recent tactics, which may have been the motivation for Colin Powell’s few bleats of reproof to Israel. We will be hearing no such bleats in the weeks to come, as Israel’s leaders advise America on how exactly to deal with Muslims. The attackers probably bet on that too, as a way of making the US’s support for Israeli intransigence even more explicit, finishing off Arafat in the process. “Freedom,” said George Bush in Sarasota in the first sentence of his first reaction, “was attacked this morning by a faceless coward.” That properly represents the stupidity and blindness of almost all Tuesday’s mainstream political commentary. By contrast, the commentary on economic consequences was informative and sophisticated. Worst hit: the insurance industry. Likely outfall in the short-term: hiked energy prices, a further drop in global stock markets. George Bush will have no trouble in raiding the famous lock-box, using Social Security Trust Funds to give more money to the Defense Department. That about sums it up. Three planes are successfully steered into three of America’s most conspicuous buildings and America’s response will be to put more money in missile defense as a way of bolstering the economy.

El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (TASE: ELAL) continues to move forward with its Boeing Dreamliner airplane purchase mega-deal worth $1.025 billion. On Monday, the company reported signing a sale and lease back agreement with an undisclosed foreign company for two of the 787-8 planes purchased from Boeing. RELATED ARTICLES El Al profit doubled in Q2 El Al blames pilots for delays and disruptions El Al begins marketing cruises El Al to buy and lease 15 Boeing Dreamliners Once Boeing delivers the airplanes, they will be sold to the foreign company and leased back to El Al, which announced that this agreement is not expected to a have any material financial effect and that the deal could be terminated under certain conditions. El Al has also signed a 787-9 lease deal with the same company and is expected to lease four Boeing Dreamliner airplanes for 12 years, with the option of stopping the lease on some of them after 10 years. Two of the airplanes are to be delivered to El Al in 2018 and two more in December 2019 and August 2020. This deal with Boeing, which El Al CEO David Maimon CEO has called, "The largest procurement plan in El Al history," comprises the purchase of 16 787-7 and 787-9 Dreamliner planes, motors and spare parts. The payment for each plane will be provided upon handover to the company, excluding an advance payment provided earlier on, under the terms of the deal. In March, El Al published a request for proposals for financing entities, for the funding of advance payment for three planes it owns and is expected to receive in 2018, but has not yet provided any updates on this issue. In June, the airline offered several companies to buy its Boeing 747-400 fleet, as part of preparations for the receipt of the Dreamliners, and has been examining the proposals received. In the past few months, El Al, controlled by Knafaim Holdings Ltd. (TASE: KNFM), held by spouses Tami and Dedi Borovich and Poju Zabludowicz, has been enjoying the slump in global oil prices. Last month, it reported its results for the first half of 2016, with a net profit of almost $14 million, after making a profit of slightly more than $1 million in the corresponding half in 2015. Its semi-annual revenue remained stable, at $934 million. Following these strong results, El Al share prices have soared 125% in the last year, reflecting a market cap of NIS 1.7 billion. In the past three years, El Al shares had the second highest return on the stock exchange (second only to electric appliance importer Tadiran Appliances Ltd.), shooting up 740%.

The single-engine, two-seater aircraft is the focus of a major competition worth billions of dollars to replace the US Air Force's aging fleet of T-38 trainers with a modern design for future pilots of fifth-generation fighters. Boeing and Saab revealed two production T-X aircraft, which will be used to demonstrate the aircraft's capabilities to the Air Force and the US Defense Department. The T-X is a "blank-sheet" aircraft designed specifically to meet Air Force training requirements for pilots of fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. Boeing says the design is inexpensive, flexible, and easily upgradeable as new technology comes online. Like most trainers, the T-X has a sleek, greyhound-like design with a single-engine and twin tails derived from Boeing's F/A-18 for greater maneuverability and a high angle of attack. It also has stadium seating and an advanced cockpit with embedded training as well as the ability to blend with state-of-the-art ground-based training. In addition, it is maintenance-friendly in anticipation of decades of service. The two production T-X aircraft have already been built will be followed by three more to demonstrate competitiveness in terms of quick delivery against competitors that are offering off-the-shelf aircraft. If successful, the T-X will replace the Air Force's fleet of 400 T-38 aircraft that have been in service for over half a century and the first T-X would enter service in 2024. Since the program anticipates a minimum order of 350 aircraft, this is a major contract worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Such a win would not only look good on Boeing's books, but it would also allow the company to reassert itself in the warplane market after losing out on the F-35 fighter and the Long Range Strike Bomber competitions to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, respectively. In addition, training aircraft often find secondary overseas markets as light fighter aircraft, so another revenue stream is possible. But this is far from a done deal. The Boeing/Saab T-X faces stiff competition from the partnership of Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries, as well as Northrop Grumman, Alenia Aermacchi, and Textron AirLand. The videos below show the T-X being prepared for rollout and an animation of a pair strutting their stuff.

Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) today in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at US$1.025 trillion. China becomes the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes in a statement today. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Tinseth said the backlog from Chinese customers demonstrates that the new 737 MAX 8 and the current Next-Generation 737-800 are at the heart of the single-aisle market. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business - already the largest in the world - air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects investments of US$5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years. The complete forecast is available at www.boeing.com/cmo. Today, Boeing jets are the mainstay of China's air travel and cargo system. More than 50 percent of all the commercial jetliners operating in China are Boeing airplanes. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model - the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the world's most technologically advanced airplane, the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies. --BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Najib Condemns Missile Attack On Makkah Zahid Discusses Strengthening Bilateral Ties With Japan Rally Theatrics Of The Opposition - Najib Other News Headlines Selangor Umno Cannot Stop Members From Participating At Tomorrow's Rally - Noh- politic Labuan IBFC To Offer Cost-effective & Lucrative Solutions To Local Businesses- business Perak Goalkeeper Eyes Debut In AFF Suzuki Cup- sports Malaysia's Halal Products Welcomed In China- features Former Sri Lankan Diplomat Arrested For Corruption- world Most Read News Democracy Means Follow The Constitution - Salleh Minimum 3A, 3B In UPSR For Fully Residential Schools' Admission Former Bernama Executive Editor Hurt In Robbery By Two Armed Men Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

The Boeing T-X is an all-new aircraft designed specifically for the U.S. Air Force training mission, and takes advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. It is an advanced aircraft designed to evolve as technologies, missions and training needs change. The design is more affordable and flexible than older, existing aircraft. “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come,” said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret. The Boeing T-X aircraft has one engine, twin tails, stadium seating and an advanced cockpit with embedded training. The system also offers state-of-the-art ground-based training and a maintenance-friendly design for long-term supportability. “It’s an honor to build the future of Air Force training,” said Saab President and CEO Håkan Buskhe. “We have created the best solution thanks to great cooperation and a clear strategy since day one.” T-X will replace the Air Force’s aging T-38 aircraft. Initial operating capability is planned for 2024.

Boeing and its partner Saab are competing against several other military contractors to win the bid to build a replacement for the aging T-38 used by the U.S. Air Force to train pilots. (Jeff Roberson/Associated Press) By Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg Published: September 13, 2016, 4:54 PM A   A Boeing’s future in the fighter-jet business may ride on the Air Force’s $11 billion contest for a new trainer aircraft, with the planemaker’s factory hub in St. Louis on the line. The world’s largest aerospace company faces a dogfight with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon for the contract to produce about 350 jets through the T-X advanced trainer program. The winning entry would replace the aging T-38 fleet on which U.S. military pilots have honed their flying skills since 1961. Boeing is the last of the major defense contractors to reveal its concept, developed with Sweden’s Saab, for the competition that kicks off late this year. And there’s more than a little symbolism to the site the company chose for Tuesday’s event to unveil the design: the manufacturing center where it churns out F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-15 fighter jets. “This is their last chance to provide a next-generation dedicated military aircraft for the company and St. Louis,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace and defense analyst with Teal Group. “The Super Hornet can go on for another five years easily, and ditto for the F-15. But the bridge to a sixth-generation fighter would depend on some kind of combat version of this.” Military aircraft contests are few and far between in an era of budget constraints, and the Chicago-based planemaker needs new orders to preserve the Missouri industrial base and engineering acumen gained with the 1997 acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Boeing’s military arm has been eclipsed by the rapid growth of the commercial jet unit this decade, with the defense division accounting for 31 percent of sales last year compared with 50 percent in 2010. The manufacturer has suffered high-profile losses: last year’s stealth bomber competition to Northrop Grumman, and the joint strike fighter contest to Lockheed’s F-35 in 2001. Boeing’s largest recent contract win, valued at $51 billion, is for an aerial refueler derived from its 767 jetliner, which is manufactured outside Seattle. The winning T-X design may go on to claim hundreds of overseas orders and spare parts stretching over decades. The Pentagon program is expected to spur other countries to upgrade their trainer fleets. Teal Group forecasts a global market for 2,737 turbine trainers valued at $32.3 billion over the next decade, a large increase from the $19.9 billion of the aircraft delivered from 2006 through 2015, according to a June research report. The Air Force isn’t expected to release final contest criteria until December, picking a winner next year who would begin production in fiscal 2018. While the need for a modernized training fleet is certain, funding may be squeezed by programs like the F-35 fighter, KC-46A tanker and a new stealth bomber, the Congressional Research Service said in a December 2015 report. What’s also uncertain is how the Air Force will weigh an aircraft’s performance against its production costs. Boeing and Northrop may be at a disadvantage since they are bidding clean-sheet designs against in-service models: the T-50A offered by Lockheed and Korea Aerospace Industries, and Raytheon’s T-100, based on Leonardo’s M-346 trainer. Aboulafia thinks the Lockheed aircraft has an edge “as the only off-the-shelf, supersonic design.” By teaming with Sweden jet-fighter manufacturer Saab, Boeing gained a way to tamp down costs and jump-start sales in international markets, said George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview. “There’s a reason why a number of these teams teamed up with foreign participants,” he said.

Boeing leaders hope it will be chosen as the jet to train the next generation of Air Force pilots. An $11 billion contract is on the line. The Boeing T-X was revealed this morning at the Boeing facility in Bridgeton during a high energy announcement with many Boeing employees and executives. Boeing is one of four companies competing to develop the plane that the Air Force will buy in the future to train the next generation of air force pilots. The overall Air Force project is called the T-X training program. The new training plane chosen by the Air Force will replace the aging T-38 aircraft. Darryl Davis, the President of Boeing Phantom Works, says Boeing`s T-X which has been in the works for nearly three years breaks the norm. He says it incorporates all of the modern technology and techniques. In fact, Davis calls the jet the training plane of the future. 'I think the most important thing that we did here was we started with a clean sheet of paper to meet the Air Force`s advanced pilot threshold requirements. That was the breakthrough-it allowed us to bring all the innovation we`ve been working on for decades in the Boeing company together into this design,' said Davis. Boeing is partnering with Saab in this project. Saab`s President and CEO Hakan Buskhe, told us, 'It`s a good design. And it`s a design that outside looks great of course but also the inside of the aircraft with all the systems and the capabilities.' Winning the contract will mean a lot of jobs for the company that gets it. The Air Force is expected to award the contract next year. The new plane should be in operation in 2024. Boeing officials say they are not sure where the planes will be built if they get the contract. They say they are looking to do it in the most affordable place because they are trying to keep costs down. We understand the winning company will build some 350 planes.

 Saab and Boeing just released their joint attempt for the Air Force's next supersonic trainer David Choi Sep. 13, 2016, 5:26 PM 11,600 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing T-X Boeing After suffering a series of blows — from losing its bid to manufacture the US military’s much anticipated F-35 Lightning II and B-21 bomber, to the industry’s stagnating demand for commercial jetliners — Boeing has shown signs of revitalization as it unveiled its latest aircraft to compete for the US Air Force’s $11 billion T-X trainer program. Partnered with the Swedish manufacturer Saab, Boeing sources claim that the twin-tailed aircraft powered by a General Electric engine was built with the latest fifth-generation fighters in mind: reports show that the trainer aircraft mimics the design and airframe of the latest aircraft that pilots would eventually be flying. Having already built 2 units that were unveiled today, Boeing emphasized that the planes weren’t prototypes, and that they plan on performing flight tests by the end of the year. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret in a press release. Details of the aircraft, such as manufacturing techniques, remain a secret due to the competition behind the award. However, what Boeing does seem to emphasize is the affordability of the aircraft. “I don’t want to give away all of the competitive secrets here,” said president of Boeing Phantom Works Darryl Davis in DefenseNews. “But we’re going to shatter that cost curve.” Also undisclosed was the specific agreement between Saab and Boeing to manufacture the aircraft. However, according to DefenseNews, Davis did state that some of the technology originated from Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Saab’s next-generation fighter, the Gripen. “There’s a lot of reuse throughout this whole jet, to include some of the design and manufacturing,” Davis stated in DefenseNews. “They brought a tremendous amount of expertise, technical detail, a lot of reuse of some systems out of the Gripen.” The T-38 Talon Sgt. Jeffrey Allen/US Air Force So far, four competitors have submitted their candidates to replace the US Air Force’s aging fleet of around 500 Northrop T-38 Talons that have been used to train its pilots. Boeing has been the first company to publicly display their newly-designed entry into the competition, while details on Northrop Grumman’s trainer aircraft remain scant — so far, only a few teaser images and pictures on Twitter have appeared. The other two competitors, Lockheed Martin and Kai, and the trio of Raytheon, Leonardo and CAE, have teamed up to build the T-50A and T-100, respectively.

Work on the first two airplanes was already well underway as the articles of incorporation for Pacific Aero Products Company established three Seattle residents as the principals, William E. Boeing, James Foley, and Edgar Gott. The company's diverse crew included men with woodworking skills, women with expertise in sewing fabric, and an American-educated Chinese aeronautical engineer named Wong Tsu. A century later, Boeing is synonymous with commercial aviation, military products, and feats in space. About the Author: John Fredrickson retired as a senior manager of the Boeing Company in 2011 after 36 years of service. He has 21 years of combined reserve and active-duty military service with the US Air Force. He first encountered Boeing products at Minot Air Force Base in 1971. His work experience on B-52 and KC-135 aircraft continued at U-Tapao Airfield in Thailand during the Vietnam War. That background qualified him for a job at Boeing Flight Test in Seattle starting in 1975, where he worked on the AWACS and YC-14 programs before undertaking a more traditional career in backroom accounting. Fredrickson is the author of Kansas City B-25 Factory and Warbird Factory.

 Norwegian Air will offer $69 tickets to Europe — but one thing needs to happen first Benjamin Zhang Sep. 13, 2016, 4:28 PM 34,985 facebook linkedin twitter email print Norwegian Air Boeing 737-MAX8. Boeing For several years, Norwegian Air has teased the flying public with promises of $69 tickets to cross the Atlantic. Now it looks like the cheap tickets for which we have pined for so long may finally be within reach. According to Norwegian Air chief commercial officer Thomas Ramdahl, his airline is awaiting the aircraft needed for the $69 flights.  That's because the first of the 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 airliners Norwegian Air ordered to operate those flights won't be ready for delivery until 2017. The Boeing 737 Max 8 is expected to enter service with launch partner Southwest Airlines during the third quarter of 2017. However, Boeing told Bloomberg's Julie Johnson and Mary Schlangenstein that the planes could be ready for delivery as early as March.  Ramdahl told Business Insider that his airline plans to make an announcement around November or December of this year with firm details of the $69 fares.  "I can promise you that you will see trans-Atlantic flights on the 737Max next year," Ramdahl told us in an interview last week. "And that's when you will see the $69 fares." The 737 MAX 8 features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. As as result, the new jet offers airlines the range and performance to operate trans-Atlantic service with the lower cost of a narrow-body jet.   Norwegian Air Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Norwegian Following the introduction of the 737 MAX 8, Norwegian will introduce the first of the 30 Airbus A321neo LR airliners it has on order in 2018. The A321neo LR will be larger than the MAX 8 and will also offer greater range than the Boeing.  Norwegian currently operates its trans-Atlantic flights using a fleet of new Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Even though the European low-cost carrier currently do offer bargain basement prices, the costs associated with operating the wide-body jets make the sub-$100 price point unfeasible.  This month, Norwegian announced that, starting next summer, it will commence flights between several major cities in the US and Barcelona, Spain for as low as $189 per ticket one way. These flights will be operated on the airline's current fleet of Boeing Dreamliners.  In July, Norwegian took home the award for best long-haul low-cost airline in the world from the highly respected consumer aviation website Skytrax. In addition, Norwegian won best low-cost airline in Europe for the fourth year in a row.  SEE ALSO: How Emirates found success with the most controversial jet in the world NOW WATCH: What it's like to fly on Qatar Airways — the best airline in the world Loading video...

(PRWEB) September 13, 2016 On September 21, 2016, Weldaloy will have the honor of hosting The Michigan Aerospace Manufacturers Association (MAMA) briefing on the scope of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system project. The meeting will be held in Weldaloy’s new office space that contains a state-of-the art training facility in Warren, MI, which is located just outside of Detroit. Speakers at the event will include Mr. Riki Ellison, Chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, Mr. John Simmons, Managing Partner of The Roosevelt Group, Mr. Daniel J. Shanahan, Senior Manager, GMD with Boeing Strategic Missile and Defense Systems, and Ms. Champagne Bell, Manager, Small/Diverse Business & Strategic Alliances, Boeing Military Aircraft, Global Services & Support, Phantom Works and Commodities & Services. Topics for the meeting will include the potential economic impact on the region in which missile fields will be located, Boeing’s supply chain requirements, how local companies can participate, and what expectations there are for suppliers, as well as what it takes to become a supplier. “We’re excited to host this event, and to share our new meeting facilities with the Michigan business community. The aerospace industry is a large part of our customer base, and we appreciate MAMA giving us this opportunity to hear directly from Boeing,” said Kurt Ruppenthal, Vice President & General Manager at Weldaloy.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com Boeing on Tuesday rolled out the sleek prototype of its new T-X trainer, the plane that just might save thousands of jobs in St. Louis County as fighter production winds down in the next decade. Boeing unveiled a twin-tail, single-engine craft designed to mimic a fighter jet with high maneuverability and endurance for high G forces. The Air Force wants 350 new jets to train the next generation of fighter pilots, but Boeing is facing off against three competitors. One of them, Northrop Grumman, has been ground-testing its own prototype. Boeing has one prototype in ground testing, and another is being assembled at Boeing’s sprawling north St. Louis County plant. Design and engineering work for the trainer is being done in St. Louis, but Boeing says it hasn’t decided where it would assemble the plane if it gets the contract. The company is in an “evaluation process” to determine where the trainer would be built, said Darryl Davis, who heads Boeing’s Phantom Works development operation. +2  Buy Now Darryl Davis, president of Phantom Works at Boeing Defense, introduces the new T-X training aircraft at Boeing on Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2016. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com Robert Cohen Boeing has teamed with Saab, the Swedish maker of the Gripen fighter, to develop the new trainer. St. Louis is the “likeliest place” to build the plane, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at the Teal Group of aircraft industry consultants. Building it in Sweden would cause political problems in the U.S. Several thousand workers build Boeing’s F-15, F/A-18 and E/A-18 fighter and attack aircraft in St. Louis County. Boeing is seeking orders for those planes, but production is likely to end sometime in the next decade. The T-X is the only other fighter-like aircraft on Boeing’s drawing boards. “The T-X is a must-win for Boeing,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area think tank on security issues. “They really need this aircraft to keep their military engineers engaged.” In addition to the 350 planes desired by the Air Force, the trainer would have potential foreign sales. The trainer it replaces, the aged T-38, debuted in 1961 and production totaled 1,146 aircraft before it went out of production in 1972. Analysts say the Air Force order alone could be worth $11 billion. Boeing and Saab designed the plane from a “clean sheet of paper,” Davis said. Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems teamed up to do the same, but two other competitors are offering versions of existing trainers. Lockheed Martin and KAI are offering a trainer based on one used by the South Korean air force. Raytheon, Leonardo, Honeywell Aerospace and CAE-USA are offering a trainer based on a Leonardo plane used in Italy. An existing design might allow for a cheaper plane with a reliable record. But starting from scratch would allow Boeing and Northrop Grumman to design an exact match for the Air Force’s requirements, Thompson noted. Lockheed builds the F-35, the Air Force’s newest fighter and the plane many of its new pilots will fly. The Boeing trainer unveiled Tuesday resembled a giant gray and white mosquito, with some similarity to Boeing’s larger F/A-18. It features a General Electric engine and “stadium seating,” with the instructor seated behind and higher than the student pilot. The Air Force wants a plane that can sustain forces of 6.5 times gravity for sustained periods during maneuvering. The double-tail design increases stability and braking ability. The cockpit will resemble the F-22 and F-35, the Air Force’s newest fighters. “I think they have a very good chance of winning,” said Thompson. “No one else is offering a dual tail. If you look at it from the front, you can see how similar it looks to the F-35 and the F-22.” Much of the design work took place at Saab, Aboulafia said. He detects “distant hints” of Saab’s old 105 trainer in the T-X wing design. What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Who's hired?

Boeing tried hard to keep the costs down, and that led to some innovations. Some composite parts are made whole in 3D printers. Workers can prepare a cockpit canopy in eight days, a task that used to take six weeks, according to Boeing officials. Boeing brought some of that cost-saving know-how from its commercial jet operation. Thompson, who toured the T-X facility, said he was impressed by how few people were assembling the plane. Boeing lost competitions to build the Air Force’s new bomber and the F-35. The T-X may be its last chance to keep a toehold in the fixed-wing, manned combat aircraft business as the F/A-18 and F-15 business fades. That might play to Boeing’s advantage when the Air Force makes its T-X decision, said Jeff Windau, analyst at Edward Jones investments in Des Peres. “It’s important to them to keep multiple suppliers engaged in developing the next generation of technologies,” Windau said. The U.S. will eventually need a newer fighter, and giving Boeing the trainer might keep Boeing as a competitor until then, Aboulafia said. “That does not mean that Boeing is still in the design game,” he added. “They outsourced so much of the design to Saab.” Boeing holds government contracts for military tanker and surveillance planes, helicopters, drones, missiles and smart bomb assemblies. It employs nearly 15,000 people in the St. Louis area. The Air Force is expected to choose the winner of the trainer contract next year or in early 2018.

AVIATION Boeing lifts China forecast Boeing Co lifted its forecast for aircraft demand in China in the next two decades, saying a rising middle class would spur leisure and business travel. The plane maker projects demand in China for 6,810 aircraft valued at US$1.025 trillion, making the nation the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast, Boeing said in a statement distributed in Beijing yesterday. The aircraft maker last year predicted China would need 6,330 new planes worth US$950 billion in the next two decades. Boeing forecast that China would need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, or 75 percent of total new deliveries. The wide-body fleet would triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes, it said. Boeing also forecast that 39,620 new airplanes valued at US$5.9 trillion would be delivered worldwide in the next 20 years. PAYMENTS Visa launches Kenya app Visa Inc, the world’s largest payments network, has introduced a smartphone application to enable cashless transactions in Kenya, where the majority of wireless payments are being done through the nation’s biggest telecommunications company, Safaricom Ltd. The mVisa app would initially facilitate transactions for people with accounts in four banks, including KCB Group Ltd and Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd, Visa emerging markets senior vice president Uttam Nayak said. The company hopes to convert an estimated 84 million of Africa’s smartphone users who still pay by cash. Users of mVisa can make payments by scanning a unique merchant quick response code using their smartphones. About 1,500 merchants have up signed up, it said. Visa is in talks to roll out apps in Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda within two months, and in Nigeria by the end of the year, it said. ELECTRONICS Samsung shares rebound Shares in South Korean giant Samsung Electronics rallied yesterday, recovering almost half the losses from a two-day collapse linked to its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, as traders welcomed news it had sold its printer unit for US$1.05 billion to US firm HP. The shares plunged more than 10 percent on Friday last week and Monday after it urged global consumers to stop using its flagship phone owing to a spate of exploding batteries. However, soon after the end of trade in Seoul on Monday, Samsung and HP announced the sale of the printer business. Samsung shares closed up 4.23 percent at 1.527 million won yesterday.

As suppliers grapple with production burdens, one manufacturer has left the ground and achieved cruising altitude September 2016 - “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness…” British author Charles Dickens opened his 1859 novel “A Tale of Two Cities” with these famous words—penned to describe the economic and political unrest that plagued London and Paris in the late 1700s and which led to the American and French revolutions. For the aerospace and defense market, it certainly seems like the best of times. The Farnborough International Airshow, held in July, broke records with $124 billion in orders and options for aircraft, engines and components. Airbus netted the largest deal, selling 100 of its A321 neos worth $12.44 billion to AirAsia.  Yet, escalating orders and burgeoning backlogs could prove to be the worst of times for suppliers, warns Dustin Tillman, president and CEO of Irvine, California-based Elite Aviation Products. At the same time, Tillman has deployed a business approach meant to propel his company ahead of the capacity curve while equipping it to support an industry that is staggering under the intense pressure of customer demands. WORKING THE VALUE STREAM Elite is able to slide freely up and down the supply chain to provide multiple solutions for end users. “The aerospace and defense market is the most bullish we’ve ever seen it,” says Tillman. “There is more booked and undelivered work now than at any other time. There are more new programs being awarded than ever before. It truly is the second Golden Age of aviation.” He deems the view from the supply chain, however, as grim. “Many U.S. suppliers haven’t been able to step up and respond to what is the largest run-up in the history of commercial flight. Customers are tired of inaction, underscored by a lack of investment, and are actively looking for companies capable of partnering with them for the long haul. Elite is stepping up to fill that role,” he says, “and the results are evidenced by the market share we continue to take from incumbents.” Push/pull Explosive growth in single-aisle aircraft has attracted Chinese and Russian aerospace suppliers to a market that is also being cultivated by Brazil’s Embraer and Canada’s Bombardier. But the battle for big jet orders remains between Boeing and Airbus—they hold 70 percent of the market for wide-body and narrow-body commercial aircraft.     According to Forecast International Inc., which performs analysis for aerospace, defense, power systems and military electronics, May 2016 backlogged orders for Airbus hit 6,759 units compared to Boeing’s 5,762, backlogs that represent 10 and seven years of production. Recent earnings statements confirm the A320 and 737 narrow body families are Airbus and Boeing’s mainstays and make up the majority of deliveries.  According to Airbus, “Middle classes in emerging markets will double to 3.5 billion people by 2035, [by which time] 62 percent of the world population will be city dwellers and the number of aviation-served megacities will rise from 55 to 93. In 20 years, the number of daily, long-haul passengers traveling to, from or via aviation megacities is expected to more than double to 2.5 million.”  Inside a Tsugami B326 Swiss-style Turn Mill, high-pressure nozzles are hard at work. Boeing executives report global passenger traffic, at 6 percent growth year to date, is outpacing gross domestic product. Experts agree, though, that with supplier bottlenecks dogging the airframe builders, Airbus and Boeing are pushing the envelope by booking new orders at a breakneck pace that doesn’t match the actual rate of production. Delays spurred Qatar Airways to cancel its order for its first A320neo jetliner from Airbus, the Wall Street Journal reported in June. Boeing took steps to minimize risk, such as pooling its suppliers’ raw material purchases and sharing manufacturing techniques. Kent Fisher, vice president in charge of supplier management at Boeing, told the Financial Times in May that “the supply chain is performing better this year than in 2015 when one supplier’s switch to a new resource management system caused the biggest number of shortages in eight years. It was an exception,” he said, but he’s only “one bad phone call away from that record being eradicated completely.” According to Tillman, the biggest problem suppliers face is a global lack of available capacity. “You have to be able to scale up in a way that doesn’t compromise cost, quality, delivery or service,” he says. “This has proven especially difficult for the industry to manage.” The Airbus A321neo engine is just one of the finished products supported by Elite’s expertise. View from the top Tillman took a blank slate approach to starting his business, which allowed him to establish solid building blocks to facilitate scalable growth. In 2015, the AS9100 Rev C- and ISO 9000-certified manufacturer acquired its second manufacturing facility in Tustin, California. The 34,000-sq.-ft. facility triples Elite’s manufacturing capacity. “I have gained a macro perspective of the supply chain, how it works and how to address these legacy challenges because I spent my career on the supply side of the aerospace market prior to establishing Elite,” Tillman says. At first glance, the sequence of operations that work in concert to design, produce and deliver products for the aerospace and defense market seems simple with a typical value stream comprising Tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers, a subcontractor performing assembly and a prime integrator. But the tiered relationship is complex and difficult to navigate, requiring a knowledge and flexibility that many in the industry lack, according to Tillman. “Today’s project and customer needs don’t always follow a traditional path,” he says. “Suppliers are finding that they must be prepared to play multiple roles.” Nimble-footed Elite is able to slide freely up and down the value stream to provide “plug and play” solutions that go beyond that of a conventional parts supplier. Tillman explained why in testimony he gave before a U.S. House of Representatives Small Business Committee hearing in May 2016. An Elite machine tool operator evaluates the first stage on a new component to ensure speeds and feeds are dialed in. American manufacturing has been stifled over the last couple decades by lack of investment in emerging technologies, slow adoption of business models with 21st century efficiencies, large growth capital requirements and lack of investment in prioritizing the cross training of employees, Tillman testified. “Elite was born out of recognition of these challenges,” he says, adding, “Our ability to address these problems has allowed us to quickly break into the aerospace marketplace while creating domestic manufacturing jobs and dispelling the myth that successful manufacturing in America is a thing of the past.” It’s why Tillman chose to build from the ground up, seeding the workspaces with a homegrown culture that is geared to the customer. “It’s no longer a decade of napkin agreements,” he says. “It’s about commissioning your customer for the work their customers are demanding.”  Tillman’s three-point plan is simple: people, processes and technology. “People are the centerpiece of any business,” he continues. “We hired best-of-breed talent and we maintain a robust human capital management program that empowers our employees through recognition and incentive systems that reward out-of-the-box thinking.” Elite’s infrastructure is networked with enterprise resource planning, quality management systems and business operating system (BOS) to promote an agile manufacturing environment that is populated with the latest equipment. The company subjects each request for proposal to a multi-departmental review and analysis to ensure the right machine tool is selected for the project. Elite’s current offering includes Swiss-style turned products used to support a variety of build-to-print and standard commercial and orbital rocket launch applications. Elite also makes complex, high cost-of-failure components like enclosures, heat sinks, manifolds and engine mounts. Raw materials range from carbon steels C12L15 to aluminum 6061-7075 and titanium 6AL4V to Inconel 625. Elite specializes in turned parts under 32mm and super alloy-milled components within a 17-in. by 24-in. envelope. Elite has plans to expand its product offering and add larger format machining by next year. The company has its eye on the commercial space transportation market as well. Tool holders stand ready to support a scheduled aviation component fabrication job. “Given the maturity of the supply chain at the OEM level over the last decade, especially in regard to total cost of ownership initiatives, we are seeing a sharper focus on quality and delivery,” says Tillman. “With the sheer volume of work in front of us ensuring parts are on-quality and on-time is going to become even more important.” Revival Quality and invisible costs associated with activities like processing and shipping are reasons Elite is also winning work back from overseas competitors, like the large contract it recently landed with an airframe manufacturer that was procuring parts from China used in the fabrication of seat monuments.  “The rejection rate [for the Chinese parts] was over 50 percent per delivery, numbers that left our customer in a predicament,” says Tillman. “Having parts reworked would have been cost prohibitive and caused further delays. Sending a quality team to regularly monitor the manufacturer added up to tens of thousands of dollars in airfare, hotels and other expenses. When our customer tallied these expenses and amortized the costs back through the piece part price, they were appalled,” according to Tillman. “The exercise made their decision a no-brainer.” Experience on the aerospace supply chain side of the fence has given Tillman a macro view of how to address the industry’s legacy challenges. Leading by example, Tillman hopes other suppliers in the global aerospace sector will follow suit. He acknowledges that it takes a certain amount of risk appetite and the ability to manage growth without diluting a company’s offerings. “We represent a very important voice,” he says. “It is the voice of the customer, not just over the next year but for the next 20 years.” Tillman also advocates getting involved in reshoring efforts and ways to remedy the shortage of skilled manufacturing workers from hiring and training veterans to engaging young people.  “As a nation we need to make manufacturing exciting again and reintroduce a curriculum in primary schools where children can be exposed to different vocations. The backbone of America has always been and will continue to be its skilled labor force,” he says. When the skills are homegrown, the entire supply base will be flying high.

Boeing released its China Current Market Outlook on Tuesday in Beijing, forecasting that demand for new commercial airplanes there will reach $1.025 trillion in the next 20 years. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” Randy Kinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes marketing vice president, said in a news release. “Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic.” Boeing’s forecast said China will need 5,110 new narrowbody jets through 2035, accounting for three-quarters of the 6,810 new commercial airplanes there. Boeing said China will need 1,560 widebody jets and 140 regional jets – 90 seats and less – over that period. During the two-decade period, Boeing forecasts annual passenger traffic growth of 6.4 percent in China.

The ratings on both classes of certificates are primarily driven by a top-down analysis incorporating a series of stress tests which simulate the rejection and repossession of the aircraft in a severe aviation downturn. The 'AA' level rating is supported by a high level of overcollateralization (OC) and high-quality collateral supporting Fitch's expectations that senior tranche holders should receive full principal recovery prior to default even in a severe stress scenario. Likewise, the 'A' rating on the subordinated certificates is supported by OC sufficient for the tranche to pass Fitch's 'A' level stress scenario. The ratings are also supported by the inclusion of 18-month liquidity facilities, cross-collateralization/cross-default features and the legal protection afforded by Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The structural features increase the likelihood that the certificates could avoid default even if United were to file bankruptcy and subsequently reject the aircraft. The initial 'AA' tranche loan to value (LTV), as cited in the prospectus, is 38.7%, and Fitch's maximum stress case LTV (the primary driver for the 'AA' tranche rating) through the life of the transaction is 82.3%. This level of OC provides a significant amount of protection for the senior tranche holders. The initial 'A' tranche LTV, as cited in the prospectus, is 55.8%, and Fitch's maximum stress case LTV through the life of the transaction is 89.5%, using our 'A' category stress scenario. Transaction Overview UAL plans to raise $919,593,000 in an EETC transaction to fund 13 new aircraft that are expected to be delivered between December 2016 and June 2017. The 'AA' tranche will be sized at $636,512,000 with a 12-year tenor and a weighted average life of 9.1 years. The subordinate 'A' tranche will be sized at $283,081,000 and will also feature a 12-year tenor and a weighted average life of 9.1 years. Collateral Pool: The transaction will be secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in 13 new delivery aircraft including seven Boeing 777-300ERs, two 787-9s, three 737-900ERs and a 737-800. Fitch considers all four aircraft types to be tier 1 collateral, though we view the 777-300ER and 737-900ER as weaker tier 1 assets. All four types are considered strategically important to UAL's fleet. Liquidity Facility: The class AA and class A certificates benefit from dedicated 18-month liquidity facilities which will be provided by Commonwealth Bank of Australia acting through its New York branch (rated 'AA-'/'F1+'/Stable Outlook). Cross-default & Cross-collateralization Provisions: Each note will be fully cross-collateralized and all indentures will be fully cross-defaulted from day one, which Fitch believes will limit UAL's ability to 'cherry-pick' aircraft in a potential restructuring. Pre-funded Deal: Proceeds from the transaction will be used to pre-fund deliveries expected to be completed by June of 2017. Accordingly, proceeds will initially be held in escrow by Natixis ('A/F1'/ Stable Outlook), the designated depositary, until the aircraft are delivered. Fitch notes that this transaction features a 35-day replacement window in the event that the liquidity facility provider or depositary should become ineligible. This is inconsistent with Fitch's counterparty criteria which generally stipulate a maximum 30-day replacement period. However, Fitch does not consider the longer replacement window to be material given that the additional time period is not significant. The transaction also features a downgrade threshold of 'BBB+' for the 'AA' tranche liquidity facility provider, whereas Fitch's counterparty criteria generally stipulate a minimum threshold of 'A-'. This is discussed in more detail below. KEY RATING DRIVERS Stress Case: The ratings for both classes of certificates are primarily based on collateral coverage in a stress scenario. The analysis uses a top-down approach assuming a rejection of the entire pool in a severe global aviation downturn. The scenarios incorporate a full draw on the liquidity facility, and an assumed repossession/remarketing cost of 5% of the total portfolio value. Fitch then applies significant haircuts to the collateral value. The 787-9s and the 737-800s in this pool receive a 40% haircut in Fitch's 'AA' stress scenario and a 20% haircut in the 'A' stress scenario, representing the low end of Fitch's stress ranges, and reflect the firm's view of these models as top-quality aircraft. The 737-900ERs receive a more severe haircut of 45% in the 'AA' scenario and 25% in the 'A' scenario, which incorporates the 737-900ER's limited user base, which could translate into a more difficult remarketing process if the aircraft had to be repossessed and sold. The 777-300ER received a 45% haircut in the 'AA' scenario and a 30% haircut in the 'A' scenario. These assumptions produce a maximum stress LTV of 82.3% for the class AA certificates using Fitch's 'AA' category scenario and a maximum LTV of 89.5% for the class A certificates using an 'A' level stress scenario. These outcomes support a high likelihood that both classes of certificates should receive full recovery with a significant amount of headroom, even in a harsh downside scenario. The highest stress LTVs are experienced early in the life of the transaction and are expected to decline gradually as the deal amortizes. High Collateral Quality: The quality of the collateral pool underlying the transaction is considered solid. 777-300ER (71% of collateral pool value per Fitch's valuations): Fitch considers the 777-300ER to be a high-quality tier 1 aircraft, but arguably weaker than other tier 1's such as the 737-800 or 787-9. The 777-300ER is the best-selling aircraft of its size with a diverse base of global operators and limited competition. With an average age of five years, the 777-300ER fleet is still a relatively young aircraft, though Boeing is preparing to launch its replacement, the 777x, in the early 2020 timeframe. Asset values for 777s have come under some scrutiny over the past year or so as some older 777-200s have been sold for well below what market observers would have expected. However, we note that value pressures have primarily centered on older vintage 777s with Rolls Royce engines, while the demand for newer models has remained intact. According to the Ascend database there is currently only one 777-300ER listed as 'in storage' - meaning that there is essentially no immediate availability for this aircraft type. Fitch notes that there is some concern over the high number of 777-300ERs scheduled to come off of their existing leases in coming years. Ascend lists 58 777-300ERs with lease expiries between now and 2023, 32 of which are from one user, Emirates. It is unclear whether a material number of lease expiries will pressure asset values over the intermediate term. Boeing also faces a gap between the end of its production run for the current 777 and the beginning of production of the 777x. The company still needs to sell a number of the current generation 777s to bridge production to the new model, which could lead to discounting that would pressure existing asset values. As such, Boeing recently cut its production rate on the 777 from 8.3/month to 7/month and is likely to cut production to 5.5/month over the transition period. Fitch's concerns are mitigated by the significant amount of overcollateralization included in this transaction. Fitch estimates that the senior tranche should continue to pass our 'AA' level stress test even if depreciation rates materially outpace our initial expectations. 787-9 (17%): Fitch considers the 787 Dreamliner to be a high-quality tier one aircraft. Despite technical issues early in the life of the smaller 787-8, backlogs for the aircraft family remain strong and delivery slots are scarce, which would support strong re-sale values if any of these planes were to come on the market. For that reason, Fitch applies the low end of its tier 1 stress range to the 787-9. The -9 variant has built up a sizeable backlog of 435 aircraft as of August 2016. Carrying 250 passengers in a standard arrangement, the 787-9 acts as a bridge in Boeing's product line between the 787-8 (typical capacity 224 passengers), and the 777-200ER (300 passengers). In addition, the 787-9 is capable of a similar range as the 777-200ER, but at an improved fuel burn rate. 737-900ER (9%): Fitch views the 900ER as a low tier 1/high tier 2 aircraft due to its attractive operating economics which make it an ideal replacement for older narrowbodies. However, the aircraft has a somewhat limited user base concentrated among a few large carriers. Lion Air and United operate nearly 50% of the fleet while the top four users (Lion, United, Delta and Alaska) operate some 75% of the 900ERs in service. The limited user base may make resale more difficult if the aircraft were to have to be repossessed or re-leased. 737-800 (3%): Fitch views the 737-800s as one of the most popular narrowbody aircraft currently in operation, and classifies it as top-quality tier 1 due to its market depth and desirability among approximately 185 global operators. The 737-800 is one of the world's most widely used aircraft and most attractive narrowbodies to finance. Affirmation Factor: Fitch considers the Affirmation Factor (i.e. the likelihood that UAL would affirm these aircraft in the event of a bankruptcy) for the aircraft in this portfolio to be high, as all are considered strategically important for UAL. The 777-300ERs, which make up the largest portion of the collateral, are a key element of UAL's widebody fleet. UAL placed the order for these 777s in 2015, with the goal of replacing older aircraft and modernizing its fleet. United currently operates 20 747s, and as those aircraft leave the fleet, the 777-300ER will represent UAL's premier large widebody aircraft. Importantly, United will operate a fleet of only 14 777-300ERs in total, seven of which are included in this transaction. Along with the 787-9s, the UAL 2016-2 collateral pool will be around 5% of UAL's widebody fleet, making it unlikely that the company would reject these aircraft in the event of a bankruptcy. The 787s are a meaningful addition to the fleet, allowing UAL to serve city pairs that were not previously accessible with older 767s. In addition, the 787 features significantly lower costs, including 20% lower fuel consumption, and 30% lower airframe maintenance costs, compared to similarly sized aircraft. The 737-900ER comprises 18% of UAL's mainline fleet, making this one of the key aircraft in its lineup. The new deliveries will largely be used to replace older 757-200s as they are taken out of the fleet. The range of the 900ER makes it an ideal plane for longer distance domestic routes, while incorporating significantly lower trip costs than the less fuel efficient 757-200. United still operates 77 757s between the -200 and -300 model, which are much more likely to be rejected in a bankruptcy scenario compared to the -900ERs in this portfolio. The 737-800 is also one of United's workhorse aircraft. The company operates 134 of them, with 737-800s serving each of United's hubs. UAL is one of the largest operators of the aircraft today, ranking just behind the likes of Southwest and American Airlines, which illustrates the importance of the 737 to United's fleet. The fact that this transaction consists entirely of brand-new deliveries and has a low total expected cost of funding also makes it unlikely that the aircraft would be rejected in a distress situation. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Ratings for this transaction are driven by a harsh downside scenario in which United declares bankruptcy, chooses to reject the collateral aircraft, and where the aircraft are remarketed in the midst of a severe slump in aircraft values. Specific assumptions regarding value stress rates, etc. are covered elsewhere in this press release. RATING SENSITIVITIES Both the AA and A tranche ratings are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Therefore, a negative rating action could be driven by an unexpected decline in collateral values. Potential risks for the 777-300ER include potential impacts from the entry of the 777x, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2020, and from the potential for discounting as Boeing looks to fill its production gap. Current generation 737s (both the 800 and 900ER) could be affected by the entry of the MAX. Senior tranche ratings could also be affected by a perceived change in the affirmation factor or deterioration in the underlying airline credit. The 'AA' tranche may also be downgraded to below the 'AA' category if United's IDR were downgraded to 'B-' or below, as stipulated in Fitch's EETC criteria. Fitch currently rates United at 'BB-'/Outlook Positive. Variation from Criteria: Fitch looks to its Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance dated Sept 1, 2016 for guidance on rating requirements for direct counterparties including liquidity facility providers. Criteria stipulate that in cases where the senior-most tranche of rated debt is rated in the 'AA' category, the liquidity provider should maintain an Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of at least 'A-'. Note that the transaction documents that govern this EETC stipulate a downgrade threshold for the 'AA' tranche liquidity facility provider of 'BBB+', representing a variation from Fitch's criteria. The variation recognizes that this aspect of the counterparty criteria does not directly apply to EETC ratings. In particular, Fitch's EETC criteria stipulate that in order to maintain a senior tranche rating in the 'AA' rating category, the underlying airline must be rated at least 'B'. However, if the liquidity facility were to be drawn due to non-payment of interest, the airline would be rated below the 'B' rating level. Thus, the ratings on the senior tranche would have already been downgraded below the 'AA' category, at which point, the threshold rating of 'A-' stipulated in our counterparty criteria is not applicable. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings: United Airlines 2016-2 pass-through trust: --Series 2016-2 class AA certificates 'AA (EXP)'; --Series 2016-2 class A certificates 'A (EXP)'. Fitch currently rates United as follows: United Continental Holdings, Inc. --IDR 'BB-'; --Senior unsecured rating 'BB-/RR4'. United Airlines, Inc. --IDR 'BB-'; --Secured bank credit facility 'BB+/RR1'.

According to Boeing's annual current market outlook, China is expected to become the world's first trillion-dollar aviation market within 20 years, China's Xinhua news agency reported. As China's economic transition into a more consumer-based economy, the aviation industry will play a key role," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing with Boeing Commercial Airplanes. China's continuous economic growth will bring vitality to the aviation market, Tinseth said. Besides, new airliners and a rising middle-class will drive market growth. "As travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years," he said. China has become Boeing's largest customer in the world. In the past three years, Boeing delivered to Chinese customers with 25 percent of its total aircraft production. To meet demand from the surging middle class in China and throughout Asia, low-cost carriers and the traditional full-service airlines have been adding planes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel. Boeing estimated that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. And China' s widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes. According to Boeing statistics, China' s single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft. The widebody fleet only represents about 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes give us reasons to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Empowering by its growing e-commerce business, the air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China. Boeing forecast the country will also need about 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Najib Condemns Missile Attack On Makkah Zahid Discusses Strengthening Bilateral Ties With Japan Rally Theatrics Of The Opposition - Najib Other News Headlines Selangor Umno Cannot Stop Members From Participating At Tomorrow's Rally - Noh- politic Labuan IBFC To Offer Cost-effective & Lucrative Solutions To Local Businesses- business Perak Goalkeeper Eyes Debut In AFF Suzuki Cup- sports Malaysia's Halal Products Welcomed In China- features Former Sri Lankan Diplomat Arrested For Corruption- world Most Read News Democracy Means Follow The Constitution - Salleh Minimum 3A, 3B In UPSR For Fully Residential Schools' Admission Former Bernama Executive Editor Hurt In Robbery By Two Armed Men Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in Chinaand throughout Asia, Boeing said. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 percent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. Chinese rivals China's rapidly growing e-commerce business, already the largest in the world -- also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing's deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe's Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The U.S. firm says it made more than half of China's commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 percent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919,China's first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Tinseth said Boeing was "absolutely" vigilant about Chinese competitors. "With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity" for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. "There are areas with COMAC where we're partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors," he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth $5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

Photo: AFP The country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:25 PM, September 13, 2016 Updated: 8:14 PM, September 13, 2016 BEIJING — China will become the world’s first trillion-dollar aviation market as its expanding middle class takes to the skies in ever greater numbers, US manufacturer Boeing predicted on Tuesday (Sept 13). The world’s most populous country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth US$1.03 trillion (S$1.4 trillion) by 2035, Boeing said in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 per cent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Mr Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in China and throughout Asia, Boeing said. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Mr Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 per cent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. China’s rapidly growing e-commerce business — already the largest in the world — also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing’s deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe’s Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The US firm says it made more than half of China’s commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 per cent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919, China’s first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Mr Tinseth said Boeing was “absolutely” vigilant about Chinese competitors. “With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity” for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. “There are areas with COMAC where we’re partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors,” he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth US$5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

GiSAT will provide broadcast and broadband capability to a targeted 35 sub-Saharan nations in Africa. GiSat will use Boeing’s tried and tested HS-702 model satellite for a private consortium based on the Cayman Islands. The satellite to deliver streaming media, digital broadcast and other communications services to Sub-Saharan Africa. With a coverage area encompassing 35 countries and 750 million people, GiSAT will deliver higher data rates at lower costs than previous satellites serving this part of the world. “Our vision for GiSAT is to provide end users with connectivity and services that are affordable, rich in local content and truly broadband in nature,” said Bahram Pourmand, CEO, Global IP. “With the ability to reconfigure the GiSAT on-board processor, the Boeing digital payload will allow us to broadcast different channels to different beams from different locations, providing better service to broadcasters, mobile operators and ISPs.” “Boeing’s latest digital payload – the most advanced design in the industry – offers greater flexibility for Global IP’s customers,” said Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International. “Boeing is committed to driving innovation in satellite technology so that our customers can bring the benefits of reliable, high-speed communications to people across the globe.” Scheduled to enter service in 2019, GiSAT is designed to operate with more than 10 gateways in Europe and multiple gateways within Africa. Privately owned Global IP was founded by three satellite industry veterans with 75 years of combined experience providing satellite products and services in emerging markets. The company CEO, Bahram Pourmand, was until recently EVP/GM, International Division of Hughes Network Systems LLC. The other two founders, Emil Youssefzadeh and Umar Javed were founders and executives of STM, one of the VSAT industry pioneers with a 15 year track record in Africa before sale of STM in 2013 in a private equity transaction.

The plane maker projects demand in China for 6,810 aircraft valued at $1.025tn, Boeing said in Beijing on Tuesday. The aircraft maker last year predicted China would need 6,330 new planes worth $950 billion in the next two decades. In China, "we continue to see very strong passenger traffic growth. We’ve seen a very strong consumer segment of the market", said Randy Tinseth, the vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "The good news for aviation is that is the segment of the economy that services the aircraft market." Carriers across Asia are expanding their fleets as economic growth makes air travel affordable to more people, lifting orders for Boeing and Airbus. The more-optimistic outlook from Boeing, which last year announced a plan to build an aircraft-completion centre in China, comes after it delivered a record number of planes to China in 2015. The plane maker won more orders from Chinese carriers including China Southern Airlines’ Xiamen Airlines unit this year. Passenger traffic will expand 6.4 per cent annually in China over the next 20 years, Boeing said. About 71 per cent of the new aircraft demand in China will be for growth, the plane maker said. Including a retained fleet of 910 planes, China will have 7,720 aircraft by 2035, the company said. The depreciation of the yuan has improved profitability of Chinese airlines and has not dampened orders at Boeing, Mr Tinseth said. The Chinese currency has weakened 4.6 per cent against the dollar in the past 12 months, the worst performer among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The aircraft-maker predicted China will need 5,110 new single-aisle jets with a market value of $535bn through 2035, or 75 per cent of total new deliveries. The widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes. China’s narrowbody and widebody fleet account for about 18 per cent and 5 per cent respectively of the global figures, Boeing said. In September last year, Boeing said it will open a facility in China with Commercial Aircraft of China to paint, complete interiors of and deliver the single-aisle 737 aircraft to Chinese companies. The US company is still working closely with Chinese partners on the details and will issue a statement at a later date, Mr Tinseth said. The plane maker said it expects 39,620 new aircraft valued at $5.9tn to be delivered worldwide in the next 20 years. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Air China builds bridge with BOC Aviation in jet sale and lease deal China creates Dh192bn fund to restructure state enterprises Airbus and Boeing get US go-ahead for $50bn aircraft deal with Iran Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad More Aviation Supercars can now travel in style from Dubai with Emirates Skywheels US regional airline Republic set to fly out of bankruptcy soon Bombardier’s passenger jet woes spur high-cost refinancing Brazil approves Qatar Airways’ stake purchase in Chile-based Latam Airlines MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

The world's most populous country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth $1.03 trillion by 2035, Boeing said in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. For Boeing, China is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth $1.03 trillion by 2035 ©Goh Chai-Hin (AFP/File) "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in China and throughout Asia, Boeing said. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 percent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. - Chinese rivals - China's rapidly growing e-commerce business -- already the largest in the world -- also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing's deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe's Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The US firm says it made more than half of China's commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 percent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919, China's first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Tinseth said Boeing was "absolutely" vigilant about Chinese competitors. "With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity" for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. "There are areas with COMAC where we're partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors," he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth $5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

percent of new deliveries China's wide-body fleet to triple in size over the next two decades News provided by Boeing Sep 13, 2016, 03:08 ET Share this article BEIJING, Sept. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing (NYSE: BA), China's leading provider of commercial airplanes, projects a demand for 6,810 new airplanes in the country over the next 20 years. Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) today in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at $1.025 trillion. China becomes the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Tinseth said the backlog from Chinese customers demonstrates that the new 737 MAX 8 and the current Next-Generation 737-800 are at the heart of the single-aisle market. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X.  This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters.

More than 50 percent of all the commercial jetliners operating in China are Boeing airplanes. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the world's most technologically advanced airplane, the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo BEIJING Chinese airlines are likely to purchase planes worth $1.025 trillion over 20 years as they expand fleets to cater to robust growth in domestic and overseas tourism, Boeing Co said in a more bullish forecast of Chinese aviation demand. Saying China as a market continued to exceed expectations, Boeing estimated 6,810 aircraft purchases in the period to 2035, up 7.6 percent from its previous prediction of demand until 2034. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing, said in a statement. He also said that he expects passenger traffic to grow 6.4 percent in China annually over the next 20 years. Boeing has stayed bullish on China even as other U.S. companies have expressed concern over the country's slower economic growth. A senior Boeing executive said in August that the plane maker was not seeing any softness in demand in China. Boeing and European rival Airbus have been jostling for market share in China, the world's fastest growing aviation market, with both opening assembly plants in the country. Boeing said more than 50 percent of commercial jetliners operating in China are its planes. China, however, is also striving to develop its own aircraft manufacturing capability and aims for its long-delayed C919 jet to make its maiden flight by the end of the year. It hopes the C919 will compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320.

View Latest Posts >>> Leaked Report Blows Lid Off Bellingcat’s Systematic Lying in MH17 Investigation By Ian Greenhalgh on September 14, 2016 We hate to say we told you so, but we did... [Editor’s note: This leaked report doesn’t tell us anything new, however it does confirm several things that we have been saying since the tragic downing of MH17, primarily that the Western narrative was complete lies and that neither Russia nor the Donbass rebels were guilty of shooting down the Boeing. There is still a lot of unknowns in the MH17 case and we do not have a clear picture of the actual events; the same can be said of the MH370 case and there is a good deal of circumstantial evidence that these are not unrelated cases and in fact, the disappearance of MH370 and the destruction of MH17 may well be very closely linked indeed. It bears repeating that MH370 was never lost, that Rolls Royce knew where the plane was and the truth is being hidden from us by a cover story involving the most unlikely scenario of the plane mysteriously flying off into the empty southern ocean to eventually meet a watery end far from land. Nothing we have been told about MH370 bears scrutiny and the same can be said of MH17, in both cases we have been fed a steady diet of lies and deceit. We may never know the whole truth behind these two airliners (or is it just one airliner?) and what is really tragic is that the families of those onboard MH370 will probably never get answers as to what happened to their loved ones. Ian] __________ Sputnik Leaked Report Blows Lid Off Bellingcat’s Systematic Lying in MH17 Investigation Later this month, Dutch prosecutors will publish the second part of their probe investigating the July 2014 destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in east Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian media have gotten ahold of a separate report breaking down the lies and half-truths used by the Bellingcat group to blame Russia for the catastrophe. On July 17, 2014, at the peak of fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and anti-Kiev militia, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, on route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was destroyed, killing all of 298 passengers and crew onboard. Kiev and independence supporters in Ukraine’s southeast quickly blamed each other for the catastrophe. Last October, Dutch investigators published a report which said that MH17 appeared to have been shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile system, produced by Russia’s Almaz-Antey defense concern. Investigators could not conclusively determine the precise area that the missile was fired from. Dutch Gov’t Feared ‘Impotence’ in Wake of MH17 Crash Could Lead to Unrest Almaz-Antey went ahead with its own investigation into the crash, finding that the missile which hit the plane could only have been launched from the settlement of Zaroshchenske, Donetsk Region, which was under the control of Ukrainian forces at the time of the incident. Last month, Dutch officials announced that their Joint Investigation Team, working on the criminal investigation into the catastrophe, would release the first results of their investigation on September 28. Headed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor, the investigation is expected to show precisely the kind of weapon that was used, and from where it was fired. On Tuesday, the Novaya Gazeta newspaper published a 31-page leaked document, signed by Almaz-Antei representative Mikhail Malyshevsky. The paper suggested that the report’s conclusions may very well serve as the basis for Russia’s possible response to the Dutch investigation; the document, prepared on the basis of an investigation by specialists from Almaz-Antei, breaks down in great detail the erroneous and sometimes outright falsified evidence presented by Bellingcat, a group of Western journalists heavily engaged in investigating the plane’s destruction. The downing of Flight MH17 has turned into one of the organization’s main pet projects, and according to Dutch media, Bellingcat’s work is being actively considered by Dutch investigators for their investigation. Despite Russian investigators’ thorough efforts to counter Bellingcat’s claims in the past, the group has continued to persist in suggesting that anti-Kiev militia, and indirectly, Russia, were responsible for the downing of the Malaysian Boeing. As a result, Russian experts have been forced to go through great lengths to refute the misinformation presented by Bellingcat. Among its most recent claims is footage from a car video recorder, said to have been shot on July 17, 2014, ostensibly showing a rebel-controlled Buk moving toward what Bellingcat’s account says was the likely launch site of the missile that downed MH17. In reality, this video could not have been shot any later than July 15, 2014, since the road the DVR-equipped car was traveling on was damaged by a rebel motor column including heavy tracked vehicles on that day. Another of Bellingcat’s charges revolves around a satellite image showing a white transport truck carrying the rebel Buk allegedly used to shoot down the MH17 on its trailer. But that image was proven to be a fake, given that three of the vehicles Bellingcat claims were part of the Buk convoy are actually pictured going in the opposite direction along the highway depicted. Moreover, the shadow given off by the truck and its cargo is not characteristic of the Buk’s distinctive shape, and is facing in the wrong direction relative to the time of day the shot was said to have been taken (11:08 AM on July 17, 2014). Next, Russian experts dissected the claim made by Bellingcat regarding a photograph purporting to show launch smoke coming from the Buk missile in an area near the alleged launch site on July 17. According experts, this photo was either digitally altered or taken at another date, since other photo and video evidence from July 17 have confirmed that the weather in the area was cloudy, not clear, as claimed by Bellingcat. Another Bellingcat claim revolves around the suggestion that a missile defense space-based infrared system (SBIRS) successfully pinpointed the launch site. In fact, detecting a Buk launch using SBIRS system is virtually possible, given that detecting and determining a fired ballistic missile’s trajectory requires more time than the Buk would be expected to fly. As to the crucial Bellingcat claim – that MH17 was hit by a single Buk SAM in the hands of the Donbass militia, the report reiterated that this is a practical impossibility, since the detection range of a single Buk is limited to 120 degrees in azimuth and 7 degrees in elevation, and its effectiveness of fire is limited. A single Buk system can guard only a pre-assigned airspace sector with knowledge of its potential targets’ parameters, up to and including enemy flight time (that is, to wait in ‘ambush’ mode). Independently and without this information, normally provided by support systems elsewhere in the military command, a single Buk is not capable of precisely locating and then hitting its target. The detailed, technical and expert-oriented 31 page report leaked by Novaya Gazeta also revealed that Almaz-Antei took the unprecedented step of providing Dutch investigators with the genuine specifications of the Buk system. This, the report suggested, was meant to preclude the use of erroneous or otherwise inaccurate data which investigators obtained from various sources, including publically available materials. “The use of such materials inevitably led to erroneous results and conclusions. Precisely in order to avoid these mistakes, the decision was made to transfer the real technical characteristics of the Buk missile to the Dutch Safety Board,” the report explained. As for Bellingcat, the report saved a special criticism for them regarding the variant of the Buk missile used to shoot down MH17, suggesting that the group does not have and cannot know the precise technical characteristics and technical documentation which would enable them to make an accurate distinction between the variants of the 9M38 missile. As for Almaz-Antei, their report from October 2015 not only included this information, but even showed the results of two full-scale experiments to recreate the crash, conclusively demonstrating that the Malaysia Airlines Boeing was downed by an old Buk model fired from Ukrainian territory.

Zionist monopoly Western MSM suppressed this to protect their own including the likely Israeli hijackers. If it had been widely known, public pressure would have demanded tracking satellite telemetry data for both engines (known to exist) be requisitioned to reveal where and when MH-370 has been flown or parked since it disappeared. That would lead to finding out the fate of passengers on board, finding the hijackers, and finding out who else may have been involved. Log in to Reply William Bourne  September 16, 2016 at 12:43 am The first photo at: veteranstoday.com/2016/04/25/russian-lawmaker-praises-new-bbc-documantary-on-boeing-crash-in-donbass displays evidence proving that this wreck was indeed the long missing MH-370. If you were to examine previous online photos of this airplane, you will find that it was purchased new about two years prior to the crash. The paint and graphics were never changed since new, so any photo of MH-370 will be correct, whereas MH-17 was about 12 years old on its third repaint (and other of this airlines 777’s were older as well). We are only interested in comparing these two using the third (and last) repaint scheme of MH-17. The paint schemes are alike to the casual glance, but certain identified anomalies are present only on MH-370. One of these is that the flag on previous photos of MH-370 is different than on MH-17. It shows noticeably less tilt, whereas when extended downwards, the left and right edges align far differently with the windows below.

Many familiar names involved. Freestone makes cloaking devices. The Chinese co-owners of an 80% interest in the patent, based on increasing the efficiency of semiconductor fabrication, were killed in the crash, leaving Jacob Rothschild as sole owner. http://www.voltairenet.org/article183486.html Garry Compton  September 15, 2016 at 9:29 am As soon Obama’s Boys wouldn’t produce the truth that they said they had that the Russians shot it down – should have finalized the outcome – NATO/ Ukies shot it down for a FF. The pics i saw showed that the crew got shot in the back – also – and then there was the other senario that the MH-17 was carrying germ war-far virus’s and was headed to Krashnadar or Rostov and it needed to be eliminated — either way a western ” act of war’. A whole bunch of Rats know who shot it down – but the Rats are well paid with american bucks and euros. The Americans saved most of the Nazi’s after WWII — it ain’t going to happen this time because the Americans/ EUers are the rats that no one will save.

So I would rather put my trust in Gordon Duff and in turn his trust in Michael Shrimpton as a credible source for an explanation of MH17 and 370.

Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA hopes to sell these bargain transatlantic tickets by flying from US airports that have low fees and little to no international service and the introduction of its new fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircrafts. The third-largest budget airline in Europe have announced that they're considering $69 (£52) flights to Edinburgh and Bergen, Norway, from US airports such as New York's Westchester County Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport. The third-largest budget airline in Europe have announced that they're considering $69 (£52) flights to Edinburgh and Bergen, Norway, from US airports such as New York's Westchester County Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport Average prices on such routes are likely to be closer to $300 (£228) round trip according to the airline's Chief Executive Officer Bjørn Kjos. Currently, many of Norwegian's fares can be as high as $500 (£380) because of higher fees levied by busier airports. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Is this the best birthday present ever?

Share this article Share 117 shares The potential plans are part of Norwegian's broader move to cut prices and take a share of the market from traditional flag carriers that dominate trans-Atlantic flights. While airlines such as Lufthansa offer travelers hundreds of destinations via connections in airport hubs, Norwegian is aiming to make nonstop service to small cities that straddle the Atlantic more common, which keeps costs low. The 737 MAX features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics which means these planes are equipped to traverse the Atlantic but are smaller than most jets that currently do so, making them a better size for international flights to cities such as Birmingham in Britain WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF BOEING 737 MAX JETS?  By increasing the fleet to 100 737 MAXs, Norwegian estimate over 65,000 passengers will experience fewer delays Passenger capacity has been increased by 12 people by accommodating two more seat rows than the 737-700 The aircraft also boasts superior fuel efficiency which will reduce carbon emissions It has a 40% smaller noise footprint than today's single-aisle airplanes. Boeing Sky Interior intends to enhance travelling experience featuring improvements such as overhead bins and LED lighting as well as split scimitar winglets Planes will feature four new large-format display screens that will increase pilots' situational awareness and efficiency. There will also be a new digital regulator for the engine bleed air systems to improve its reliability The new and smaller engine has an advanced core and larger turbine fan Kjos said: 'I think you will see a lot to that effect within five years' time. What will happen to [Lufthansa] when everyone starts to fly direct?' Norwegian has 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets on order and expects to receive five in 2017. The 737 MAX 8 features new fuel-efficient engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. It means these planes are equipped to cross the Atlantic but are smaller than most jets that currently do so - making them a better size for international flights to cities such as Birmingham in Britain according to Kjos. Regulators will have to agree to set up customs stations at US regional airports to handle international traffic - although Kjos said he is confident this can be arranged. Norwegian is not the only airline to market cheap fares across the Atlantic. Iceland's Wow Air recently offered one-way fares between Boston and Paris for £75.  Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Eurowings is also starting cheap long-haul flights. The potential plans are part of Norwegian's broader move to cut prices and take share from traditional flag carriers that dominate trans-Atlantic flying Kjos downplayed the competitive threat of Eurowings, saying, 'I don't believe in their being able to operate low cost with a Boeing 767,' in part because the widebody planes save less fuel and have smaller range than planes such as Boeing Dreamliners in Norwegian's fleet. Norwegian separately reported on Tuesday that it filled 96 per cent of long-haul plane seats in September, helping the airline post better-than-expected results.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 117 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

The project takes advantage of the latest technology, tools and manufacturing techniques. The design specifications make the aircraft more affordable and flexible than older iterations. “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come,” said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret. The Boeing T-X aircraft has one engine, twin tails, stadium seating and an advanced cockpit with embedded training. The system also offers state-of-the-art ground-based training and a maintenance-friendly design for long-term support. “It’s an honor to build the future of Air Force training,” said Saab President and CEO Håkan Buskhe. “We have created the best solution thanks to great cooperation and a clear strategy since day one.” The Air Force’s aging T-38 aircraft have a limited service life and the the new Boeing design has been slated to replace them when they enter into service in 2024. www.boeing.com Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags Boeing Saab T-X Related Boeing, Airbus offer positive outlook for aircraft demand Boeing designs autonomous underwater vehicle Study shows aerospace giant Boeing contributes $3 billion to Canadian economy Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The customer, Cayman Islands-based Global IP, will use the satellite to deliver streaming media, digital broadcast and other communications services to Sub-Saharan Africa. GiSAT will have a coverage area encompassing 35 countries and 750 million people. “Our vision for GiSAT is to provide end users with connectivity and services that are affordable, rich in local content and truly broadband in nature,” said Bahram Pourmand, CEO, Global IP. “With the ability to reconfigure the GiSAT on-board processor, the Boeing digital payload will allow us to broadcast different channels to different beams from different locations, providing better service to broadcasters, mobile operators and ISPs.” Scheduled to enter service in 2019, GiSAT is designed to operate with more than 10 gateways in Europe and multiple gateways within Africa. Privately owned Global IP was founded by three satellite industry veterans with 75 years of combined experience providing satellite products and services in emerging markets.  The company CEO, Bahram Pourmand, was until recently Executive Vice President and General Manager, International Division of Hughes Network Systems LLC.  The other two founders, Emil Youssefzadeh and Umar Javed were founders and executives of STM, one of the VSAT industry pioneers with a 15 year track record in Africa before sale of STM in 2013 in a private equity transaction.

The planemaker projects demand in China for 6,810 aircraft valued at $1.025 trillion, making the nation the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast, Boeing said in a statement distributed in Beijing Tuesday. The aircraft maker last year predicted China would need 6,330 new planes worth USD950 billion in the next two decades. In China, “we continue to see very strong passenger traffic growth. We’ve seen a very strong consumer segment of the market,” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said at a briefing in Beijing. “The good news for aviation is that is the segment of the economy that services the aircraft market.” Carriers across Asia are expanding their fleets as economic growth makes air travel affordable to more people, lifting orders for Boeing and Airbus Group SE. The more-optimistic outlook from Boeing, which last year announced a plan to build an aircraft-completion center in China, comes after it delivered a record number of planes to China in 2015. The planemaker won more orders from Chinese carriers including China Southern Airlines Co.’s Xiamen Airlines unit this year. Passenger traffic will expand 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years, Boeing said. About 71 percent of the new aircraft demand in China will be for growth, the planemaker said. Including a retained fleet of 910 planes, China will have 7,720 aircraft by 2035, the company said in presentation materials. The depreciation of the yuan has improved profitability of Chinese airlines and hasn’t damped orders at Boeing, Tinseth said. The Chinese currency has weakened 4.6 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months, the worst performer among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The aircraft-maker predicted China will need 5,110 new single-aisle jets with a market value of $535 billion through 2035, or 75 percent of total new deliveries. The widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes. China’s narrowbody and widebody fleet account for about 18 percent and 5 percent respectively of the global figures, Boeing said. In September last year, Boeing said it will open a facility in China with Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. to paint, complete interiors of and deliver the single-aisle 737 aircraft to Chinese companies. The U.S. company is still working closely with Chinese partners on the details and will issue a statement at a later date, Tinseth said. The planemaker said it expects 39,620 new aircraft valued at $5.9 trillion to be delivered worldwide in the next 20 years.

(WKRN) – The Pleasant View Volunteer Fire Department has a unique and even fun way to teach kids about fire safety. They have their very own Fire Safety House, and it’s kind of a playhouse for learning set up inside a trailer. “So what we do with this is we visit every single elementary school in our district,” said Abbie Boeing. (Photo: WKRN) “It has your living room area and your kitchen areas. So we can talk about safety in your living rooms, safety in your kitchens, cooking safety, things like that,” she explained. Boeing said there’s also an upstairs so they can teach children what to do if a fire breaks out while they’re sleeping and how to get out. There’s even a fireplace to teach kids not to put toys and objects too close to the heat. Tennesseans in need of a smoke alarm can request one free of charge at TN.gov/fire. This is through the State Fire Marshal’s Office (SFMO) “Get Alarmed” program. Since the Get Alarmed program’s inception in 2012, the SFMO has distributed over 122,000 smoke alarms statewide to 475 partnering organizations. Smoke alarms installed through the program are credited with saving 147 Tennesseans from fire danger so far and helped lower Tennessee’s fire fatality rate to an all-time low in 2015.

A Delta Air Lines jet skidded off a snowy runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport last year because the pilot used too much reverse thrust and lost control of the plane's direction, federal investigators said Tuesday. There were no serious injuries aboard the airliner arriving from Atlanta on March 5, 2015, but the National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart said it was "a very close call." The report found that the captain and first officer were unprepared for the amount of snow that was on the LaGuardia runway because the information that had been provided to them was not current. The Boeing MC-88 veered left, hit a fence with its left wing and came to rest with its nose on leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy Flushing Bay. My day so far. #crashland pic.twitter.com/dpNnGP5oQk — Steve (@steveblaze98) March 5, 2015 The investigators said the captain initiated reverse thrust—one of several braking mechanisms on the aircraft—before the plane's nose wheel hit the runway, which was not proper procedure, according to Delta or Boeing. The report found that overuse of reverse thrust on a slippery surface rendered the rudder useless. The investigators said the first officer told the captain to come out of reverse three times before he finally did, but by then it was too late. The NTSB also faulted the cabin and flight crew for failing to promptly evacuate the 127 passengers from the plane, which began leaking fuel after the wing hit the fence. Investigator Emily Gibson said it took 12 minutes before the first passengers stepped off the aircraft and 17 minutes before all passengers had been evacuated. Reasons for the delay included a lack of decisiveness on the part of the captain, who "did not convey a sense of urgency to evacuate the cabin," she said. Laguardia Airport: 131 passengers/crew on plane. 24 non-life-threatening injuries, 3 of whom transported at this time pic.twitter.com/UlvDtcuHUF — FDNY (@FDNY) March 5, 2015 She said the captain's inaction was compounded by the lead flight attendant's decision to tell passengers they had time to take their coats out of the overhead compartments. Investigators also said the accident disabled the plane's public address and intercom systems, and the crew's training had not addressed handling an emergency landing with no working PA system. Gibson said it was initially not clear to first responders whether there were 125 or 127 passengers on the plane. The crew provided the lower number, which didn't include two lap infants. The transportation board, meeting in Washington, D.C., voted 4-0 to accept the report and recommend policy changes to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident. Atlanta-based Delta said Tuesday in a statement that its top priority "is always the safety of our customers and employees." "We cooperated with the National Transportation Safety Board during the course of the investigation and we respect their findings, conclusions and recommendations," the airline said. "Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation."

Because aircraft sizes and utilization will rise, the carriers’ fleets will not need to grow quite as fast, Boeing said, forecasting that aircraft numbers will expand at 5.1% per year. The fleet growth forecast is slower than the 5.3% figure that Boeing issued in 2015 for the 20 years through 2034. The difference appears ...

The world’s largest aerospace company faces a dogfight with Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Raytheon Co. for the contract to produce 351 jets through the T-X advanced trainer program. The winning entry would replace the aging T-38 fleet on which U.S. military pilots have honed their flying skills since 1961. The new T-X fighter by Boeing. Source: Boeing With lights pulsing and booming music, Boeing and Sweden’s Saab AB unveiled their entry Tuesday in St. Louis for the competition that kicks off late this year. Their jet melds a twin tail reminiscent of Boeing’s Super Hornets with a General Electric Co. engine and systems honed through Saab’s Gripen jets. But the real innovation comes through new technology and production processes the companies say will slash manufacturing costs, Darryl Davis, president of Boeing’s Phantom Works research and development organization, told reporters. “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come,” said Leanne Caret, chief executive officer of Boeing’s defense unit. Boeing is the last of the major defense contractors to reveal its concept after plane spotters glimpsed Northrop Grumman’s entry making a test flight last month. And there’s more than a little symbolism to the site Boeing chose to debut the first proposed trainer model: the St. Louis manufacturing center where the company churns out F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-15 fighter jets. “This is their last chance to provide a next-generation dedicated military aircraft for the company and St. Louis,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace and defense analyst with Teal Group. “The Super Hornet can go on for another five years easily, and ditto for the F-15. But the bridge to a sixth-generation fighter would depend on some kind of combat version of this.” Boeing fell 1.2 percent to $128.53 at 3:01 p.m. in New York, leaving the stock down 11 percent this year. Few Contests Military aircraft contests are few and far between in an era of budget constraints, and the Chicago-based planemaker needs new orders to preserve the Missouri industrial base and engineering acumen gained with the 1997 acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Boeing’s military arm has been eclipsed by the rapid growth of the commercial-jet unit this decade. The defense division accounted for 31 percent of sales last year, down from 50 percent in 2010. The manufacturer has suffered high-profile losses: last year’s stealth-bomber competition to Northrop Grumman, and the joint strike fighter contest to Lockheed’s F-35 in 2001.  Boeing’s largest recent contract win, valued at $51 billion, is for an aerial refueler derived from the 767 jetliner, which is manufactured outside Seattle. The winning T-X design may go on to claim hundreds of overseas orders and spare parts stretching over decades as the Pentagon program spurs other countries to upgrade their trainer fleets. Teal Group forecasts a global market for 2,737 turbine trainers valued at $32.3 billion over the next decade, up from the $19.9 billion of the aircraft delivered from 2006 through 2015, according to a June research report.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter The U.S. Air Force isn’t expected to release final contest criteria until December, picking a winner next year who would begin production in fiscal 2018. The new trainer isn’t slated to begin preparing a new generation of pilots for combat for another eight years. The gap could be longer if funding is squeezed by programs like the F-35 fighter, the KC-46A tanker and a new stealth bomber, the Congressional Research Service said in a report last year. It’s uncertain how the Air Force will weigh an aircraft’s performance against its production costs. Boeing and Northrop Grumman may be at a disadvantage since they are bidding clean-sheet designs against supposedly less expensive, in-service models: the T-50A offered by Lockheed and Korea Aerospace Industries, and Raytheon’s T-100, based on Leonardo’s M-346 trainer. Aboulafia thinks the Lockheed aircraft has an edge “as the only off-the-shelf, supersonic design. We don’t know to what extent Boeing and Northrop Grumman will exceed expectations.” Next Model Boeing already is assembling its second production trainer in St. Louis, employing some of the advanced manufacturing techniques developed over the past five years through its secretive “Black Diamond” initiative. They range from using 3D printing for the plane’s ductwork to a canopy developed with injection molding that shaves a six-week process down to eight days. But the company wants to make sure that work counts in the upcoming competition. Boeing has urged Air Force planners to hold to current criteria “if they are serious about the cost curve,” rather than tilting judging so that planes that exceed threshold requirements will have an advantage, said Davis, the Phantom Works president. By teaming with Sweden’s Saab, Boeing gained a way to tamp down costs and jump-start sales in international markets, said George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “There’s a reason why a number of these teams teamed up with foreign participants,” he said.

For three years, Boeing has been secretive about its proposal to manufacture the new twin-engine, supersonic jet trainer. The Chicago-based company, collaborating with Saab, is directly competing with Northrop Grumman Corp. for a new “clean sheet” design. The Air Force wants a replacement for its T-38 Talon trainer aircraft, first produced by Northrop in 1959. The Talon is used to prep pilots for “front-line fighter and bomber aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, F-15C Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, B-1B Lancer, A-10 Thunderbolt and F-22 Raptor,” according to the service. The service hopes to buy 350 new trainer jets. Photos surfaced last month on social media showing the Northrop version of the aircraft. Northrop spokeswoman Katherine Thompson confirmed to Defense News that the photos were of its trainer, which was conducting taxi testing in Mojave, California. Northrop is partnering with BAE Systems, L-3 and Rolls-Royce on the project. Promo videos of Boeing’s version were posted on the company’s site days after Northrop’s flightline tests. The official Twitter account for Boeing on Sept. 1 also posted, “Mark your calendars: #NewBoeingTX will be revealed in St. Louis on September 13” with a link to the sneak peek videos. Other vendor teams such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Korea Aerospace Industries, and Raytheon Co., Leonardo-Finmeccanica and CAE Inc. are offering modification designs to current aircraft, but are not competing in clean sheet designs. At the upcoming AFA conference, Boeing will have five exhibit booths on the technology show floor, more than any other defense company presenting at the exposition.

 How Emirates found success with the most controversial jet in the world Benjamin Zhang Sep. 13, 2016, 2:32 PM 73,458 facebook linkedin twitter email print Airbus A380. Airbus More than a decade after its maiden flight, the Airbus A380 superjumbo remains a major point of interest and curiosity for passengers and airline industry insiders alike. As impressive and attention grabbing as the aircraft may be, it hasn't had the same paradigm-shifting effect that the Boeing 747 had upon its debut decades earlier.  Most of the airlines around the world who either operate the A380 or are thinking about investing in the plane have struggled to figure out a way to maximize its revenue generating potential. As a result, Airbus has struggled mightily over the past few years to find new customers for its flagship airliner.  However, the double-decker jet has no bigger supporter than Emirates Airlines. Of the 319 orders Airbus has won for the super jumbo, 140 of them have come from the Dubai-based airline. In comparison, Singapore Airlines has the second largest order with 24 A380s. Why does Emirates love the A380 so much? "Airport congestion around the world is getting worse," Emirates President Sir Tim Clark told Business Insider. "And up-gauging aircraft is a solution for this." Emirates' business strategy involves funneling large masses of people to its palatial home base in Dubai and dispatching them to various destinations around the world. Often times, those destinations are either well-developed first world cities or under developed third-world cities, that are both plagued by airports bursting at the seams with people and planes.  Emirates Airbus A380. REUTERS/Phil Noble According to Sir Tim Clark, the A380 allows Emirates to get ahead of congestion issues at major airport around the world. With infrastructure struggling to keep up with demand for landing slots and airport gates, the superjumbo allows the airline to increase passenger volume with fewer aircraft and fewer flights. "It works great for our network structure's long-haul to long-haul connections," Emirates senior vice president for operations Hubert Frach told Business Insider in an interview. "It allows us to offer efficient connections between developing economies with well established economies." As a result, Emirates and its centrally located-Dubai base has become a gateway — connecting Europe and North America with Africa and Asia.  While other carriers operating the A380 have concerns over filling the double decker's cavernous cabin, Emirates does not seem to have that concern. "Although you can't operate each and every destination with the aircraft, we do see the demand pull of the A380," Frach said. "Take London for example. We operate nine A380 flights into London every day and, believe me, they are all full." And the strategy seems to be working. In May, Emirates announced a record $1.93 billion profit for the last fiscal year with a margin of 8.4%. Although it should be noted that Emirates, along with the rest of the airline industry, has benefited greatly from plummeting fuel costs. In addition, the rapid growth of Emirates and its fellow Middle Eastern carriers Etihad and Qatar have come under criticism from American, United, and Delta Air Lines. The US3 allege that the ME3's stellar performance and service are unfairly augmented by as much as $42 billion in subsidies over the past 10 years. The ME3 have denied these allegations. Emirates president, Sir Tim Clark. REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah In addition to the operational benefits of the A380, it's also a great marketing piece. "At the Berlin Air Show, we usually bring a brand new A380 that's just been delivered from the Airbus factory in Hamburg and the line to see the plane usually a mile long," Sir Tim Clark told us while in New York for the US Open tennis tournament for which his airline is a major sponsor.  It's a sentiment echoed by Frach. "Every time I'm on an A380, I still see people taking selfies and photos of the plane," the executive added. "It's iconic and it's a customer magnet." Emirates isn't the only airline that understands the marketing power of the superjumbo. In May, Qatar Airways launched its inaugural flight to Atlanta — the home fortress for Delta, arguably the Middle Eastern airlines' staunchest critic. Although the flight is normally operated by a smaller Boeing 777, Qatar decided to make a splash by rolling into town with a superjumbo — an aircraft Delta does not possess in its 800-plane fleet. Etihad operates its glamour routes to London and New York using its A380s as well. Why don't more airlines buy the A380? If the A380 works so well for Emirates, why don't more airlines around the world commit to the plane? "Since the great recession, airlines around the world are run by risk averse boards who don't want to spend $400 million on a single plane,"  Clark said. "Here, we don't have that, it's just me and my boss (Emirates Group chairman H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum)." Qatar Airbus A380 in Atlanta. Qatar Airways Due to geography, Emirates operates only international flights and boasts a fleet of roughly 250 wide-body long haul jets. In addition to the world's largest fleet of A380s, it also boasts the world's largest fleet of Boeing 777s with more than 150 of the twin-engined jets.  However, the reality of the A380 is that it is the largest and most expensive airliner in the world at $428 million a plane. Boeing's 777-9X is second at $400 million. Even though it's capable of offering its operators the lowest per-seat cost of any airliner in the world, its four-massive turbo fan engines are far from economical. As a result, even Emirates' well-financed neighbor Etihad have limited its fleet of A380s to just 10 planes.  "No, we're done," Etihad Aviation Group CEO James Hogan told Business Insider last year when asked whether he'd buy more A380s. "We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient."  But for now, the Airbus A380 is alive and moving forward with its most important customer.   "We are taking another 50 or so A380s," Clark said. "So we're keeping the production line going."

"As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, Vice President of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years," he added. According to Tinseth, the country's growing middle class and new visa policies "gives every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market.” READ MORE Russia developing aircraft engine for joint passenger jet with China Boeing predicts that three-quarters of new deliveries will be single-aisle aircraft that carry between 90 and 230 passengers. Demand for wide-body planes will also increase, with 1,560 new planes expected to triple the country's fleet over 20 years. Read more China plans to produce its own aircraft engines The report said that air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China supported by the country’s growing e-commerce business which is already the largest in the world. Boeing has played a major role in developing China's aviation industry and infrastructure, making up more than 50 percent of commercial jetliners operating in the country. China, however, wants to develop its own aircraft manufacturing capability. Two years ago Beijing signed a deal with Russia to create a long-range wide-body aircraft. The project is part of a $13 billion aviation cooperation deal between the two countries. The new 250-280 seat aircraft will have a range of 12,000 kilometers. In June, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin announced the start of construction work on a heavy-lift aircraft engine for the jet. The first airplanes are expected to be completed by 2023 and to go on sale in 2025.

The latest estimate of 6,810 planes is 7.6 percent higher than the 6,330 aircraft predicted last year. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing, said in a statement. He also said that he expects passenger traffic to grow 6.4 percent in China annually over the next 20 years. Boeing has stayed bullish on China even as other U.S. companies have expressed concern over the country's slower economic growth. A senior Boeing executive said in August that the plane maker was not seeing any softness in demand in China. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

But the Canadian aviation landscape makes it hard for new airlines to survive—and the two dominant airlines are sure to respond. Justin Bachman justinbachman September 12, 2016 — 6:00 AM EDT Updated on September 12, 2016 — 3:54 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Travel nearly anywhere in the world, and you'll find cheap airlines offering no-frills service, from European giant Ryanair Holdings Plc to Peach Aviation Ltd. in Japan, Flynas in Saudi Arabia, and Spirit Airlines Inc. in the U.S. But head north of the border, and the aviation landscape is untouched by ultralow-cost airlines. Canada ranks among the world’s most expensive countries to fly in, due in part to high airport and security fees and limited competition, and service is meager in many small and midsize cities. More than 60 percent of Canada’s 36 million people live within 100 miles of the border, and many head south to fly; about 5 million cross the border each year for cheaper flights. “Griping about the cost of air travel in this country is as endemic as bitching about the weather—it’s as if nothing can be done about either of them,” a columnist for Canada’s National Post wrote in June. Some cheaper fares may be en route. Three companies are working to bring the ultralow-cost model to the country, where air travel is dominated by two national airlines, Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. But higher operating costs make it hard for new airlines to survive, and the dominant airlines are sure to respond to upstarts offering lower fares. WestJet, for example, has already begun new nonstop service on two routes flown by the first of these newcomers. Canada is one of just two nations in the Group of 20 largest economies without any ultralow-cost carriers, or ULCCs. The other, Argentina, may see one next year as Irelandia Aviation Ltd.—the Dublin-based investment firm that has established such ULCCs as Ryanair in Europe and Allegiant Travel Co. in the U.S.—aims to expand its low-cost airline group Grupo Viva Aerobus there. Canada also charges higher security fees than most other nations—up to $25 per passenger—and its 26 largest airports must make annual payments to their municipalities in lieu of local taxes. A 2015 report (pdf) to the Canadian transport minister, reviewing the nation's transportation system, found air travel in Canada “marked by weak accountability constraints on fees and charges; high costs for users and operators; aggressive capital expenditure programs at airports; modest traffic volumes; and limited competition.” It recommended that the government reform airport ownership structure and offer the aviation sector more federal financial aid, as the U.S. does. “There is no room for complacency,” it added. Canadians are eager for the expanded service and lower fares that ULCCs could provide, said Jim Young, chief executive of NewLeaf Travel Co., a “virtual” airline in its sixth week of operations, with three Boeing 737s flying to secondary airports in 11 cities nationwide. NewLeaf, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, itself has no air certificates or airplanes. It sells tickets on an established carrier, Flair Airlines—a “wet lease” arrangement that lets NewLeaf escape many of the costly aspects of being an airline. Flair staffs and maintains the fleet and sells capacity to NewLeaf. Canadians “understand the business model—they understand the fees, they understand that you pay for what you consume,” Young said in a telephone interview.  Canada is among the most expensive places for air travel—No. 70 out of 75 nations in the average cost to fly 100 kilometers, at $38.71, according to data released last week by the online travel agency Kiwi.com. (Only Japan, the Netherlands, Qatar, Finland, and the United Arab Emirates had more expensive fares, according to Kiwi; the U.S. was No. 17, with India the cheapest place to fly.) The country's high airport fees limit the traffic-stimulating effect that lower fares can have for low-cost airlines elsewhere, but flying to smaller, cheaper airports increases the odds of success, said NewLeaf’s chairman, Ben Baldanza, calling the company “the only ULCC option that I have seen in Canada that makes sense to me.” Baldanza, who was previously chief executive at Spirit, is also a “small investor” in the Canadian startup and serves on the board of Iceland's low-cost carrier WOW Air. NewLeaf eschews Canada’s primary, higher-cost airports such as Toronto Pearson and Vancouver International, just as Allegiant Travel Co. avoids larger U.S. airports. In Canada, secondary airport fees are generally far lower than those at major airports, which is why a low-cost airline such as NewLeaf prefers such towns as Hamilton over Toronto or Abbotsford instead of Vancouver, Baldanza said. Price is the prime selling point in the ULCC model: Fares begin at less than $40, and in many cases much less than $40. In China, for example, Spring Airlines sells tickets for as little as 99 yuan ($14.82). The U.S. has three such carriers—Spirit, Allegiant, and Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc.—and all have been expanding voraciously. Because of Canada’s higher costs, fares there won’t be as low as other nations enjoy. But executives at all three of Canada’s fledgling ULCCs say they aim to underprice Air Canada and WestJet by 25 percent to 35 percent. Calgary-based Enerjet is a charter operator that flies oil-and-gas field workers in northern Alberta and does contract work for Air Transat, another Canadian charter carrier. Now it is shifting to the ultra-low-cost model1. Enerjet has been “hunkered down” for more than a year amid the collapse in oil prices and western Canada’s depressed economy, said Darcy Morgan, the company’s chief commercial officer; his brother Tim, a WestJet co-founder, is its CEO. The company leases three Boeing 737-700s and wants to begin a new ULCC tentatively called Flytoo. (It was first called Jet Naked2 for its knack for drawing publicity, but that name was abandoned.) Enerjet is working to raise C$80 million ($61 million) and hopes to begin Flytoo service by year’s end. Source: Boeing A third company, Calgary-based Canada Jetlines Ltd., is trying to raise C$50 million ($38 million) and begin flying from major Canadian cities to U.S. sun destinations, such as Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Los Angeles this year or next. Jetlines has ordered five new Boeing 737 Max aircraft for its future expansion, with options for 16 more. Initially, Jetlines plans to expand to a half dozen 737-700s in its first year and to list shares publicly. The airline plans to offer fares 30 percent cheaper than Air Canada and WestJet but also to avoid direct competition with both, said Jim Scott, Jetlines’ president and chief executive officer. “The passengers that we [will] move are not the passengers that Air Canada and WestJet want, anyway,” Scott said. “The focus in Canada is on the business traveler or the frequent flier. I always say everyone who gets boarded before I get boarded is the [passenger] they’re interested in.” During the winter, all three low-cost airlines will look south to Mexico, the U.S., and the Caribbean, as Canadians seek warmer-weather respites. Southern California and Phoenix are likely to be among the winter U.S. destinations, Scott and Young said. “I think there’s a chance to make more money in the winter than [NewLeaf does] in the summer,” Baldanza said of NewLeaf's focus on smaller cities. “The reality is that people who live in Moncton want to get warm just like people who live in Toronto want to get warm in the winter.” As with nearly any airline startup, financing has been lean for all three companies so far. Scott attributes that to Canada’s conservative investment climate—where preventing losses is paramount, dwarfing a focus on the upside potential, and where realism outweighs the dream of a huge payday. And in a nation with near-duopoly air service, airline upstarts have had a spotty record, as well as some high-profile failures in the last 15 years—including low-cost operator Jetsgo and smaller leisure-oriented carrier Harmony Airways. To help their funding efforts, both Enerjet and Jetlines have asked to be exempted from Canada’s 25 percent cap on foreign investment in airlines, in the hope of selling as much as a 49 percent stake to non-Canadian investors. Those exemption requests are opposed by South Beach Capital Partners, an investment group formed by Manitoba First Nations indigenous peoples that took a financial stake in NewLeaf Travel in June; Canada’s transport minister is expected to decide on the requests later this year. That foreign ownership cap was one of the aspects of Canadian air travel that last year's federal transportation report pointed to, advocating for raising it. “In contrast to larger markets like the U.S., there may not be enough capital in Canada to finance 75 percent of a new national carrier,” said the report, which was overseen by David Emerson, a former Cabinet minister, Vancouver airport executive, and member of Parliament. The report also recommended sweeping changes in airport funding, airport capital spending programs, security, and visa systems. Tim Morgan, the Enerjet CEO, thinks the Canadian market, once properly stimulated with low fares, could support “more than 50” planes flying in the ultralow-cost model—“and maybe even 100, or more than 100,” he said in a telephone interview. “And that’s without affecting the major carriers.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

There is a proposal to launch commercial satellites from international waters just outside Kiribati's Christmas Island EEZ. 46,000 tons of 1980s kerosene and LOX-fueled Russian rockets will crash back into the Pacific with each launch, producing 36 tons of carbon monoxide in the lower troposphere on the way up and a kerosene slick several kilometers wide as about 4.5 tons of kerosene fall unburned on the way down. The Environmental Assessment (EA) is now open for comment. The closing date for comments (by mail) is May 26. A source who gave us this information has the draft EA but says there are huge holes in it. But the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority's Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation who has set a thirty day comment period, ending on May 26, proposes a finding of no significant impact. This means there will be no official impacts investigation - ESI. Briefing notes as follows: It is a U.S./Russian/Ukraine/Norwegian venture. They are using 1980s ZENIT Russian rockets. The launch pad is a modified North Sea oil rig. The service ships are being custom-built by Kvaerner Maritime, a Norwegian company. Sea Launch itself is based in the Cayman Islands, and also has a 15-acre site at Long Beach on the U.S. West Coast. They propose to launch the satellites on top of the Russian rockets from the launch pad. The ships will retire 5 kilometers before any launch. Only the satellite will make it to space. The rest of the rockets will crash back into the ocean. Each rocket is 440 feet long with a 46 thousand ton displacement. They are made of aluminum and graphite epoxy. The draft EIA says historically approximately 3,489 kg and 1,060 kg of kerosene falls unburned in the rocket's fuel tanks. Sea Launch's overhead said the fuels being used are "environmentally friendly." When questioned they said the overhead was wrong. It should say "environmentally friendlier." The rocket is fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene -- more than half of that being kerosene. The draft EIA says approximately 44,700 kg of liquid oxygen (LOX) and 17,000 kg of kerosene would be burned below 2,000m. Approximately 36,100 kg of carbon monoxide (CO) would be produced into the troposphere near sea level. The draft EIA also says the nitrogen produced would cause a "substantial, temporary reduction" of stratospheric ozone. Viola Brady, a Sea Launch legal officer, said "If it weren't for the obvious environmental and safety and other issues we could launch right on the beach (Long Beach)." Marc Nance: "Why are we using the boat rather than renting an island? Launching from sea greatly reduces the close proximity of environmental effects you get on land. In Australia, for example, off Cape York, you get a lot of crocodiles. In the ocean you tend to have less of those life forms." He said that they wanted to launch from the equator, partly because there's less pull from the earth at the equator so it's more efficient, "and it's away from land mass and peoples and away from environmentally sensitive areas." He went on to say "The launch area ecosystem is resilient and relatively low in biological productivity, and far removed from sensitive coastal margins....All the research we've done suggests there are not a lot of higher forms of life there. Fish tend to be in waters that are shallower." He said the Pacific Ocean waters and atmospheric processes would overwhelm the Sea Launch material and heat inputs to the environment. The draft EIA contains no discussion of the possible impacts on life forms like whales, other marine mammals and fish, or birds, any of which could conceivably be in the ocean or flying overhead. The rockets will be traveling through major flight paths for migratory birds. The draft EIA does discuss the effects on plankton of the 4,500 kg of kerosene sprayed out of the fuel tanks as they descend and crash into the ocean. Each launch would result in a kerosene slick several millimeters deep in the center and several square kilometers wide. Overall, the report says, the effect on plankton would be minimal since population densities are at a maximum density at around 30 meters below the surface. It does not consider the noise of the launch would damage life forms in the oceans. This noise would be 150 decibels at 378 meters, and a predicted 75 decibels in the water at the same distance. "Little to no impact to the environment is expected from these levels due to the small number of launches per year and the relative absence of the higher trophic level organisms that would typically suffer injury from a loud sound."

Last June, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted a launch site license to the airport, allowing Ellington to be used as launch site for reusable launch vehicles. Last year, the Houston Airport System spent 6.9 million U.S. dollars to purchase a 53,000-square-foot office building that will house new spaceport tenants. The building, located near NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, had been solely occupied by Boeing until the company relocated part of its operations on July 31. Boeing now operates from a six-story building to serve the aerospace and defense sectors. Now, Houston aerospace officials are turning up the volume on efforts to land new tenants that will help usher in Houston's ascent into all things space. "We are developing infrastructure of the future and we're just getting it started," said Arturo Machuca, general manager of Ellington Airport and Houston Spaceport. "We still have plenty of good challenges in development ahead of us." The spaceport's first aerospace tenant, Intuitive Machines, moved into the mega-office complex on August 11 where it is building unmanned aerial systems, or drones, for commercial use. "It's a great opportunity and experience for us," said Health Mooney, director of production facilities management at Intuitive Machines. "We're the first ones (tenants) here. This is a burgeoning industry and this place will only grow and we want to be a part of it." Spaceport officials are working to include more aerospace entities into the fold. "We have ongoing conversations with other companies, including the Russian engineering company Progresstech," Machuca said. "They want to set up an operations facility that would be used to serve their U.S. based clientele." Houston officials also have letters of intent from Sierra Nevada Corporation, which plans to transport cargo to the International Space Station, and from Catapult Satellite Applications to lease space at the office complex. Houston officials are also in talks with the Japanese Government Space Industry and South Korean airport officials who have expressed interest in partnering. Another potential tenant is California-based SpaceX, which designs, manufacturers and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft, Machuca said. "We haven't had conversations with them (SpaceX) as of yet," he said. "They could come, but not now. Currently they've been taking off from the Kennedy Space Center. Eventually they want to build a launch site in South Texas." Ellington's spaceport will be a hub for a new generation of space planes that will take off horizontally from Ellington, and once over the Gulf of Mexico will ascend into the lower reaches of space. "The possibilities are limited only by our imaginations," said Michael Wagoner, an inspector with the Houston Airport System. "A lot of what we're looking at is the same thing we had with the space shuttle, which is that you can take off from this airport and you can land at this airport. We're open to all possibilities." Bob Mitchell, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, said that development of the Houston Spaceport is moving smoothly. "We're working on a number of agreements that work perfectly into the commercial space model we're trying to create," he said. "We have three confidential projects that are close to decision, and if we land even one of them we are on our way to achieve our goal. It will drive the future innovation and technology for this region and for America."

Ellington's spaceport will be a hub for a new generation of space planes that will take off horizontally from Ellington, and once over the Gulf of Mexico will ascend into the lower reaches of space. "The possibilities are limited only by our imaginations," said Michael Wagoner, an inspector with the Houston Airport System. "A lot of what we're looking at is the same thing we had with the space shuttle, which is that you can take off from this airport and you can land at this airport. We're open to all possibilities." Bob Mitchell, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, said that development of the Houston Spaceport is moving smoothly. "We're working on a number of agreements that work perfectly into the commercial space model we're trying to create," he said. "We have three confidential projects that are close to decision, and if we land even one of them we are on our way to achieve our goal. It will drive the future innovation and technology for this region and for America."

From Thursday, bigger aircraft like Airbus-320 and Boeing-747 can take off and land from the extended runway at Jaipur airport. Senior officers of Airport Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur, on Monday said that after the completion of runway extension from 9,174 feet to 11,500 feet, the Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA) too has commissioned the new runway. "From Thursday morning, our new runway would be operational. I hope various operators will now come to Jaipur to start a direct flight to international destinations," said B K Tailang, director, AAI, Jaipur on Monday. Tailang has also left for China where he is going to meet international airline operators to pursue them to bring flights to Jaipur. "I will tell them about international facilities in Jaipur," Tailang added. The runway extension and CAT-IIIB light work was already over and now Jaipur airport is geared up for the landing of bigger aircraft. "Earlier, our runway's length was 9,174 feet which was not sufficient for the landing of big aircraft like Boeing 747 and Airbus 320," said an officer. Though, Jaipur airport was given the international status in 2006 and was equipped with a new terminal building and traffic control, it failed to function fully as an international airport as the runway's length was not 11,500 feet, as required. Initially, the airlines flying to destinations, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai would be allowed to take the extended runway to replace their aircraft with the bigger aircraft and October 2 onwards Jaipur would be directly connected to Singapore. "Scoot airlines has already got permission to fly from Singapore to Jaipur and Jaipur to Singapore from October 2. By the end of December, we hope to have direct flight from Jaipur to other international destinations like Bangkok and Malaysia," said an officer. When asked about the countries which are likely to get connected to Jaipur after the completion of whole work, a senior officer said, "We are looking at Kuala Lumpur-Bangkok-Thailand sector and then there would also be increase in flights to the Gulf countries including Muscat and Oman. It will also bring more flights from UAE." He added, "At a later stage, Jaipur would directly be connected with European countries as well."

Photo / AP New Zealand-born company LanzaTech has made an aviation biofuel breakthrough with partner airline Virgin Atlantic. The company has produced nearly 5700 litres of low-carbon ethanol produced from waste gases for the airline, founded by Sir Richard Branson. The company was founded in New Zealand 11 years ago and the parent company remains New Zealand-registered while its headquarters have moved to Illinois. LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic say they will work with Boeing and others in the aviation industry to complete the additional testing that aircraft and engine manufacturers require before approving the fuel for first use in a commercial aircraft. "Assuming all initial approvals are achieved, the innovative LanzaTech jet fuel could be used in a first of its kind proving flight in 2017," LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic say. The two companies have been working together since 2011. The Lanzanol fuel was produced in China at the RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified Shougang demonstration facility. The alcohol-to-jet process was developed in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab with support from the US Department of Energy and with the help of funding from HSBC. Sir Richard Branson said: "This is a real game changer for aviation and could significantly reduce the industry's reliance on oil within our lifetime." In 2008 Virgin Atlantic was the first commercial airline to flight test bio-fuel flight - derived from coconut and babassu oil. Continued below.

The airline's understanding of low carbon fuels had developed rapidly over the last decade. The company, which has received more than $14 million in New Zealand Government funding, shifted much of its previously Auckland-based research and development workforce to Chicago in 2014. LanzaTech has raised more than US$200m from investors including Silicon Valley-based Khosla Ventures and the NZ Superannuation Fund, which has invested US$75m. Other investors included Sir Stephen Tindall's K1W1 fund and Mitsui. Its technology is based around steel production, which produces waste carbon monoxide (CO) gas, frequently flared to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The process involves capturing carbon from the waste gas via fermentation to ethanol, which is recovered to produce ethanol feedstock for a variety of products, including aviation fuel. Other airlines have trialled biofuel made from waste cooking oil, and in the case of Air New Zealand the Jatropha plant. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Life Buy/Sell The Platform Close Post-Dispatch Corn growing in greenhouse at Chesterfield campus of Monsanto Co. on Dec. 1, 2015 (Post-Dispatch) Editorial: Monsanto's transition from old economy to new economy to German economy By the Editorial Board Sep 14, 2016 (…) Post-Dispatch Corn growing in greenhouse at Chesterfield campus of Monsanto Co. on Dec. 1, 2015 (Post-Dispatch) The proposed $66 billion purchase of Monsanto Co. by Germany’s Bayer AG announced Wednesday surely has profound national and international implications, some heartening, some troubling. Locally, the news, while not unexpected, still comes as a blow. Yes, Bayer has announced that, pending regulatory approval, the combined company’s agricultural headquarters for seed and “traits” (the characteristics imparted by biotechnology), as well as its North American commercial operations, will remain in St. Louis. But another Fortune 500 headquarters will be gone, along with whatever bragging rights are attached to that. St. Louis didn’t do anything wrong — global economic trends and federal policy decisions drove the decision — and most jobs are created by small businesses, anyway. But we didn’t do anything to lose two NFL teams, either. The insult to civic self-esteem still stings. We adjusted to McDonnell Douglas being swallowed by Boeing and Anheuser-Busch being swallowed by InBev and Ralston Purina being swallowed by Nestle. The key for the St. Louis economy is to constantly reinvent itself, and there, Monsanto’s history can be instructive. Monsanto traces it roots to a saccharin company founded by John F. Queeny in 1901. His son, Edgar Queeny, gave the company his wife’s family name and took it into drugs, fertilizers and detergents. As other industries did, he built a company town across the Mississippi River, the better to make its own rules. Monsanto, Ill., was later named Sauget, and St. Louisans of a certain age can still remember the odors from the Monsanto plant. It made polychlorinated biphenyls and dumped the PCB sludge into the aptly named Dead Creek. It became one of dozens of Monsanto Superfund sites. Monsanto reinvented itself after World War II as an agricultural pesticide company and in the 1960s turned its focus to pesticides. Having invented effective weedkillers in the old economy, it became a new-economy firm engineering seeds for plants that could resist its herbicides. In 2002, Monsanto spun off its pharmaceutical and chemical business and reinvented itself as an agriculture seed and crop chemical company. In this incarnation it helped feed the world and created a measure of prosperity for millions of developing-world farmers. It also became a global villain for aggressively protecting its patents and for those suspicious of genetically modified crops. By helping farmers get bigger yields, it helped create a commodity glut that cut into its profits. Global agricultural and seed companies decided to take the uncertainty out of their business by combining. The Monsanto-Bayer combine, in the works since May, will leave but three competitors where, five years ago, there were six. Federal regulators must decide whether this leaves farmers, and eventually consumers, with reasonable prices. Like it or not, such is the way of the world. Smart companies adapt. So do smart cities.

You know policy on the environment I don't know I don't really know where it stands is again I don't know who's has been inaccuracies and much. All right so an environmental engineer would like more conversation about the environment and global warming. It was wonderful to me which classy and it often a history of rock girl how much I liked it got the united. That sounds pretty and thank you some it's a case necks that read out. Tell me your name and and much last name is you have that means violently you have a political hat on. But the story for Christmas. It's from Jersey it does things by not users isn't. It as a human rights. And what year you are you planning on voting I am here linguistics its major. Millennium. For him. Come. Decided the angels'. Gary. Time. Ills and the Green Party and yes. In just a wonderful what he's going to be out. Rates. Oh and that one seat I think wheels kind of weeded Fannie what is the first thing the next president should do after taking office what would be your first priority. Comic there so many things okay come I think. I say it like an issue that's really central to me right now health care. And reforming not just so everyone can like really get access health care is there some people in this country that just. Can't get the things that they need to do. Make themselves healthy and make themselves mentally stable in this country whether. Whether you that's up from like that gun rights standpoint or whether approach that from. Trans rights stuff like that. Up to you buy health care is. Okay when we first when he first got you said so many things health care about your second meeting day to. TT. I think. A lot of candidates haven't really addressed very well. Racial climate in this country and I'd think. That needs to be addressed as well. Wonderful thank you so much for stopping by really thoughtful. I am in no way it surprised we have had such awful responses all across Ohio and again here. On campus at deal highest it's a date is next even waiting. Step right up we really hate when I tell me who you are. Brendan weary frown a suburb about fifteen minutes OK your local and what you're you might I am voting. Every times a year for me there's this. Wonderful out. Would you spend. I got a big hefty spent. That's. Boeing had plenty like this Moneyline it's like okay. Yeah I think wheels like but. I just fine what's one thing you dislike most about the candidates what really funny and night party now. I'm between Clinton and Johnson because I'm mostly. I Dennis strong okay ankles to keep them away anymore so they get somebody else. Well tell what's one thing that you just like Canadian got Hillary Clinton makes you have pods she seems. They should be very intervention lists him only about under the cover internationalist and do a lot of things most likely a Middle East disaster there's a lot of oil internal. Turmoil. And just generally. Going there do more things raiders. Overthrowing. Dictatorship possibly other government but and setting up our own the kind of serves our own means of letting them actually develop their own and one networks heard their culture and the way. They have of thinking because it is significantly different from ours as far as I can tell not necessarily wrong but. Not saying because it has the world can always be a saint. So you're worried about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy sounds like. Now I'm hours. About things don't cover up and I think that foreign policies would be one of the bigger things you would cover up just because I feel a rarity have a problem with Powell involved we are just what everybody else's affairs specifically militarily. So interesting to Aspin and again that catching the question. Just stop it we'll get a random national other Atlantic do you think the two parties needed change after this election you are considering voting for Gary not so in what way. I think they need to have some limit on how much money they receive so they changed from a fund raising machine to something acts as a political interest of their voters' minds. Because. I think that's a good a lot of light. Dehumanized. And candidates is because they all have to have this massive amounts of money to even run for president. Or any other this happens. And that concerned him yeah right that's out this way Gary Johnson seems so human and so normal because of saying deep debts grass roots he doesn't have like. The biggest of multibillion dollar companies backing him and shoving money down this through until he does what they want them to you. And this and wonderful well thank you so much a ticket had attacked. OK good next up I had. Primary Dallas has the meet and thank you but it did indeed Villa ended yet you've had your flag and yes politician and make no I'm not work at the Ohio Statehouse Thompson page.

Lifkin Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 5:11 pm | י"א אלול תשע"ו The coach-class cabin of a A Boeing 787 Dreamliner. YERUSHALAYIM - El Al’s plans for a billion-dollar fleet of Dreamliners are coming to fruition as a deal was closed for procurement of two of the 787-8 planes from Boeing, Globes reported. Proclaimed by CEO David Maimon as “the largest procurement plan in El Al history,” it calls for the purchase of 16 787-7 and 787-9 Dreamliner planes, motors and spare parts in an agreement valued at $1.025 billion. On Monday, El Al confirmed signing a sale and leaseback agreement with an undisclosed foreign company for two of the 787-8’s. Like other carriers, El Al has benefited from the worldwide slump in oil prices. Last month, it reported for the first half of 2016 a net profit of almost $14 million, after making a profit of slightly more than $1 million in the corresponding half of 2015. Its semi-annual revenue remained stable, at $934 million. Accordingly, El Al share prices have increased 125 percent in the last year, reflecting a market cap of NIS 1.7 billion. In the past three years, El Al shares had the second highest return on the stock exchange (second only to electric appliance importer Tadiran Appliances), surging by 740 percent.

(Source: Samsung/CNN) COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - Samsung Electronics still scrambling today to come up with short and long-term solutions to its exploding battery problem. The company's stock price and reputation have taken a hit after reports of explosions and fires from the batteries in its new Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. A researcher at the University of South Carolina says the battery issue is partly due to faulty manufacturing and not confined to that particular phone. The Samsung Note 7 is getting a lot of attention right now, but the basic problem with the battery in that phone has turned up in many other devices and forms. You might remember not long ago when the hot consumer item was the hoverboard. Wen people began buying and using them by the thousands, some of those hoverboards were hot in another way. They had a tendency to catch on fire. We've also seen similar issues with laptop batteries and even batteries on Boeing's 757 Dreamliner aircraft, which is partially built in North Charleston. The common thread here is lithium-ion batteries -- a technology that allows a lot of energy to be squeezed into a very small package, but with that sometimes come increased risks. "We know how to make them so they don't explode but, of course, there's a lot of manufacturers that cut corners and don't have the tolerances that they should have," USC professor John Weidner said. "So yeah, unfortunately, we will probably continue to happen. But it's not, I don't think that's an indictment on the technology. We can make safe lithium-ion batteries." Samsung has recalled its Note 7 phones and also has begun offering a software update that will limit to 60 percent the amount that a battery in one of their phones can be charged. But experts say the explosions and fires are likely to crop up in other devices as the use of the lithium-ion battery continues to become more common in all kinds of electronic devices. The New York Times says, meanwhile, the FAA has been tracking battery related problems in aircraft and the paper says one estimate suggests a plane carrying 100 passengers could also have more than 500 lithium-ion batteries on board -- a problem that could continue to pose risks for air travel.  Copyright 2016 WIS.

US dignitaries included Ambassador Patrick Gaspard and US Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, Heidi Grant, among others. The delegation represented almost 30 key industry players, including Lockheed Martin, Honeywell and the State of Maryland, one of 50 that make up the United States. The state is home to many historic places and institutions, including the US Naval College in the state capital, Annapolis. The US Air Force (USAF) has brought the C-17 Globemaster III, the latest model C-130J Hercules medium transport and the KC-135 Stratotanker air-to-air refueller and the MQ-9 Reaper UAV. Ambassador Gaspard said: “I have to say that, though we are advancing the impressive wares that US companies have come with, this also presents a remarkable opportunity to sow the seeds of growth here in Africa as well, I want to remind everyone that this trade runs to both sides of the Atlantic. It’s absolutely remarkable that American companies like Boeing are able to partner with South African firms like Thompsons to create opportunity in this growing manufacturing sector and it is also remarkable that South African companies like Aerosud that are based here in Pretoria are growing industry, transforming the next generation of industry leaders.” Paul Ausley, CEO of Terraview 360, a UAV manufacturer, said: “To us, Africa is a huge opportunity and without Maryland’s help we would never get exposure to it.” READ MORE Paramount Advanced Technologies unveils tethered UAV First African Unity Pavilion for AAD Reutech out in force at AAD aad Jessica Reynolds, Regional Manager for the state’s investment and trade, said of her small state: “Not only are we close to Washington D.C. and have 20-plus federal facilities but we also are top in terms of federal funding so that attracts a lot of the top talent, in all industries but particularly in defence so research and development is really one of the top areas.” The delegation spoke of their potential target markets. Reynolds said: “So of course South Africa’s very high up there especially in terms of aerospace and defence just because of the capabilities in the country. Broadly – not necessarily industry specific – Nigeria is also a top focus for Maryland because we have a pretty strong Nigerian population and other countries of interest would be in East Africa would be Ethiopia, Kenya.” Tom Jarboe, also of Ausley Unmanned Aviation, added: “In our county in southern Maryland we have about 300 defence contractors…We’re trying to take what we do extremely well and also expand it into a global presence in defence but also look at how to migrate the technology into commercial applications too.” Some of the companies at the US International Pavilion, organised by Kallman Worldwide Inc, include Harris, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin and Rockwell Collins. ....

The energy sector did its best to drag the rest of the market down with it, but the tech and utilities sectors resisted. The blue chips have dipped below the break-even line as Apple’s gains were not enough to offset weakness at IBM and Boeing, two more heavyweights in the price-weighted DJIA. WTI crude oil for October delivery settled at $43.58 a barrel, down 2.9% for the day following a small drop in U.S. inventories. December gold closed up 0.2% on the day to settle at $1,326.10. Equities were headed for a mixed close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down by 0.21% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down by 0.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up by 0.35%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Wednesday was American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) which traded down 1.34% at $63.50. The stock’s 52-week range is $50.27 to $78.40. Volume was about 20% below the daily average of around 4.5 million shares. The company had no specific news, but continues to trail off on lack of faith that the Fed will raise interest rates next week. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) traded down 1.23% at $153.90. The stock’s 52-week range is $116.90 to $164.95. Volume was about 15% below the daily average of around 3.4 million shares. The company had no specific news Wednesday. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) traded down 1.18% at $98.26. The stock’s 52-week range is $75.10 to $107.58. Trading volume was about equal to the daily average of around 6.4 million. Falling oil prices hurt Chevron again Wednesday. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) traded down 1.00% at $127.47. The stock’s 52-week range is $102.10 to $150.59. Volume was about 15% below the daily average of around 3.6 million shares. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said that production of the 777 may be cut below the already planned cut from 8.3 a month to 7 per month. This could have a significant impact on cash flow, and has been a concern for months. Of the 30 Dow index stocks 8 are on track to close higher Wednesday and 22 are set to close lower.

Sep 15, 2016 Jen Deglmann | Inside MRO EMAIL Tweet Comments 2 Advertisement On Aug. 4, my friend boarded United Airlines Flight 1864 and sent this video to a few people. At 6 a.m. in Minneapolis, the temperature was 78F, with a dew point of 70F. The fog or mist created inside the cabin is produced from the cooler air and dew point inside equalizing with the extreme humidity outside. According to Boeing's article "Controlling Nuisance Moisture in Commercial Airplanes," published in the manufacturer's January 1999 Aero magazine, high seating density, load factors and aircraft utilization rates can cause increased cabin humidity and therefore greater condensation rates.   Will it damage the aircraft? The short answer is "yes and no." Stefan Jacob, sales director of aviation for Mankiewicz, says interiors coatings and undercoat combinations are tested for moisture buildup of any kind: "The results of these tests . . . show that the painted surfaces enduringly fulfill the qualitative demands defined in the specifications, and undercoats/substrates will be sustainably protected." These demands include fire, water and even disease control protection. Coatings, such as the Alexit-FST from Mankiewicz, provide more benefits to surfaces than meets the eye. However, moisture buildup is potentially hazardous for the interior wall of the aircraft if it is not addressed correctly. Stephen Clark, director of marketing and technology for Immaculate Flight, says, "the danger is not to fixtures such as seats and walls, but rather to internal components behind wall panels. This includes electrical fixtures, insulation blankets (like insulation in your home) and wiring." Moisture buildup also can be caused by frost or accumulation of passenger respiration. When the moisture drips down the cabin walls or even on passengers, it is important that the water is addressed quickly. Moving forward, moisture-control systems such as insulation blankets and improved airflow systems can minimize the amount of unwanted moisture in the cabin. Updated: reader Kevin Pinkerman sent this video from his flight on Virgin America 219 from Austin to San Francisco on Aug 19. Pinkerman says the heavy humidity that day came from the same storm system that caused the catastrophic flooding in Louisiana. The humidity was 97% at 7 a.m. that morning. Have a video or picture of your own flight anomaly? Email me your experience, and we can take a look at how something simple might greatly affect an aircraft.     Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 2 Phantaslube on Sep 15, 2016 I wonder what would happen if you checked that "fog" for TCP (organophosphate)?

By SueChang Markets reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 closed in negative territory Wednesday in the wake of slumping crude-oil prices, erasing earlier gains for the major benchmarks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq bucked the losing trend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.22% slid 31.98 points, or 0.2%, to close at 18,034.77 even as Apple AAPL, +0.03%  climbed 3.6% as analysts at RBC Capital Markets outlined five reasons the tech giant is still a buy. However, the tech giant’s gains were overshadowed by big declines in International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.20%  and Boeing Co. BA, +0.45% The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.27% fell 1.25 points to end at 2,125.77, weighed by a 1.2% drop in the energy sector. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.31% advanced 18.52 points, or 0.4%, to close at 5,173.77. A rebound in Treasury prices had earlier buoyed the market, according to Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. “The stable bond market gave investors some comfort, encouraging them to buy some of the dip,” he said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.02%  slid 4.3 basis points to 1.691% after touching its highest level since June 23 on Tuesday. But as crude oil’s decline accelerated, stocks failed to capitalize on their gains. A report on oil supplies published by the Energy Information Administration showed inventories declined by 600,000 barrels last week, much smaller than the 14.5 million barrel drop from the week before. Oil prices briefly spiked after the report, but have since turned lower as analysts concluded that the sector is still bogged down by excess inventory. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery US:CLV6 settled at a two-week low. All three stock-index gauges on Tuesday suffered big losses on a sharp slump in energy prices and rate increase fears. “There is not a strong driver or a data point for investors to trade on and there is a lack of a conviction in the market,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve, who expects the market to remain choppy going into the Federal Reserve meeting on Sept. 20-21. The overall narrative, in his opinion, hasn't really changed significantly over the past several months, with investors still preoccupied with central bank policies, global growth and corporate earnings. Read: Is this the real culprit behind the stock and bond selloff? “September is probably an easier time for the Fed to raise rates than December, but it really does not matter. Markets by now know that there will be a rate hike in the next six months,” said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. Trump unveils plan to make child care cheaper(1:36) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed new subsidies for child care in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening, hoping to reach out to women and suburban swing voters. The CME FedWatch Tool is showing a 15% probability of a rate increase next week. Goldman Sachs on Monday cut its September hike odds to 25% from 40% following dovish comments from Fed Gov. Lael Brainard. “It seems to be all about the Fed and other central banks. Ironically, I think the market will rally when [the rate hike] happens,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners. “The market, like you and me, would rather go out in the rain rather than when it’s not sure if it’s going to precipitate.” The economic calendar was relatively thin on Wednesday. Market reaction to the August import-price index was muted. Import prices slipped 0.2% due to lower oil, while export prices dropped 0.8%, driven by a fall in farm crop prices.

Meanwhile, Russian media have gotten ahold of a separate report breaking down the lies and half-truths used by the Bellingcat group to blame Russia for the catastrophe. On July 17, 2014, at the peak of fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and anti-Kiev militia, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, on route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was destroyed, killing all of 298 passengers and crew onboard. Kiev and independence supporters in Ukraine's southeast quickly blamed each other for the catastrophe. Last October, Dutch investigators published a report which said that MH17 appeared to have been shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile system, produced by Russia's Almaz-Antey defense concern. Investigators could not conclusively determine the precise area that the missile was fired from. © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov Dutch Gov't Feared 'Impotence' in Wake of MH17 Crash Could Lead to UnrestAlmaz-Antey went ahead with its own investigation into the crash, finding that the missile which hit the plane could only have been launched from the settlement of Zaroshchenske, Donetsk Region, which was under the control of Ukrainian forces at the time of the incident. Last month, Dutch officials announced that their Joint Investigation Team, working on the criminal investigation into the catastrophe, would release the first results of their investigation on September 28. Headed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor, the investigation is expected to show precisely the kind of weapon that was used, and from where it was fired. On Tuesday, the Novaya Gazeta newspaper published a 31-page leaked document, signed by Almaz-Antei representative Mikhail Malyshevsky. The paper suggested that the report's conclusions may very well serve as the basis for Russia's possible response to the Dutch investigation; the document, prepared on the basis of an investigation by specialists from Almaz-Antei, breaks down in great detail the erroneous and sometimes outright falsified evidence presented by Bellingcat, a group of Western journalists heavily engaged in investigating the plane's destruction. The downing of Flight MH17 has turned into one of the organization's main pet projects, and according to Dutch media, Bellingcat's work is being actively considered by Dutch investigators for their investigation. Despite Russian investigators' thorough efforts to counter Bellingcat's claims in the past, the group has continued to persist in suggesting that anti-Kiev militia, and indirectly, Russia, were responsible for the downing of the Malaysian Boeing. As a result, Russian experts have been forced to go through great lengths to refute the misinformation presented by Bellingcat.  © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov Russia Regrets US, Ukraine’s Failure to Share MH17 Investigation DetailsAmong its most recent claims is footage from a car video recorder, said to have been shot on July 17, 2014, ostensibly showing a rebel-controlled Buk moving toward what Bellingcat's account says was the likely launch site of the missile that downed MH17. In reality, this video could not have been shot any later than July 15, 2014, since the road the DVR-equipped car was traveling on was damaged by a rebel motor column including heavy tracked vehicles on that day. Another of Bellingcat's charges revolves around a satellite image showing a white transport truck carrying the rebel Buk allegedly used to shoot down the MH17 on its trailer. But that image was proven to be a fake, given that three of the vehicles Bellingcat claims were part of the Buk convoy are actually pictured going in the opposite direction along the highway depicted. Moreover, the shadow given off by the truck and its cargo is not characteristic of the Buk's distinctive shape, and is facing in the wrong direction relative to the time of day the shot was said to have been taken (11:08 AM on July 17, 2014). Next, Russian experts dissected the claim made by Bellingcat regarding a photograph purporting to show launch smoke coming from the Buk missile in an area near the alleged launch site on July 17. According experts, this photo was either digitally altered or taken at another date, since other photo and video evidence from July 17 have confirmed that the weather in the area was cloudy, not clear, as claimed by Bellingcat. Maksim Blinov MH17 Crash Probe Initial Results to Be Unveiled September 28Another Bellingcat claim revolves around the suggestion that a missile defense space-based infrared system (SBIRS) successfully pinpointed the launch site. In fact, detecting a Buk launch using SBIRS system is virtually possible, given that detecting and determining a fired ballistic missile's trajectory requires more time than the Buk would be expected to fly. As to the crucial Bellingcat claim – that MH17 was hit by a single Buk SAM in the hands of the Donbass militia, the report reiterated that this is a practical impossibility, since the detection range of a single Buk is limited to 120 degrees in azimuth and 7 degrees in elevation, and its effectiveness of fire is limited. A single Buk system can guard only a pre-assigned airspace sector with knowledge of its potential targets' parameters, up to and including enemy flight time (that is, to wait in 'ambush' mode). Independently and without this information, normally provided by support systems elsewhere in the military command, a single Buk is not capable of precisely locating and then hitting its target. The detailed, technical and expert-oriented 31 page report leaked by Novaya Gazeta also revealed that Almaz-Antei took the unprecedented step of providing Dutch investigators with the genuine specifications of the Buk system. This, the report suggested, was meant to preclude the use of erroneous or otherwise inaccurate data which investigators obtained from various sources, including publically available materials. "The use of such materials inevitably led to erroneous results and conclusions. Precisely in order to avoid these mistakes, the decision was made to transfer the real technical characteristics of the Buk missile to the Dutch Safety Board," the report explained. As for Bellingcat, the report saved a special criticism for them regarding the variant of the Buk missile used to shoot down MH17, suggesting that the group does not have and cannot know the precise technical characteristics and technical documentation which would enable them to make an accurate distinction between the variants of the 9M38 missile. As for Almaz-Antei, their report from October 2015 not only included this information, but even showed the results of two full-scale experiments to recreate the crash, conclusively demonstrating that the Malaysia Airlines Boeing was downed by an old Buk model fired from Ukrainian territory. ...

Reply RedBanner 00:01 15.09.2016 | 0 | Edit | Delete All available evidence points to Kiev. At some point I remember reading the testimony of a man who worked on a military airbase, about a Ukrainian fighter jet pilot who went out with missiles loaded on his aircraft, and after returning to the base he didn't have his missiles anymore (so they were fired). The witness claims hearing him saying that he had shot down an aircraft (the Donbass militia never had aircraft, as far as I know, so it couldn't have been a rebel fighter) that, according to his words "was at the wrong place at the wrong time"... So maybe the Buk theory is all wrong from start! I wonder why this theory has never been fully investigated!

She said the full details of the investment will be disclosed soon after fulfilling certain conditions.   "What we can be revealed is that the investors are promoters of new commercial aircraft," she said.   “The investor is coming in at a time when the African aerospace market has been dominated by Airbus and Boeing, with only limited competition in the regional jet market from Bombardier and Embraer." READ: Transformation key to grow SA aviation - Skywise In her view, aligning with an airline like Skywise would provide a good marketing window for the aircraft promoters to tap into the growing and vast African market. "With the right-sized aircraft balanced with sound top level management, Skywise and other African carriers would be able to offer a better combination of capacity and frequency in core, as well as, low-to-mid-density markets," said Qadir. "Rapidly evolving aviation product offerings and growth in emerging markets are broadening the geographical balance of airplane demand for which entering the commercial space will have to be done with crucial knowledge transfer and test programmes together with Skywise Airlines." READ: Acsa hits back at Skywise allegations She said Skywise is appointing a new management team as both she and her co-chair Javed Malik are stepping down. “As aviators we ought to take much more challenging roles in the industry,” the co-chairs said in a statement. Malik is considering an offer as CEO at an African carrier, while Qadir said she is now at Pakistan International Airlines. As chief customer experience officer she is heading up the airline's recently launched premier service. Airports Company SA (Acsa) suspended Skywise's flights on December 2 2015 due to unpaid airport charges for landing, take off, parking of aircraft and related service charges. At that time Skywise had already appealed to President Jacob Zuma, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters, Acsa and South African Airways for assistance. It also sought investors. In April this year Skywise said six companies had expressed interest in a sizeable acquisition in Skywise. Of the six, four were foreign-based, while two were from South Africa, Skywise said at the time. Skywise brand ambassador at the time, Ndileka Mandela, a granddaughter of Nelson Mandela, also expressed the wish that the authorities would resolve the issue of the grounding of Skywise flights. Acsa has maintained all along that its decisions regarding Skywise were taken in its own best commercial interests, and to ensure the sustainability of the aviation industry.

The plan will cover a decade’s worth of aid, beginning in fiscal year 2019. The memorandum of understanding between the U.S. and Israel will be made public today during a signing ceremony in the State Department’s Treaty Room. Story Continued Below Reuters reports that the $38 billion deal “also involves major concessions granted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to officials on both sides. Those include Israel’s agreement not to seek additional funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually in the new package and also to phase out a special arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend part of its U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons, the officials said.” — CAN THE AGREEMENT BUY OBAMA THE LOVE OF HIS PRO-ISRAEL CRITICS? Not a chance, write our colleagues Nahal Toosi and Bryan Bender: “Some hawkish U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy commentators are raising questions about aspects of the deal, especially reports that it limits Israel's ability to lobby for more aid from Congress. They also insist Obama's Middle East policies, including his embrace of a nuclear deal with Iran, have endangered Israel enough that in the long run the larger aid package may not make a difference. “Conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin, for one, called the deal ‘one more kick in the shins to Israel.’ Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who pointedly notes that Congress didn't play a role in crafting the agreement, has suggested he wants to appropriate even more aid to Israel. Others, too, say that with the future uncertain in an increasingly chaotic Middle East, the agreement should be seen more as a guideline than anything binding.” WAR REPORT — SO FAR, SYRIAN CEASE-FIRE STILL HOLDING, reports The Wall Street Journal: “Syria’s cease-fire appeared to take firmer hold on its first full day Tuesday, with the main opposition monitoring group reporting calm in major provinces. The truce sponsored by the U.S. and Russia went into effect Monday evening, but there were accusations of violations by both rebels and the regime just a few hours into it. Both sides traded more such accusations on Tuesday, but the battlefields were noticeably quieter, according to residents and activists on the ground.” — SYRIAN ACCORD WIDENS THE RIFT BETWEEN KERRY AND THE PENTAGON, reports The New York Times: “The agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry announced with Russia to reduce the killing in Syria has widened an increasingly public divide between Mr. Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, who has deep reservations about the plan for American and Russian forces to jointly target terrorist groups. “Mr. Carter was among the administration officials who pushed against the agreement on a conference call with the White House last week as Mr. Kerry, joining the argument from a secure facility in Geneva, grew increasingly frustrated. Although President Obama ultimately approved the effort after hours of debate, Pentagon officials remain unconvinced.” — WHAT ARE THE DEAL’S DETAILS? “The new Syria cease-fire is rich in detail on the mechanics of ending violence in Aleppo. It says little about how the United States and Russia will establish a new military partnership that is seen as key to the long-term sustainability of the deal,” The Associated Press reports.

HAPPENING TODAY — JUSTICE’S NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION AT 10: Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough speak at a daylong conference on the Justice Department’s National Security Division. This month is the 10-year anniversary of the division, which was created after the 9/11 attacks to integrate law enforcement, intelligence and other tools in the national security fight. The full schedule for the conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies is here. ALSO TODAY — CARTER RETURNS TO AUSTIN: The defense secretary visits Austin, Texas, where he’ll stop at the Capitol Factory, a tech incubator he also went to earlier this year. There, he’s expected to “provide an update” on the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, his tech outreach initiative with offices in Silicon Valley and Boston. And he’s hinted he’ll be announcing the third outpost in Austin today. “Stay tuned, you’ll see us doing more — in fact, very soon — in this same area,” Carter said Tuesday at the TechCrunch Disrupt SF conference while discussing opening the Boston office. — SOPKO TALKS AFGHANISTAN CORRUPTION: The special inspector general for Afghanistan, John Sopko, speaks today at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on his office’s first “lessons learned” report titled “Corruption in Conflict: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan.” The House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee holds a hearing on next-generation air space control. And the Senate Aerospace Caucus has a reception on Capitol Hill this evening with Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Defense Security Cooperation Agency Director Vice Adm. Joseph Rixey and Aerospace Industries Association CEO David Melcher. IN A BUDGET FIGHT, THE SENATE SQUEEZES THE HOUSE, our colleague Ben Weyl reports on the latest as Congress works to keep the government running past Sept. 30: “As the Senate grinds toward a bipartisan deal to keep the government open, House Republicans are increasingly resigned to accepting whatever the upper chamber decides to send their way. "The growing fatalism comes as the Senate is on track to pass legislation in the coming days to fund the government through early December — amid chatter that senators could soon leave town for a lengthy recess, effectively forcing the House to either pass the Senate bill or allow a government shutdown weeks before the presidential election.” ** A message from the Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition: Help Save Taxpayers Up To $500 Million: Buying materials in advance for the construction of the next two new U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will save taxpayers up to $500 million over the course of their construction and will keep the industrial base strong.

Currently, Adm. Michael Rogers serves in a "dual-hat" role as the head of both agencies. "I do not believe rushing to separate the dual hat in the final months of an administration is appropriate given the very serious challenges we face in cyberspace and the failure of this administration to develop an effective deterrence policy,” he said Tuesday. NBC News reported last week that Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have endorsed a plan to eliminate the dual-hat leadership position. Asked about the split on Tuesday, Carter said no decisions have yet been made, while explaining the arrangement, “has worked very well, but it’s not necessarily the right approach to those missions overall in the long run.” Our colleague Martin Matishak has more on the dispute here, for Pros. PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT REJECTS JOINT PATROLS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, the AP reports on the latest incident that could rankle U.S.-Philippine relations: “Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday he won't allow government forces to conduct joint patrols of disputed waters near the South China Sea with foreign powers, apparently scrapping a deal his predecessor reached with the U.S. military earlier this year. Duterte also said he was considering acquiring defense equipment from Russia and China. The Philippines has traditionally leaned on the U.S., its longtime treaty ally, and other Western allies for its security needs.” INDUSTRY INTEL — BOEING UNVEILS ITS T-X TRAINER OFFERING: Boeing on Tuesday unveiled its offering for the new Air Force two-seat T-X trainer jet program, announcing it has already made two production-level aircrafts instead of the expected prototype. The world's largest aerospace company is paired with Swedish firm Saab on the jet, with an engine made by General Electric. Boeing, who touted the plane in a flashy event in St. Louis, hopes the design will replace the Air Force's T-38 jets, made by Northrop Grumman and used to train pilots to fly fighter jets. Among the features revealed in the Boeing-Saab design is "one engine, twin tails, stadium seating and an advanced cockpit with embedded training," according to the company statement. The T-X program is considered one of just a few large-scale Air Force procurement efforts in the foreseeable future and a big priority for many defense companies. The service plans to buy 350 new trainers, with a final solicitation set to be released by December.

EPA/ATSB/ HANDOUT EDITORIAL USE ONLY Menéame Newly discovered debris potentially from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people onboard, may be the first piece of evidence supporting the theory that there was a fire onboard the plane, according to Australian media reports. Five pieces of debris were handed to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in Canberra on Monday morning by American amateur sleuth Blaine Gibson, ABC broadcaster reported. Gibson, who has previously brought 13 of the 27 suspected and confirmed pieces of wreckage from the flight to MH370 investigators, said two of the pieces were burned and singe marks on them. "If those are found to be from Malaysia 370 and if it is discovered that the fire took place before the crash, then this is a real game changer that could help identify what was the cause of the plane's demise," he told ABC. The debris, which was found on the coast of island nation Madagascar, located off the southeast coast of Africa and where the majority of the suspected debris had already been discovered. The pieces resemble some of the paneling used in Boeing 777 planes and have the honeycomb pattern of Boeing's composite materials, and the burn marks could support the theory that the plane was downed by a fire. Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with available data indicating that the plane flew into the sea in the southern Indian Ocean. More than 110,000 square kilometers of the seafloor have been searched so far. Content providers. Contact EFE.

Samsung Electronics Co., under pressure from consumers for longer-lasting batteries that charge faster, pushed the limits of lithium-ion technology. The effort backfired when some of its new Note 7 handsets caught fire and exploded. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Photographer: Jannis Mattar/EPA Building a better battery has long bedeviled the tech industry. Smartphones are constantly improving, with sharper displays, improved software and cameras rivaling those used by the pros. Not so the batteries, which despite advances still die faster than consumers like and take too long to recharge. “It’s the race to add new capabilities and features to the phone that demands a more capable battery,” said Martin Reynolds, a Gartner analyst. On top of the demands placed on their performance, batteries are getting slimmer and smaller, as smartphone makers try to win over consumers with thinner devices. That’s putting strain on the manufacturing process, and raising the risk of defects that can lead to the kind of malfunctions seen in Samsung’s phones. The Note 7 was supposed to stand out with its stylus, large edge-to-edge display and faster charging technology. Samsung rolled out the device in August, just before Apple Inc. unveiled a new batch of iPhones. It was a opportunity for the Suwon, South Korea-based company to outshine its biggest smartphone rival. Instead, it backfired. Usually, smartphone makers and wireless providers rigorously test products before they reach customers, although the process is mainly focused on making sure the devices are compatible with wireless networks. Samsung provided carriers with the typical amount of testing time before the launch date, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung first showed prototypes of the Note 7 to carriers in April and testing began in May, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements aren’t public. At least one major Samsung partner is reassessing its testing procedures to catch issues like this in the future, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The South Korean manufacturer is holding multiple meetings each week with major carrier partners to discuss the latest details from its investigation and assist in mitigating the issue, the person said.  Headaches involving the production of lithium-ion batteries aren’t unique to the smartphone industry. Overheating battery packs made by Sony Corp. led to the recall of millions of laptops made by Dell Inc., Toshiba Corp. and others in 2006, while Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner suffered from electrical fires after the airplane’s 2011 debut. For an explanation of how batteries work, click here. “Based on our investigation, we learned that there was an isolated issue with the battery cell,” Samsung said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Overheating of the battery cell occurred when the anode-to-cathode came into contact with each other, causing a very rare manufacturing process error.” Head of Samsung Electronics Koh Dong-jin during a press briefing to announce the global recall on Sept. 2. Photographer: Yonhap via EPA Samsung is working to fix the problem. While only about three dozen cases were reported, the company is seeking to replace 2.5 million Note 7 phones, an endeavor that could cost as much as $2 billion. On Wednesday, Samsung placed advertisements in South Korea’s major newspapers to apologize for the incident. In an effort to prevent any more device explosions, the company is also rolling out a software update on Sept. 20 that will limit the battery charge at 60 percent. Availability of that update outside South Korea will vary depending on each market, Samsung said. The Note 7 features a larger battery than its predecessor, one that can store 3500 milliamp hours of electric power, compared with 3000 mAh for the Note 5 (Samsung skipped a number this year, to match its flagship Galaxy S7). By comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus, the Note 7’s main competitor, has a 2900 mAh battery. While Apple has also sought to upgrade its battery technology to support better screens and faster graphics, it hasn’t often promoted battery life as a feature itself. Last week’s iPhone event was an exception, when the company highlighted that the iPhone 7 can last almost two hours longer than its predecessor thanks to better software and processor design. Samsung SDI Co. was the main battery supplier for the Note 7, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The batteries failed because a separator within the cells was too thin and electrodes weren’t properly insulated, according to a government quality inspection agency in China, where almost 2,000 Note 7s were distributed as test devices. Samsung, which is preparing to get replacements into the hands of customers from Sept. 19, said in a statement that “all Galaxy Note7 replacement devices will be equipped with the battery from other suppliers.” Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter For the past few years, Samsung has adopted Quick Charge, a technology developed by Qualcomm Inc., throughout its product lineup, including the Note 7. Using specialized chips, circuits and software, the mechanism works in tandem with a specific charger to speed up the process. While that has enabled rapid charging -- up to 50 minutes faster than its predecessor -- it’s also pushing up against the physical limits of the materials and design used in battery technology. Gartner’s Reynolds noted that fast charging is essentially a solution to the problem of short battery life. “It’s a feature driven by short battery life in general, not something that people really want,” he said. The first batch of Note 7 batteries probably had a flaw in their design that didn’t work properly with the chemistry in some units, according to Kyle Wiens, creator of iFixit, a popular website that dissects the innards of gadgets to gauge the ease of repairing the devices. Fast charging “crams as much energy as possible into the battery, and the closer you push it to the edge, the more of a potential safety issue there is,” he said.

By adding too much engine power for what is known as “reverse thrust” to help with braking, the crew caused the plane to skid to the left, the National Transportation Safety Board ruled. While other planes landing shortly before had stopped with no issues, the pilots were hampered by outdated runway condition reports and vague guidance in their manuals, the NTSB found. “Make no mistake: This was a very close call,” NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said at the hearing in Washington. The Boeing Co. MD-88 carrying 127 passengers and five crew members slid onto a retaining wall and its nose came to rest over Flushing Bay on March 5, 2015. While no one was seriously hurt, 29 people suffered minor injuries. Steering Loss The captain used too much engine power while trying to stop, which can cause a loss of steering on a slick runway, according to NTSB documents. After being told the runway was “good” for braking, he was surprised when he descended through clouds to see that it was covered in snow, he told investigators. The safety board found that the pilot’s “situational stress” and high work load as he tried to stop contributed to the mistakes. “The pilots in this accident found themselves without timely and accurate information,” Hart said. It was unfair to simply cite the crew when they were battling marginal weather conditions and LaGuardia’s relatively short runways surrounded by the bay, said Captain Steve Jangelis, vice president for safety at the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents them. Morgan Durant, an airline spokesman, said “Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation.” After Flight 1086 came to rest, it wasn’t fully evacuated for more than 17 minutes, surveillance video of the plane showed. Even though firefighters who arrived on scene were urging the flight crew to evacuate because of a fuel leak, the exit was delayed due to poor communication, according to the NTSB. The crash had knocked out the plane’s intercom, making it difficult for the pilots to talk to the flight attendants. Six Minutes It took six minutes from the time an evacuation was ordered until the first passenger left the plane. Flight attendants allowed passengers to retrieve winter coats and weren’t urging an immediate exit, the safety board concluded. Evacuations are supposed to occur as quickly as possible in case fire breaks out. The captain, in landing, used a common technique known as reverse thrust, in which devices within the engines push air forward instead of toward the back of the plane. That helps the brakes slow a plane down. On the MD-80 series of aircraft, pilots are advised not to use too much engine power during reverse thrust because it can create swirling winds that engulf the tail, where both engines are mounted. If that happens, the tail can no longer keep the plane pointed straight. The engines on Flight 1086 were revved to higher levels than were permitted in the flight manual, according to the NTSB. The captain told investigators he didn’t look at the thrust setting on the engine after touchdown while concentrating on trying to stop. The copilot noticed the issue and twice told the captain to back off the power, according to NTSB records. Voice Recording “Come out of reverse,” the copilot said about eight seconds after landing, according to a transcript of the voice recording. “Come out of reverse.” As the plane skidded off the runway and onto a retaining wall, the recording captured the pilots uttering several expletives and the sound of rumbling or scraping. The plane stopped about 36 seconds after it first touched down, according to the recording. Use of too much reverse thrust is common, the NTSB found. In a sample of flights on the accident plane and another Delta jet that had landed just before it, crews used too much reverse thrust in all 14 cases in which runways were wet and skidding was a risk. Pilot Manual NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt faulted Delta for not being precise enough in its pilot manuals. They advised pilots that using too much thrust could “potentially” cause skidding, while Boeing documents said it definitely would. “It’s not a maybe, might, could,” Sumwalt said. “It looks like Delta downgraded this in their training material.” The accident has some similarities to a fatal runway crash in Little Rock, Arkansas, on June 1, 1999, when an American Airlines MD-82 slid off the airport grounds into an adjacent riverbed in a downpour. Eleven people died when the plane broke apart and a fire erupted. While it wasn’t the main cause of the accident, the NTSB concluded that a pilot’s attempt to use too much reverse thrust was one reason the plane skidded off the runway. On Oct. 1, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is introducing new standards for describing how slick a runway is in rain, snow or icy conditions. The action is designed to give pilots a clearer sense of the potential risks and it stems from a 2005 crash in Chicago in which a Southwest Airlines Co. plane slid through a fence and hit a passing car outside the airport.

By adding too much engine power for what is known as "reverse thrust" to help with braking, the crew caused the plane to skid to the left, the National Transportation Safety Board ruled. While other planes landing shortly before had stopped with no issues, the pilots were hampered by outdated runway condition reports and vague guidance in their manuals, the NTSB found. "Make no mistake: This was a very close call," NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said at the hearing in Washington. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Boeing MD-88 carrying 127 passengers and five crew members slid onto a retaining wall and its nose came to rest over Flushing Bay on March 5, 2015. While no one was seriously hurt, 29 people suffered minor injuries. The captain used too much engine power while trying to stop, which can cause a loss of steering on a slick runway, according to NTSB documents. After being told the runway was "good" for braking, he was surprised when he descended through clouds to see that it was covered in snow, he told investigators. The safety board found that the pilot's "situational stress" and high work load as he tried to stop contributed to the mistakes. "The pilots in this accident found themselves without timely and accurate information," Hart said. It was unfair to simply cite the crew when they were battling marginal weather conditions and LaGuardia's relatively short runways surrounded by the bay, said Captain Steve Jangelis, vice president for safety at the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents them. Morgan Durant, an airline spokesman, said "Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation." After Flight 1086 came to rest, it wasn't fully evacuated for more than 17 minutes, surveillance video of the plane showed. Even though firefighters who arrived on scene were urging the flight crew to evacuate because of a fuel leak, the exit was delayed due to poor communication, according to the NTSB. The crash had knocked out the plane's intercom, making it difficult for the pilots to talk to the flight attendants. It took six minutes from the time an evacuation was ordered until the first passenger left the plane. Flight attendants allowed passengers to retrieve winter coats and weren't urging an immediate exit, the safety board concluded. Evacuations are supposed to occur as quickly as possible in case fire breaks out. The captain, in landing, used a common technique known as reverse thrust, in which devices within the engines push air forward instead of toward the back of the plane. That helps the brakes slow a plane down. On the MD-80 series of aircraft, pilots are advised not to use too much engine power during reverse thrust because it can create swirling winds that engulf the tail, where both engines are mounted. If that happens, the tail can no longer keep the plane pointed straight. The engines on Flight 1086 were revved to higher levels than were permitted in the flight manual, according to the NTSB. The captain told investigators he didn't look at the thrust setting on the engine after touchdown while concentrating on trying to stop. The copilot noticed the issue and twice told the captain to back off the power, according to NTSB records. "Come out of reverse," the copilot said about eight seconds after landing, according to a transcript of the voice recording. "Come out of reverse." As the plane skidded off the runway and onto a retaining wall, the recording captured the pilots uttering several expletives and the sound of rumbling or scraping. The plane stopped about 36 seconds after it first touched down, according to the recording. Use of too much reverse thrust is common, the NTSB found. In a sample of flights on the accident plane and another Delta jet that had landed just before it, crews used too much reverse thrust in all 14 cases in which runways were wet and skidding was a risk. » Next page...

Alia Dharssi, Calgary Herald  09.14.2016 ShareAdjustCommentPrint This is part of Alia Dharssi’s series, Workers Without Borders. To see the series in its entirety, click here. Should the Canadian government get into the business of selling permanent residency? For many, that’s the question Ottawa is considering as it looks at ways to remake its immigrant investor program, which ran from 1986 to 2014 and provided millionaires with permanent residency in exchange for investing in the Canadian economy. The program aimed to attract wealthy people with business experience like Joe Lim, who was a senior executive for multinational companies, including Unilever and Clorox, in Asia. He settled in Canada as an immigrant investor in 2004 and took over Island Clean Air Inc., a company that made air filtration systems for the printing industry, a year later. “I thought I would retire, but I was bored,” recalled Lim, who looked like a content retiree in a shirt with a pattern of tropical leaves at his office in a Vancouver commercial park.   Over the last decade, Lim led Island Clean Air in expanding its sales into Europe and securing clients for its industrial air filtration systems in the auto body industry. It now supplies the United Nations, Porsche, Boeing and Canon. But, according to a federal evaluation of the program published in 2014, most immigrant investors don’t make the same type of economic contributions to Canada as Lim. Instead, they pay, on average, lower taxes than other immigrants, including refugees. That’s because they continue their businesses abroad, leaving their partners and children behind to live in upscale Vancouver, Toronto and other major cities, say immigration consultants who have helped them. In fact, critics charge that those who come to Canada under Quebec’s provincial version of the program, which is still running, use it as a backdoor into Vancouver and, some say, are part of the cause of the soaring housing prices in the region. Meanwhile, the Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Pilot Program, which replaced the old federal investor program, asked immigrants for $2 million for a startup investment fund and aimed to invite 60 immigrants during a test period that kicked off in 2015. The money is not guaranteed and, it appears, the price is too high for the market. As of August 2016, it had received only 17 applications. No one has been selected yet. In contrast, the old program had a backlog of 65,000 applications in 2014. At that time, entire families could apply for permanent residency in exchange for loaning $800,000 to the government for five years with no interest. The funds were divvied up among the provinces, which put them toward things like improving hospitals and building housing. But after five years, once the fees for financial intermediaries were deducted from the approximately $60,000 accrued from the interest on the loan, just $20,000 was left for Canada.   “One area where the immigration system is not doing a good job at all is on the side of business immigration,” said Ilia Burtman, a former manager of immigration programs for Ontario. Rather than being tossed, the old program should have been redesigned to attract helpful investments from people likely to continue to operate in Canada’s economy or open businesses, he said. “Imagine you bring 1,000 investors, each of whom gives $2 million for the construction of hospitals,” he said. “You can see how much money that would generate.” The market for such investors abroad is booming and, according to Burtman, Canada is missing out. A growing number of countries have a variety of deals for rich immigrants, ranging from US$100,000 for citizenship in Dominica to an investment of £2 million (about $3.4 million) in the British economy for residency in the United Kingdom. It’s a global market that was worth US$2 billion in 2014, according to Henley and Partners, a company that specializes in citizenship and residency solutions. But, economics aside, a dicey political question remains: is it acceptable to Canadians if the government exchanges residency for money?

(NYSE: BA) unveiled its entry into the contract competition for a new training jet for the U.S. Air Force. Called the T-X for now, the new aircraft is a clean-sheet design from Boeing and its partner in the bidding, Sweden’s Saab, and would replace the current Air Force trainer, the T-38. Boeing first teased its design at the Air Force Association conference in September of last year and launched a website last month that offered a “sneak peek” at the design it has prepared with Saab. Boeing said Tuesday that it will use the two production aircraft that it and Saab have built “to show the U.S. Air Force the performance, affordability, and maintainability advantages” to their T-X. The Boeing website features a new video of a computer-generated T-X. In late August Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) and its partners began runway testing of its clean-sheet design to replace the T-38. As the release of the U.S. Air Force request for proposal (RFP) for a new training jet, the four competitors have all now either shown a modified version of a real plane or drawings of an all-new, clean-sheet design. In addition to the clean-sheet design from Northrop Grumman and its partners, Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Corp. (NYSE: RTN) have also proposed modified versions of existing training jets. The Air Force released its final draft RFP last month and is expected to have the final document released late this year or early next. That will start the clock running on a one-year evaluation phase according to Aviation Week. A milestone decision is expected early in fiscal year 2018 and entry into service is currently set for 2024. The initial phase of the contract is worth about $8.4 billion, but the total could run much higher. The Air Force plans to buy 350 of the new planes. Boeing’s defense president and CEO Leanne Caret said, “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come.” The following photo of the real thing is also available at Boeing’s website.

The Boeing MD-88 with 127 passengers and five crew members aboard veered left off runway 13, hit a fence and stopped with its left wing leaking fuel onto a berm overlooking Flushing Bay about 11 a.m. on March 5, 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The investigation also found that the flight crew violated procedures, in allowing passengers to fetch their coats, and delaying the evacuation of the plane after the crash, though only 29 people had minor injuries and no one was seriously hurt. “Make no mistake: This was a very close call,” said Christopher Hart, the board’s chairman, after his four-member panel heard and approved the findings and recommendations of an 18-month investigation during a public hearing Tuesday. The pilots did not have timely information and did not expect to see a snowy runway when they approached La Guardia, investigators said. The captain and co-pilot knew they were flying into a challenging snowstorm on their route from Atlanta to New York. They had developed plans to go to an alternative airport if La Guardia did not report that other planes had landed with good braking conditions, Hart said. But the airport reported braking conditions were good and runway 13 had been cleared, sanded and de-iced, investigators said, though it had not been treated since dawn. “As the airplane descended through the clouds, the flight crew did not expect to see that the runway, which had recently been cleared, was covered with snow,” Hart said. “They are thinking this is a slippery snow-covered runway with water at the other end — very cold water by the way — so we need to stop right now,” Hart said. “So one of the first things they did was they landed sooner than they otherwise would . . . and immediately thrust reverse.” The captain applied too much reverse thrust too soon, before the nose wheel hit the runway, despite recommended procedure, investigators said. A reverse thrust, which blasts exhaust forward to slow the plane, can make the rudder ineffective in the control of the airplane. After the crash, it took two hours to get the correct passenger count, investigators said, because the manifest showed 125 passengers and omitted two lap-held children who didn’t have tickets — a potential problem for emergency responders. The investigators’ recommendations include more training for crews, a study to determine the best way to apply maximum reverse thrust and examining the use of technology to provide pilots with the quality of braking action on runways in real time. Delta Air Lines said in a statement that it cooperated with the investigation, respects its findings and will use the guidance to enhance the safety of its operation.

article NEW YORK, Sept. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Executive Summary The global recession has hit the business jet market hard. It is predicted that the manufacturing of new business jets is not likely to reach to pre-recession levels for almost another ten years. Deliveries of new business jets which stood at approximately 1300 in 2008 halved to about 600 in 2012. In the Asian region, the players are focused on China and India. It is expected that in the next decade the business aviation industry in India will grow three times and emerge as the third largest aviation market by 2020. Boeing has anticipated India's demand for aircraft to reach 1,740, valued at USD 240 billion, over the next 20 years in India. Given the economic strengths and the rising demand from India, the business jets sector is betting highly on the market's potential. Currently, India outnumbers both China and Japan when it comes to private jets. Most Indians who can afford a private jet refrain from buying one due to the infrastructural challenges, high costs and maintenance. Why should the report be purchased? The report 'Indian Business Jets Market 2015: Competitive Landscape & Opportunities' highlights key drivers of and trends emerging in India and China's business jet market.

REUTERS/Mike SegarMore By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday faulted a Delta Air Lines pilot for a March 2015 incident in which a Boeing MD-88 veered off the runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport, resulting in minor injuries to 29 passengers. The report said the pilot's use of excessive reverse thrust during landing led to a loss of directional control and the jet’s departure from the snow-covered runway. The report also said the flight and cabin crews did not conduct a timely or effective evacuation for a number of reasons, including the fact that damage to the aircraft resulted in the loss of the interphone and public address system, which delayed an announcement to evacuate the aircraft. The evacuation of the plane with 127 passengers and crew took 17 minutes and did not start until six minutes after landing, the NTSB said. The plane struck a chain-link fence before coming to rest on a snow-covered embankment just feet from Flushing Bay with its left wing tank leaking fuel. "Make no mistake: This was a very close call," NTSB chairman Christopher Hart said on Tuesday. LaGuardia, the smallest of the New York area's three major airports, was temporarily closed after the mishap. The report said the captain faced situational stress at the time of landing, which prevented him from immediately recognizing the use of excessive reverse thrust. Delta said in a statement it had cooperated in the probe and "we respect their findings, conclusions and recommendations. Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation." The NTSB report also raised concerns about the initial uncertainty about the number of passengers aboard the plane, which didn't include two lap-held children. The report also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration's airport winter safety guidance as "not sufficiently clear about the timing and need for updated runway condition reports."

Bezos said in an email Monday the orbital rocket, known as the New Glenn, will be ready for a test launch before the end of this decade. The rocket is named for John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. Here’s a look at New Glenn, alongside other rockets—past, present and in development: Blue Origin’s next step…meet New Glenn #NewGlenn #GradatimFerociter pic.twitter.com/p4gICKZRfi — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) September 12, 2016 New Glenn will measure 23 feet in diameter, with 3.85 million pounds of thrust. It will be powered by seven Blue Engine 4 rocket engines, which Blue Origin has spent more than four years developing, that burn liquefied natural gas and liquid oxygen. The same kind of engine will power the new Vulcan rocket from United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which is scheduled for test launch around 2019. The New Glenn family will include two variations. The two-stage version of the rocket will be 270 feet tall. The three-stage version will stand 313 feet high, with a “high specific impulse hydrogen upper stage” that will allow the rocket to fly further into space, beyond low-Earth orbit. The image Bezos shared on Twitter was meant to drive the point home—to both the public and his competitors—that the New Glenn will be huge. The rocket will also be powerful; with 3.85 million pounds of liftoff thrust, the New Glenn will surpass the United Launch Alliance’s Delta IV Heavy, the most powerful rocket in operation, at 1.6 million pounds. SpaceX, Elon Musk’s spaceflight company, seeks to surpass them both; its Falcon Heavy, whose first launch is scheduled for November, will generate 5.13 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. Here’s some more perspective on power, from Eric Berger at Ars Technica: By way of further comparison, the space shuttle’s main engines had an individual thrust of 470,000 pounds. Along with its solid-rocket boosters, the shuttle had 7 million pounds of thrust at launch. The Saturn V rocket, with five F1 engines, had about 7.5 million pounds of thrust. So Blue Origin’s very first orbital rocket will have slightly more than half the thrust of the rockets that carried humans to the Moon. Bezos said Monday his company’s reusable rocket, New Shepard, “has taught us so much about how to design for practical, operable reusability.” In November 2015, Blue Origin launched New Shepard—named for Alan Shepard, the first American in space—and returned it to Earth for a soft, vertical landing, becoming the first to successfully land a reusable rocket on the ground after launch. But observers—especially Bezos’s competitor, Musk—pointed out while New Shepard reached the boundary where outer space is understood to begin, it did not enter orbit.

More than 25 artistic people shared their creativity with community members at Art in Legion Park Sept. 10-11. The annual art show presented by Arlington Arts Council provided opportunities for local artists to share their work with the community - and that is the essence of art, for at least two of the participating artists. Jacques Drapeau and Marcello Cicchini both expressed appreciation for the opportunity to chat with people and get feedback about their art. Cicchini, who works by day at Boeing, said it is essential for artists to share their work other people. "Some artists fear critics," said Cicchini, a resident of Marysville who grew up in Argentina. "But it's important to show what you do or it means nothing." Another artist at the show, Jacques Drapeau agreed. For Drapeau, who is a member of several art groups including the Greater Marysville Art Guild and the Stanwood Camano Art Guild, the opportunity to show his art is the reason to join an art group. "It's important for artists to show their work to the public," said Drapeau, who also shows his fantasy dinosaur narrative paintings at the Arlington Library and in the AAC's Art along the Way project, where art is exhibited in 15 different businesses around town. Most of the artists seemed pleased with the results of the show, selling paintings, photography, jewelry, yard art, paper mache´sculptures and wooden bowls, among other things, to an assortment of visitors who walked through the park on Saturday and Sunday, while listing to the ring of live music along the way. Visitors included cyclists along the Centennial Trail, like Gary from Granite Falls, who parked near the cemetery and took a quick bike ride to town and stopped in to hear some music and have a glass of wine in the wine and beer garden. "I just felt like getting out of the house today," he said. Dawn Latimer sold kettlekorn at the art show on Sunday, after her parents were there on Saturday. "Yesterday was really busy, but today was good, too," Latimer said. "It's a family affair," she said of her business selling donuts and popcorn of various flavors. Roberta Baker, the coordinator of the show for AAC, was tired at the end of the day on Sunday but she felt rewarded for all the hard work by the positive feedback from the artists. "It seems like most of the artists were satisfied with their sales," Baker said. "I had a good day," said Vicki Johnson, a pastel artist. "I sold a few paintings," Cicchini said. "And got lots of interesting feedback." Visitors gathered enthusiastically every hour and a half to see if they had won a raffle prize or not, and in the Youth Engaged in Art tent, youth and adults painted plywood fish, to freshen up the fish pole in Legion Park. And the weather cooperated, too, with puffy white clouds providing periodic shade from the warm sun and a fresh, cool breeze wafting over the park both Saturday and Sunday. The Arlington Arts Council's next event is its annual Fall into Art Auction on Saturday, Oct. 15, at Gleneagle Country Club. Tickets are available at Flowers by George and by phone at 360-435-5866.

Blog Samsung Gets Kicked Off the Plane Steve Ohr, Consultant, Semiconductor Industry Analyst 9/13/2016 01:40 PM EDT  2 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Lithium-ion battery fires are infrequent but not rare. Incidents involving Samsung's latest smartphone may encourage mobile device makers to reexamine the integrity of their power trains. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an advisory Thursday (September 8th) effectively declaring the Samsung Galaxy Note 7  arguably the most feature-laden smartphone ever  a fire hazard. The FAA advisory asked airline passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage. The advisory follows a much publicized incident in which a Samsung smartphone exploded while charging on a car console, sending the Jeep Cherokee up in flame. Samsung has already issued a recall for an estimated 2.5 million units. Major cell phone service providers like Sprint and AT&T Mobility acknowledged the problem, stopping the sale of Galaxies, and issuing refunds on purchased phones that varied across the ten countries where the affected smartphones were sold. The exploding phone could not have come at a worse time for the worlds largest handset maker, with a new Apple iPhone model fast on its heels. The latest battery fire will likely have every portable device maker  whether smartphone, tablet, laptop computer, or electric car  examining the integrity of their products power train. And its none-too-soon: lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries are the highest density mobile energy source that is commercially available. (There are lithium-polymer formulations that offer incremental improvements in battery density, but there is nothing ready to substitute for Li-Ion, in terms of light weight, high power density and accessible cost.) The key components of a lithium-ion battery are its anode, its cathode, and its electrolyte, whose behavior varies depending on whether the battery is being charged or discharged (i.e., in use, driving a load). During charging, lithium ions are ejected from the cathode (which typically includes cobalt, manganese, nickel and oxygen) toward the anode (which is made of graphite)  across an ion-filled electrolyte fluid. As the battery drains in use, the lithium ions return from the anode back into the cathode. The problem for these batteries is that the lithium is extremely reactive with oxygen and/or water vapor in the atmosphere  despite the neutralizing effects of the electrolyte. Packing a bomb Lithium batteries were used for military aircraft long before they were tweaked by battery-maker Sony for commercial use. The current solution partially neutralizes the lithium solution with lithium ion or lithium cobalt, and  most important  reducing the compounds exposure to the atmosphere, where it could first gulp down oxygen, raising its temperature in the process, and, then, within milliseconds bursting into flames. Ionized lithium provides a buffer, but its effectiveness is not 100%. The battery design requires the lithium material to be physically isolated from the atmosphere. It means protecting the battery from cracks or punctures. Heat, by itself, is not the cause of Lithium battery fires. Rather, too much heat can stress the battery seals, and its a broken seal that leads to an explosion. Battery fires have been reported in laptop computers, made by Dell, Hewlett Packard and Toshiba, and in the Chevy Volt and Tesla Model S electric cars, and even in Boeings most recent jetliner, the 787. In the case of the computer battery fires, their cause has been attributed to defects in the battery manufacturing process, in which microscopic metal filings were accidentally rolled into the electrolytic film, potentially puncturing the film, short-circuiting anode-to-cathode in that spot, and getting horrendously hot. Improvements in battery manufacturing have pretty much eliminated computer battery fires. In the case of the Tesla battery fire, the battery case on the underside of the car was ruptured by the car going up on a curb. In the case of the Boeing 787 fires, the company spent a lot of energy making the FAA  and potential 787 passengers  understand that the use of lithium batteries did not affect the planes ability to fly. Of the two lithium battery packs on board, one was used to start the jet engines when the plane was on the ground; the other was used to power up passenger comfort systems. And, just in case, Boeing redesigned the battery case seals to ensure there would be no additional exposure to oxygen (i.e., no explosion) in case of an internal short. While the U.S. Product Safety Commission recalled 35,000 laptop batteries as late as 2008, the tone of experts commenting on the possibility of future lithium fires is spread across a spectrum from oh, theyre safe go back to bed, to Be Afraid Be Very Afraid. The consensus seems to suggest that lithium ion batteries are safe; that catastrophic failure is rare. The caveat is that Lithium batteries need to be treated with respect  and thats a major role for the surrounding control circuitry. The batteries should never be fully depleted, never be overcharged (as that could cause overheating), never allowed to experience a reversal in polarity. With hundreds of millions of lithium ion batteries produced each year, the market for smart battery charging controllers (also called battery management ICs) is roughly $1.6-$1.8 billion with average selling prices (ASPs) considerably less than 50 cents in very high volumes  amazingly cheaper, considering the functions they perform. The market leaders are generally those with skill sets in precision signal conditioning and control.

However, manufacturing defects in the cell membrane can cause spectacular failures as shown by the SONY flaming laptops a few years ago.  In this case, Samsung only has problems with one of two suppliers which points to a weaker design or manufacturing defects.

If it tried to appear friendlier to the masses, it failed. It only proved that a select elite truly congregates behind closed doors to push a New World Order agenda. If you know anything about international politics or the plan for a New World Order, you surely know about the CFR. It was often deemed “the most influential foreign policy think tank in the world” by international journalists. The list of its members is astonishing, to say the least, as it includes gigantic names in the corporate, financial and political world. Some examples of corporations: ABC News, American Express, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Ford Motor, Google, Halliburton, Heinz, IBM, Nike, Sony Corporation America and Visa. Examples of members: Barack Obama, Zbigniew Brzezinski (Obama’s advisor), Hilary Clinton, Dick Cheney, John McCain and David Rockefeller. Researchers have observed that these figures are working towards a world government and members never truly denied this fact. Shortly after his election, Obama selected the president of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass, along with senior CFR-members Richard Holbrooke and  Dennis Ross as special Foreign Envoys/ Foreign Policy Advisors. Here’s the promotional video posted by the CFR. The Council on Foreign Relations is a trusted and indispensable resource. Watch CFR members explain why:https://t.co/zAmqsBTIBM — CFR (@CFR_org) August 5, 2016 While this video attempts to put a friendly face on the CFR by using TV celebrities and movie stars, it only ultimately proves that this globalist organization (created by JP Morgan and john D. Rockefeller) is more powerful (and less democratic) than ever. The video basically says: “The world is complex and geared towards globalization…and we’re the only ones who can deal with this”. By showcasing its members, the video also showcases who and what the elite truly “owns”. Here are some of the people seen in the video. Juliette Kayyem CNN National Security Analyst, Robert Rubin Former Treasury Secretary , Co-Chair CFR Juju Chang, ABC News Anchor Dina Habib Powell, Global Head of Impact Investing, Goldman Sachs Condolezza Rice, Former Secretary of State Angelina Jolie, Actress Jon Meacham, CEO Random House Publishing Rev. Chloe Breyer, Interfaith Center of New York Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove, Park Avenue Synagogue Richard Plepler, CEO HBO Jared Cohen, President of Jigsaw Random House is the largest general-interest trade book publisher in the world. Goldman Sachs is one of the largest banking firms in the world (it was rescued as part of a massive U.S. government bailout). CNN, ABC and HBO are some of the largest TV stations in the world. This gives you an idea of the reach of the CFR. By including Rev. Chloe Breyer, who works at the Interfaith Center of New York, you get a glimpse of the “one world religion” agenda of the NWO. It was founded in 1997 by the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, former Dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine – a NWO-friendly “sinister site” I’ve previously analyzed in this article. Jared Cohen is the founder and President of Jigsaw (previously Google Ideas). He’s also an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Previously, he served as a member of the Secretary of State’s Policy Planning Staff and as a advisor to Condoleezza Rice and later Hillary Clinton.Initially brought in by Condoleezza Rice as a member of the Policy Planning Staff, he was one of a few staffers that stayed under Hillary Clinton. The video shows Henry Kissinger next to a pile of Foreign Affairs publications (published by the CFR). In case you didn’t know, Henry Kissinger basically shaped the world as we know by dictating the US foreign policy for decades. In short, this CFR video gives you a glimpse of the tentacular reach of this elite-created organization and how it is pushing towards a world government – despite its claims of not having agenda. Its founding members never shied away from the fact that they DID have an agenda. Proof of this can be found in this great short video about the CFR.

Friday’s hideous trading day aside, the market has fared somewhat better this year than in 2015, and some underweighted areas like utilities and telecoms have made big moves. It’s not unusual to see changes made in front of the final quarter of the year. The UBS Dividend Ruler portfolio continue to outperform the overall market, and we continue to think that the outperformance will stay in place for the rest of the year and beyond. The analysts focus on stocks with solid dividends that have consistently grown over time, and their performance this year is once again outstanding. Year to date, the portfolio is up 10.7% on a total return basis, versus the S&P 500’s 7.8%. The portfolio managers make a huge change, removing a venerable blue chip Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) and adding Praxair Inc. (NYSE: PX), a leader in the industrial gas business. Praxair’s debut in the portfolio could be very timely. This top company offers atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, argon and rare gases, and process gases such as carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases and acetylene. It also designs, engineers and builds equipment that produces industrial gases, as well as manufactures precious metal and ceramic sputtering targets used primarily in the production of semiconductors. In addition, the company supplies wear-resistant and high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders to the aircraft, energy, printing, primary metals, petrochemical, textile and other industries. UBS is bullish on Praxair as it is in a sector with a very high barrier to entry. The report said: In short, we believe Praxair is emerging from a challenging period and earnings are poised to begin to grow once again, bolstered by continued favorable trends in end-markets such as healthcare, food and beverages, and electronics. Underscoring the relatively defensive nature of the business, and aggressive cost controls, earnings have fallen by only 12% from the 2014 peak despite very difficult conditions. In addition, management has continued to increase the dividend over the last two years, which suggests confidence in the long term outlook. Boeing exits the Dividend Ruler portfolio with its shares still down over 10% since the beginning of the year. This top aerospace industrial designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services worldwide. The stock has had a very up-and-down year and UBS mentioned this in its report: The commercial aerospace business is cyclical and there are some indications that airlines may have expanded their wide-body fleets too aggressively in recent years, suggesting a period of weaker demand going forward. In addition, the fall in oil prices reduces the incentive to upgrade to the most fuel-efficient planes. Finally, Boeing is launching refreshed versions of the 737 and the 777 in the next couple of years. New product introductions carry the risk of potential cost overruns. As a result, our confidence in the dividend growth outlook has waned and we are removing the shares from our list. Praxair shareholders receive a 2.53% dividend. The UBS price target for the stock is $130, and the Wall Street consensus target is $126.38. The shares closed Monday at $118.53. Boeing shareholders are paid a 3.35% dividend. Its shares are rated Neutral at UBS with a $128 target. The consensus target is higher at $149.27. The stock closed last Monday at $130.12.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) WABC Eyewitness News Tuesday, September 13, 2016 QUEENS, New York (WABC) -- NTSB investigators are blaming pilot error for a Delta Airlines jet skidding off the runway during a snowstorm at LaGuardia Airport in 2015. At a hearing Tuesday, investigators said the captain used too much engine power while trying to stop, which can cause a loss of steering on a slick runway. The plane's left wing struck a perimeter fence. Authorities also questioning the captain's decision to wait six minutes after the crash to order an evacuation. None of the 127 passengers and five crew members was seriously injured in the incident, which happened on March 5 and left Delta Flight 1086 dangerously close to ending up in Flushing Bay. Many said the jet went out of control almost as soon as it touched down, finally skidding to a stop midway down the runway after crashing through the fence. The runway had been plowed minutes before the incident, and two other pilots had reported good braking conditions. Passengers were told to exit over the broken right wing because the door out the back was too close to the water. They climbed off the plane dressed in their heavy winter coats and scarves and tromped through several inches of snow. The plane did not make contact with the water. "As we walked across the runway, it was covered with so much snow that I was wondering: Who decided it was safe to land here?" said passenger Jane Kaufman, of Gainesville, Florida. New York Giant tight end Larry Donnell was aboard, he reported on his Instagram page. When Donnell got off the plane, he posted a picture he took of the scene, captioning it, "Look at this s**t! Knew I shoulda stayed my a** at home." He later released a statement saying, "I'm blessed to be safe and sound after our plane skidded off the runway at LaGuardia airport today. I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries. We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know ,all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely." Delta released the following statement: "Delta Air Lines' top priority is always the safety of our customers and employees. We cooperated with the National Transportation Safety Board during the course of the investigation and we respect their findings, conclusions and recommendations. Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation."

The one-day event will also feature fast-track RFID training on Oct. 19, provided by RFID4U. As news of RFID adoption continues to accelerate in these sectors, RFID in Aerospace and Defense aims to help companies comply with customer requirements and use the technology internally to achieve significant benefits. "RFID is delivering real value, not just to Boeing, Airbus and the U.S. Department of Defense, but to their suppliers as well," says Mark Roberti, RFID Journal's founder and editor. "This event offers a unique opportunity for companies being asked to tag parts and shipments to learn how they can benefit from RFID internally."

Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint New Delhi: Air India Ltd plans to reinstate pilots it sacked after they took part in a two-month strike that brought the airline’s international operations to a halt four years ago.  The airline hopes to use the seven pilots who were seen as key people in instigating the strike seeking exclusivity over flying a certain type of Air India planes to expand its operations. Air India’s executive director (operations) Arvind Kathpalia on 6 September wrote to chairman Ashwani Lohani seeking reinstatement of pilots who were involved in the 2012 strike organized by the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG). Within 48 hours, Lohani cleared the move, which Mint has reviewed. “We are in the receipt of applications from the following pilots who were terminated in IPG agitation in 2012, requesting to be reinstated in the airline,” Kathpalia wrote, naming the pilots in the letter and recommending that in view of plans to induct two more Boeing 777 planes “we may reinstate the above 7 pilots”. ‘We need to fly, not keep aircraft on ground. Please do by tomorrow,” Lohani wrote. Some 100 pilots took part in the 2012 strike; the seven pilots mentioned by Kathpalia weren’t taken back by the airline because they were seen as key instigator, but the others have already been reabsorbed. Lohani cleared the proposal days after another union, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), on 1 September threatened labour action if its demands for pay raises and other service benefits weren’t met. Lohani had on 5 September written a letter warning of “exemplary disciplinary action” against any employee who resorted to such action. In the context of the tough stand he took, the decision to take back the seven pilots may send the wrong message, some analysts said.  “A disciplinary action issued one day is revoked next day. With this mindset you can never enforce discipline,” said Mohan Ranganathan, a Chennai-based aviation analyst. Also read: Air India wants to do a debt restructuring: Ashwani Lohani “Of late, there are examples like reinstatement of a pilot which had been kept in abeyance because of misconduct and a pilot promotion that has already been challenged in the courts,” Ranganthan said, “Air India has to not just pretend to be tough and but act tough.” Air India suffered a loss of Rs.600 crore in the 58-day strike by pilots in 2012, then civil aviation minister Ajit Singh told Parliament on 14 August 2012. The pilots started reporting sick from 7 May in 2012 in protest against management’s decision to train pilots of erstwhile Indian Airlines to fly long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The decision to take back the pilots comes at a time when many Air India pilots flying Boeing 777s are waiting to be promoted. “Ideally those people should have been given training and made commanders instead of taking pilots that caused the company so much harm,” said a person aware of the situation who declined to be named. “It has sent very wrong signals across the company.” Lohani defended the move. “There is no decision so far. We are only examining because we want to fly all Boeing 777s in the overall interest—extra frequencies to San Francisco and a new flight to Washington is on the cards,” Lohani said in a text message in reply to questions from Mint. Air India has 1,700 pilots of which nearly 300 have been recruited in the last one year alone. Boeing 777s are only scheduled to join fleet in the next financial year. All its existing Boeing 777s already operate flights globally.

David Ake A construction worker carries a ladder across the scaffolding on the U.S. Capitol Dome early in the morning, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2016, in Washington on the day Congress returns to work after their summer holiday. (AP Photo/J. David Ake) WASHINGTON • It looks more and more like Congress will kick the can down the road on the 2017 budget, passing a continuing resolution to get beyond the Nov. 8 elections, and then leaving a resolution to a lame-duck Congress thereafter. How this will affect spending on issues important to the St. Louis region is still unclear. But Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said Monday she was confident that any final budget and appropriations deal passed by Congress will include one of the biggest potential line items: The extra spending for an additional 14 or more Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet jets for the Navy built in St. Louis. It may just take longer to get there. The reason: There is substantial momentum for the spending on the new planes, with the House and Senate both passing separate blueprints that include the additional planes earlier this year. There remain big differences over how to pay for the new planes. Democrats complain that House Republicans want to hide its funding by paying for it out of a separate budgetary line item on fighting wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere. But, McCaskill told the Post-Dispatch on Monday that “I think it’s important to realize that both sides have passed” an overall blueprint for the planes and she predicted it would pass in either a catch-all “omnibus” spending bill at year’s end, or in one of a series of smaller “mini-buses” passed late in the year. However, McCaskill signaled she may be a “no” vote if it comes in an omnibus, and even if it has the Super Hornets in it — in large part to protest Congress’s continuing use of such catch-all funding mechanism. “I just think it is a terrible way to spend public money,” she said, complaining that Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had promised to return the Senate to more regular order in the way it passed appropriations and budget bills. McCaskill also said she was confident that Congress would attach funding for additional spending to fight the Zika virus to a continuing resolution because Republicans don’t want to go home to campaign for re-election leaving that issue in the air before a voting public that knows the GOP controls Congress. That issue has become big in the Missouri Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. Roy Blunt and Democratic Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt has been a lead negotiator on a $1.1 billion compromise that passed the Senate earlier this summer. But House Republicans attached riders on flying the Confederate flag at federal cemeteries and banning Planned Parenthood funding that Democrats could not swallow, and they blocked it in the Senate. Kander has accused Blunt of not being able to get the bill passed. Now, expect some finessing of the issue — attaching it to a continuing resolution, for instance — to get Zika funding passed before members of Congress go home to campaign for re-election. (Chuck Raasch) BY THE NUMBERS: $3 billion – estimated cost of the additional F/A-18E Super Hornet jets being contemplated by Congress 5,000 – Jobs in the St. Louis region connected with their construction by Boeing and suppliers, according to Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin. ON THE WEB: Account of June House passage of the funding for the additional Super Hornets. One account on the Senate’s 2016 work schedule saying it will be in session the fewest days of any of the last 60 years. SHE SAID IT: “Mitch McConnell came into Congress promising two things: We would work all week, and we would get back to regular order (of passing budget bills). Instead he is filling the tree (with extra spending) and he is doing omnibuses (giant, catch-all spending bills). And we have worked fewer days than we have in 60 years.” —Sen.

Noile estimări ale companiei americane sunt cu 7,6% mai mari faţă de prognozele de anul trecut care vizau vânzarea a 6.300 de aparate de zbor. Creşterea comenzilor pe care le vor face companiile aeriene din China va fi susţinută de dezvoltarea clasei de mijloc din statul asiatic şi de noile politici de acordare a vizelor. Potrivit Boeing, traficul de pasageri în China ar urma să avanseze, în fiecare an, cu 6,4%, în următoarele două decenii.

It was not a pleasant experience. On Sept. 4, 1971, Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, en route from Anchorage to Seattle via Cordova, Yakutat, Juneau and Sitka, slammed into a mountainside while approaching Juneau International Airport. All 111 people aboard the aircraft were killed. It was – and remains – Alaska’s worst air disaster. “It’s like being on another planet,” wrote Mottram, the Juneau bureau chief for the Associated Press, at the time. At 2,500 feet above sea level, the accident site was enveloped in fog and mist. Instead of a junked aircraft, Mottram saw a junkyard littered with debris and gore. “There isn’t a piece of that 727 jet too big to hold in your hand. The only sound is the wind and the voices of the rescue workers. The clouds move in and out, and you stand on soft, spongy ground, uneasy,” he wrote. Mottram watched as Juneau National Guardsmen and Alaska State Troopers collected the remains of the victims, pieces of people. It would take more than a week to gather those remains and almost a month more to identify them. “You have difficulty even visualizing what it was . visualizing an airplane with smiling people aboard and the stewardess saying, `Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,”’ Mottram wrote. “It is very quiet up there.” On the 45th anniversary of the accident, if you fly by helicopter to the crash site just as Mottram did, you will still find quiet. You will still find wreckage, too. Resting on stony ground are pieces of fuselage and structure clearly marked with the orange stripes Alaska Airlines used in the 1970s, reported the Juneau Empire. The wreckage has remained undisturbed, but flying hasn’t. In the past 45 years, commercial aviation – both in Juneau and across the nation – has become safer. In 1970, according to statistics kept by the U.S. Department of Transportation, crashes killed 146 people on scheduled commercial flights with more than 12 passengers. These crashes took place in a year when commercial flights scheduled fewer than 2.7 billion miles. In 2015, American commercial flights covered nearly 7.7 billion miles – with no fatalities. No large American airliner has crashed since 2009. That safety record is at least partially a result of lessons learned 45 years ago. Flight 1866 inspired changes in prevention and response that have saved thousands of lives. Forty-five years on, Flight 1866’s crash site is still quiet, but its impact resounds. Barlow inbound On the morning of Sept. 4, 1971, Flight 1866 took off from Anchorage under the command of an experienced crew headed by 41-year-old Dick Adams, a pilot with almost 14,000 hours of flying time. Adams had been with Alaska for more than 16 years and was one of the airline’s more experienced pilots. He was joined in the cockpit by two other experienced crewmen with ample training in the Boeing 727 they flew. In “Character and Characters,” an oral history of Alaska Airlines, author Robert Serling describes the people aboard as “a typical cross-section of passengers from every walk of life, every age group, every economic stratum.” Most were from Alaska. There were nine freshmen heading to class at Sheldon Jackson College and four going to Mount Edgecumbe school. The Anchorage Daily News published brief profiles of some of the others: – Harvey Golub, Alaska’s most experienced bridge engineer, was on his way home from a meeting in Anchorage where he was planning a bridge across the Yukon River. – Cathy Peak was married to a Coast Guardsman stationed in Cordova and was flying home to visit family in Missouri with her sister and daughter. – Judy Nichols was taking her infant son Stephen to meet her future husband in Juneau. – Clint Schilstra was an all-tournament basketball player for Kake at the Gold Medal tournament and taught at the town’s school. – With Schilstra was Kake’s schools superintendent and three other teachers; all were flying home with several hundred pounds of moose meat from a successful hunt in Yakutat. The weather on the day of the crash was typically bad – heavy clouds and fog that forced Adams and his crew to land using instruments instead of peering from their cockpit windows. Juneau’s surrounding mountains preclude the use of normal instrument approaches, but the Federal Aviation Administration has long operated a navigation aid called a “VHF omni-directional range” (VOR) beacon. This beacon, located on Sisters Island in Icy Strait, sends out a radio beam along a set course. It’s supposed to be a reliable landmark when murky clouds interfere with navigation. Another beam comes from the localizer, another beacon at the airport. By determining the angles of the beams reaching an aircraft, that plane’s pilot can determine the aircraft’s approximate location. On that day, however, the Sisters Island beam wasn’t reliable – unknown to anyone, it was almost 45 degrees off its correct direction. According to the official report compiled after the crash, the beacon was sending out a correct signal, but the plane’s instruments were receiving an incorrect one. As a result, when Flight 1866 began to descend toward Juneau, the plane’s crew thought they were eight miles east of the Chilkat Range, at Barlow Cove on Admiralty Island, not directly above the range’s peaks. The crew had ways to verify the plane’s location, but using them wasn’t required and wasn’t part of the normal landing procedure. Also, the crew had no reason to believe they were off course. In its report on the accident, published 13 months after the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded, “the probable cause of this accident was a display of misleading navigational information. The origin or nature of the misleading navigational information could not be determined.” There were no signs the plane ever slowed down or realized it was about to strike a mountain. “This was a nonsurvivable accident,” the NTSB report stated. Responding in a fog That Sept. 4 was a Saturday, but Charlie Smith was in his office at the Alaska Department of Public Safety when word of the crash arrived. He’d spent some of the workweek in Anchorage and needed to catch up. “It was a Saturday, and ironically, I had a ticket to come back on the same plane, but I came back a day early,” he said, sharing his memories of the accident in an interview over coffee. He still lives in Juneau. In addition to working for the state, Smith was the National Guard lieutenant in charge of Juneau’s Guard detachment. When he learned about the accident, he began calling his superiors, asking for permission to mobilize his soldiers to help. When he couldn’t reach them – it was a holiday weekend, after all – he called them out on his own accord. “Granted, it was a recovery, but it started out as a search and rescue mission,” he said. The flight was due to land in Juneau shortly after noon, but when it didn’t arrive, everyone involved knew it was in trouble – they just didn’t know where. The crash wasn’t found until a hired helicopter with an Alaska State Trooper and an Alaska Airlines pilot aboard discovered it about 4:30 p.m. Troopers arrived by helicopter that night to secure the scene and look for survivors, according to an account drafted by the coroner’s office. The Guardsmen arrived the next morning, some of them carried by the Coast Guard cutter Sweetbriar, which was based in Juneau and stayed on scene while workers recovered bodies and debris deemed critical to the accident investigation. A base camp was established at sea level, and for almost a week, helicopters flew constant missions, flitting between base camp and the accident site, between base camp and the airport, and between base camp and the National Guard armory (today’s Juneau Arts and Culture Center), which became a morgue. Juneau’s National Guardsmen were combat engineers, not crash recovery experts. On training missions, they built radio stations and playgrounds. “These young folks really did one heck of a job even though they didn’t have any specific training,” Smith said. “The only training we had back in those days was riot control training because it was the late ’60s, early ’70s . We never had anything like this.” Dennis Egan, now state senator for Juneau, was in the National Guard at the time of the crash. “My wife and I were in Valdez when the crash happened, and lo and behold, we were activated,” he said. They drove to Anchorage and got onto a flight that took them back to Juneau, where Egan spent the following two weeks recovering remains and working at the morgue. “It was horrible. It was just horrible,” he said. “Guys on the plane were friends of mine. Everybody in this town, because it was small enough back then, knew somebody who was on that flight.” Three refrigerated container vans were kept operating 24 hours a day to store the remains while the FBI laboriously identified them through fingerprints, dental records and jewelry. It wasn’t until the end of September that all the remains were identified and left Juneau, according to the coroner’s report now kept in the Alaska State Archives. The process left the armory almost unusable, Smith recalled. All of the FBI and forensics experts were walking around with cigars, Egan said. When he asked why, one of the FBI men cryptically responded, “You’ll get it.” “Opening up those cooler vans – the stench stayed in there because there was so much formaldehyde and other stuff,” Egan said. Afterward, the armory’s floor was pulled up and replaced, and its walls were repainted to get rid of the smell. Fixing the problems that led to the accident would not be so easy. Repairing navigation It became apparent even before the official report that faulty navigation – whether on the part of the pilots or the FAA – was to blame for the accident. Flight 1866’s “black box” cockpit and ground-control recordings were almost immediately recovered and it was discovered that there were no flaws with the aircraft or crew, who believed themselves well east of the mountains. Even though the official investigation wasn’t complete until 13 months after the accident, Gov. Bill Egan wasted no time calling for better groundside navigation equipment. On Sept. 9, five days after the accident, he wrote a letter to the Secretary of Transportation urging him to upgrade the navigation equipment on Sisters Island. “It is my sincere hope that you will understand that because of the topography of the landscape approaching Juneau that extraordinary measures are warranted at once, simply to provide additional air safety that most air travelers take for granted as already being a part of the system,” he wrote. The FAA responded promptly. By year’s end, the agency installed distance-measuring equipment at Sisters Island that would have given the pilots of Flight 1866 a safeguard against the disaster and might have prevented it. The FAA also mandated new standards for planes flying into Juneau’s airport, which had to fly a steeper approach and hold to tougher weather standards. After the NTSB report failed to come up with an adequate explanation for the bent beam, Alaska Airlines employees found the Sisters Island beacon wasn’t set up according to the FAA’s own standards, Serling wrote in his book. Furthermore, while conducting their own experiments, the airline employees found that the beacon could send flawed signals on the rare days when Icy Strait was millpond-smooth. On those days, the beacon’s radio signals could suffer from interference and rotate the signal counter-clockwise, just as experienced by Flight 1866. The results of the airline employees’ experiments were not duplicated by the FAA’s own tests, and the federal agency continues to state in its own official history that “the origin or nature of the misleading navigational information could not be determined.” An FAA spokesman declined to answer questions about the accident. When lawsuits pertaining to the accident were settled in the mid-1970s, the FAA contributed millions of dollars to the final amount paid to the families of crash victims. The exact amount and the details of the settlement remain sealed from public view by court order. ‘Saved’ at the airport John Ladner is Alaska Airlines’ director of operations, the man responsible for training the company’s pilots and ensuring that the experience of Flight 1866 doesn’t happen again. “The navigation systems have evolved dramatically in the decades since 1971 when this accident happened,” Ladner said by phone from Seattle. The distance-measuring equipment added by the FAA “gives you a more clear depiction of where you are,” Ladner explained, but it wasn’t a perfect solution, particularly in Juneau. “Juneau is arguably one of the most difficult airports to fly into in the entire country,” said Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for Alaska Airlines. That difficulty led to more accidents like the one that claimed Flight 1866. In 1985, a LearJet crashed into the Chilkat Range, killing all four people aboard. In 1992, an Air National Guard aircraft crashed into the mountains, killing all eight aboard – including a brigadier general. Those accidents – each considered a “controlled flight into terrain” as Flight 1866 was – convinced Alaska Airlines and the City and Borough of Juneau (which owns the airport) that more improvements were needed. The solution was a system called “Required Navigation Performance,” which combines onboard navigation and the GPS satellite network to create precise landing paths. It improves safety and efficiency and is reliable even in fog or bad weather that obscures the runway. “I think that each of these sorts of accidents, and especially Flight 1866, was a big driver toward making a safer way to get in there,” Ladner said. In the 1990s, Alaska Airlines and Juneau officials – including Dennis Egan, who was the city’s deputy mayor at the time – lobbied Congress to make Alaska’s capital a testbed for RNP. When the system began operating in 1996, it was the first of its kind in the world. It was successful almost immediately. Alaska Airlines began keeping track of its “saves,” flights able to land under RNP that would have been stopped by bad weather otherwise. In 2011 alone, Alaska Airlines logged 831 “saves” at Juneau International Airport, the company’s then-chairman, Bill Ayer, said at the time. In 1998, following Juneau’s experience, the FAA certified standards that allow airlines to set up their own RNP landing approaches at airports across the country. Internationally, other countries have also set up similar programs. “The RNP has really been something that I think has been a great addition to flying safety,” Ladner said. “It’s really been able to make it safe and efficient.” ‘Terrain! Pull up!’ In the days after Flight 1866 crashed into the Chilkat Range, a small plane deliberately traced its path west of Juneau. Aboard the plane was a young engineer named Don Bateman, and in the plane was a warning device that he had invented. As Bateman’s small plane neared the fatal mountain, a warning sounded. His plane pulled up and flew to safety. Flight 1866 didn’t have that warning. “I was disappointed,” Bateman told Bloomberg reporter Alan Levin earlier this year, recalling the experience of flying over the site. “We needed to do better.” Bateman, now 84, is the inventor of the Ground Proximity Warning System, a device that warns pilots when their planes near mountains. In the 1960s and 1970s, when Flight 1866 crashed, the most common cause of airline disasters was what the National Transportation Safety Board calls “controlled flight into terrain” – hitting the ground without warning. “This (controlled flight into terrain) is something that really over the decades the industry has tried to reduce,” Ladner said. Since 2001, when the FAA began mandating that commercial airliners use an enhanced version of Bateman’s system, not a single commercial airliner has crashed due to a “controlled flight into terrain.” President Barack Obama awarded Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011, recognizing his achievement. Where the RNP system pioneered by Alaska Airlines is designed to keep planes on track, the equipment designed by Bateman gives pilots critical seconds of warning if something goes wrong. Three years after Flight 1866’s crash, the FAA began requiring large airliners to carry radar altimeters. These devices let pilots know if they were unexpectedly nearing the ground, but they didn’t give advance warning if a plane was approaching a mountain in front of it. After the end of the Cold War, improvements in computer technology and the availability of electronic terrain maps meant that planes could carry a nearly foolproof warning device. “A wonderful thing happened during the end of the Cold War . enlightened people on both sides decided to use the digitized terrain that was developed for military purposes for cruise missiles and so on … for the civil sector, and that’s been very, very good,” Bateman said in a 1998 hearing about the crash of a Boeing 747 on Guam. The newest versions of the warning system give as much as several minutes’ notice before a crash, allowing pilots to avoid problems before they become fatal. With a digital voice that shouts “Terrain! Pull up!” the warnings are impossible to miss. “It’s accidents around the world that drive us to find a better way to do things,” Ladner said. “Smart people start making better devices so we can continue to find a way to operate safely.” Improvements to response Even with these technological breakthroughs, the FAA does not require ground-proximity warning systems like Bateman’s on air taxi aircraft or private aircraft, which now make up the vast majority of fatal air disasters in Alaska. Recently, a pair of small aircraft collided in midair near the Yukon River town of Russian Mission, killing all five people aboard the two planes. As happened 45 years ago with Flight 1866, the Alaska State Troopers and Alaska National Guard were the first on the scene. The response, however, was very different, based on lessons learned in part from Flight 1866. Lt. Col. Tony Stratton of the National Guard is in charge of the Guard’s emergency response in Alaska. In 1971, a 32-year-old Juneau lieutenant called out the Guard to help. If the same thing were to happen today, a lieutenant wouldn’t be making that call. “Communications is probably the biggest difference from then to now,” he said by phone from Anchorage. The state and federal agencies operate a rescue coordination center and emergency operations centers as needed to coordinate agencies and help. “The RCC has a list of agencies that include the Air National Guard, Army National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, Alaska Mountain Rescue. It’s an extensive list, and they’ll go through that list to match needs and capabilities,” he said. Instead of Smith and Juneau troopers calling friends and neighbors to help, there’s a set procedure and process to call into action. There’s better training, too, said Lt. Bryan Barlow, aircraft section commander of the Alaska Department of Public Safety. “State troopers receive specific training in search and rescue and the Incident Response System in their academy curriculum as well as continuing and advanced education in the same topics once they are working in the field,” he wrote. That’s a marked difference from 1971, when Sgt. Harcourt Tew, an instructor at the Trooper academy, wrote in a memo, “I do not feel we were prepared, either with equipment or training, to handle a situation of this type.” Equipment is different and improved. In 1971, the National Guard and Troopers had to turn to Juneau’s sporting goods stores for the gear they needed to work in the Chilkat Range. Now, Troopers and Guardsmen have prepackaged disaster kits that can be delivered by helicopter or aircraft to the scene of an accident. In August, the National Guard tested one of those kits, a 25-person “Arctic Sustainment Package” in an exercise designed to simulate a sinking cruise ship in the Bering Sea. Both agencies say they are better-equipped to handle the human aftermath as well. “Some of my people had some problems with it,” Charlie Smith recalled. One man, who had served during the Vietnam War, said the scene in the Chilkat Range was worse than anything he saw on the battlefield. Overseas, he hadn’t had to cope with the body parts of friends and neighbors. He later asked Smith for a letter of support as he sought federal disability for post-traumatic stress disorder. “Back in those days, they probably didn’t get into drugs, but some of them got into alcohol and stuff like that,” Smith remembered. “Back then, maybe you visited the chaplain because you were having issues or because you were concerned,” Stratton said. Now, “we have (critical stress) instructors who are specifically trained in this arena. When they come back out of the field, they’ll be received by the same group.” A disaster, as it turns out, can affect even the uninjured. An unforgettable album Robert Mottram has retired from the Associated Press. Now living in Anacortes, Washington, he writes books – one about dogs, another about RV-ing across America. During our conversation, he said he distinctly remembers a photo album found by then-state Sen. Bill Ray, who visited the crash site during the recovery. “I stood and looked over his shoulder as he flipped through the pages,” Mottram said. “It soon became apparent that this album belonged to a little girl, a little Native girl who was in a lot of the pictures. It was full of family shots and as we proceeded through the pages, it became apparent who the little girl was,” he said. She was one of the students traveling to Mount Edgecumbe boarding school in Sitka from the North Slope. Mottram said he and Ray concluded that the girl had taken the album with her because she wanted to introduce her school friends to her family, “or, she was taking it because she was going to be homesick and she wanted to bring a part of her family with her.” Alaskans and the world have learned from Flight 1866. Aviation is demonstrably safer and more reliable. “Absolutely,” Egan said. “I’m no pilot, but I can guarantee it.” Mottram said he knows it too, but he also can’t help but think about the price of the lesson. “There were young people who would be alive,” he said. “Those people are still dead, and they probably wouldn’t be yet. When you think about the kids and you think about the potential there, that’s potential we are lacking now. We should still be benefiting now.” “Your mind absolutely refuses to compute,” Ray wrote in the Juneau Empire following the crash. “You breath deeply – again and again – trying to compose your stunned emotions and with an intense effort you barely manage to curb the insane desire to run away – blindly – anywhere, just away. You shudder, blink back the rapidly forming tears, and once again look downward in abject futility at the still and unmoving forms. Why, Dear Lord, why. “ Copyright 2016 Associated Press.

Full Site Menu Jeff Bezos unveils new rocket to compete with SpaceX 2 months ago / Reuters CAPE CANAVERAL – Jeff Bezos on Monday unveiled a heavy-lift reusable rocket expected to compete against Elon Musk’s SpaceX and other companies for commercial satellite launches before the end of the decade. Bezos’ Kent, Washington-based Blue Origin space company is designing two versions of the rocket, named New Glenn, a nod to John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and the last surviving member of NASA’s original Mercury Seven astronauts. “New Glenn is designed to launch commercial satellites and to fly humans into space,” Bezos, also the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc, said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday. Both versions of New Glenn will use a first stage powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines. The company is building a launch site and test facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and a rocket manufacturing plant at NASA’s adjacent Kennedy Space Centre. Blue Origin also intends to sell the BE-4 to United Launch Alliance for its new Vulcan rocket. ULA is a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Blue Origin intends to fly New Glenn’s first stage back to a landing pad so it can be refurbished and reflown, an approach that fellow tech billionaire entrepreneur Musk is taking with his Falcon rockets. SpaceX so far has successfully landed rockets six times, twice on the ground and four times on a platform floating in the ocean. SpaceX had expected to try a seventh landing on 3 September, but its rocket was destroyed during a routine prelaunch test two days before lift-off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The cause of the accident, which destroyed a $200 million Space Communication Ltd satellite, is under investigation. Blue Origin has been testing a smaller, reusable rocket and spaceship called New Shepard, which is intended to fly paying passengers to an altitude of about 62 miles (100km) so they can experience a few minutes of microgravity and see the limb of Earth set against the blackness of space. Blue Origin has not yet started selling tickets for rides. If test flights continue as expected, Blue Origin pilots could begin flying next year, with paying passengers to follow in 2018, Bezos told Reuters during an interview earlier this year.
