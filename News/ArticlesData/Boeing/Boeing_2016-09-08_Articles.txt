Until now, passengers traveling between Washington and Morocco had to fly through New York -- RAM's first US destination, or catch a different connecting flight abroad. "Royal Air Maroc is thrilled to launch the only non-stop service between Washington, DC and Casablanca. We are equally excited about deploying the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 on this important route," said Mr. Abdelhamid Addou, Royal Air Maroc's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in a release. "Royal Air Maroc's new Boeing 787 Dreamliner service to Casablanca, Morocco, provides passengers another important destination from Dulles International, the region's international gateway airport," said Mike Stewart, the Vice President of Airline Business Development at Washington Dulles International Airport. Seattle-based Boeing has had a presence in Morocco since at least 2001, when the company became a co-founder of Morocco Aero-Technical Interconnect Systems (MATIS) Aerospace, which produces parts and engines for Boeing jets and employs 850 people in Casablanca. Boeing is just one of many US companies with strong commercial ties to the United States. In fact export data pulled from the International Trade Administration (ITA) shows that average US exports to Morocco have more than tripled since the US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect just over a decade ago. In the three years before the FTA (2003-2005), US exports to Morocco averaged $482 million; in the past three years (2013-2015), they increased 328 percent to $2.1 billion. The US's biggest exports to Morocco include petroleum, aerospace and automotive parts, and food products; and the US imports primarily fertilizer, electric machinery, and certain agricultural products from the country. In recent years, Morocco has successfully positioned itself as a gateway for US companies to African and European markets, and through aggressive economic reforms has become a top destination for foreign direct investment in Africa. Earlier this year, Morocco was named by the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index among the 50 most innovative economies in the world and one of just two such in Africa. The results echoed the findings of many industry reports of recent years. In 2014, the Wall Street Journal's Frontiers/FSG Frontier Markets Sentiment Index reported that Morocco is among the top ten frontier markets -- and the only one in the Maghreb -- most favored by foreign corporations. KPMG International and Oxford Economics' 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) ranked Morocco as the most "change-ready" country in the Maghreb, with particularly positive results in the category of "enterprise capability." The World Bank's Doing Business 2016 report ranked Morocco first out of 20 MENA countries in terms of "ease of starting a business" and placed it sixth overall in the region for "ease of doing business." "This direct connection has been centuries in the making. Morocco is quite literally the US's oldest friend, and houses the only US National Historic Landmark located in a foreign country. Morocco was the first country to recognize US independence and continues to be a strong ally and partner," said former US Ambassador to Morocco Edward M. Gabriel. The Moroccan American Center for Policy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. This material is distributed by the Moroccan American Center for Policy on behalf of the Government of Morocco. Additional information is available at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.

News Business Business News British Airways; Bank of England; Thomas Cook: Business news in brief, Friday September 9 2016 Airline scales back expansion; Bank says it won't stifle burgeoning financial technology industry with rules; Travel agent shares boosted by Chinese venture  Ben Chapman Friday 9 September 2016 15:10 BST British Airways owner IAG is to scale back orders for new planes Reuters British Airways Owner IAG ponders reducing orders IAG, the owner of British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, is considering reining in expansion plans as worldwide economic growth slows and the company grapples with the effects of the Brexit vote. “Without doubt all airlines, including airlines within IAG, are reassessing their requirements for new aircraft,” as the outlook for growth has “softened,” Willie Walsh, BA chief executive said on Thursday. “I don’t think we’re going to see growth rates that were anticipated.” The comments reflect a tougher sales environment for plane manufacturers. Airbus and Boeing racked up their lowest tally of aircraft orders in six years at the aviation industry’s annual showcase this summer. While both firms sit on huge order backlogs, that cushion could provide little protection if headwinds continue and airlines start to feel the pinch from lower fares. IAG, which also owns Irish carrier Aer Lingus, ordered 20 single-aisle Airbus A320neo planes a year ago, and Mr Walsh outlined plans earlier this year to buy used widebody Boeing 777s and lease Airbus’s double-decker A380s for British Airways.  Following the UK vote in late June to quit the European Union, Mr Walsh said IAG will have to cut spending amid a plunge in the pound’s exchange rate and a slowdown in traffic growth as business customers scale back travel. Corporate customers are still holding off on business trips as they analyse how the Brexit vote will affect Britain’s economy and currency, Mr Walsh said on Thursday. Another question carriers must consider with plane orders is the drop in the price of oil in recent years, and “whether it’s worth buying this new-technology aircraft to get the fuel-cost advantage,” he said. Bloomberg New fintech rules won’t stifle innovation, says BoE The Bank is grappling with how to regulate fintech(Getty) The Bank of England will not “stifle” innovation in financial technology with new rules as it seeks to get to grips with its impact, a senior central bank official said on Thursday. Victoria Cleland, the BoE’s chief cashier, said a priority for the central bank this year was devising its regulatory approach to so-called fintech. It was looking at the risks and benefits of applications including digital currencies and blockchain, a tamper-proof shared ledger that can automatically process and settle transactions using computer algorithms. Ms Cleland’s reassurances over regulation come at a time when British policymakers are looking for any signs that fintech firms in London, which has become a global hub for the sector, will move to mainland Europe. Fintech firms have expressed worries they could be cut off from the single market once Britain leaves the bloc. Berlin has already begun a marketing drive to attract fintech firms from the British capital. Ms Cleland said firms in the fast-growing fledgling sector want to know where the goalposts will be and the BoE was working with them. “It’s very difficult to decide how to regulate something you don’t quite know what it is,” she told a conference on peer-to-peer lending, adding fintech was a global industry and a similar approach was needed by other regulators. The Financial Stability Board, a global watchdog chaired by BoE Governor Mark Carney, is looking at whether using blockchain for processes such as settling transactions could undermine financial systems and if any new rules are needed. Reuters Thomas Cook shares surge on China travel venture The travel company is targetting the wealthiest chinese tourists (Getty) Thomas Cook, Europe’s second-biggest tour operator, set up a high-end Chinese travel agency with minority shareholder Fosun International in a bid to capture a more lucrative slice of China’s booming tourism market. The shares rose to their highest in more than three months. The agency will sell overseas holidays to the wealthiest 20 per cent of Chinese travellers, and guide them beyond Europe’s obvious destinations, as Thomas Cook aims to make China a “substantial” part of its business, Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook chief executive  said in an interview with Bloomberg News in Shanghai. Thomas Cook shares, which have lost 38 per cent this year, rose as much as 7.3 per cent yesterday, bringing the company’s market value to £1.2bn. The companies are betting that China’s outbound tourism market – the largest in the world – can help drive growth in Europe, where travel has been depressed by recent terror attacks and the UK’s vote to leave the EU. Fosun, a unit of a Shanghai-based conglomerate backed by billionaire Guo Guangchang, said it expects the number of Chinese travelling outside the country to grow by as much as 20 per cent annually. Fosun, which owns 8.2 per cent of Thomas Cook, will use its resources globally to support the tour operator’s online travel services. Its financial muscle will ease restrictions on Thomas Cook’s expansion plans, which have been hampered by stretched finances. In July, the 180 year-old company cut earnings forecasts for 2016 after a string of terror attacks across Europe depressed summer travel. Bloomberg Dixons Carphone shrugs off Brexit Dixons Carphone was positive about its outlook despite Brexit (Getty) Dixons Carphone, Britain’s biggest consumer electricals and mobile phone retailer, reported better than expected first-quarter sales on Thursday and said it had not seen any impact on demand from Junes Brexit vote. Shares in the company, which trades as Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse, have fallen 12 per cent in the past three months given its exposure to big ticket goods, and perceived vulnerability to any slide in consumer demand. In the 13 weeks to 30 July, Dixons Carphone, which also trades as Elkjop and El Giganten in Nordic nations and Kotsovolos in Greece, said sales at stores open more than a year rose 4 per cent, beating forecasts of 2.5 per cent, thanks to strong sales of mobiles, televisions and domestic appliances. Though the shock Brexit vote stunned markets, they have since recovered and consumers, who drove the country’s recovery after the financial crisis, appear to have largely taken the referendum result in their stride for now. Data has suggested the economy has not suffered the kind of devastating impact forecast by some Remain supporters in advance of the 23 June referendum, although some economists say it is heading for a sharp slowdown. “We’re not experiencing anything at the moment, we’re full steam ahead for peak [Christmas] and Black Friday (25 November). If the consumer environment changes then we’ll trim our sales to match,” Seb James, Dixons Carphone chief executive said. “We’ve just got to take the world as we find it. We’re absolutely on the lookout and preparing ourselves in case something like that should happen,” he told reporters. Reuters Zoopla earnings at top end of range despite market uncertainty Property website Zoopla said annual earnings would hit the top end of forecasts, boosted by a higher number of property listings and growth in its price comparison service, confounding predictions that Brexit would freeze the market. Zoopla’s positive update matched the confident outlooks from British house builders Barratt Developments and Redrow in recent days. Housing market strength was also apparent in data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which said on Thursday that its monthly house price index jumped to +12 in August, from July’s three-year low of +5, the first rise in six months.

Reuters Amazon adds Alexa to discounted Fire tablet  Amazon wants to be under lots of Christmas trees this year. It’s cut the price of its new Fire tablet almost in half and added its popular voice assistant, Alexa, in the hope of making it a hot holiday item, despite a slump in overall tablet sales. The new Fire HD8 tablet will cost £70, down from £120. Mixed-use battery life is up to 12 hours from eight, and the base storage is doubled to 16 gigabytes. The biggest change is that the tablet will have Alexa functionality. That means that when users tap and hold the tablet’s home button, they can ask the assistant for anything from weather reports to news queries, and also get the device do things like adjusting the lights or temperature on compatible smart-home devices. The tablet market in general has been decreasing. Most people have already bought one who wanted one and see little reason to upgrade.  AP Small businesses get Facebook tools  Facebook is expanding its services to small businesses that want to sell to customers in other countries. The social media company said on Thursday it’s adding features to its small business sites that allow companies to search for and advertise to customers in other countries. Businesses will be able to choose which countries they want to target, and can aim at customers in specific regions or the entire world. The features will be available to small businesses around the world.  Sixty million businesses have Facebook pages, and more than 1bn people using the social media site are connected to at least one business in another country, the company said. In the US, more than 60 per cent of Facebook users are connected to a company in another country. Catalysts for the expansion included data that showed Facebook users and small businesses are increasingly engaging in cross-border transactions, the company said.  AP Playboy can block picture links, landmark ruling says Playboy’s Dutch publisher can stop a news and entertainment website from posting links to its images without permission, a top EU court said in a ruling that could reverberate across the internet. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said GeenStijl, owned by GS Media, broke copyright laws when it published links to pictures of TV personality Britt Dekker without the permission of Sanoma Oyj’s Dutch unit, which runs Playboy in the Netherlands. Thursday’s ruling, which guides a Dutch court making a final decision in the dispute, says the website may fall foul of copyright rules because the links were posted for profit in the full knowledge that the photos were published online without consent. “An eye on profit, that’s something dirty, according to the European clowns,” GeenStijl said in a statement on its website. “The consequence is that from now on, you always run the risk of being sued, just for placing a hyperlink.” Bloomberg More about: British Airways Bank Of England Mark Carney fintech Thomas Cook Dixons Carphone Brexit Zoopla Amazon Facebook Playboy EU Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Copyright Getty Images Advertisement Boeing Co. is studying two designs for its so-called Max 10, a potential stretch of its largest 737 aimed at making up ground on Airbus Group SE’s longest single-aisle jet, according to people familiar with the plans. One option Boeing (IW 500/9) has discussed with airlines and lessors in recent weeks is a simple lengthening of the 737 Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of Airbus’s A321neo, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The company is also vetting an alternative, more elaborate revamp that would feature the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. The more straightforward redesign, which would rely on upgrading engines developed for the Max family, would enter the market by early 2020, while the more complex one wouldn’t begin service until almost two years later. Airbus, meanwhile, has already received almost 1,300 orders for the A321neo, with a long-range version scheduled to begin commercial operation in 2019. Boeing definitely needs to do something." — Dimitroff, head of valuations, Flightglobal’s Ascend Consultancy “Boeing definitely needs to do something,” said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flightglobal’s Ascend Consultancy. “The market wants a choice, not an Airbus monopoly, so they can continue to have access to competitive pricing.” Chicago-based Boeing has struggled for years to find an answer to the A321, and the quandary has grown this decade as the out-of-production 757 has started to fade from airline fleets. Airbus redesigned its largest narrow-body to cruise seven hours from Europe to North America, or cram in as many as 240 people. Its versatility is a crucial reason why the A320 family has outsold the 737, Boeing’s biggest source of profit, by about 1,000 orders, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Eroding Market Share at the Top Both planemakers have benefited as low-cost carriers gravitate to larger narrow-body aircraft to keep pace with capacity growth. The most popular market segment remains the 160-seat sector served by Boeing’s 737-8 and its midsize Airbus counterpart. But A321neo sales have surged over the last two years, increasing the pressure on Boeing to address its eroding market share at the top of the narrow-body market. Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things “We continue to look at the higher end of the Max family,” Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing, said in an e-mail. “The needs of our airline customers as well as the business case will drive our decision and timing.” The manufacturer declined to elaborate on the latest studies for a larger 737. The board must sign off on any new variant before the company can formally market the plane to customers. Airbus' Extra Eight Feet Airbus has a size advantage and operating economics advantage because the A321 can squeeze more travelers into a frame that is eight feet (2.4 meters) longer than the Max 9, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018. The challenge in extending the 737’s fuselage lies in overcoming the limits of a design dating to the 1960s: The plane has smaller turbines than the A321neo because it rides closer to the ground when on the tarmac. But any redesign can’t be so expensive and difficult to manufacture that it bogs down production of the 737. It’s not the monumental engineering challenge that people assume." — Mike Delaney, Boeing vice president of airplane development “This is not a trivial stretch because it will require increasing engine thrust and changing the landing gear,” Douglas Harned, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said of the Max 10 in a Sept. 6 report. “While this would be much less expensive than a new airplane or a major new derivative, it is still a significant modification. It is unclear if the payback would be there.” As the first 737 Max 8 jets glide through flight-testing ahead of a 2017 debut, Boeing and engine-maker CFM have gained confidence that they can reap enough extra thrust from the plane’s existing Leap-1B engines to speed to market a new, longer variant with relatively uncomplicated landing gear, the people said. Jamie Jewell, a spokeswoman for CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA, declined to comment.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Confirmed: PIA to Get Eight New Boeing 787 Dreamliners 5.4kShares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Aamir Attaa 2 months ago Pakistan International Airline has confirmed to induct eight new fuel efficient 787 Dreamliners to its fleet with deliveries starting as early as mid next year. This started when President and CEO of Boeing wrote a letter to Prime Minister of Pakistan earlier in August and offered the lease of multiple 787 Dreamliners. Boeing had then invited Pakistani government to get its latest flagship 787 Dreamliner jets. The airliner maker had also extended all sorts of support for a smooth transition and adoption of new jets. Now we are getting reports that PIA is determined to get eight 787 dreamliners as a BBC journalist confirmed the news on his twitter. Breaking: PIA to get 8 @boeing 787 dream liners with deliveries due from mid next year. The chairman just told me exclusively. — Tahir Imran Mian ✈ (@TahirImran) September 5, 2016 Boeing 787 Dreamliners are billed as most fuel efficient jets and are used for both long and mid-range routes. It maybe recalled that PIA just retired its five A310s with an aim to replace them with better airliners. PIA has been making efforts lately to revive its glory by targeting both economy and premium customers. PIA’s Premier Service, with all modern in-flight facilities, is particularly an effort to bring back premium flyers. Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size widebody plane that comes with up to 335 passenger capacity in various configurations. PIA will use these new aircraft for its long-haul routes to Europe, US and East Asia. It won’t be out of mention that Boeing has struggled selling its 787 Dreamliners due to a battery fiasco that it claims to have fixed now. 5.4kShares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint HassaanM Apart from the battery issues the Rolls Royce engines used by 787 are prone to engine failures due to the fatigue cracking of turbine blades. Only a week ago Japan’s biggest airline, ANA, grounded all 100 Dreamliners in its fleet because of incidents of engine failure. So, I don’t think it is prudent to invest in these planes until Boeing has sorted out all the kinks. No wonder they are being all cozy about this deal. Raja Maja Hassaan news is not “Japan’s biggest airline, ANA, grounded all 100 Dreamliners in its fleet because of incidents of engine failure”. News would be if all the current orders of 787 got cancelled due to this a week ago engine failure. Do you think they are stupid enough to let this problem go with new production? HassaanM They don’t make their engines. They just put them into the plane. As of now there are three variants with the 787 – RR Trent 1000. RR Trent 1000 TEN, and General Electric GEnx. Its the Trent 1000 that has been causing all the problems while the 1000 TEN is in testing phase. Lets see which engine comes with our planes. Mr U Asar Besides engine issues are not of Boeing, but of Rolls Royce, Pakistani engineers prefer General Electric, so expect GE-NX coming with 787’s delivered to Pakistan, not Trent 1000’s HassaanM Don’t about the individual preference of our engineers but GEnx is a way better choice than the Trents because General Electric has been working with Boeing for eons and are their primary engine provider. Jawad Nazir ✈ That’s not right, ANA is still operating 787’s. I just saw one parked at SYD. Raja Maja Aamir Atta would be in dilemma (being PoTIan) “Oh yeh taraqqi kahan say agai” ha ha ha :o aamir7 Jee Waqayi, I am about to commit suicide :D Bilal Iqbal suicide or suicide attack … :P Detective go for suicide attack , atleast paisay tw milein gey Ishtiaq Koi aur nahi bas “shairrrrrr…. Shair…. Shairrr”. Gabbar to crash in yet another building in US?? Bilal Iqbal jets are Built … NOT Billed… :P Muhammad Zaman If the world is grounding these planes then why these are being inducted in PIA only on request letter from Boeing? Why not to induct 10 years old 20 Boeing 777 for the same price and put surplus PIA employees on job? We have the capability of overhauling 777s. Can somebody please elucidate? Mr U Asar It’s not buying, actually trading the 777 with 787, refer to the letter sent to PM by Boeing. Kazim Nice design.

At first light, it looks like Mexico would be the big loser. Exports and imports represent 64 per cent of GDP. Exports are 31 per cent of GDP, and 77 per cent of these embarkations go to the United States. There is no doubt that the end of NAFTA would be a blow. However, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the US stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico was US$107.8 billion in 2015, while the Mexican stock of FDI in the US was US$17.7 billion. The interesting thing is that the stock of FDI is valued at historical levels. The current market value is probably much higher. Therefore, which country is going to be the big loser? The answer is not Mexico. Looks are deceiving These two candidates point to the huge amount of Mexican exports that enter the US, but what they don't explain is that much of this trade is intercompany. In other words, Boeing's plant in Queretaro sells airplane components to the company's main assembly facility in Everett, Washington. The exports appear to be Mexican, but they really belong to Boeing, an American firm. Indeed, many US companies are competitive on a global scale, thanks to low-cost Mexican operations which provide essential components for their high-tech products. Losing these inputs would make these US firms uncompetitive, thus leading to the loss of high-paid jobs. What Trump and Sanders don't say is that US firms have been the main beneficiaries from the vast array of trade treaties. The US automotive industry was one of the main drivers behind NAFTA. The concept was born out of the Automotive Products Trade Agreement (APTA) that was signed with Canada in 1965. Although labour productivity and the education levels of these two countries are similar, Canada had been gravitating towards universal health care during the early 1960s. By moving labour-intensive activities north of the border, US automobile companies were able to slash costs - given that the Canadian government had assumed responsibility for the provision of health benefits. Soon, the Big Three automotive groups were the most powerful lobbyists fighting to support Canada's universal health-care programme. Unfortunately, the auto sector suffered an expensive setback during the early 1970s, when US President Nixon passed legislation enacting the Environmental Protection Agency. The new agency introduced sweeping regulation to clean up the environment, which became an onerous burden for many industries. This created an impetus for the Big Three to move the environmentally challenging parts of the manufacturing process to friendlier locations. Fortunately, Mexico was close by and ready to welcome the factories. Once the operations relocated south of the border, the companies took advantage of other favourable factors, such as cheap labour costs, compliant unions and lower health/pension benefits. US the big winner Hence, US companies have been the winners from the various trade agreements and they will have the most to lose if they are abrogated. Mexican factories are fully integrated with US industry. The end of NAFTA will deliver a debilitating blow to these operations, triggering a massive downgrade of earnings and a punishing writedown of assets. What Trump and Sanders fail to understand is that bringing back a handful of low-paying jobs will not justify the debilitating blow that will be delivered to the US economy. At the same time, Mexican businessmen will have a unique opportunity to buy top-of-the-line facilities, with cutting-edge technologies and well-trained employees at cut-rate prices. It would also be an opportunity for Mexico to delink itself from the US and open its trade relations with the rest of the world. Less than a decade ago, the Mexican economy was pushed into an unnecessary recession because of the collapse of the US housing bubble, even though there was nothing wrong at home. There is a saying among Mexican economists that when the US sneezes, Mexico catches pneumonia. Delinking itself from the US would allow Mexico to diversify across a wider spectrum of trade partners where it is no longer considered to be a second-class citizen. There is no doubt that the end of NAFTA would be painful, but the floating exchange rate regime would mitigate the blow. Therefore, the US should be careful what it wishes for, because it might just come true. - Dr Walter T.

ROS LBoard 1 ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Three abandoned planes in Senai airport up for auction FMT Reporters | September 9, 2016 The Boeing aircraft, which have been ‘parked’ at the airport for the last 10 years, are being auctioned off for RM5.3 million each. PETALING JAYA: Three Boeing 747 aircraft, which have been sitting idle at the Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru for the last 10 years, are being auctioned off for scrap. The 30-year-old planes – two cargo and one commercial – could be yours for “only” RM5.3 million each, reported The Star today. According to the report, the aircraft, which belonged to an American-based company were brought in to the state for an aviation venture that never took off. The planes were previously worth about RM120 million each, but have gathered dirt and soot after 10 years of being exposed to the elements. Its owner also owes the airport more than RM1 million in parking charges. The airport had taken the planes’ owner to court and won the case, hence the auction. A Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) spokesperson told the daily that the planes could be foreign-registered and there were guidelines to be fulfilled if the registrations were to be changed to a Malaysian one. Senai airport officials declined to comment when contacted by the daily. This is not the first time planes have been found abandoned at airports. In December last year, Malaysia Airport Holdings Bhd (MAHB) put up advertisements in newspapers to trace owners of three Boeing 747-200F cargo jets parked at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for more than a year. The ads said that if the owner failed to “collect” the aircraft within 14 days of the date of the notice, MAHB reserved the right to sell or dispose of the aircraft under Malaysian regulations. Swift Air Cargo Chief Executive Officer Capt Blue Peterson subsequently came forward to claim ownership of the planes, and, according to The Star report, a legal settlement over the case was still pending. There was another similar case in Subang Airport, in 2014, but the MAHB managed to trace the plane’s owner and returned it, after necessary payments had been made.

The deal covers the systems engineering and logistic support planning required for production acceptance testing and evaluation of the DSU-42/B precision laser guidance set and the KMU-558 series guidance set of the GBU-56(V)4/B PGM as well as integration for Navy and USMC F/A-18. GBU-56s are cleared for carriage on the Boeing F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16, F/A-18, McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier, Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, Rockwell B-1B Lancer, Boeing B-52H Stratofortress, Panavia Tornado, and Eurofighter Typhoon. The DoD’s chief weapons buyer has estimated that a new intercontinental ballistic missile to replace the Minuteman III will cost at least $85 billion to develop and field. In a memo to USAF Secretary Deborah James, Frank Kendall cited figures generated by the Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office, which are about 36% more than a preliminary estimate by the service. The figure will be reassessed in “March 2018 once missile designs are more advanced, technical risks are reduced and the service has a better understanding of overall costs.” Raytheon has received an $8.8 million DoD contract to upgrade the Center Display Unit (CDU) on 130 F-16 fighters. The retrofit is expected to be completed by September 2017. Raytheon’s CDU won the favor of the USAF in late 2012, when it was endorsed as the F-16’s primary flight reference (PFR) system. Middle East & North Africa Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training has received a $39 million contract modification in connection to two Jordanian F-16 training centers. Under the deal, the company will provide at least two Fighting Falcon air combat training centers and logistical support with completion of contract due for September 2020. Israel’s Space Communications (Spacecom) Ltd and Beijing Xinwei Technology Group have given themselves 30 days to salvage a deal that was contingent on the launch of a satellite destroyed in an explosion last week. The Chinese group had agreed last month to purchase Spacecom for $285 million, pending the successful launch and operation of Spacecom’s $200 million Amos-6 communications satellite. Instead, the failure of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last week has caused stock market turmoil and a reexamination of the future deal. Europe Russia’s Deputy Minister for Defense Yuri Borisov has said that the Sukhoi PAK-FA is ready for mass production with Moscow planning to acquire a squadron of aircraft in 2017. Equipped with advanced avionics and all-digital flight systems, the PAK-FA is set to become the first operational stealth aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces. An export version is expected to be available by 2025. Germany’s defense minister has called for a European “defense union” in the face of a more aggressive Russia and worsening conflicts in the Middle East. Ursula von der Leyen’s comments were made during a visit to Lithuania, where Berlin is preparing to lead a battle group of about 1,000 troops as a deterrence against neighboring Russia. Calling the union a “Schengen of defense,” von der Leyen added that such a union “is what the Americans expect us to do.” Asia Pacific BAE Systems is debuting its CV90 Infantry Fighting Vehicle at this week’s Land Forces 2016 Exhibition in Australia. The company is working in conjunction with Patria to offer the IFV to Canberra as part of the government’s request for information on the LAND 400 Phase 3 program. Nine CV90 variants are currently in service, and more than 1,280 vehicles have been sold to seven European nations.

Boeing is analysing two potential designs for a plane that is expected to be called the 737 MAX 10 and would be the largest aircraft in the 737 line. Boeing has held recent discussions with airlines and aircraft leasing firms to gauge interest in such a plane, said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and confirmed a Bloomberg News report. Such a plane would address an important gap between the 737 MAX 9, which can transport 200 travellers and the Airbus plane, which holds up to 240 passengers. The A321Neo has given the edge to the European giant in the lucrative market for middle-range planes, with orders running about 1,000 above those for Boeing’s 737 line, according to data released by the companies. “We continue to look at the higher end of the MAX family,” said Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. “The needs of our airline customers, as well as the business case, will drive our decision and timing.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Movie accent expert breaks down 32 actors’ accents Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Boeing sees US$2.1b cost on 787 dreamliners, air tanker Boeing eyes rivals as it turns 100 Ganti cermin retak, Rayani Air terpaksa sewa pesawat Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737 MAX jet completes first flight (VIDEO) Aircraft leasing firm BOC Aviation places order for 22 Boeing B737s Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Credit: SpaceX artist's concept and Boeing KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — The two companies developing commercial crew transportation systems for NASA are experiencing problems that will likely push back the beginning of regular flights until at least late 2018, an agency report warned. The report by the NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG), released Sept. 1, also concluded that those delays may force NASA to purchase additional seats on Russian Soyuz flights to and from the International Space Station, the cost of which has grown significantly over the last decade. The report argued that while previous delays in the overall commercial crew development program could be blamed on funding shortfalls, more recent delays have their roots in technical problems both Boeing and SpaceX are experiencing in the development of the respective vehicles, the CST-100 Starliner and Crew Dragon. "While past funding shortfalls have contributed to the delay, technical challenges are now driving schedule slippages," the report stated. "Notwithstanding the contractors' optimism, based on the information we gathered during our audit, we believe it unlikely that either Boeing or SpaceX will achieve certified, crewed flight to the ISS until late 2018." As of June, Boeing had completed 15 of 34 milestones in its Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract with NASA, valued at $1.067 billion, according to the report. The company has experienced problems, though, with the CST-100's development, including mass growth and aeroacoustical loads on its Atlas 5 rocket during launch. Earlier this year, Boeing delayed an uncrewed test flight of the spacecraft to December 2017 and a crewed test flight — likely to carry one NASA astronaut and one Boeing test pilot — until February 2018. SpaceX, according to the report, has completed eight of 21 milestones under its CCtCap contract and received $469 million. Its issues with Crew Dragon stem in large part from a design change from a spacecraft that would land on dry land to one that will splash down. "This resulted in significant challenges, including complications with vendor components and the effectiveness of the integrated landing system designed to ensure parachutes work and the capsule does not take on excessive water after landing in the ocean," the report stated. The report added that SpaceX, which was planning uncrewed and crewed test flights in mid-2017, was encountering issues with several other vehicle subsystems, including the spacecraft's parachutes and the tunnel allowing the crew to move between the Dragon and the ISS. SpaceX also hadn't completed all the milestones associated with a critical design review. "Accordingly, we anticipate additional schedule slippage and do not expect certified flights by SpaceX earlier than late 2018," the report stated. That assessment came before the Sept. 1 pad accident at Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral that destroyed a Falcon 9 and its satellite payload and damaged pad infrastructure. While commercial crew missions will launch from Launch Complex 39A here, the investigation into the failure could delay upcoming launches, including commercial crew test flights. SpaceX argued in the report that a prior Falcon 9 launch failure in June 2015 did not have a major effect on its commercial crew work. "Although SpaceX officials told us that the [2015] mishap has not delayed its crew development efforts because it had built sufficient margin into the schedule," the OIG report stated, "they also noted the lack of margin remaining to accommodate any additional unexpected issues that may arise." A delay to late 2018, and the possibility of additional delays, could require NASA to purchase additional Soyuz flight services, which currently run through 2018. The report noted that the price of Soyuz seats charged to NASA by Roscosmos has increased by 384 percent since NASA first acquired seats in 2006, to nearly $82 million for six seats in 2018. The NASA Advisory Council, meeting in Cleveland in July, expressed similar concerns about needing to buy additional Soyuz seats, adding that NASA would likely need to make a decision soon. "Due to the long lead time to procure Soyuz seats, a decision must be made really very shortly — before the end of 2016 — to guarantee access to the ISS in 2019," said Wayne Hale, interim chairman of the council's human exploration and operations committee, at the July 28 meeting, "or we may be forced to reduce or possibly eliminate its crew complement." NASA had planned to hold a commercial crew update here Sept. 6 in advance of the Sept. 8 launch of the agency's OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. Media arriving at the center for the event were told the event was canceled, without explanation. Originally published on SpaceNews.

Opinion Readers React Opinion Boeing bonuses: earned or excessive? MIssile Defense Gene Blevins / Zumapress.com Spectators and military personnel watch a Jan. 28 missile defense test launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Spectators and military personnel watch a Jan. 28 missile defense test launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. (Gene Blevins / Zumapress.com) To the editor: Isn’t this exactly the corruption lurking in the military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned about? ( “Boeing wins big bonuses after failures,” Sept. 4) My heart sinks when I think of the national treasure that has been squandered for decades on gold-plated, ineffective weapons programs such as this. Thank you so much for unearthing this colossal waste of public money. Kent Strumpell, Los Angeles :: To the editor:  So, Boeing has developed a missile that travels at 4 miles a second, that can hit a missile coming at the United States at probably about the same speed, a target which is only about the size of a bus.

I suggest that we buy fewer tanks, fighter planes and ships (used in the last century’s wars) and buy 300 of these antimissiles. On the bonus to Boeing, it’s less than 10%. The company earned it. Jeffrey Pierce, Torrance :: To the editor: Boeing is indeed the master of spin. Billing the taxpayers for failure — no problem. But use these billions to clean up the highly contaminated site it is responsible for at the Santa Susana Field Lab? Nope. Nearby residents have been waiting for years for proper cleanup of the contaminated soil and water. Boeing did not have to wait for its unearned bonuses — why should residents have to wait and continue to fight for a healthy environment? Catherine Lincoln, Van Nuys :: To the editor: Like most readers, I am outraged, but perhaps for a different reason. The argument is that outsourcing provides superior results at lower costs. The problem is that senior government positions are too often held by bureaucrats rather than technocrats (people who understand what they are contracting for). Technical people will tell you that arcane procedures meant to protect against favoritism actually encourage it. Having different contractors write the requirements, determine the products/procedure the project should use, and implement the solution ensures that knowledge about the problem is compromised, if not lost. Also allowing a retiring bureaucrat to join a contracting firm one year (or 180 days in California) after leaving government pretty much explains to me how this drama unfolded. Keep it simple. My suggestions: Pay to hire technical managers who understand what they are purchasing, change the law so no one can leave the government and go to work for a contractor for seven or more years, and keep the bidding/purchasing process as simple as possible. Kay Hammer, Venice :: To the editor: The American taxpayers paid billions of dollars for a missile defense system that essentially doesn’t work, and then gave Boeing billions in bonuses. This is why I believe people vote for someone such as Donald Trump — not because he has any idea what he’s talking about, which he doesn’t; not because he tells the truth, which he apparently can’t; not because he’s the best one for the job, which he isn’t — but because they are so tired of this kind of corruption and ineptitude that they just say “screw it.” Such is the delicate architecture of history.

On behalf of "Boeing" R. Conner expressed his sincere and deep condolences to the Government and people of Uzbekistan in connection with the passing of the First President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov. The high level of mutually beneficial and long-term cooperation with "Boeing" in the field of civil aviation is the result of all-round support of joint projects by the First President of our country Islam Karimov. Today, "Boeing" is a reliable partner of Uzbekistan in the sphere of supply, operation and maintenance of modern passenger aircraft. National airline "Uzbekistan Airways" operates 15 Boeing aircraft, which provide more than half of all traffic of the NAC and make a significant contribution to the strengthening of its position as one of the largest and fastest growing airlines in the region. On the eve of the Independence Day, the park of the National airlines was supplemented with the most modern and comfortable aircraft Boeing – "787 Dreamliner." The new plane started its flights already on September 5, with the flights to Urgench, Bukhara, Nukus. From the next week it is planned to conduct international flights. In November of this year, Uzbekistan will receive the second "Dreamliner." Intensive collaboration is carried out in the field of training of flight personnel and specialists, including by equipping the training centre of our airline with complex equipment. A new joint project – the regional center for repair of large composite structural elements of modern aircraft on the base of aviation enterprise "Uzbekistan Airways technics” was launched in January this year. Raymond Conner expressed his sincere appreciation for the support of joint projects and assured of the readiness of the company to continue the mutually beneficial and fruitful cooperation with Uzbek partners.

(Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) Share Written by Aimee Groth Obsession Life as Laboratory September 08, 2016 Black Rock City, Nevada Just before dawn on Sept. 3, 2015, about 100 people gathered in the middle of the Nevada desert for a send-off party. It was a black-tie occasion, Burning-Man style: extravagant feather headdresses, black fishnet tights, white fur coats. They were there to bid a final farewell to Dan Fredinburg, aged 33, who had died four months earlier in an avalanche on Mt. Everest, triggered by the earthquake that killed thousands in Nepal. He had been there as part of an ambitious, some might say reckless mission: to get imagery from the summit of Everest for Google Street View, allowing anyone to see the panorama at the top of the world from within Google Maps. Fredinburg was head of privacy at Google X, the search giant’s “moonshots” division, and Everest was his own moonshot. He had narrowly evaded death on his first attempt to scale the mountain the year before, and had lobbied hard to win approval for a second expedition. And it was a group of like-minded thrill-seekers that largely orchestrated his send-off on the Nevada playa: Summit Series. The invitation-only organization’s stated mission is to “make no small plans,” and its members—totaling some 10,000 worldwide, though the core group is much smaller—elevate risk-taking above all else. Some are based in San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles, and some at the group’s headquarters: Powder Mountain in Eden, Utah, which its co-founders purchased for $40 million in 2013. Many are nomadic, embracing a carefree lifestyle, often fueled by a fortuitous tech IPO or acquisition. But they always find their way back to one another on the festival circuit, and Burning Man—a pop-up metropolis and rave in the desert that draws around 70,000 revelers—is one of those central points of reconnection. When the question “why?” is put before Fredinburg’s family and friends, many turn it around: “Why not?” In a community of risk takers, his endeavors were the status quo, something to aspire to. Indeed, far from deterring them, his death has galvanized Summit’s members to lean even harder into risk. Sitting on a broken couch at Summit’s Utah headquarters, a lodge overlooking the majestic Ogden Valley, Jeff Rosenthal, a Summit co-founder, said, “Attracting people like Dan is the greatest litmus test of whether we’re doing our job.” The Summit community gathered at Google engineer Dan Fredinburg’s memorial service in Napa Valley.

(Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) The path to Google Alfred Lin is a partner at Sequoia Capital, a venture firm that has invested in the most iconic entrepreneurs of our time, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and the PayPal Mafia (Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Max Levchin). He says the very best entrepreneurs, the truly unstoppable ones, all share a similar trait. “I’ve never met someone who is really well-adjusted who is an entrepreneur,” Lin explains. “They all have a chip on their shoulder, something to prove, and they do it.” Fredinburg certainly had something to prove. His parents, Paul Fredinburg, a bank appraiser, and Debbi Willis, a nurse, divorced when their son was young. He spent his school years in Arkansas, just on the periphery of the Deep South, with his mother and his older sister, Tricia, and summers with Tricia and their father and stepmother, Cathy, in Orange County, California. Fredinburg had a mischievous streak—his mother, he recalled, encouraged him to “break all the rules”—but his parents knew that he was smart and encouraged him to apply to the Arkansas School of Mathematics, Sciences and Arts (ASMSA), funded by Arkansas native President Bill Clinton. The school was his best chance at a life outside of Arkansas, but he risked getting kicked out for bad behavior. If not for a compassionate headmaster, his parents say, his life might have looked very different. “If he hadn’t graduated from ASMSA he wouldn’t have been accepted to the University of California system,” says Paul Fredinburg. “If he went back to the high school he was going to previously, he would have never been admitted.” At the University of California, Irvine, where he earned a computer science degree, his friends remember a very Southern Fredinburg—sometimes joking and playing into the stereotypes of the small-town Southern frat boy, but sometimes genuinely being one. “I don’t think he knew any different,” says Owen Egan, one of his fraternity brothers. “I don’t know how much exposure he had to other people his age at the time.” But UC Irvine was also where Fredinburg met someone who would turn out to be the key to his future: Alex Abelin, a student up the coast at Berkeley, whom he met at a fraternity event in 2002. Abelin would go on to work at Google, and when the two reconnected at a party a few years later, he recommended Fredinburg—by then working for Boeing’s Future Combat Systems division—for a job there. The sprawling, fast-growing tech giant, which he joined in October 2007, was arguably the perfect place for someone like Fredinburg to flourish. He was a skilled engineer; at Boeing he had developed a system to improve the security network even though he didn’t yet have a security clearance. But he also had a high emotional intelligence, a rare trait in Silicon Valley. (He never stopped honing it, either; after his death, his girlfriend Ashley Arenson discovered stacks of books on human psychology in his bedroom.) Combined, these two traits made him a powerhouse at hacking Google itself. Fredinburg got to know all the key players at the company, studying the organizational chart and determining who had influence where. “He would know everything about what was going on at Google, from politics to legal to pop culture,” says Nirdhar “Ninu” Khazanie, a Google product manager who was to become Fredinburg’s close lieutenant. Says Abelin: “Dan just knew how to beat systems. He was a master chess player. He knew the flaws and weaknesses of the people who interviewed him, and used that sixth sense against them so they felt he had to have a seat at the table. Once he got in, he did whatever he wanted.” That included making good use of the “20% time” that Google back then granted its employees to work on projects outside their core jobs. Paul and Cathy Fredinburg recall how their son always maxed out his travel budget and found ways to convince his managers to send him to exotic locations around the world, trips that he would segue into vacations. When Fredinburg married his college sweetheart Leslie Eggers in 2010, he negotiated his way to living in Zurich for a few months, which allowed for an extended European honeymoon. But as idyllic as the situation seemed, it wasn’t enough to ensure a happy marriage. Soon after returning to the states, Fredinburg and Eggers separated, though they never divorced. “That’s when Dan started [partying hard] and climbing mountains,” recalls Abelin. Alex Abelin speaking at Fredinburg’s Napa Valley memorial service. Abelin opened the most important doors in Fredinburg’s life—to Google, to Summit Series, to the people who would change the course of his life. (Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) Setting sights on Everest In October 2011, Fredinburg—by then one of the early members of Google’s privacy team—and a few other Googlers trekked to Everest Base Camp. They brought with them a wide-angle lens camera owned by the Google Street View team, which was busy capturing images of every road on the planet. The photos turned out to be good enough to publish. When he returned from the trip Fredinburg sent an email out to Google’s internal mountaineering group, asking if anyone wanted to join him on his next adventure. Only one person showed up to the video-conference: Michele Battelli, a member of the company’s Enterprise Search Group, who had just returned from a climbing trip in the Himalayan region of Ladakh in northwest India. The two had met some years before during an internal startup competition. They agreed to meet in Argentina in December 2011—less than a month later—to climb Mt. Aconcagua, one of the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each of the world’s seven continents. Although they nearly lost their toes, for fledgling mountaineers they fared well. Fredinburg again brought a Street View camera, and again the photos turned out well. Together he and Battelli co-founded a new team, which they called Google Adventures. Its mission: to scale and capture all Seven Summits for Street View. The photos from Mt. Aconcagua would be part of a portfolio that the two planned to use to make the ultimate pitch—asking Google to fund their expedition to Everest. First, though, Fredinburg needed some recovery time. Ever since separating from Eggers he had been operating at an extreme pace—climbing, partying, and experimenting with recreational drugs—and wanted to get grounded again. He asked Abelin to join him in doing a “Sober Q1” for the first quarter of 2012. Abelin agreed, and started inviting Fredinburg to charity galas in New York. At one of them he introduced Fredinburg to Amanda Slavin, a charismatic young woman who worked for the events team at Summit Series. Slavin recalls that Fredinburg was sporting a mohawk. He asked her why she found value in supporting charity when there were no clear returns. “He was kind of polarizing,” she says. “He had no real need or want to be a part of it. His mind was on logistics and engineering.” And yet, he was open to a new way of seeing things. “I told him that what I found is that when I do good, more comes back to me,” Slavin says. “A lightbulb went off for him.” By summer 2012, Fredinburg was ready for his next adventure. He and Battelli planned to scale Mt. Kilimanjaro that July—Africa’s highest peak, and the easiest of the Seven Summits to climb. Fredinburg even invited his younger half-sister, Megan Ezell, to join them, convincing her that it would be good for her college application. She agreed, and celebrated with the team by joining in a dance party once they reached the summit, watching as her brother jumped around in an orange “Pokey” cartoon character costume. So when Florian “Flo” Nagl, an online sales manager based in Google’s Dublin office—and arguably the best mountaineer in the company—sent out a message through the internal network asking if anyone wanted to join him in climbing Mt. Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe, Fredinburg and Battelli responded “yes” immediately. “In climbing terms [Kilimanjaro] is not a mountain, it’s a hike,” says Nagl. “Mt. Elbrus and Aconcagua are different; they require proper mountaineering. On these two mountains if you make a wrong decision it can be fatal.” Two other Googlers also opted in. At the last minute Battelli couldn’t make it, but the others continued with their plans. In August 2012, after a few days of partying, instigated by Fredinburg, the four trekked up Elbrus. It was brutal. One of the Googlers turned around early due to frostbite. For Fredinburg it was so physically and psychologically grueling that Nagl tied a leash around him and carried him the last 100 meters to the summit. “He had no orientation anymore, he was so altitude sick,” recalls Nagl, who is several inches shorter and has a slimmer frame. “On the summit he sank down. I got the [StreetView] equipment ready and told him to push the right buttons, and we got the collection in.” Fredinburg later joked about the experience on Facebook: “It didn’t feel badass,” he wrote to a friend. “It felt like I was absolutely going to die.” But the difficulty didn’t deter him. Instead, he was thrilled to have found such an experienced mountaineer in Nagl for his Seven Summits quest, and invited him to join the Google Adventures Team. He, Nagl and Battelli would go on to style themselves “the Three Musketeers.” “I’m the project manager,” Fredinburg told Nagl. “I’m the politician. I need someone on the ground to make sure it becomes a success. If one day we get to Everest I’ll make it happen, and you make sure we get to the summit.” The boy from rural Arkansas had come a long way. But he was about to take his skills to a whole new level. And once again his friend Alex Abelin would be the one to unlock the door. Dan 2.0 By the fall of 2012, Amanda Slavin—the Summit events team worker who had found Fredinburg “polarizing” when they first met—had left Summit to launch CatalystCreativ and produce events for Tony Hsieh, CEO of the online shoe store Zappos. As part of his own personal odyssey to reinvent business culture, Hsieh had launched the Downtown Project, an ambitious effort to revitalize the area around the Zappos headquarters in downtown Las Vegas. Hsieh wanted to attract enterprising, entrepreneurially minded people in the hope that they might contribute or invest in the area in some way. When Slavin invited Fredinburg to attend a retreat she and Hsieh called Catalyst Week, starting the week before Thanksgiving, he said yes. The week involved days of talks followed by nights of partying. The guest list consisted primarily of members of Summit Series. Invisible Children co-founder Bobby Bailey danced on stage to The Killers’ “All these things that I’ve done” as he talked about his organization’s campaign (later much criticized) against Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony. Adventure Project co-founder Becky Straw spoke about her mission to eradicate poverty. Fredinburg talked about patent trolls. (Google had offered pay bonuses for filing patents and he had filed a number of them.) The retreat culminated with an emotionally charged evening hosted by Slavin and Abelin. As part of a “vulnerability exercise,” attendees were invited to share their biggest weaknesses, or make a confession. Vulnerability is one of the key values of Summit Series, which likes to see itself as recognizing the shortcomings of the Silicon Valley myth. “In the tech space, there’s this success porn that’s propagated non-stop around unicorns,” says Andrew Horn, a Summit member and startup founder. “It creates this culture where everyone feels the need to propagate the image and aura of invincibility. Everyone is scared of sharing their struggle because they think it’ll alienate friends and investors.” Fredinburg, however, seemed conflicted. At one point he stood on the threshold, with one foot inside the room and the other outside in the hallway, scanning the room. His fraternity brothers happened to be in Vegas and were waiting for him out on the Strip, but he wanted to see what would happen next. Finally he made a choice, and stepped forward. “I feel like all of you guys have this incredible ability to feel all these emotions,” he said, eyes searching the room. “I have a Tin Man heart. A robot heart.” The engineer in Fredinburg was always looking for new ways to hack parts of his life, and now he was expressing a desire to reverse-engineer empathy. “In that moment when Dan spoke up, I decided I wanted to help that man find his heart,” says Nyla Rogers, founder of nonprofit Mama Hope. “He was looking for the biggest hearts that he knew, and he knew that we could help him.” Joining the Wolf Pack Fredinburg’s gesture sparked an initiation process. He was introduced to the Summit team and went on a New Year’s trip to Panama. There he met Sophia Bush, an actress who was one of Summit’s core members. She took to Fredinburg and invited him to attend one of the young organization’s traditions, Wolf Pack weekend, in early 2013. The tradition had begun a year earlier when the Summit founders invited around 50 of their closest friends, including Bush, to board a 737, and flew them to Eden, Utah. There they brought everyone to the top of Powder Mountain and told them they were going to buy the land and build a community there. The event’s guest list included those who were felt to embody the true Summit ethos. At first, the core group didn’t take well to Fredinburg. “Sophia brings Dan to Wolf Pack, Wolf Pack is family,” says Sean Carasso, founder of Falling Whistles, which campaigns for peace in the Congo. “It’s the nearest and dearest, the tried and true, the compatriots—and she brings Dan. In the beginning we’re like, ‘Who’s this clown?’ He was still so stiff. He was very engineer, very Google.” But Fredinburg’s relationship with Bush would be transformative. “Sophia completely changed the trajectory of Dan’s life,” says former Googler Max Goldstein. “This incredibly powerful, smart woman was madly in love with him and enabled him to operate at the highest levels of society and business.” Fredinburg, too, fell hard for Bush, and soon he was appearing on red carpets and gaining attention from paparazzi. The relationship also amplified Fredinburg’s pursuit of the Silicon Valley ideal. Bush introduced him to influential people. She also taught him, friends say, a skill that would stand him in good stead as he built towards his Everest expedition: creating compelling story arcs around adventures and connecting them to social enterprise. Sophia Bush “completely changed the trajectory of Dan’s life,” says former Googler Max Goldstein. (Jordan Strauss/AP) Around the same time, Fredinburg began working for Google X. Friends and family say he didn’t secure the job through the traditional channels of applying for one, but tailgated an employee into a building where he knew a Google X meeting was being held. There he pitched the Google X leadership, guided by the division’s head, Astro Teller, on involving his privacy team in their operations. (Teller declined to comment.) However it came about, soon Fredinburg and his team were involved in the company’s hottest projects: self-driving cars, Project Loon (an attempt to deliver high-speed Internet to remote regions of the world using a fleet of balloons), and smart contact lenses (embedded with a wireless chip that helps diabetics measure their glucose levels). With his newfound freedom and status, Fredinburg became obsessed with taking risks and plotting with graphs how he could use his networks. He would often strategize how to make the “maximum impact possible,” says Wayne Price, a filmmaker who is documenting the Summit story and met Fredinburg that fateful week in Las Vegas. His friends called the new phase of his life “Dan 2.0.” Jailbreaking By April 2013, the Google Adventures Team was ready to attempt another of the Seven Summits. These trips were still on their own dime and vacation time, but they carried the Street View equipment with them, and a few other Googlers had joined in. This time the target was Carstensz Pyramid, also known as Puncak Jaya, located off the coast of West Papua, New Guinea, and Indonesia’s highest peak. One of the party, Sara Pelosi, split her elbow on the trek up, and developed a fever, but she kept pressing on and they reached the summit. On the way down bad weather caught them. By now Pelosi was dehydrated and in bad shape. To get her back faster, most of the team opted to take a shortcut and go down through the Grasberg gold mine inside the mountain. But in the mine, Indonesian security forces stopped them. The Googlers were brought to a small jail cell. They explained that they had taken the shortcut so they could get back faster, but the guards accused them of trespassing—and worse, carrying drugs, an offense punishable in Indonesia by the death penalty. They poured out the packets of dry energy mix the Googlers were carrying and told their captives to drink it so that they could observe the effects. Then they demanded ransom. Fredinburg called the one person he knew would come through—Owen Egan, his fraternity brother from back in the days at UC Irvine. “I need your help,” he whispered over the phone into Egan’s voicemail. “We’re being held hostage.” He asked Egan to wire money to a bank in Bali. Egan says it was one of few times he had ever heard real fear in his friend’s voice. Egan called Andrew Swerdlow, one of Fredinburg’s closest colleagues at Google, who arranged the ransom, and they were let go. Friends and family say that Fredinburg managed to escape the Grasberg mine with a piece of gold, which he had made into a piece of jewelry for Bush. But Fredinburg’s friends also say that—notwithstanding Pelosi’s injury—he was planning to test his luck in the gold mine no matter what. “Dan wanted to get himself into prison,” says Nagl. “It’s an adventure. He wanted to get captured for the story.” He got his story, and the Google Adventures Team got their photos. And by now, after conquering four of the world’s Seven Summits, they were confident they could approach Google about funding a mission to Mt. Everest. They secured funding from the Emerging Markets team. That snowballed into funding from the Street View team, with matching funds from marketing, to send a crew of photographers to document the mission. They partnered with International Mountain Guides (IMG), a Seattle-based adventure-travel company, for their mission. All told, Google agreed to invest just shy of $1 million to fund their moonshot. “Dan loved the politics of Google,” says his friend and fellow engineer Mike “Doc” North. “For him there were two Everests: One was going out and climbing Everest, the other was getting Google to pay for him to climb Everest.” First attempt at Everest The Google Adventures Team named their expedition E14, short for “Everest 2014”. Everything was in place. Then, at Wolf Pack weekend in early 2014, just a few weeks before their departure, Bush ended her relationship with Fredinburg. He was devastated. Friends rallied to help him stay motivated for Everest. He spent the next couple of weeks at Sean Carasso’s place in Eden, Utah. “Somehow, he managed to get himself up every morning and carried a large backpack on his shoulders and climbed to the top of Powder Mountain,” says Carasso. “Every single day for a month, he did that.” A week before the trip, Fredinburg joined a group of friends at The Battery, a club in San Francisco. There he invited Price, the filmmaker, and a few others to join the first part of the expedition, to Everest Base Camp. Price noticed that his friend was still in rough shape from the breakup. Yet he agreed and purchased a ticket for Kathmandu for the following week. “No one else in the world could have convinced me to do that,” says Price.

Friends describe Fredinburg as a master game theorist—to the point of wanting to get into prison in order to see if he could escape. (Wayne Price/31 Squirrel) Fredinburg documented his 2014 climb in a series of Instagram images, many of which also included a related quote or reflection on the psychology behind the challenge: Day 25: The icefall is no different than anything else really. To get further, lean just slightly beyond the edge of fear and discomfort. Constantly. In everything you do. #everestawesome #deida A photo posted by Dan Fredinburg (@danfredinburg) on Apr 16, 2014 at 4:22pm PDT   Day 25: Scrawled on my thermos, "Imagine living your life without being afraid to take a risk and explore life."

In a tense exchange, one woman in a neighboring camp made it clear to Fredinburg that her team would start climbing first thing the next morning, before the Google team. Although he consented, Fredinburg resolved that he wanted to be first and convinced his colleagues to depart for the Khumbu Icefall, Everest’s most treacherous zone, in the very early morning. They made their way through safely and arrived at Camp 1 just after dawn broke on April 17. The Three Musketeers triumphant in the Khumbu Icefall: Googlers Florian “Flo” Nagl, Fredinburg and Michele Battelli. They were stranded above the icefall for three days after the 2014 avalanche. Fredinburg’s competitiveness may have been unsporting, but it may also have saved their lives. Had they left the next day, there was a good chance they would have been caught in the deadliest day in Everest’s history up until that point. At 6:45am on April 18, 2014, an avalanche swept through just below the icefall, killing 16 Sherpas who were carrying supplies up for the next group of climbers. The Google team, having gone up the day before, were stranded above the icefall for three days. When they finally returned to Base Camp, Fredinburg infuriated other climbers by dressing in costume and dancing, as he had on Mt. Kilimanjaro. Nagl says he was just trying to break the tension. After the mountain was evacuated Fredinburg went on a 10-day vipassana (silent meditation retreat) in Nepal. He followed that with a trip to Thailand, where he partied hard. At a nightclub he created a VIP section in the center of the bar where he charged guests to enter, and they willingly paid him. “After escaping death, Dan had this newfound sense of confidence and invincibility,” says Breton Carasso, Sean’s brother. “Like he was unstoppable.” Reality distortion field Back in the US, newly single and riding on the hubris of defying death, Fredinburg sought out his close friends Doc North and Max Goldstein. He had another adventure in mind. “Dan wanted to go on a trip together somewhere between the Baltics and the Balkans,” says North, who owns engineering consultancy North Design Labs. “And he said that we needed to have some social good component around it, so we created Save The Ice (to bring awareness around climate change). Dan did some research to come up with the narrative. Around 1550, the Baltics faced the greatest threat of their time, fending off Ivan the Terrible. The Swedish Vikings came down through Scandinavia to support them. So we were Americans coming down from Sweden to fend off the greatest threat of our time: climate change.” They played the part, dressing in Viking costumes and driving around Europe in an art car, Burning Man-style, that they had decorated—somewhat ridiculously—to look like a ship. North and Fredinburg traveled together often and created a “reality distortion field,” as North describes it, an alternate reality where they made up their story as they went along. “To be perfectly honest we didn’t really understand what’s going on,” admits North about the “Save The Ice” mission. “But it doesn’t mean you can’t do it. Both of us were very comfortable operating in a place where we didn’t understand what’s going on.” He and Fredinburg had bonded over that mentality: “You have to just start doing stuff,” he explains, “and when people see it’s working eventually they’ll get behind it.” That was the approach Fredinburg took in lobbying Google to return to Everest. Understandably, the company was reluctant to send its employees back after they had barely escaped death the previous year. When friends and family asked Fredinburg if he was going, he would tell them “not yet.” In reality, “Dan never stopped training after the 2014 expedition,” says North. “He would say he was training for Burning Man.” Fredinburg officiating Mike “Doc” North and Marnie Brumder’s wedding on the Burning Man playa in August 2014. Fredinburg and North were Burning Man soul mates; they were as close as brothers. (Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) By fall 2014 the Google Adventures Team had the green light from Street View to climb Everest again in 2015. The Access & Energy team, which Battelli had joined as a technical program manager, agreed to contribute funding if the team tested new wireless technologies at Base Camp. They called the new mission, naturally, E15. Before each of their adventures the Three Musketeers would calculate what they idiosyncratically labeled the MROD, or “Mild Risk Of Death.” The calculation took into account the number of previous deaths on any particular mountain, and their causes (accident, natural disaster, etc.). Scaling Everest, they initially concluded, posed a 5% MROD. For the second expedition they raised the number slightly, to account for the 2014 avalanche and the increasing effects of climate change. Fredinburg continued to operate at a breakneck pace. Ashley Arenson, whom he had recently started dating, pleaded with him to decline parties and get more sleep. She was particularly concerned after he stayed up for 48 hours before the Dublin Web Summit in November 2014, where he sat on a panel to discuss Internet privacy. “But you don’t understand, this is training,” he would tell her. He spent several weekends at Summit’s headquarters in Eden, Utah, and ran with Marshall Birnbaum, an ultra-marathoner, around the grounds on Saturday mornings. Once Fredinburg spotted a man carrying logs on a mountain road, so he decided to find a log, too, and carry it up the mountain. Then, seemingly out of the blue, weeks before the climb, Street View decided to withdraw its funding from Google Adventures. Instead of having Googlers go all the way to the summit, it would have a manager at Base Camp—Sara Pelosi, who had been on the eventful climb up Carstensz Pyramid—coordinate the Street View images with Sherpas and mountain guides, who were trained on how to use the cameras. The Three Musketeers had to find another way. The Access & Energy team was still willing to send them to Base Camp to test its wireless devices. But it was only providing partial funding for the expedition. Fredinburg and Battelli decided to pay the rest, covering their own and Nagl’s expenses out of their own pockets, and joining a different camp at Base Camp instead of Google’s expedition with IMG. That also meant the Three Musketeers were traveling without the Street View cameras that were the whole reason for the Everest expedition in the first place. But by that point, it didn’t matter. Everest had become part of Fredinburg’s identity; he was obsessed. “There was absolutely nothing stopping Dan from that mountain,” says Slavin. Price, the filmmaker, agrees: “Dan had this almost sick joy telling people about the Death Zone on Everest, where many people don’t make it. Their bodies eventually break down. If you rest your muscles for a second you can never get up. When people asked if he was worried, Dan said no. But you still knew he was worried.” In the days before his departure for Nepal, Fredinburg said his goodbyes. He carried Arenson on his back through the steep streets of San Francisco, training up until the last minute. She gave him a parting gift with letters of encouragement from all of his friends to read throughout his journey. Another night, with North, he picked up a few final items, including toilet paper and whiskey. (The previous year, to Nagl’s dismay, Fredinburg had put glass bottles of rum in his climbing shoes to protect them from breakage.) Sean Carasso was one of the last to see Fredinburg. “Stay safe!” he told Fredinburg over and over again that night. He texted Fredinburg the message once again before going to sleep, and woke up to a reply: “Stay strong.” It was the last time Carasso heard from his friend. The final climb Like any high-functioning startup that has defied death, the Google Adventures Team went into their 2015 climb with high confidence and an air of invincibility. Climbing conditions were ideal and the Three Musketeers were all in peak physical condition. Surviving the avalanche the previous year had only made them stronger, they felt. At Base Camp, Fredinburg took what was to become an iconic selfie. Day 19: We're cleared for launch. Now we help the Sherpa celebrate this auspicious day and the next stages of our expedition. #Everest2015 A photo posted by Dan Fredinburg (@danfredinburg) on Apr 22, 2015 at 8:58am PDT Quartz reporter Svati Narula, who trekked to Base Camp with David Breashears, a famed mountaineer and filmmaker, met Fredinburg and Battelli over tea and a game of Tiger & Goats. The two, she recalled, wouldn’t reveal their last names or their mission for Google. Around noon on April 25th, Battelli and Fredinburg were looking through photos in their tent. Suddenly the ground shook and they heard a loud crack beneath them. “We said to each other, ‘Let’s get out, let’s get out!” says Battelli. He ran out of the tent and saw Nagl outside. Together they looked up at what appeared to be a mile-long avalanche of snow and debris coming straight toward them. Both jumped into a ditch and covered their heads as the wind blasted them; when Battelli put his finger into the air, debris cut it like a knife. Battelli thought Fredinburg was behind him, or maybe had run in the other direction. Now he surmises that he probably never even made it out of the tent. “Maybe he lost two seconds grabbing a jacket, grabbing his phone,” says Battelli. “Those few seconds were fatal for him.” Once the avalanche had subsided, Battelli and Nagl plodded through the snow to find their friend lying face-down near a boulder. Battelli slowly turned Fredinburg around, careful not to aggravate any injuries, and felt for a pulse. “Dan? Dan?” he said into the eerie calm. Nothing. Fredinburg’s eyes and mouth were wide open. An Everest doctor walked over and took one look at Fredinburg. “He’s gone,” she said, kissing Fredinburg on the forehead. “That’s how we die,” says Battelli. “Gasping for our last breath.” There was nothing else that they could do, so they covered their friend with a sleeping bag and worked to help others survive. Operating on pure adrenaline, they couldn’t feel the cold as they dug through the snow with bare hands to search for other bodies and supplies to help the injured. With Battelli and Nagl standing next to her, Google’s Pelosi called the Fredinburgs from a satellite phone to give them the news. She reached Fredinburg’s older sister, Tricia Curreri. Curreri remembers Pelosi apologizing over and over again. At dusk the two remaining Musketeers trekked down to Gorak Shep, a village in the valley, to avoid the risk of aftershocks. Neither could sleep. The nightmare just played in their minds like movies. Every few minutes they’d turn to one another: “Flo, you OK?” “Yeah. … Michele, you OK?” “Yeah. … Flo, you OK?” They continued the same conversation over and over again, until dawn the next day, when they made their way back to Base Camp. Send-off on the playa “Can you grab a paint brush and help us?” Courtney Boyd Myers, a Summit staffer, called over to some young women who were testing bikes still covered in the previous year’s playa dust. It was a hot evening in August 2015, and the team was preparing for Burning Man. It was a large-scale operation: Summit, for all its ambitions, is still at its heart an events company, and a warehouse near the town center was filled with supplies for shelter, food, and transportation for many of its members. About a mile across town, a few of the Summit founders and their friends were working on an art car in a garage. The double-limousine was designed as a hover board, a nod to Michael J. Fox’s time travel to 2015 in Back To The Future. Arenson picked up a brush and began painting the large V-shaped wooden structures with grey paint. Since Fredinburg’s death in April, she had spent a lot of time at Eden. Just as the Carasso brothers and the group took care of Fredinburg after his breakup with Bush, they were now doing the same for Arenson. #Repost @maxstossel On Saturday close friends and family came together to celebrate Dan's life and love for adventure. It was an amazing day for an amazing man. #CelebratingDan #AdventuresWithDan #DanimalDID #SaveTheIce #DanFredinburgFoundation Crowdrise.com/CelebratingDan A photo posted by Dan Fredinburg (@danfredinburg) on May 11, 2015 at 8:44am PDT In the aftermath of his death the community has been forced to confront its own mortality—accepting that making “no small plans” and going to the edge sometimes means dying. Yet it seems entirely comfortable with that. “What is 33 years, or 43 years, or 53 years?” asks Abelin, who left Google to launch Liquid Talent, a startup that supports gig-economy workers. “Dan’s death was not a tragedy. The real tragedy is in not living.” Adds Slavin, “We all knew Dan would never make it to a hospital bed. Everyone knew it would be something like this, but not this soon.” Rosenthal, the Summit co-founder, told a story about flying in a test plane with a friend, doing negative-G loops. “If I die like this it’s not going to be surprising, but a tragedy that will affect my loved ones,” he explained. This is a tradeoff many Summit members choose to make. “By putting yourself in these experiences and feeling the edges of life, it made Dan feel alive, and it makes a lot of us feel alive.” The following week at Burning Man, Sean Carasso was among those who made the pilgrimage to Fredinburg’s memorial in the deep playa. His friends drove the art cars from Utah; he took his motorcycle. “100 mile-per-hour winds, my bike broke down, I had no food, no water,” he remarked as he approached the art car, cracking a smile. “The journey made it all worth it.” As the dawn broke, friends, colleagues, and curious onlookers made their way to the Disco Space Shuttle, not too far from the Robot Heart theme camp—a place that held special significance for Fredinburg. For all his outsized adventures, he once said that the biggest risk he took was to become emotionally vulnerable—a direct result of his encounter with Summit Series that evening in Vegas, when he confessed to having a “robot heart.” The farewell on the desert playa was exactly the sort of send-off he would have wanted. Before his death he had arranged for his friends to host parties around the world in his honor should he die—no doubt a sign of hubris, but also of wanting his friends to celebrate life instead of simply grieving. The growing party around the Disco Space Shuttle was a strange combination of both. Many revelers had bloodshot eyes, from a mixture of mourning and recreational drugs. They passed around bottles of whiskey and danced without inhibition. North was there with his partner Marnie Brumder; Fredinburg had married them on the playa a year earlier. They were wearing matching bright yellow onesies. North and Brumder mourn Fredinburg in matching onesies at Burning Man in September 2015, only a year after their friend married them on the playa. Arenson, wearing black fishnet tights, walked over to a young woman who was fully covered in a white slip. Arenson took one look and tore the dress off the woman, revealing only a bra and underwear. Then she christened her with a disco ball necklace, nodded approvingly, and disappeared back into the crowd. Arenson has taken it upon herself to carry on Fredinburg’s legacy. She is a force behind the hashtag #LiveDan, which symbolizes living fearlessly, and is still going strong more than a year and a half after Fredinburg’s death. Friends regularly post photos of themselves wearing the navy-blue “Live Dan” T-shirt with antler ears from places like the Antarctic tundra or atop the Andes. “Immediately after his death we went on the Inca Trail [to Machu Picchu],” says Summit member Max Stossel, a social media strategist and storyteller. “We realized what Dan might have loved about being so high in the air.” “There is a component that is Icarus,” Rosenthal acknowledged, in the lodge at Powder Mountain. “Of all of our friends, he was most certain of his immortality.” Then his voice lifted, buoyed by the thought of his friend on Everest. “If you asked Dan how he would have liked to have died, he would have said, ‘Closer to the top.’” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Airports from across Europe continue to pitch in a competitive battle to make use of the carrier’s ever increasing Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet, but on this occasion it is Barcelona that has come out the winner. Budget carrier Norwegian has this week announced details of its latest long-haul European base with transatlantic flights launching to five destinations in the United States of America from June 2017. Airports from across Europe continue to pitch in a competitive battle to make use of the carrier’s ever increasing Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet, but on this occasion it is Barcelona that has come out the winner. The expanding low-fare carrier will base two 787-8s at El Prat Airport in the Catalan city from next summer launching flights to Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, New York and Oakland. The first aircraft will inaugurate long-haul flights from June 5, 2017 with the second enabling growth to 12 weekly return flights from August 22, 2017 – four times weekly to Newark, three times weekly to Los Angeles and Oakland and twice weekly to Fort Lauderdale. Norwegian will directly compete with United Airlines on the Barcelona – Newark market as well as indirectly with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines into New York. It will be the only scheduled operator on the other three city pairs, albeit American Airlines will provide indirect competition into Florida via its Miami flights. Norwegian will also be the sole carrier to link Spain to the San Francisco Bay area via its flights into Oakland International Airport. “The launch of direct flights between Barcelona and the United States is a new milestone for Norwegian,” said Bjorn Kjos, chief executive officer, Norwegian. “Spain is an important market for us where we have been very well received since its inception.” Norwegian has been growing steadily in the Spanish market and now has seven bases across the country, over 1,000 employees and an extensive network covering domestic and short-haul international routes. It has served the Catalan city since 2008 and opened its short-haul base at El Prat Airport in 2014. After initially linking Barcelona to Moss Airport, Rygge from February 2008, Norwegian expanded its offer before the end of the following year to comprise flights from the main international gateways into Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. Other points across the Nordic region and Scandinavia including Bergen, Gothenburg and Helsinki were added to the Barcelona network over subsequent years. London became the first destination outside the region to be served from April 2013, ahead of the opening of a local base and new flights to Germany, Poland from 2014. Norwegian’s peak summer Barcelona schedule now includes more than 120 weekly departures from Barcelona offering almost 23,000 seats in each direction. Its network now encompasses 21 destinations across ten different countries and it is now the fifth largest short-haul operator from El Prat Airport with a 3.6% share of departure seats, according to OAG Schedules Analyser data. Norwegian launched its first long-haul flights in 2013 between Oslo and New York and shortly thereafter between Stockholm and New York. As the company has phased out more new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the number of transcontinental flights has increased as the airline’s intercontinental strategy has taken shape. Adding to its Dreamliner flights from Scandinavia (which also includes Copenhagen), long-haul links have also been introduced from London from 2014 and from August this year from Paris. The airline now operates 42 routes between Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, London, Paris, Barcelona and the United States and currently offers more routes between Europe and the United States than any other European airline serving nine destinations in the United States: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Orlando, Boston, Puerto Rico and St. Croix. Its Americas network also includes winter flying from the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe to Boston, New York and Baltimore / Washington and from Guadeloupe to Fort Lauderdale. But after Scandinavia, London, Paris and now Barcelona, where will be next for Norwegian’s long-haul growth? Norwegian has led the way in utilising the performance of the 787 to develop a successful low-cost long-haul operation and the recent addition of 787-9s to its fleet will enable it to grow its route structure, while providing more range and capacity. “Future growth and competiveness in the long-haul market depends on the fuel-efficient, state-of-the art 787 Dreamliner. Not least, the Dreamliner offers the best passenger experience,” said Kjos. The airline currently has a North American focus for its 787 long-haul operations with the Thailand capital, Bangkok, the only market outside of the Americas to be served by the carrier with flights from Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. The current long-haul strategy for the 787 fleet is underpinned by routes into popular leisure markets and those easily stimulated by its low-fare offering. These include New York (via JFK and now Newark), Los Angeles, San Francisco (via Oakland) and Miami (via Fort Lauderdale). The airline is also able to secure some business traffic on these routes to boost its yield and has shown it is not concerned with going head-to-head with long-standing legacy operators that are already well established. But it is not all about O&D traffic and the airline’s expansive short- and medium-haul network across Europe and into North Africa and the Middle East can also provide feed into the long-haul markets. “The Scandinavian and European route networks play an increasingly important role in our long-haul strategy, as many of our passengers use connecting flights with Norwegian,” added Kjos. A new dimension to its long-haul network will be the utilisation of smaller single-aisle airliners on thinner routes as advancements in aircraft technology mean a range envelope that can open up new Transatlantic city pair markets, as per Norwegian’s plan to fly between Cork in the Republic of Ireland and Boston. The airline is the European launch customer for Boeing new generation 737MAX family and has committed to acquire 100 aircraft as part of a January 2012 deal which was the biggest ever single order placed in Europe for Boeing equipment, valued at $11.4 billion at list prices. “In 2017 we, as the European launch customer of Boeing, start taking deliveries of the new 737MAX, then additional routes to the East Coast of the US will be launched, offering direct transatlantic connections to new smaller cities and communities on both sides of the Atlantic carrying additional millions of passengers per year between the two continents,” Kjos has stated. Looking more closely at Norwegian’s summer short-haul programme in Europe you can start to get a picture of possible future Dreamliner long-haul bases. With the exception of London, Barcelona is the carrier’s largest network point outside of the Nordic and Scandinavian region and biggest point in Spain. The airline has a strong presence in other European capitals such as Helsinki (800,000 departure seats), Berlin (305,000 seats) and Rome (276,000 seats) and a growing offer from the likes of Budapest, Edinburgh, Manchester, Prague and Tenerife, all markets that have been suggested for possible long-haul expansion. However, with the impending 737MAX arrival many other markets will now also be on the Norwegian network radar.  Register for Routes Americas 2017 in Las Vegas, USA, 14 - 16 February 2017 Register for Routes Europe 2017 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 23 - 25 April 2017 The Fundamentals of Route Development This essential download gives you all you need to get started with air service development.

(PRNewsFoto/Royal Air Maroc) WASHINGTON - Yesterday, Royal Air Maroc, the award-winning national airline of Morocco, launched thrice-weekly non-stop service between Washington Dulles International Airport and Casablanca. Washington, D.C. becomes the airline’s third destination in North America, and its second U.S. destination, after New York (JFK) and Montreal (YUL). The Washington, D.C. and New York-to-Casablanca flights, which are operated with a new generation Boeing 787 Dreamliner, will increase the seats offered in the United States by more than 40 percent. Flight AT218 from Casablanca touched down at 9:55pm local time at Dulles Airport outside Washington, D.C. and was greeted with a water cannon salute. The return flight to Casablanca, flight AT219, departed at 11:40pm. The Washington, D.C.-to-Casablanca flight operates on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and offers a schedule and product perfectly connected to the domestic and international networks of Royal Air Maroc. Through its global hub in Casablanca, customers can seamlessly connect to destinations such as Dakar, Lisbon, Nairobi, and the popular vacation destination, Marrakesh. “Royal Air Maroc is thrilled to launch the only non-stop service between Washington, D.C. and Casablanca. We are equally excited about deploying the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 on this important route; the spacious cabin interior allows our customers to move with ease and gives them a greater feeling of comfort. We look forward to welcoming guests onboard as they travel to Casablanca and beyond across our global network,” said Mr. Abdelhamid Addou, Royal Air Maroc’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Royal Air Maroc’s new Boeing 787 Dreamliner service to Casablanca, Morocco, provides passengers another important destination from Dulles International, the region’s international gateway airport,” said Mike Stewart, the Vice President of Airline Business Development at Washington Dulles International Airport. “This new service also allows passengers in the national capital region to easily connect to more than 95 other Royal Air Maroc destinations.” Royal Air Maroc’s fleet of brand-new Boeing 787 Dreamliners feature 18 Business Class flat-bed seats and partitions with adjoining seats in a 2-2-2 layout, and 256 Economy Class seats in a 3-3-3 layout. Ergonomic seats have been entirely redesigned to guarantee all customers more space, legroom, and comfort for a truly relaxing journey. Casablanca serves as Royal Air Maroc’s global hub, offering convenient connections to more than 90 cities across Morocco, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. Morocco offers visitors a cultural experience that will always be remembered and creates lasting memories, including ancient cities, modern metropolises, gorgeous luxury coastal resorts, and remote towns on the edge of the desert.

Everything you need to know here > Donald Trump's complicated and controversial history with 9/11 Before you go, we thought you'd like these... READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Aol.com Editors Sep 9th 2016 9:45AM Two days after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, a reserved and calm Donald Trump was asked in an interview to explain how it was possible that "two Boeing planes would be able to destroy the Twin Towers?" Without hesitation, the billionaire businessman attributed the destruction to "tremendous amounts of fuel," saying the buildings were hit with "more than anything could take." No blame was laid at the feet of President George W. Bush, no peddling of conspiracy theories, no claims that if he were president the attacks wouldn't have happened. Instead, Trump stood poised in front of the Manhattan backdrop and championed New Yorkers as "strong and resilient," saying "they'll rebuild quickly." Fifteen years later, Trump's relationship with 9/11 has evolved, and now perhaps more clearly resembles the Republican presidential nominee's current campaign -- controversy-laden and with a tendency to produce more questions than answers. The 2001 terror attacks have come up multiple times over the course of Trump's presidential campaign, with the GOP candidate's remarks usually sparking outrage. "The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign. Remember that," Trump said during a heated exchange with Jeb Bush at a February primary debate. This particular incident wasn't the first time Trump implied Bush was in some way to blame for the attacks. In October 2015, Trump told Bloomberg TV, "He was president, OK? Don't blame him or don't blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign."

Jeb Bush called Trump's comments "pathetic," saying that his brother "kept us safe." Fellow 2016 contender at the time Ben Carson also weighed in, calling the allegations against President Bush "ridiculous to suggest." One area, however, where Trump and Carson see eye-to-eye are the billionaire businessman's controversial claim that he witnessed "thousands" of people "cheering" in New Jersey following the September 11, 2001, attacks. Trump claims he "watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering." While PolitiFact and The Washington Post conducted fact checks both concluding there's little to no evidence in support of Trump, Carson corroborated the claim saying he saw "the film of it," adding that he thought Trump's remark "was an inappropriate response." RCP General Election Poll Average - Clinton vs. Trump | InsideGov Trump hasn't backpedaled on his attacks aimed at former President Bush, or his steadfastness regarding the existence of the infamous New Jersey celebration video. He did, however, recently delete a tweet from 2013 where he commemorated the 12th anniversary of the September 11 attacks by saying, "I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th." Trump's team removed the controversial tweet shortly after it started making the rounds online in 2015. When asked why the tweet was deleted Trump campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks told Business Insider "it is from several years ago."

Fuller Steady state and transient vibration in the Boeing H-47 Chinook is now more controllable after the final product qualification of LORD Corp.’s patented Improved Vibration Control System (IVCS). This IVCS technology has a triple-digit weight-savings benefit, creating performance buy-back for operators.  LORD Defense Business Manager Stuart Hartwell told R&WI product deliveries began in May, and the first aircraft off the line with the system installed is planned for delivery to the U.S. Army in early October. This will be followed by retrofit opportunities of Special Operations MH-47Gs, fielded CH-47Fs and Foreign Military Sales H-47s in 2017. The system uses accelerometers that measure vibration levels and a centralized computer process that sends commands to force generators located under the pilot’s seat. This counteracts the aircraft vibration, creating a more comfortable environment. The IVCS is a direct/drop-in replacement for its predecessor — heavy passive-tuned vibration absorbers — also located under the pilot’s seat. It’s made for easy installment, using mounts that already exist on Chinook aircraft. This upgrade has come to fruition after 12 yr of development.  Related News   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertise with us Rotorcraft Jobs Search Jobs: Browse all jobs Post jobs Post Resume View Resumes Most Read Most Commented Panel to Focus on Most Daunting Certification Challenges Sikorsky Seeks Innovative Kids 2008 Buyer’s Guide Directory Listings: Directory Webinar Focuses on Rotorcraft Boom, Near-Term Prospects Summit Agenda, Speakers Now Online GoPro Unveils Camera Drone In Bid to Save Stock Prices EASA Revision of SPI Regulation Continues How Operators Will Be Impacted by ICAO’s CORSIA Agreement Supersonic Avionics to Fly on ‘Baby Boom’ in 2017 New Report Outlines Avionics Equipage Issues for NextGen Do you receive The Rotorcraft Collective?

India has left everyone guessing in regards to who it will choose to manufacture a new fleet of combat aircraft for its air force. Though it is evident that the government is in talks with Sweden’s SAAB, France’s Dassault Aviation, and Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the US, it has not given any indications as to which of the contenders would be bagging the contract. © Flickr/ Alexander Babashov India's Deal for 36 Dassault Rafale Stealth Fighter Jets Reaches Final PhaseDuring Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar’s recent visit to the US, Boeing and Lockheed Martin made official proposals to manufacture F/A-18 and F-16 respectively under the ‘Make in India’ campaign, triggering speculations in favor of the US. But Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar’s upcoming visit to Linkoping of Sweden to inspect the production facility of SAAB where Gripen fighter jets are produced indicates that India is equally interested in Gripen. According to Defense Ministry sources, Parrikar is likely to visit Sweden this month. Earlier in June this year, Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha inspected the SAAB production facility in Linkoping. © AFP 2016/ FABRICE COFFRINI India Rejects SAAB's Offer to Develop Tejas MK1A AircraftSAAB has offered to develop, manufacture and undertake the final assembly of its Gripen E fighter jet in India with actual Transfer of Technology under the Make in India project. This would be a big relief for SAAB as India has not signed any major deal with the Swedish firm after a political storm triggered by allegations of corruption in the purchase of Bofors howitzers in 1987. Recently, India rejected SAAB’s offer to set up a production line under 'Make in India' and to supply the latest Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for the indigenous fighter aircraft Tejas MK1A. In an interview to All India Radio in May this year, Manohar Parrikar said, “India will select a good fighter by the end of this financial year to be made domestically. It is not yet decided which aircraft it would be. It may be F-18, Rafale, Eurofighter or Gripen. The decision in this regard will be taken in this financial year.” ...

US aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step yesterday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can put out the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries.

One option Boeing has discussed with airlines and lessors in recent weeks is a simple lengthening of the 737 Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of Airbus’s A321neo, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The company is also vetting an alternative, more elaborate revamp that would feature the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. The more straightforward redesign, which would rely on upgrading engines developed for the Max family, would enter the market by early 2020, while the more complex one wouldn’t begin service until almost two years later. Airbus, meanwhile, has already received almost 1,300 orders for the A321neo, with a long-range version scheduled to begin commercial operation in 2019. “Boeing definitely needs to do something,” said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flightglobal’s Ascend Consultancy. “The market wants a choice, not an Airbus monopoly, so they can continue to have access to competitive pricing.” Chicago-based Boeing has struggled for years to find an answer to the A321, and the quandary has grown this decade as the out-of-production 757 has started to fade from airline fleets. Airbus redesigned its largest narrow-body to cruise seven hours from Europe to North America, or cram in as many as 240 people. Its versatility is a crucial reason why the A320 family has outsold the 737, Boeing’s biggest source of profit, by about 1,000 orders, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. ‘Higher End’ Both planemakers have benefited as low-cost carriers gravitate to larger narrow-body aircraft to keep pace with capacity growth. The most popular market segment remains the 160-seat sector served by Boeing’s 737-8 and its midsize Airbus counterpart. But A321neo sales have surged over the last two years, increasing the pressure on Boeing to address its eroding market share at the top of the narrow-body market. “We continue to look at the higher end of the Max family,” Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing, said in an e-mail. “The needs of our airline customers as well as the business case will drive our decision and timing.” The manufacturer declined to elaborate on the latest studies for a larger 737. The board must sign off on any new variant before the company can formally market the plane to customers. Size Advantage Airbus has a size advantage and operating economics advantage because the A321 can squeeze more travelers into a frame that is eight feet (2.4 meters) longer than the Max 9, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018. The challenge in extending the 737’s fuselage lies in overcoming the limits of a design dating to the 1960s: The plane has smaller turbines than the A321neo because it rides closer to the ground when on the tarmac. But any redesign can’t be so expensive and difficult to manufacture that it bogs down production of the 737. “This is not a trivial stretch because it will require increasing engine thrust and changing the landing gear,” Douglas Harned, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said of the Max 10 in a Sept. 6 report. “While this would be much less expensive than a new airplane or a major new derivative, it is still a significant modification. It is unclear if the payback would be there.” Extra Thrust Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter As the first 737 Max 8 jets glide through flight-testing ahead of a 2017 debut, Boeing and engine-maker CFM have gained confidence that they can reap enough extra thrust from the plane’s existing Leap-1B engines to speed to market a new, longer variant with relatively uncomplicated landing gear, the people said. Jamie Jewell, a spokeswoman for CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA, declined to comment. Boeing is also convinced it has solved the manufacturing riddle for a more elaborate design if customers prefer the range and payload gains possible with the larger Leap-1A engines designed for the A320 family. That model would need some modifications to the wing and tail, and taller landing gear that would mechanically shrink to fit into the same wheel well used on other 737s. “It’s not the monumental engineering challenge that people assume,” Mike Delaney, Boeing’s vice president of airplane development, said of the Max 10 options in an interview at the Farnborough Air Show in July. ‘Too Late’ Air Lease Corp. has been among the customers prodding Boeing to act. During an Aug. 4 earnings call, Air Lease founder Steven Udvar-Hazy and Chief Executive John Plueger said Boeing was formulating a two-pronged strategy in which the Max 10 would be followed a half-decade later by an all-new design, a middle-of-market aircraft to bridge the divide between narrow- and wide-body jets. While Boeing had penciled in a commercial debut for the Max 10 in late 2021, “that’s just too late,” Plueger said. “I believe they’re looking at moving that up meaningfully. But if you’re going to do a one-two punch, you’ve got to do a one-two timely, especially the one part.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The analysts forecast global autopilot systems market to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% during the period 2016-2020. According to the autopilot systems market report, one of the key drivers for market growth will be increasing demand for automation. Automation enhances flight operational safety and efficiency through providing low operating costs and greater profits. This is especially critical for commercial airlines, which support millions of air travelers. In 2014, the airlines carried passenger traffic of 838.4 million passengers on more than 8.5 million flights, globally. In the same year, a survey of airline pilots was carried out, which reported that the pilots operating Boeing 777s spent just seven minutes manually piloting their aircraft during a flight, whereas, those operating Airbus planes, spent half that time. Thus, the growing demand for automation in aircraft is driving the autopilot systems market. The growth of the market is fueled by the increasing emphasis on aircraft modernization. Several available next-generation products and systems have raised the demand for aircraft modernization. For example, Airbus and Boeing are currently focusing on the automation of cockpit technology, which will assist the pilot during autopilot mode using sophisticated design solutions. During 2015, the global autopilot systems market was led by the Americas with a market share of more than 37%. The growth of the market in this region is spurred by the need to comply with strict regulations to enhance the safety standards by leveraging modern technology for passengers and airlines. The autopilot systems market analysts predict that the narrow-body aircraft sector will dominate the market and grow at a CAGR of approximately 6% during the forecast period. The increasing number of fleets of LCCs (low-cost carriers) will bolster the demand for sophisticated and technologically upgraded autopilot systems. This rising demand will also lead to the development of systems offering a wide variety of advanced functionalities like automatic control of payloads, compatibility with hybrid structures, curve-based navigation, and sense and avoid RTK precision, and obstacles and safe flight zones definition.

X Aer Lingus owner considers curbing aircraft-buying plans Economic slowdown behind IAG’s reassessment of purchasing plans, says Willie Walsh Thu, Sep 8, 2016, 12:35 IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, speaking on Thursday. Photograph: Bloomberg         IAG, the owner of Aer Lingus and British Airways, is considering reining in fleet plans as worldwide economic growth slows and the company grapples with the effects of Brexit. “Without doubt all airlines, including airlines within IAG, are reassessing their requirements for new aircraft,”as the outlook for growth has “softened”, chief executive Willie Walsh said on Thursday. “I don’t think we’re going to see growth rates that were anticipated.” The comments reflect a tougher sales environment for aircraft-makers. Airbus Group and Boeing racked up their lowest tally of aircraft orders in six years at the aviation industry’s annual showcase this summer. While both Airbus and Boeing sit on huge order backlogs, that cushion could provide little protection if headwinds continue and airlines start to feel the pinch from lower fares. Cut spending IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, ordered 20 single-aisle Airbus A320neo aircraft a year ago, and Mr Walsh outlined plans earlier this year to buy used wide-body Boeing 777s and lease Airbus’s double-decker A380s for British Airways. Following the UK vote in late June to quit the European Union, Mr Walsh said IAG would have to cut spending amid a plunge in the pound’s exchange rate and a slowdown in traffic growth as business customers scaled back travel in response to the referendum. Corporate customers are still holding off on business trips as they analyse how the Brexit vote will affect Britain’s economy and currency, Mr Walsh said on Thursday. Another question carriers must consider with plane orders is the drop in the price of oil in recent years, and “whether it’s worth buying this new-technology aircraft to get the fuel-cost advantage,” he said. As IAG studies potential orders, “We’d look at how we would finance those aircraft: whether we’d buy them or whether we’d lease them,” so there are “a lot of options for us,” he said.

Currently, American astronauts have to hitch a ride with their Russian counterparts.  It's a critical step in NASA's  Commercial Crew Program  — which relies on private companies to ferry astronauts between Earth and the ISS.  SEE MORE: NASA's Mars Mission Might Be In Trouble The docking adapter  will allow SpaceX and Boeing to park their spacecraft on the space station and allow crew to come aboard.  The capsules designed to fit the dock aren't finished yet. SpaceX is currently working on a manned version of its  Dragon capsule , and Boeing is still finishing its  CST-100 Starliner . But if all goes according to plan, the first missions with those crafts are slated for late 2017 and early 2018.  The  dock itself arrived  at the ISS on July 20, but astronauts aren't installing it until Friday. Two astronauts aboard the ISS will spend about six hours outside the station to connect the dock. NASA plans to live-stream the entire operation.  Recent related news Boeing to consolidate defense and space sitesSt. Louis (UPI) Nov 16, 2016 Boeing is preparing to consolidate Defense, Space & Security...

NASA to Shine Lasers on Future Aircraft Concept by Kathy Barnstorff for LRC News Hampton VA (SPX) Sep 08, 2016 illustration only As NASA aeronautics engineers prepare to develop a series of greener, quieter, faster X-planes, they are already testing concepts that could be candidates. One of those is a blended wing body (BWB). A six-percent scale model of a Boeing BWB is being tested for six weeks in the 14-by 22-Foot Subsonic Tunnel at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. "We're happy to have the model back in our wind tunnel," said Dan Vicroy, principal investigator at NASA Langley. "It gives us a couple of opportunities - to add to our knowledge about this configuration as well as how to improve our testing methods." A blended wing body doesn't look like a conventional airplane. Instead of the usual tube and wing design - it's shaped more like a triangle where the wings are, in essence, merged into the body. Another difference is that it does not have a tail. This same model was put through its paces in the Langley 14-by 22-Foot tunnel in 2014 and in the 40-by 80-Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA's Ames Research Center in California in 2015. That work was part of NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation program, which developed technologies to improve fuel efficiencies, lower noise levels and reduce emissions. But for this test it looks a little different. The top of it has been painted in non-reflective matte black to accommodate laser lights that will sweep across the model in sheets. NASA and Boeing researchers will use those laser sheets combined with smoke in the technique known as particle imagery velocimetry or PIV. That will map the airflow over the model. "We didn't get the opportunity to use PIV in the previous tests," added Vicroy. "It helps us analyze the flow going into the engine inlets, which is one of the challenges with this design since the engines are on top of the fuselage, toward the rear." In most planes flying today the engines are out on the wings, in front, where there is nice clean airflow. Anything in front of an engine can disrupt the flow. "Airflow makes a difference in how well the engine performs," said Vicroy. "It's a matter of how much distortion the engine is seeing. So if you want the engines to perform well you want to have the distortion at a minimum." So if engineers have to worry about airflow - why change where the engines are? Researchers say putting them on top of the plane helps shield noise, especially from people on the ground, and contributes toward NASA's goals of developing greener, quieter planes. The other benefit to NASA from this test has more to do with the tunnel itself. The 14-by 22-Foot tunnel recently completed repairs and an upgrade, so having the same model return can verify how well it's working. And having the same model tested in a totally different facility, such as the one in California also helps add to engineers' knowledge base. "In wind tunnel testing we have to account for how the model is installed, the size and proximity of the tunnel walls in the test section and other factors," said Vicroy. "Testing the same model in two very different tunnels gives us data to improve our test correction methods, some of which were developed in 1940s." For Boeing the tests are part of an ongoing research development program. "Our tests are a continuation of more than two decades of successful research and development of this concept, which is unparalleled in industry," said John Bonet, Boeing's test director for the BWB. "What we learn from this round of testing will be used to complete the definition of our aerodynamic, stability and control low-speed databases - a major milestone in the technology development of the concept." With the exception of Boeing proprietary technology, NASA knowledge gained from this collaborative research will be documented and publicly available to benefit the aviation industry.

It was the first time such images had been released in China and they went viral on mainland social media. The images were taken by JLCG-1, a microsatellite constellation launched last year consisting of four satellites, the smallest of which weighs just 65kg, able to take photographs at resolutions of up to 0.72 metres per pixel. The JLCG constellation orbits 650km above the earth, slightly above the International Space Station. But the satellites have limited orbital manoeuvrability, meaning that if they enter into a collision course with the space station or other spacecraft in the busy lower-earth orbit, their operator would be unable to move them out of the way. The number of satellites orbiting the earth has jumped 40 per cent to nearly 1,400 since 2011, and in five years the number could more than double, according to some space industry estimates. The increase has mainly been driven by technological innovations with have reduced the size of satellites, in some cases down to something the size of a smartphone. In June, US aviation giant Boeing filed an application to the US Federal Communications Commission to launch nearly 3,000 satellites to provide broadband internet services, which prompted traffic jam concerns in the US as no single federal government agency had the means or authority to track a microsatellite and order it to move out of the way to avoid a collision. The situation in China “could be worse”, said Dr Liu Jing, deputy director of the Space Debris Monitoring and Application Centre, a space environmental protection watchdog under China’s National Space Administration. US satellite makers such as OneWeb recognised the risk of space debris and had taken steps to address the issue, she said. Chang Guang, founded two years ago by more than 40 institutional or private investors with technical support from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is one of many microsatellite and nanosatellite assembly plants to have emerged in China in recent years. China’s hack-proof quantum satellite leap into space leads the world Others include the Shanghai Engineering Centre for Microsatellites, the Picosat Development Centre in Zhejiang, the Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Microsatellites in Xian, and the Aerospace Dongfanghong Development company in Shenzhen, each with plans to send tens or even hundreds of small satellites into space. China remains a relatively small player at present, with international companies such as Boeing, Airbus, SpaceX and OneWeb planning to launch thousands of microsatellites in the coming years which could provide earth-observation or communication services, such as Wi-fi access, to everyone on the planet. But China could easily catch up in numerical terms because it is building satellites more cheaply, some costing less than a small car. To reduce costs, most Chinese microsatellites do not have rocket engines that need fuel. They also operate in higher orbits to prolong their lifespan. Large international companies tend produce satellites with rockets that operate in lower orbits due to concerns about collisions and the creation of debris. China could pollute space with a large number of small, cheap satellites according to some space environment experts, unless the industry is reined in with strict, clear regulations as quickly as possible. In March, Japan lost contact with Hitomi, its brand new, flagship X-ray telescope. Investigators found the satellite had disintegrated, typically what happens after a space debris collision. China launches high-resolution imaging satellite to service civilian users How to regulate traffic in space as the number of satellites increases has been an international concern for decades, but the issue became urgent in recent years. OneWeb microsatellites are equipped with thrusters that can send them back into the atmosphere to burn up at the end of their service, but Liu said most Chinese microsatellites were not up to that standard and were left drifting freely in space after the end of their operational life. Some were small and operating in high orbits, eluding detection by ground-based radar and posing a severe threat to other spacecraft. The State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence had issued a regulation on small satellites to address such issues, but in practice the regulation was ignored. She urged the central government to immediately raise the bar for microsatellite standards, requiring them to be equipped with mobility thrusters, among other control devices, and restricting their operations to certain low-earth orbits to shorten the time they lingered in space after service and reduce the chance of collisions with other spacecraft. But a representative of a private company in Guangdong that plans to send a couple of microsatellites into space in November opposed such restrictions, describing space debris concerns as an “unfounded scare”. Is China militarising space? Experts say new junk collector could be used as anti-satellite weapon Tens of thousands pieces of debris were currently orbiting the earth, he said, but space was enormous. He likened the situation to “adding a few grains of salt to a lake”, which made no difference. The microsatellite industry in China was still in its infancy, he said, and its development needed support. Too many restrictions would kill the business, he said, requesting anonymity both for himself and his company. He added that the space debris scare had been invented by the owners of big satellites. “Of course they don’t want to see the revolution of microsatellite technology which will allow new, small players to challenge their monopoly,” he said. “They will use or fabricate any excuse to suffocate our development.” New restrictions and regulations would increase the cost of Chinese-made microsatellites, reducing China’s competitive edge in the international market, he said, adding that would be a “betrayal” of China’s national interests. Pioneering space debris researcher Donald Kessler, a former Nasa astrophysicist, said adding a few thousand satellites in orbit was just the start of the issue. If the objects in low-earth orbit reached a high enough density, debris generated by one collision would lead to another and eventually fill space with small, fast-flying junk, making all space activities impossible, a scenario known as the Kessler syndrome. “A 10 to 100kg satellite colliding with a satellite as large as 100,000kg would produce an amount of debris similar to either of the catastrophic collision events that have occurred, i.e., the 2007 China anti-satellite test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision,” he said. China says space junk crashed in eastern province - possibly from failed Russian rocket “If these microsatellites are part of a constellation, a failed microsatellite would eventually collide with another member of the constellation, resulting in a Kessler syndrome effect within the constellation, perhaps quickly expanding to the population of larger objects.” To mitigate the problem, an international Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee had imposed a “25-year rule” which required any object placed into earth orbit be out of orbit within 25 years of the end of service. Kessler said China was a member of the committee and should ensure its launches followed its guidelines. China has more than 100 satellites in space, with mainland media reports saying space debris warning authorities issued 87 red alerts for extremely close encounters with space debris last year. The JLCG-1 constellation will end its operational life by 2020, when the Chinese Space Station is due to start operation.

The retired Boeing aerospace engineer has posted a series of videos to Youtube showing his granchildren enjoying the coasters. The 'Out'n'Back Negative-G' starts from the top of a picnic table placed on his porch and speeds over a series of bumps and dips, before climbing a large slope and retracing the course backwards. Another ride dubbed 'Smaug the Terrible' after the character from The Hobbit barrels its way through the backyard, weaving between trees and looping under itself. The gifted grandfather has so far constructed three coasters, applying the same processes he used when he worked on aeroplanes and military vehicles at Boeing. The materials a bit of a step down from the cutting edge alloy he's used to - mainly lengths of timber and PVC pipe. In a post to Reddit, Mr Gregg described how he carefully designed each coaster with CAD schematics, calculated velocity, kinetic energy and G-forces for each twist and turn using spreadsheets and the accelerometer in his phone.  He carried out extensive safety tests with sandbags strapped to an infant car seat, before finally letting his grandson ride. Mr Gregg has plans for more coasters and has even published his own book, Backyard Coasters, in order to pass his knowledge along to the next generation of budding home-coaster enthusiasts. His efforts already have some dubbing him 'Granddad of the Century' - a claim which would be hard to deny.

Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Vice President Joe Biden says he’s well aware that the last eight years haven’t been easy for the nation’s workforce. In remarks on Friday at a roundtable discussion at LanchCode in St. Louis, Biden says the economic downturn in the late 2000s  “clobbered” the middle class. And that had tangible consequences for struggling cities. “As Detroit was crumbling, basically the intellectual infrastructure of the city left,” Biden said. “I mean, it just got hollowed out.” But Biden said there are reasons for optimism. He said an improving economy and advancing technology provided opportunities to get people jobs in the technology industry. And he said groups like LaunchCode are helping meet an urgent need. “What you guys are doing here is translating the need into reality,” Biden said. “It’s like knowing how to know. Well, look around the table here. Look at the companies that are represented here. This is not the little league. These are serious outfits.” The vice president generally steered clear of any political overturns during his remarks at LaunchCode, which helps bolster the careers of computer programmers. The nonprofit organization has helped train and match hundreds of people in St. Louis with big companies like MasterCard and Boeing. Vice President Joe Biden speaks at LaunchCode alongside Jim McKelvey, founder of Square and co-founder of LaunchCode, on Friday morning. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Biden said the effort coincided with the Obama administration's focus on getting more women and minorities acclimated to coding and computer programming. “Now I will announce an additional $40 million in scholarship funds for women and minorities who are underrepresented in the tech sector to attend coding boot camps and to have a shot at these good paying jobs,” Biden said. “And the goal is to get $100 million in the private sector. And I think we’ll be able to do that in the next little bit. Attendees take pictures of Vice President Joe Biden at LaunchCode. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio “And it matters because these investments matter,” he said. Joining Biden in the roundtable discussion was Jim McKelvey, who helped cofound the nonprofit LaunchCode in 2013. The cofounder of Square said that his group doesn’t “ask the companies to do us any favors,” but, rather, they say “you have a need for talent and we have a source for talent.” “And on the other side we say to people who want these jobs they’re open to you,” McKelvey said. “And that anyone, and I truly mean anyone, can get one of these jobs if you work hard enough. And we never lowered the standards for that work, so we keep it all about talent.”   Felipe Naranjo was one of the people who linked up with LaunchCode – which eventually led to a job at Express Scripts. Vice President Joe Biden speaks alongside tech executives and employees – including Felipe Naranjo, at Biden's left – who got their start through LaunchCode. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio “I had a lot of time to spend on YouTube and I stumbled upon a video in which Bill Gates, Chris Bosh and Mark Zuckerberg were telling me, ‘You need to learn how to code. It’s great. We love it,’” Naranjo said. “I thought if two of the smartest men in the world and a NBA champion with a Georgia Tech degree could do it, why not me?” “I was very skeptical about my skills. I wasn’t sure I was ready,” he added. “So I waited a long time to apply. And I always regretted it. Because as soon as I applied, they were incredibly welcoming and they had a lot of guidance to give me. They were able to measure my skills and take that measurement and compare that to where I needed to be.” Vice President Joe Biden greets fellow panelists after speaking at LaunchCode on Sept. 9, 2016. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Biden said groups like LaunchCode help the U.S. fill a need for hundreds of thousands of IT professionals. He added that the federal government can play a role in closing job gaps. “There’s an awful lot of people out there that have capacities they don’t know they have,” Biden said. “And you know, neither Barack nor I think government is the answer. But government can be a catalyst.” Follow Jason on Twitter @jrosenbaum Tags:  Joe Biden LaunchCode Jim McKelvey Express Scripts 2016 Missouri elections Top Stories TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content Biden: Federal Stimulus Has Brought Jobs, Infrastructure To 'Heart Of America' 2 years ago Biden Defends Withdrawal Of Troops From Iraq, Afghanistan 2 years ago St. Louis launches experiment to connect programmers with jobs 3 years ago McKelvey shares his thoughts on Square and St. Louis' tech sector 10 months ago Looking Ahead At 2014, What Can St. Louis Expect? 2 years ago Express Scripts CEO Paz to step down in May 1 year ago Labor activists hold protest rally at Express Scripts operation here 6 years ago View the discussion thread.

(NYSE: I), operator of the world's first Globalized Network, powered by its leading satellite backbone, today updated the in-service date for the Intelsat 33e satellite, successfully launched on 24 August 2016. The in-service date is being adjusted from fourth quarter 2016 to first quarter 2017. Due to a malfunction in the primary thruster used for orbit raising, the orbit raising will take longer than planned and the satellite will arrive on station for In Orbit Testing in December 2016. The satellite's solar arrays and antennas have been successfully deployed, and after completion of the In Orbit Testing, the satellite will be ready for service sometime in the first quarter of 2017. Boeing, the satellite's manufacturer, is presently working with the company to determine the cause of the thruster malfunction. About Intelsat Intelsat S.A.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks on Friday suffered the worst slide since the U.K.’s surprise decision to exit from the European Union, as hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials slammed bond and equity markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13%  closed down 394.46 points, or 2.1%, at an intraday low of 18,085.45, with all 30 blue-chip companies in the red, led lower by 3.3% drops in shares of Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.48% Boeing Co. BA, +0.14% and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.72% The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16%  plunged 53.49 points, or 2.5%, to close at its intraday low of 2,127.81 with all 10 main sectors finishing lower. So-called defensive sectors—utilities and telecoms, which both finished off more than 3%—led the losses, while energy shares declined 2.8% amid a steep drop in crude-oil futures. Oil prices US:CLV6  settled down 3.7% at $45.88 a barrel and eanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.19%  shed 133.57 points, or 2.5%, to close at an intraday low of 5,125.91. For the broader market, it was the worst session since June 24, when the Dow industrials cratered 3.4%, the S&P 500 plunged 3.6% and the Nasdaq Composite unraveled by 4.1%. On Friday, the S&P 500 and the Dow fell below their 50-day moving averages. Friday’s broad selloff puts the Dow industrials at a weekly loss of 2.2%, the S&P 500 at a 2.4% loss, and the Nasdaq at a 2.4% decline. For the month to date, the Dow is 1.7% lower, the S&P 500 is off 2%, and the Nasdaq down 1.7%. Comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren—a voter this year on the Fed’s interest-rate setting board—helped to contribute toe the selloff. He said on Friday that the U.S. central bank could resume gradual rate increases as the risks facing the economy are more in balance, reigniting Wall Street’s fears about the end of easy-money policies. Rosengren’s comments drove the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.27%  firmly higher, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.20%  jumped to levels not seen since before the U.K. referendum, known as Brexit. A sharp jump in Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -1.12% which surged by 39% to 17.50, highlighted the worries on the day. The VIX marked its largest one-day jump since June 24, and hit its highest level since June 28. On the New York Stock Exchange, 19 stocks declined for each one advancing, with 98% of the session’s volume contributing to the selloff. Wall Street losses followed declines for European SXXP, -0.43%  and Asian markets, which were unsettled by North Korea’s confirmation that it has successfully carried out a fifth nuclear test. Read: Next time, Draghi should say the ECB has done all it can “When the market is near its top—as this market has been—any piece of bad news will results in a selloff,” said Thomas Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. Some analysts think that a rate increase by the Fed in September could be greeted positively by the market. “If the Fed does it for the right reasons—that the economy is on solid footing—then, markets would welcome a rate increase,” said Joe Saluzzi, partner at Themis Trading. Other market participants suggested that investors are losing confidence in the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the European Central Bank held its interest rates pat and opted not to expand its quantitative-easing measures, which disappointed Wall Street. Read: Politicians need to take some of the burden off the world’s central bankers “With the ECB’s inaction sparking fears that central banks have lost confidence in the benefits of further monetary easing, Wall Street could find itself vulnerable to steeper losses,” said FXTM Research analyst Lukman Otunuga in a note. Other central-bank talk: Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo, who’s viewed as dovish on monetary policy, said he couldn't rule out a rate increase this year, but would like to see more inflation, during an interview on CNBC.

RH, +2.85% shares advanced 3.1% after the home-furnishings retailer posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and per-share earnings late Thursday. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Shares of both companies fell nearly 2%. Logistics company CAI International Inc.

North Korea Nuclear Test Is Its Biggest Yet, Seoul Says(1:25) North Korea confirmed it had conducted a nuclear test—its fifth since 2006—after South Korea's seismic monitoring agency detected an earthquake that was more powerful than those linked to the North's earlier tests.

Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com Updated at 3:30 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden lauded LaunchCode’s efforts to train computer programmers as a stepping stone to employment in a visit to the St. Louis nonprofit’s headquarters on Delmar Boulevard on Friday. Flanked by executives from local companies who have hired dozens of paid apprentices through LaunchCode and those who emerged from the free training to land jobs, Biden said, “I came for a simple reason, to try to amplify what you’re doing here.” Founded in St. Louis in 2013, LaunchCode has placed 485 people in apprenticeships with a 90 percent hiring rate into full-time positions. Sixty percent of these folks were previously unemployed, and 25 percent lack a college degree. LaunchCode, which employs 30 locally, has expanded to Kansas City, Miami and Rhode Island and plans to add offices in Seattle and Portland next year. Biden on Friday credited LaunchCode founder Jim McKelvey, who also is co-founder of Square, with helping inspire TechHire, a federal initiative launched last year by the administration of President Barack Obama. Like LaunchCode, TechHire is designed to get people with non-traditional work and educational backgrounds trained and employed in tech jobs, including software coding. Biden said there’s a demand for 1.2 million IT workers in U.S. by 2022 — and 40 percent of the jobs won’t require a college degree. “There are an awful lot of people out there who have capacities they didn’t think of before,” Biden told the crowd of about 150 people. In St. Louis, companies such as MasterCard, Boeing, and Express Scripts have been expanding the talent pool they draw on, working with initiatives like LaunchCode to develop talent.

Check our People in Business “We think LaunchCode is going to be in every city that has a talent shortage, which is pretty much every city,” McKelvey told the Post-Dispatch. At the Friday event, several St. Louis area employers offered testimonials about LaunchCode’s value, including Robert Reeg, president of Global Technology and Operations at MasterCard, who said the credit-card company has brought in 21 LaunchCode apprentices in St. Louis and Miami, and wants to expand the program to its New York office. Neal Sample, chief information officer for Express Scripts, credited LaunchCode with helping the pharmacy benefit manager shift to hiring employees with a desire to learn tech, not just those with degrees. Later Friday, Biden stopped by the Goody Goody Diner in north St. Louis to campaign for U.S. Senate candidate Jason Kander, Missouri’s Secretary of State. Biden and Kander, a Democrat, stopped at more than a dozen tables to shake hands with customers at the diner at 5900 Natural Bridge Avenue. Kander is running against incumbent Republican Roy Blunt for the Senate seat. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The multi-billion shilling loss is the difference between revenues earned from the sub-leasing contracts and payments to be made to primary lessors in the same period. Kenya Airways yesterday said that the prevailing business circumstances had made it prudent to reduce excess capacity through leasing, adding that the Sh4 billion loss is an accounting treatment covering the entire period of the sub-lease. The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ, as the airline is popularly known, signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. “The airline has sub-leased certain aircraft that are held on operating and finance lease at lease rentals that are lower than that charged by the primary lessors resulting into onerous lease provision,” the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm says in its latest annual report. KQ last year leased five Boeing aeroplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines in the middle of a liquidity crisis that it only navigated with the help of the government.   The airline recognised a Sh1.4 billion loss in the year ended March 2016, with the balance of Sh2.5 billion expected to filter through over the coming years as the contracts roll on in the medium term. KQ chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze said at the time of signing the lease contracts that they would reduce fleet costs by Sh8.4 billion annually, indicating that sub-leasing at a loss (which was not disclosed at the time) represents a lesser evil compared to maintaining a bloated fleet. “These actions will reduce our monthly fleet costs by over $7 million (Sh707 million), and improve our liquidity, and is part of our strategy to return Kenya Airways to profitability in the next 18 to 24 months,” Mr Ngunze said on a May 26, 2016 statement, adding that while it was sad to see brand new aircraft going to other airlines, it was important to understand the context in which the decision was made. READ: Kenya Airways board to share recovery plan with shareholders KQ leased two B787s to Oman Air for three years and is set to take a loss of Sh918 million in that transaction. Besides, its lease of three B773s to Turkish Airlines for four years is expected to result in a loss of 3.1 billion, bringing the total loss to Sh4 billion. Sub-leasing the aircraft, non-renewal of other leases and sale of several aeroplanes saw KQ’s fleet drop to 47 planes in the year ended March compared to 52 units the year before. The airline plans to further scale back its capacity in the current financial year to cut costs prevent a further decline into the negative capital position with the sub-leasing of more aircrafts to Omar Air and Turkish Airlines. Kenya Airways has said it is keen on reducing the number of empty seats on long haul flights and terminating some routes to further cut costs. “There will be further reductions in both fleet count and aircraft type with the initiative to have a lean and efficient fleet tailored to the company’s network requirements,” KQ said in the report. Two B787-8s are to be sub-leased to Oman Air for an undisclosed number of years, bringing the total number of aircrafts seconded to the Muscat-based carrier to four. Three B777-300ER will be sub-leased to Turkish Airlines for an undisclosed period, raising the number of airplanes sent to the Istanbul-based carrier to six. KQ did not indicate whether the upcoming sub-leasing deals with the same carriers will also leave it underwater or whether it will break even or book a profit. The national carrier also plans to sell two B777-200ERs and return two E170s (Embraers) to their owners at the end of their lease period. The mix of aircraft sub-leasing, sales and non-renewal of leasing will discharge a total of nine aeroplanes from its fleet that will shrink to 38 units. The B787 series, also known as Dreamliners, are among the most expensive airplanes in KQ’s fleet expansion programme that was based on a projection of flying to 77 countries and 115 destinations by 2021. Drafters of the Project Mawingu strategy addressed several risks including funding but did not take into account lack of demand for the enlarged capacity, a key factor in KQ’s woes as seen in massive debts unmatched by revenue growth. Paring down capacity fits into KQ’s broader turnaround plan that includes staff retrenchment, with pilots and cabin crew among employees to be rendered redundant by the capacity reduction. KQ says it let go of 41 pilots in the year ended March, a move that saw their count drop to 489 from 523 the year before. Its overall staff count dropped to 3,870 from 4,002 over the same period, with further retrenchments having commenced from July. The airline made a record net loss of Sh26.2 billion in the year ended March, widening the Sh25.7 billion net loss the year before. This saw its net worth worsen to negative Sh35.6 billion from negative Sh5.9 billion over the same period. -businessdailyafrica.com Tweet Filed under Habari za Nyumbani · Tagged with Comments are closed.

A 3D printed trim-and-drill tool, developed by researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to be evaluated at The Boeing Company, has received the title of largest solid 3D printed item by Guinness World Records. The lower cost trim tool was printed 30 hours using carbon fiber and ABS thermoplastic composite materials, which will be tested in building the Boeing 777X passenger jet. The 3D printed structure 17.5 ft long, 5.5 ft wide and 1.5 ft tall and weighs approximately 1,650 pounds. ‘The existing, more expensive metallic tooling option we currently use comes from a supplier and typically takes three months to manufacture using conventional techniques,’ said Leo Christodoulou, Boeing’s director of structures and materials. ‘Additively manufactured tools, such as the 777X wing trim tool, will save energy, time, labor and production cost and are part of our overall strategy to apply 3D printing technology in key production areas.’ Guinness World Records judge Michael Empric measured the trim tool, proved it exceeded the required minimum of 0.3m3, or approximately 10.6 ft3, and announced the new record title. ‘The recognition by Guinness World Records draws attention to the advances we’re making in large-scale additive manufacturing composites research,’ said Vlastimil Kunc, leader of ORNL’s polymer materials development team. Boeing plans to use the additively manufactured trim-and-drill tool in the company’s new production facility in St Louis, MI, USA. The tool will be used to secure the jet’s composite wing skin for drilling and machining before assembly. This story uses material from ORNL, with editorial changes made by Materials Today.

Shutterstock Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Just as oil and gas has raised the stature of countries like Saudi Arabia in the age of oil, countries that dominate the production of metals are set to benefit similarly in the rare metal age. Rare metals, which are produced in limited amounts and often in just a few countries, play critical roles in the next generation of products: they store power, provide luminescence and make products more efficient. Tesla vehicles, iPhones, Boeing 787s and even night vision goggles rely on the specific properties of a host of difficult-to-pronounce obscure metals. Because of the global explosion in high-tech wizardry, people rely on the production of more metals on the periodic table than ever before. And because of the high number of rare metals it takes to produce green products, it’s no understatement to say that the fate of the planet is tied to these materials. Over the Olympic season, countries rank their international stature on medal counts achieved during the games as a proxy for a country’s geopolitical stature. But the “real metal count” has a greater impact on the fate of nations. To give an idea of how countries are doing, we produced two infographics to show the most notable changes in global producers from 1970 and 2015. It tallies the first, second, and third leading producers of all major and minor technology metals. For each major mineral commodity, the world’s leading producer earns a gold medal, second leading producer a silver medal, and third leading producer a bronze medal. (Data source: USGS) Dylan McFarlane, Robert Pell, David Graham, Author provided From the metal tables you can see that no country has succeeded in the real metal race like China. Through geological good fortune, along with a sustained focus on the production of rare metals at lower costs than other countries, China is poised to reap the gains from their production. Their focus on producing these metals is important. Finding secure, stable supplies outside China is a goal of two international research projects, SoS Rare and HiTech AlkCarb. For each major mineral commodity, the world’s leading producer earns a gold medal, second leading producer a silver medal, and third leading producer a bronze medal. (Data source: USGS) Dylan McFarlane, Robert Pell, David Abraham, Author provided Unlike Saudi Arabia, which sought riches from the sale of its resources, China seeks to capitalise on building downstream industries – for example, by making smartphones using home-produced components – through its industrial strategy: Made in China 2025. These resources are then a great means to continue to expand their manufacturing prowess. David Abraham, senior fellow at New America, assisted in the production of the piece.

U.S. Launch Report/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo By Irene Klotz | CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. If history is any guide, Elon Musk's SpaceX could be grounded for nine to 12 months while it investigates the cause of last week's launch pad accident and makes any repairs, according to the chief executive of SpaceX's primary U.S. competitor on Thursday. "It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is," Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. Bruno did not mention SpaceX by name. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk's privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has "always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know ... how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place." Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. "Historically, it had never been the pad that's taken the longest time," he said. Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co, was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. The Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, blasted off at 7:05 p.m. EDT (2305 GMT) on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno also said he had called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend his sympathies and offer help. "It's a small community and issues especially around safety - but even mission success - kind of transcend the competitive piece of this," Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by U.S. government agencies. Musk's company in May broke ULA's monopoly on flying U.S. military and national security satellites, winning an $83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on Sept. 19. Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. "It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service," Bruno said.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 9 September 2016 | MYT 10:02 AM Rocket carrying NASA asteroid probe blasts off from Florida by irene klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - An Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Florida on Thursday carrying a robot space probe on NASA's first quest to collect samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth in hopes of learning more about the origins of life. The 19-story rocket, built and flown for NASA by United Launch Alliance, lifted off at 7:05 p.m. (2305 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, hurling the satellite explorer Osiris-Rex on its voyage to the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. The 3,300-pound (1,500-kg) solar-powered probe separated from the rocket's upper stage an hour after blastoff, soaring into space at 22,000 mph (35,400 kph) - more than 28 times the speed of sound - to begin its $1 billion, seven-year mission. It will take Osiris-Rex two years to reach its destination, a dark, rocky mass roughly a third of a mile wide and shaped like a giant acorn orbiting the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. Bennu is thought to be covered with organic compounds dating back to the earliest days of the solar system. “You can think of these asteroids as literally prebiotic chemical factories that were producing building blocks of life 4.5 billion years ago, before Earth formed, before life started here,” NASA astrobiologist Daniel Glavin said before launch. Scientists believe asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth delivered water and organic compounds that seeded the planet for life. Atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could help them prove that theory. Once it settles into orbit around Bennu in 2018, Osiris-Rex will spend up to two more years mapping the asteroid's surface and taking inventory of its chemical and mineral composition. Scientists will ultimately choose a promising site on Bennu to sample and command Osiris-Rex to fly close enough to extend its robot arm to the asteroid's surface. A sampling container will then release a swirl of nitrogen gas, which will stir up gravel and soil for collection. "The more big pieces we can get the better ... they could contain the carbon molecules that we want to see," Jim Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said on NASA TV. After gathering at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of material, Osiris-Rex will fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid-sample container for a parachute descent and landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. Only one other spacecraft, Japan’s Hayabusa, has previously returned samples from an asteroid to Earth, but it collected less than a milligram of material because of a series of problems. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is under way, with a return to Earth planned for December 2020. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Although Bennu occupies the same approximate orbital distance from the sun, it poses little threat to Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

"The more big pieces we can get the better ... they could contain the carbon molecules that we want to see," Jim Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said on NASA TV. After gathering at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of material, Osiris-Rex will fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid-sample container for a parachute descent and landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. Only one other spacecraft, Japan's Hayabusa, has previously returned samples from an asteroid to Earth, but it collected less than a milligram of material because of a series of problems. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is under way, with a return to Earth planned for December 2020. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Although Bennu occupies the same approximate orbital distance from the sun, it poses little threat to Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

Not since 1987 has India signed a major defence contract with Sweden. The last one was the Bofors howitzer that ran into controversy over charges of kickbacks during Rajiv Gandhi's regime. Parrikar's scheduled visit this month would follow a five-day tour of Sweden in June by Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha. Raha flew in a version of the single-engine Gripen fighter during his visit. The maker of the Gripen, Swedish firm Saab, have proposed to set up capabilities in India to make the aircraft in India. It has also proposed technological cooperation in developing a Mark II version of the Tejas light combat aircraft. Parrikar has said in the past that the government would take a decision on a new line of fighter aircraft by the end of the current fiscal. The Gripen C/D and versions of the F-16 Fighting Falcon (made by the US Lockheed Martin), the F/A-E/F Super Hornet (made by Boeing, also of the US) did not make it through the trials conducted by the Indian Air Force for its tender for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) since 2007. The Eurofighter Typhoon and the Rafale were "downselected". Rafale beat the Typhoon by quoting a lower price. The tender was cancelled last year after Prime Minister Modi announced in Paris that India will purchase 36 Rafale aircraft through a government-to-government contract with France. The negotiations have been stalled on issue of price for some months. But defence ministry sources say that a contract is now likely with a French delegation expected to arrive in Delhi within weeks. The contract could be the largest signed for the IAF with the value upwards of Euro 7 billion (between Rs 56,000 and Rs 60,000 crore). Sweden and Saab are now pitching the Gripen E for the Indian Air Force requirement of fighter aircraft. Unlike the Gripen C/D variant that was fielded in the trials in India, the Gripen E has a wider undercarriage that folds into its double-delta wings (and not its fuselage). India believes that with a wider and deeper understanding with the US in recent weeks - as exemplified by the Lemoa - the possibility of acquiring weapons platforms with US-origin equipment has brightened. The Gripen E is powered by US-origin GE-414 engines. Many of its avionics components are also of US-origin. The IAF is in the process of acquiring the LCA Tejas - said to be home-grown - that is of the same class as the Gripen in the sense that both are single-engined aircraft. The IAF has contracted 120 LCA Tejas with the GE 404 (US-origin) engine while the Gripen E has a more powerful GE 414 engine tailored for it. Swedish defence minister Peter Hultqvist visited New Delhi and invited Parrikar to the Gripen-manufacturing facilities in June last year. The Swedes have illustrated their offer to develop capabilities by citing experiences in South Africa and Brazil where they have won contracts and are setting up facilities after training local technicians. Hultqvist also visited the facilities of Hindustan Aeronautics and the Bharat Electronics in Bangalore.  More stories in Nation Temple & temporal: Rahul's journeys Other civil servants upset with IAS Akhilesh praises 'good boy' Rahul CPM trains temple gun at Sangh Iron mesh & arrests can't save Shah meet Ad watchdog proposes clearer disclaimers 2 central forces headless for a week 'Bromance' in full flow, questions on gains Jab for Kejri, haze on BJP Satellite milestone 'Trial' tag on surge price in train tickets Glare on Valley perks Modi tough on Pak, not so on China    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Founded in 2008 by arts lovers Jess Brown and Janet Wilson, the annual event brings New Orleans area arts and culture nonprofits to one spot, for one night so people could learn more about what great resources the city has.  Held Aug. 31 in the National World War II Museum's U.S. Freedom: The Boeing Center, Culture Collision 8 featured 62 organizations including Prospect New Orleans, NOLA Project, Birdfoot Chamber Music Festival, New Orleans Photo Alliance, New Orleans Public Library, Ashe Cultural Arts Center, Women's National Book Association/NOLA Chapter (which awards the Pinckley Prizes for Crime Fiction) and the Marigny Opera House. Working with event host WWNO, organizers also added Second Harvest Food Bank, United Saints Recovery Project and NOLA Pay It Forward for attendees to learn more or to donate in response to the Louisiana Flood of 2016. New Orleanians filled the center -- a sampling of people said it was one of their favorite events of the year -- who also enjoyed performances from OperaCreole, Dancing Grounds, National World War II Victory Belles, and a jazz ensemble from Xavier University Department of Music. The performances were in honor of the late Sharon Litwin, a well-known supporter of the arts and culture in New Orleans.  Culture Collision 8 was sponsored by Deveney, Dirty Coast, National World War II Museum, and Yelp, and organized by a planning committee representing the Arts Council of New Orleans, Deveney, Funny Bones Improv, Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, New Orleans Ballet Association, New Orleans Opera Association, Ogden Museum of Southern Art, Southern Rep, and WWNO. According to event co-founder Jess Brown, Culture Collision 8 "was our best year yet!" ******  To reach Sue Strachan, send an email to socialscene@nola.com or call 504.450.5904.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Ideology Not Evidence: What is (Not) Known about Independent Teacher Preparation Programs Ideology Not Evidence: What is (Not) Known about Independent Teacher Preparation Programs Posted on September 8, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Key New NEPC Brief Takeaway: The expansion of independent teacher education programs is not grounded in research evidence, raising equity concerns about how teachers are prepared to teach “other people’s children.” Boulder, CO (PRWEB) September 08, 2016 Advocacy groups and self-proclaimed social entrepreneurs are working aggressively to deregulate the preparation of teachers and to expand independent, alternative routes into teaching. The policy push is so powerful that it raises a real possibility that the nation may dismantle its university system of teacher education and replace much of it with independent, private programs not connected to colleges or universities. These new routes sometimes emphasize technical skills over deep, professional understanding. Accordingly, some of the new programs are very different from most teacher education programs provided by U.S. colleges and universities, which are usually grounded in core research knowledge—about the subject matter being taught as well as child and adolescent development and learning theory, all taught in the context of practice and of the students’ environment. In a brief released today, Independent Teacher Education Programs: Apocryphal Claims, Illusory Evidence, Ken Zeichner of the University of Washington reviews what is known about the quality of five of the most prominent independent teacher education programs in the U.S., including their impact on teacher quality and student learning. Zeichner is the Boeing Professor of Teacher Education at UW and is a member of the prestigious National Academy of Education. The five independent programs examined in Zeichner’s brief are: The Relay Graduate School of Education (Relay), Match Teacher Residency (MTR), High Tech High’s Internship, iTeach, and TEACH-NOW. His analysis demonstrates that claims regarding the success of such programs are not substantiated by peer-reviewed research and program evaluations. “The promotion and expansion of independent teacher preparation programs rests not on evidence, but largely on ideology,” says Professor Zeichner. “The lack of credible evidence supporting claims of success is particularly problematic given the current emphasis on evidence-based policy and practice in federal policy and professional standards.” Zeichner’s analysis also concludes that two of the programs, MTR and Relay, prepare teachers to use highly controlling pedagogical and classroom management techniques that are primarily used in schools serving students of color whose communities are severely impacted by poverty. In doing so, they contribute to the inequitable distribution of professionally prepared teachers and to the stratification of schools according to the social class and racial composition of the student body. “The teaching and management practices learned by the teachers in these two independent programs are based on a restricted definition of teaching and learning and would not be acceptable in more economically advantaged communities,” explains Zeichner. “Students in more economically advantaged areas have greater access to professionally trained teachers, less punitive and controlling management practices and broader and richer curricula and teaching practices.” At a time when we are working to educate an increasingly diverse student body, this shift away from preparing teachers with deep professional knowledge may negatively impact teacher quality and student learning. Professor Zeichner offers four specific recommendations based on these findings: State and federal policymakers should not implement policies and provide funding streams that promote the development and expansion of independent teacher education programs unless and until substantive credible evidence accrues to support them. There currently is minimal evidence. State policymakers should be very cautious in authorizing “teacher preparation academies” under a provision in the new federal education law (Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA). Such authorization would exempt those programs from the higher standards for teacher preparation that states typically seek to enforce for other teacher education programs. Policies should hold all teacher preparation programs to clear, consistent, and high standards. Teacher education program quality should be determined by an analysis of the costs and benefits of multiple outcomes associated with the programs. Policymakers should thus reject the argument made by two of these five programs (MTR and Relay) that the sole or overriding indicator of teacher and program quality should be students’ standardized test scores. State and federal policies that are designed to support the development of independent teacher education programs should include monitoring provisions to ensure that they do not contribute to a stratified system, where teachers serving more economically advantaged communities complete programs in colleges and universities to become professional educators, while teachers serving low-income communities receive only more technical, narrow training on how to implement a defined set of curricular, instructional and managerial guidelines.

Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Sep. 08, 2016 11:15AM EDT Last updated Thursday, Sep. 08, 2016 11:15AM EDT Comments AA Gordon Reid is president and CEO of Goodreid Investment Counsel. His focus is U.S. equities. Top Picks: Boeing (BA.N) Latest purchase Aug 2016 @ $134 Boeing is in full production and has a commercial aircraft backlog of 5,700 planes, representing over $400-billion. Visibility is good, valuations are reasonable and cash-flow is robust, supporting a 3-per-cent-plus dividend yield. Market Call Tonight: Top Picks from Goodreid's Gordon Reid (BNN Video) Dycom Industries (DY.N) Latest purchase April 2016 @ $84 Dycom is a telecom services company, capturing a large share of the massive amount of work to upgrade wireline networks to accommodate greater bandwidth. Organic revenue growth in the most recent financial report was an impressive 20 per cent. Earnings are soaring, yet valuations are modest, at less than 16 times the current year’s expected results. Home Depot (HD.N) Latest purchase Aug 2016 @ $137 Home Depot is growing, attractively priced, well managed and has multiple favourable trends supporting it. Household formation numbers are rising but are still lagging population growth. Interest rates remain low and lending standards are more relaxed than in past years. Unemployment is falling and GDP growth is steady. At 21 times earnings, Goodreid believes this issue is a buy. Past Picks: September 30, 2015 Facebook (FB.O) Then: $89.90 Now: $131.05 +45.77% Total return: +45.77% Citigroup (C.N) Then: $49.61 Now: $47.48 -4.29% Total return: -3.63% Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) Then: $53.33 Now: $70.90 +32.95% Total return: +34.71% Total Return Average: +25.62% Market outlook: The market’s message is confusing some participants, but Goodreid believes it should be taken at face value. A rate hike by the Federal Reserve is unlikely in September, but when it happens, it is likely to be another one and done until well into 2017. The earnings recession is showing signs of ending. Revenue growth has improved and valuations, given the monetary backdrop, are reasonable.

All three are scheduled to blast off to the International Space Station (ISS) on Sept. 23. (Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP) Print Email The Republican Editorials By The Republican Editorials masslive.com on September 08, 2016 at 10:15 AM comments When NASA decided to ground the space shuttle, the future became clear: The International Space Station would sooner or later become a truly big problem. Buddy, can you spare $81.9 million? Perhaps NASA could adopt that as its unofficial theme song going forward, as that's how much we pay Russia to ferry each of our astronauts to the International Space Station. But the lyrics would have to be repeatedly changed, as the price per ride just keeps going up and up like, well, like a rocket. In 2006, we paid about $21.3 million for each seat on a Russian spacecraft. The trouble, of course, is that since NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011, hitching a ride on a Russian rocket is the only way to go. Russia, obviously aware of that sad fact, has been pricing those rides accordingly. NASA had been hoping that private ventures operated by companies such as SpaceX and Boeing could take over for the government-run National Aeronautics and Space Administration. So far, however, that dream has been little more than science fiction. When SpaceX saw a rocket blow up on the launch pad recently, it marked the second catastrophic failure for the company of late. The rocket and its payload – a commercial satellite – were lost, and the launch pad suffered serious damage. But not as much as the reputation of SpaceX. Boeing, for its part, hasn't been going great guns, either. When NASA decided to ground the space shuttle, the future became clear: The International Space Station would sooner or later become a truly big problem. Sooner or later is now. It's long past time to ask real questions about the future of the space station. Can it be maintained? Should it be maintained? Are we simply throwing good money after bad by continuing? Are the possible rewards worth the prohibitive cost? Is the dream of the International Space Station as a space-based center of cooperation and innovation just so much pie in the sky? Ask even those in the know to list the most significant benefits to have come from the venture, and you'll not get a very impressive response. Perhaps it's time to acknowledge that the International Space Station offered more in our collective imagination than it has provided in reality. Or, rather than actually asking the difficult questions, we could just keep on doing the same old expensive thing over and over again.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Atlas V begins OSIRIS-REx’s round trip to the asteroid Bennu September 8, 2016 by William Graham NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has began a seven-year round trip to the asteroid Bennu on Thursday, beginning its journey via a launch aboard the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V. Liftoff from SLC-41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was on time, at the start of a 115-minute window that opened at 19:05 local time (23:05 UTC). Atlas V – OSIRIS-REx Mission: The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer, or OSIRIS-REx, is NASA’s first sample-return mission to an asteroid, and – excluding the Apollo program – its third sample return mission beyond Earth orbit after the Genesis and Stardust probes. See Also LIVE Atlas V/OSIRIS-REx UPDATES ULA Forum Section L2 BEO Section Click here to Join L2 Japan’s Hayabusa spacecraft was the first mission to return an asteroid sample to Earth, completing operations in June 2010. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission of NASA’s New Frontiers program, following the New Horizons spacecraft which flew past Pluto last year and Juno, which arrived in orbit of Jupiter in early July. New Frontiers is a class of intermediate missions between the low-cost Discovery program and NASA’s flagship missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory. The OSIRIS-REx mission is expected to last seven years, culminating with the reentry of the spacecraft’s return capsule in September 2023. About two and a half years of the mission will be spent at the asteroid (101955) Bennu, from August 2018 to March 2021, with sampling of the asteroid expected to occur in 2020. Bennu was discovered on 11 September 1999 by scientists at the Lincoln Laboratory’s Near Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program using the Experimental Test Site (ETS) telescope at White Sands, New Mexico. It was provisionally named 1999 RQ36. An Apollo-class near Earth asteroid orbiting between 134 and 203 million kilometers (83.4 to 126 million miles; 0.897 to 1.36 astronomical units) from the Sun, Bennu has an orbital period of 437 days and a rotation period of 4.29 hours. The asteroid has a radius of approximately 246 meters (807 feet) and its mass has been estimated at between 60 and 77.6 billion kilograms (59 to 76 million Imperial tons; 66 to 86 million US tons). Bennu is classified as a B-type asteroid, within the wider C-group of dark-coloured carbonaceous asteroids. The B-type is believed to be a particularly primitive class of asteroid, dating back to the early Solar System, so studying and sampling it could provide scientists with a snapshot of conditions when the Solar System was forming. The asteroid was selected as the destination for OSIRIS-REx due to its proximity to Earth, being sufficiently large and with a slow enough rotation rate to make sample collection practical and the scientific interest in its carbonaceous composition. The goals of OSIRIS-REx’s mission are to return a sample of Bennu to Earth for analysis, to conduct a spectral analysis of the asteroid’s surface and characterise its composition, to investigate changes in the asteroid’s orbit due to the absorption and reemission of radiation – a phenomenon known as the Yarkovsky effect – and to study the structure of the asteroid’s regolith. Professor Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona is the principal investigator for the OSIRIS-REx mission, while the mission is being managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The spacecraft was constructed by Lockheed Martin Space Systems. *Click here for additional articles on this spacecraft* OSIRIS-REx will be powered by a pair of solar arrays, generating up to three kilowatts of power at perihelion. Unfuelled, the spacecraft has a mass of 880 kilograms (1,940 pounds) and at launch it will weigh 2,110 kg (4,650 lb). The sample return capsule – the only part of the spacecraft designed to return to Earth – has a mass of 46 kilograms (100 lb). As a sample-return mission, OSIRIS-REx’s primary objective is to collect a sample of Bennu and deliver it to Earth. The Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism, or TAGSAM, will be used to achieve the sampling part of the objective, while a reentry capsule will facilitate its safe return to Earth. TAGSAM consists of a sampler mounted on an extensible 3.35-meter (11-foot) arm. OSIRIS-REx will manoeuvre close to the asteroid without landing and deploy the arm to bring the sampler into contact with the surface. This will use a nitrogen jet to loosen surface material for collection. The spacecraft is carrying sufficient nitrogen to attempt this process three times if an insufficient amount of material is initially captured. At least sixty grams (2.1 ounces) of material is expected to be collected. Once sampling is complete, the sampler head will be stowed within OSIRIS-REx’s return capsule and detached from the arm. The return capsule will remain attached until OSIRIS-REx makes its final approach to Earth in September 2023, at which point it will separate with the main spacecraft bus subsequently performing a course correction to avoid also entering the atmosphere. The sample capsule will use an ablative heat shield to protect it as it reenters the atmosphere, descending under a parachute to a landing in Utah. Following landing, the capsule will be taken to the Johnson Space Center’s Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office for the study of its contents. A suite of instruments aboard OSIRIS-REx will aid in the location of a sample collection site, provide for additional study of the asteroid and give context to the samples returned. The OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite, or OCAMS, consists of three imaging payloads; the 20 cm (8-inch) PolyCam will be used for high-resolution imaging, reaching resolutions of up to one centimeter (0.4 in) while the spacecraft is scouting for a site from which to take its sample. MapCam will be used to produce high-resolution imagery of the asteroid’s surface and to search its proximity for satellite asteroids, while SamCam will observe the sample collection phase of the mission. The OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA) will use LIDAR to produce a three-dimensional map of the asteroid’s surface and to characterise its topography. Higher-resolution surveys will be conducted of candidate sample collection sites ahead of the sampling attempt. The OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or OTIS, will produce spectra for thermal emissions from Bennu, allowing for minerals present in the surface to be characterised. The OSIRIS-REx Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (OVIRS) will analyse the light reflected by the asteroid – providing reflection spectra which can also be used to identify minerals present in the asteroid’s surface. The Regolith X-Ray Imaging System, or REXIS, will use a technique called X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to produce additional surface composition data. By studying the wavelengths of secondary x-rays emitted when the asteroid’s surface is bombarded with incident high-energy radiation, the instrument will characterise the elemental composition of the regolith. This research will complement the mineral composition determined by the OTIS and OVIRS instruments. Scientists also plan to study the Doppler shift affecting radio communication between OSIRIS-REx and Earth, accurately determining the spacecraft’s orbit and allowing Bennu’s mass to be inferred and gravitational field to be characterised. OSIRIS-REx began its mission atop United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket, which was making its sixty-fifth flight since its 2002 debut. The vehicle that launched OSIRIS-REx, tail number AV-067, flew in the Atlas V 411 configuration. Like all Atlas V versions, this consists of a Common Core Booster (CCB) first stage powered by an RD-180 engine burning RP-1 propellant and liquid oxygen, with a Centaur second stage which uses cryogenic propellants; liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. In this configuration, the rocket makes use of the single-engine version of Centaur, with one RL10C-1 providing thrust. The single-engine Centaur was introduced with the Atlas III in 2000 as an alternative to the twin-engine configuration the stage had used since the 1960s, and quickly became the standard. All Atlas V launches to date have used the single-engine model, although Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner – slated to begin launching late next year – will use a dual-engine Centaur. At liftoff, a single AJ-60A solid rocket motor ignited to provide additional thrust in the early stages of first stage flight. Thrust vectoring allows the rocket to remain under control while flying in this asymmetric configuration, which was used for the fourth time with Thursday’s launch. At the nose of the Atlas, OSIRIS-REx was encapsulated within a four-meter (13-foot) Large Payload Fairing – at 12 meters (39 feet) in length this is the shortest of three available four-meter fairings. The Atlas V has been chosen to launch a number of NASA’s exploration missions, beginning with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) in August 2005 and the New Horizons mission to Pluto in January 2006. Other planetary missions launched by the Atlas V have included the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and LCROSS in June 2009, the Juno mission to Jupiter and the Curiosity and MAVEN Mars probes. Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin to compete for the US Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, which saw it developed alongside Boeing’s Delta IV. Production and operations of both vehicles – along with Boeing’s older Delta II rocket – was taken over by United Launch Alliance upon its formation in December 2006. ULA is currently in the process of phasing out the Delta IV and developing a new rocket, Vulcan, to replace both EELVs. Thursday’s launch began with ignition of the first stage’s RD-180 engine 2.7 seconds in advance of the planned T-0 mark in the countdown. Ignition of the solid rocket motor and liftoff occurred 1.1 seconds after the zero mark. Ascending from Cape Canaveral’s Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41), AV-067 began a series of pitch and yaw manoeuvres after 6.7 seconds of flight to establish an 89-degree launch azimuth taking it almost due East over the Atlantic Ocean. The vehicle reached Mach 1 – the speed of sound – 56.9 seconds after launch before passing through the area of maximum dynamic pressure, or Max-Q, 11.7 seconds later. The AJ-60A booster is designed to burn for around ninety seconds, after which its thrust tailed off. Its spent casing remained attached until the two-minute, nineteen-second mark when conditions were optimal for its jettison. The first stage burned for four minutes and 2.8 seconds before shutting down its RD-180 engine, an event designated Booster Engine Cutoff (BECO). Six seconds after BECO the spent Common Core Booster separated and the Centaur began its prestart sequence, culminating in ignition – designated Main Engine Start 1 (MES-1) ten seconds after staging. Centaur’s first burn lasted eight minutes and 3.7 seconds, establishing an initial parking orbit. Following the conclusion of the burn at Main Engine Cutoff 1 (MECO-1) the Centaur coasted for 21 minutes and 25.7 seconds. After its coast phase concluded, Centaur restarted for a second burn. Lasting six minutes and 50.4 seconds, this burn propelled OSIRIS-REx to Earth escape velocity and into heliocentric orbit. Spacecraft separation occurred a quarter of an hour after the end of the second burn, at 55 minutes and 38.6 seconds elapsed time, over the Indian Ocean. Centaur underwent blowdown and safing 26 minutes and 20 seconds after separation, with the Atlas’ mission concluding one hour, 56 minutes and 58.6 seconds after liftoff. Following launch, OSIRIS-REx will perform a series of manoeuvres as it journeys towards the asteroid Bennu. This will include a flyby of Earth which is scheduled to occur on 22 September next year in order to gain a gravity assist. The spacecraft is currently slated to arrive at Bennu in August 2018, remaining there until March 2021. The sample return capsule is expected to return to Earth on 24 September 2023 while the parent spacecraft will remain in orbit around the Sun. The OSIRIS-REx launch is the first from Cape Canaveral after the explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fuelling for a static fire test on 1 September. The explosion occurred at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40), adjacent to Atlas’ SLC-41. Although they have always been numbered separately, the two pads were both originally part of the Titan Integrate-Transfer-Launch (ITL) complex along with a shared processing facility which has since been demolished. At the time of the explosion OSIRIS-REx was already atop the Atlas V and enclosed within its payload fairing, having arrived at the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) on 29 August. The Atlas was inside the VIF when the Falcon explosion occurred a little over a mile away. Despite this, NASA and ULA are confident that the payload and rocket suffered no damage and the Atlas launch has continued on schedule. Thursday’s launch is the fifth Atlas V launch of 2016 and the eighth of the year for United Launch Alliance (ULA), who have also launched three Delta IV rockets. ULA’s next launch is currently scheduled for 16 September with another Atlas carrying the commercial Worldview 4 imaging satellite into orbit. That mission will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to dispatch the robot explorer Osiris-Rex on a seven-year mission. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Osiris-Rex is headed to a 1,640-foot-wide (500-meter-wide) asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the $1 billion mission. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu’s surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. ‘Time capsule’ “We’re going to asteroid Bennu because it’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar,” lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference Tuesday. Inside the developing solar system, small rocky bodies were beginning to form, many of them studded with water ice and organic materials, which are key compounds that may have made Earth habitable or even given life its start, Lauretta said. If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on September 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by NASA’s Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan’s Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway. The Osiris-Rex launch is set for between 7:05 p.m. and 9:05 p.m. EDT Thursday (2305 to 0105 GMT on Friday).

Most Americans actually support free trade, TPP Foreign trade and international trade deals could not be more unpopular on the presidential campaign trail this summer, as both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton emphasize that they don't like Barack Obama's pending Trans-Pacific Partnership, at least as now written. But a clear majority of Americans support TPP, and most say international trade is good for the U.S. economy, according to a survey released this morning by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Here are the details, which will bring smiles to the faces of execs at Boeing, ADM, Caterpillar and other big local exporters. For starters, two of three Americans, 65 percent, say that globalization—defined as "the increasing connections of our economy to others around the world"—is good for the U.S. That's the highest figure since the council began polling on that question two decades ago, with majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents all holding positive views. (Read the report below.) On the proposed TPP deal itself, 60 percent of those surveyed support it, the council reported, down a bit from 64 percent last year but still a clear majority. Support drops off among Republicans, traditionally the party of free trade, with 47 percent of Trump backers in favor of TPP but 58 percent of GOPers who voted for other presidential candidates in favor of the deal. Somewhat less favorable are results broken down by demographic group. In general, support for international trade and views of its impact on consumers rise with income and educational level. But those surveyed appear to recognize that there's a cost to getting more competition and cheaper prices: Only about a third say international trade is good for "job security for American workers." The survey was conducted for the council by GfK Custom Research. It sampled 2,061 adults online from June 10 to 27. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 2.2 to 3.5 percentage points, depending on the question, but higher among subgroups. So, is there a silent majority of sorts on trade that smart pols could tap? Maybe.

"Our aspiration is to become the airline of choice for the global fashion community, and our collaboration with Jimmy Choo serves as a natural extension of our fashion week alignment, particularly during New York Fashion Week," added Pierce. On the fashion runway, Etihad Airways is hosting a VIP lounge with WME | IMG and Jimmy Choo at Skylight at Moynihan Station, one of the main venues for the shows throughout New York Fashion Week, from September 8 through 15. The lounge features a retrospective of the 20 most iconic Jimmy Choo shoes from the past 20 years, as curated by the brand's Creative Director, Sandra Choi, and imagery from the Anniversary campaign, shot by Craig McDean.  Along with the airline's world-class cabin crew, the lounge will act as a hub for Etihad Airway's signature hospitality and will feature imagery from the airline's uniform campaign shot by Norman Jean Roy. Italian furniture company Poltrona Frau, the airline's exclusive onboard partner for luxury leather upholstery in The Residence, First and Business classes, are featured within the lounge. In addition to the brand's sofas, the display will include armchairs designed by Peter Marino, all featuring the top quality leather for which Poltrona Frau is known worldwide. An Etihad Airways Atelier is located in the main entrance of the Jimmy Choo VIP lounge, where guests are invited to have their initials monogrammed on a luggage tag onsite. Each accessory comes with a custom insert highlighting the Etihad Airways' guest experience. On the airport runway at JFK International Airport, Amber Valletta unveiled an Etihad Airways A380 livery with the "NYFW: The Shows" branded logo on the aircraft's engines and door, along with prints by Jimmy Choo, which are prominently displayed on board in "The Lobby" of the aircraft, located on the upper deck between the First Apartments and Business Studios. The Jimmy Choo 20th Anniversary celebration will continue with Etihad Airways during London Fashion Week and in Abu Dhabi later this year. This collaboration follows an announcement made in April 2016 of the airline's comprehensive global agreement with WME | IMG as a long-term partner of the fashion industry, connecting the airline with the fashion capitals of the world. New York is the latest stop in the sponsorship, which supports 17 fashion week events worldwide annually. It follows the airline's recent participation at Lakmé Fashion Week in Mumbai, and shows in London and Milan will follow next month. The airline began flying between New York and Abu Dhabi in October 2006 and currently offers twice-daily service between the two cities on an Airbus A380 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft but will transition to operating an all A380 service in June 2017. Etihad Airways and the airline's A380 experience, which features The Residence by Etihad™, the only three-room suite in the commercial skies, have become synonymous with world-class design, luxury and innovation. On board the A380, the airline's world-class cabin crew includes Savoy-trained Butlers dedicated to The Residence, highly-skilled Inflight Chefs in First Class, Food and Beverage Managers in Business Class and Flying Nannies trained at the famous Norland College in Economy Class. Etihad Airways opened a new First and Business Class lounge at New York's JFK International Airport in December 2015, marking a significant investment in further improving the ground experience for its guests. Conveniently located immediately after the security checkpoint in Terminal 4, the new lounge embodies the highest levels of luxury and comfort for discerning travelers. New York Fashion Week is the second major partnership for Etihad Airways in New York following its principle partnership with the New York City Football Club.

Home Entertainment BellaNaija Ladun Liadi Linda Ikeji Nigerian Newspapers Daily Times Guardian Newspaper National Mirror Punch Newspaper The Nation Newspaper Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Vanguard Newspaper Nigeria News PM News Premium Times TV Stations Channels TV Lagos Television TVC News TV Continental Videos Music Videos Notjustok Tooxclusive News Videos YOHAIG Think YOruba HAusa IGbo Plane Leasing deals Leave Airline with Sh4 Billion Loss Posted September 9, 2016 10:37 pm by admin Comments National carrier Kenya Airways’ decision to sub-lease five aeroplanes to foreign airlines left it with a Sh4 billion loss, the company’s latest financial statement shows. The multi-billion shilling loss is the difference between revenues earned from the sub-leasing contracts and payments to be made to primary lessors in the same period. Kenya Airways yesterday said that the prevailing business circumstances had made it prudent to reduce excess capacity through leasing, adding that the Sh4 billion loss is an accounting treatment covering the entire period of the sub-lease. The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ, as the airline is popularly known, signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. “The airline has sub-leased certain aircraft that are held on operating and finance lease at lease rentals that are lower than that charged by the primary lessors resulting into onerous lease provision,” the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm says in its latest annual report. KQ last year leased five Boeing aeroplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines in the middle of a liquidity crisis that it only navigated with the help of the government.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE After Samsung recalled all Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to the device exploding last week, US authorities advised airline passengers not to switch on or charge Galaxy Note 7 phones while travelling U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Shares of Samsung suffered their second worst day of the year, tumbling 4 percent Friday on the Korea Exchange. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

(AP) — SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk is calling last week's launch pad accident the "most difficult and complex failure" in the company's 14-year history. After a week of public silence, Musk said via Twitter that the company is still investigating the accident, its second in just 15 months. A massive fireball erupted during a prelaunch test Sept. 1 at the company's main launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon rocket and a satellite were destroyed, and the pad was damaged. Ground crews were fueling the Falcon for a brief test-firing of its engines, two days before its scheduled liftoff. This Thursday, Sept. 8, 2016 photo shows the damaged SpaceX launch complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. A Sept. 1 accident destroyed a SpaceX Falcon rocket and its payload during a test on the launch pad. (Red Huber/Florida Today via AP) The blast rocked the launch pad — which had been cleared of workers for the test-firing — and shook buildings several miles away at NASA's neighboring Kennedy Space Center. The sound of explosions continued for several minutes and black smoke billowed into the morning sky. Particularly puzzling, according to Musk, is "the quieter bang" heard a few seconds before what he is calling a fireball, not an explosion. He said the bang may have come from the rocket or something else. "Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation," he said in a tweet. "Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source." In the immediate aftermath, Musk said the trouble appeared to originate around the upper stage's oxygen tank. He made no mention of that in his tweets posted early Friday EDT. When pressed for further information Friday, the California-based SpaceX said there was nothing new to share for now. "We are continuing to thoroughly investigate last week's loss of Falcon 9, with support from the FAA, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and industry experts," SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton said in an email Friday. "Our priority is to safely and reliably return to flight." The core investigation team consists of about 20 people, more than half of them representing federal agencies and industry. SpaceX's vice president for flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, is heading it up. SpaceX is urging anyone with audio, photos or video of the accident to send the material to report@spacex.com for use in the investigation. "Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation," Musk said on Twitter. "Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years." A co-founder of PayPal, the 45-year-old Musk also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, and is chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. His private space company had been on a roll, with eight launches already accomplished in 2016, two of them space station supply runs for NASA. The company had also, last December, pulled off the world's first landing of a booster rocket used in an orbital mission, and had been repeating the success. It was planning to use a recycled rocket for an upcoming satellite launch. SpaceX was attempting to catch up on launches following an accident in June 2015 that grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for six months. That accident, two minutes into a delivery mission for the International Space Station, was blamed on a support strut that broke loose inside the upper stage. The issue was said to have been fixed. Now, with more than 70 launches in the wings worth $10 billion, SpaceX said it can rely on its two other launch pads if necessary, one at Kennedy and one in California, once the Falcon rocket is ready to fly again. Both pads are undergoing construction and should be ready soon. Facebook had planned to use the lost satellite — an Israeli-made communications satellite — to expand internet service in Africa. For now, NASA isn't saying much publicly about the SpaceX mishap. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start ferrying astronauts to the space station; even before SpaceX's Sept. 1 accident, next year's targeted launch date had been in jeopardy. "Clearly this incident is a setback for SpaceX," said Dale Skran, the National Space Society's executive vice president. At the same time, he noted in a statement earlier this week that NASA was wise to hire multiple companies for cargo and crew transport, not only from a competitive standpoint but for backup. At the time of the explosion, NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft was just a mile away, awaiting its own launch to chase down an asteroid. Both NASA and rocket maker United Launch Alliance conducted extra checks to make certain nothing was damaged by the blast before Thursday's successful liftoff. NASA launch director Tim Dunn was sympathetic and earlier in the week praised SpaceX's resilience. "It's nothing that any of us ever want to see," he said. "However, it is part of our business that has very harsh consequences." ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ Share or comment on this article e-mail 5 shares Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Consumer Product Safety Commission tells consumers to stop using Galaxy Note 7 devices over exploding battery fears Agency working with Samsung to announce official recall  Samsung investigation found rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault CPSC working to determine whether a replacement is acceptable remedy By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 17:24 EST, 9 September 2016 | Updated: 17:43 EST, 9 September 2016 e-mail 823 shares 33 View comments Owners of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones should stop using the devices and turn them off because of the threat of a battery fire, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has said. The CPSC said in a statement it was working with Samsung to announce an official recall of the devices as soon as possible.  The agency also said it is working quickly to determine whether a replacement Galaxy Note 7 is an acceptable remedy for Samsung or their phone carriers to provide to consumers. Scroll down for video  This Samsung customer displayed a melted Galaxy Note 7 on YouTube, saying it was less than two-weeks old. Owners of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s should stop using the devices and turn them off because of the threat of a battery fire, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has said. WHAT IS THE ISSUE?  Samsung found that a battery cell made by one of its two battery suppliers caused the phone to catch fire.  The company refused to name the supplier. 'There was a tiny problem in the manufacturing process, so it was very difficult to figure out,' Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung's mobile business told reporters at a news conference. 'It will cost us so much it makes my heart ache. Nevertheless, the reason we made this decision is because what is most important is customer safety.'  'Lithium-ion batteries pack a lot of power into a small package,' it said. 'When these batteries overheat and burst, the results can be serious.  'This is why the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is urging all consumers who own a Samsung Galaxy Note7 to power them down and stop charging or using the device. 'This consumer warning is based on recent reports involving lithium-ion batteries in certain Note7 devices that have resulted in fires.  'These incidents have occurred while charging and during normal use, which has led us to call for consumers to power down their Note7s.'  Consumer Reports earlier this week slammed Samsung for failing to issue an official recall notice for its Galaxy Note7 smartphone following reports of some phones exploding while charging. Samsung said last Friday it had stopped selling the Note7, and would replace models that consumers had already purchased. However, Consumer Reports said 'the company's action was not an official recall, which would have involved the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and would have made it illegal to sell the phones.' It also comes after U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Father-of-one left in shock after brand new Samsung Galaxy... LG beats Apple to a dual camera phone as it launches V20... Share this article Share The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing 'recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung' about the devices.  It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault.  Owners of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s should stop using the devices and turn them off because of the threat of a battery fire, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has said.  In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Delta Air Lines Inc, the No.2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it is still studying the issue. 'Delta is in constant contact with the FAA and other bodies in its run of business as a global airline,' spokesman Morgan Durrant said in a statement. 'We will comply with any directive and are studying this matter. Safety and security is always Delta's top priority.' United Continental Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the FAA advisory. Vaughn Jennings, a spokesman for Washington-based trade group Airlines for America, said the organization was 'closely monitoring any developments as this issue evolves.' A family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle (scenes from that incident pictured) The family said the phone, which was plugged in here, was engulfed in flames which quickly consumed the rest of the vehicle Samsung say they are investigating the incident, and providing assistance to the family 'Each individual carrier makes determinations, in compliance with FAA safety rules and regulations, as to what is permitted to be carried on board and in the cargo hold,' Jennings said in a statement. The FAA statement does not order U.S. airlines to take action. The International Air Transportation Association said airlines have conducted risk assessments and noted that other phones have been recalled for battery issues. 'Although Samsung is the most recent company advising of faulty devices, others have issued similar recalls and warnings regarding lithium batteries in laptops over the last 12 months, so the industry is familiar with and equipped to manage such situations,' the IATA said. Australian airlines Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia have banned passengers from using or charging the Galaxy Note 7 during flights over fire concerns. Although customers will still be able to bring the phones on flights on the Australian carriers, the ban extends to the phones being plugged into flight entertainment systems where USB ports are available. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August.  The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring.  Delta Air Lines Inc, the No.2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it is still studying the issue. The FAA statement does not order U.S. airlines to take action (stock photo) Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 is not the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to 'thermal runaway' in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels.  Water can put out the flames, but does not always halt the thermal runaway.  Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices.  Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Video Samsung Galaxy Note7 Users Urged to Turn Off Phones By ENJOLI FRANCIS Sep 10, 2016, 12:11 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayJannis Mattar/EPA WATCH US Government Warns Customers Not to Use Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Phones Due to Fire Risk 0 Shares Email The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is urging consumers who have Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphones to "power them down and stop charging or using" them. The warning, issued in a news release today, came amid recent news that lithium-ion batteries in certain Note7 devices had resulted in fires. "When these batteries overheat and burst, the results can be dangerous," the CPSC said in its statement. "These incidents have occurred while charging and during normal use, which has led us to call for consumers to power down their Note7s." The agency said it is working with Samsung to formally announce a recall of the devices. "CPSC is working quickly to determine whether a replacement Galaxy Note7 is an acceptable remedy for Samsung or their phone carriers to provide to consumers," the agency said. In a statement today, Samsung asked owners of the smartphones to exchange them for a loaner phone as it hammers out the terms of the recall. "New Note7 replacement devices will be issued to exchange program participants upon completion of the CPSC process. In the interim, consumers can return their Note7 for another device," said Tim Baxter, the president of Samsung Electronics America. "Our collaboration with the CPSC, carrier partners and via our own communication channels is aimed at ensuring all Note7 users are aware of the issue and understand their options." On Thursday the Federal Aviation Administration warned fliers not to put the Note7 smartphone in their checked bags or turn them on or charge them during flights. The same day, Samsung and fire officials said they would be launching investigations after a Florida family said a Galaxy Note7 exploded in their Jeep on Labor Day, setting the vehicle on fire and destroying it. The family said that the phone had been left charging in the empty vehicle as the engine ran. Florida Family Claims Samsung Galaxy Note7 Phone Set Jeep Ablaze Samsung Recalling Galaxy Note 7 Smartphones Because of Potentially Exploding Batteries On Sept. 2, before the Florida incident, Samsung said it was suspending sales of and recalling the Galaxy Note7. The move came after several reports that the phones exploded while charging. The tech giant said in a statement last week that there were 35 reported cases of phones with "a battery cell issue" and that it would replace devices that had been purchased. It also said sales of the smartphone would be suspended in 10 countries, including the U.S. In February the FAA issued a safety alert about lithium-ion batteries, saying airlines that carried the batteries as cargo carried the "risk of a catastrophic hull loss" after they led to fatal fires on Boeing 747s in 2010 and 2011. In 2013 several fires in the batteries of Boeing 787s led the FAA to ground the entire Dreamliner fleet. American Airlines announced Friday that it will start broadcasting warnings about the Samsung Galaxy Note7 at the gate, and on board flights. The gate announcement will be, "Due to a recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note7, the Federal Aviation Administration advises these devices should be powered off, and not connected to any power source while on board the aircraft. If your bag is checked at the gate, please remove your Galaxy Note7, and place it in your carry-on." Samsung has sold more than 1 million Note7s since the smartphone debuted in August and has manufactured an additional 1.5 million units. The unsold devices will be replaced with new, modified versions so that they will not be affected by the battery problem, Samsung said. ABC News' Paul Blake, Avianne Tan, and Erin Dooley contributed to this report. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Samsung Galaxy Note7 Users Urged to Turn Off Phones Vulnerable Countries Pledge to Go All-Renewables, With Help Today's Energy System Could Blow Paris Climate Goals Dying UK Girl Convinces Judge to Let Her Body Be Frozen China Astronauts Return From Monthlong Space Station Stay In Graveyard of Dead Coral in Pacific, Hope and Life Bloom Google Disappointed by South Korean Refusal on Mapping Data Google Hits Pixel Resellers With 'Digital Death Sentence' Facebook Boosts Efforts to 'Do Good' With New Tools " Rocket Carrying Crew of 3 Blasts off for Int'l Space Station " Trump Offers Sen.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed nearly 400 points lower, with 3M and Boeing contributing the most losses. The index also posted its biggest single day fall since June 24 and its worst week since January.

It is billed as an instrument of national pride and industrial renewal. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, September 10, 2016 Kato Manufacturing, based in the blue-collar enclave of Gifu prefecture in central Japan, is a microcosm of the country’s industrial evolution. The family-run metal shop, which was started 128 years ago, originally made simple farming tools for what was then a largely agrarian society. When Japan morphed into a manufacturing giant, churning out automobiles and electronics for the world, Kato supplied the metallic equivalent of skeletons: Sculpted frames and housings that gave products their shape. Now, as Japan aggressively tries to regain its manufacturing might in the face of competition from lower-cost countries like China, Kato is producing parts for aircraft. The company recently installed new metalworking machinery and hired half a dozen workers to accommodate orders from domestic aircraft makers. “Airplanes, rockets — they’re a symbol for manufacturing,” said Mr Keiji Kato, the company’s president and the fourth generation of the family’s leadership at the firm. Kato Manufacturing is a small piece of Japan’s vast bet on aerospace, a multi-billion-dollar government effort to replace lost manufacturing jobs and lift up the country’s industrial heartland, centred in Gifu and neighbouring prefectures. Sony and Panasonic have closed consumer electronics factories here in the past decade. While the car industry has been more resilient, officials worry that the region’s industrial base is becoming dangerously narrow. Developing aerospace is more than just a bid for economic growth. The most public symbol of this effort, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, is being billed as an instrument of national pride and industrial renewal, a chance for Japan Inc to restore some of its former glory. At a short test flight of the aircraft from an airport in Nagoya, Japan’s economy minister declared “the start of a new era for Japan’s aviation industry”. But breaking into the aerospace sector will be difficult. The country last produced a passenger aircraft more than 40 years ago, at the end of the propeller era. And Japan has never produced a civilian jet plane, although it has assembled some military models. The industry, which requires huge start-up costs, is dominated by a handful of established behemoths. Embraer of Brazil and Bombardier of Canada have long operated as a virtual duopoly in the midsize passenger-jet market that Mitsubishi is targeting. Chinese and Russian manufacturers also recently tried to grab a share of the business, with mixed results. Taxpayer funds are on the line. The Japanese government is underwriting about a third of the development costs for the Mitsubishi jet, which were initially projected at US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion) but are likely to rise after repeated delays. “If Japan succeeds at this, it could be a huge new industry. But the short-term hurdles are high,” said Mr Yasuo Unakami, an analyst at the Japan Finance Corporation, a government-backed research and investment group. “” For a country proud of its manufacturing heritage, the fact that no modern passenger airplane is marked “Made in Japan” rankles. Japan was banned from making planes after its defeat in World War II. Although the prohibition ended decades ago, efforts to revive the industry have stumbled. One project, a propeller plane called the YS-11, built by Mitsubishi and other big names in the 1960s and ’70s, was a commercial flop. Even so, enthusiasts still celebrate the short-lived plane. When the last ones were retired from service by airlines a few years ago, newspapers and television news programmes were full of nostalgic tributes. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), for which Kato is making parts, is drawing on a similar sentiment. At the unveiling of a prototype in 2014, a film showed workers holding signs with messages like “Made in Japan”, “This is our MRJ” and “MRJ renovates Japan”. “The world is full of products that are made in Japan, but unfortunately there hasn’t been a domestically made passenger plane in about 40 years,” Mr Hideaki Omiya, the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the plane’s developer, said at the time. “This is a long-held dream.” The Mitsubishi jet is the most prominent of several Japanese aircraft projects underway. Honda Aircraft, a subsidiary of Honda Motor, is developing a light jet for five or six passengers, but it is being built in North Carolina. Japanese military contractors are looking at overseas markets after a decades-long ban on arms exports was lifted in 2014. ShinMaywa Industries, for instance, is in talks to sell a large-capacity seaplane, the US-2, to the Indian navy. Mitsubishi considers its new passenger jet the logical extension of a business that has grown to encompass satellite-carrying rockets and large-scale subcontracting work on Boeing jets. The company says it has an edge in technology, in particular with lightweight composite materials. The materials, Mitsubishi says, will make the new jet more fuel efficient than those of its rivals. But making parts and subsystems to order is one thing. Organising the hugely complex task of assembling a modern jet is another. The delays to the project have added to costs and undercut technological advantages by giving competitors such as Embraer time to catch up. Mitsubishi’s first test flight took place last year, three years behind schedule. The first delivery had originally been planned for early 2014, but is now expected in late 2018. Mitsubishi declined to disclose its latest cost estimates for the project, but said it would cover any overruns without relying on additional support from public funds. “We will recover our investment costs in the long run,” it said in a statement. Despite the challenges, Mitsubishi is a central piece of the government’s plans to nurture a broader industry and to provide a lift to the sagging economy. Aircraft manufacturing now generates about ¥1.5 trillion (S$20 billion) in revenue for Japanese businesses, according to the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, an industry lobby. That is up by half from five years ago, although it is still just a small fraction of the auto industry’s sales. Japan’s efforts extend along the supply chain. C-Astac, a government organisation, helps small-business owners break into aerospace, holding seminars to explain the certification and grant process. Subcontractors such as Kato Manufacturing are benefiting from start-up cash and relaxed regulations on things like factory floor space to accommodate new machinery. Mr Kato said he received a government grant of ¥15 million to buy new equipment. His new team is a mix of seasoned factory workers and novice recruits. Mr Ryoji Soga, a youthful-looking 72, retired seven years ago but decided to come back when he heard the company needed experienced hands to produce new kinds of aircraft parts. Mr Soga said he was glad to have a good-paying industrial job. “It’s better than waving a flag at a road construction site or cleaning toilets at a supermarket,” he said.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive FAA warns airline passengers not to use Samsung smartphone Friday Sep 9, 2016 at 2:01 PM Sep 9, 2016 at 2:01 PM Joan Lowy The Associated Press WASHINGTON — U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire.  The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for theFAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Shares of Samsung suffered their second worst day of the year, tumbling 4 percent Friday on the Korea Exchange. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone.  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 | SpecOut The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report.

Army-technology.com wraps up key headlines from August. Saudi Arabia requests $1.15bn sale of battle tanks and vehicles from US The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified Congress of $1.15bn potential sale of M1A2S Abrams main battle tanks (MBT) and M88Al/A2 heavy equipment recovery combat utility lift evacuation system (HERCULES) armoured recovery vehicles (ARV) to Saudi Arabia. The procurement of the equipment will improve the Royal Saudi Land Force’s (RSLF) interoperability with US forces. Saudi Arabia will use its enhanced capability to meet current and future threats, as well as provide greater security for its critical infrastructure. Canadian Army receives first TAPV from Textron Systems The Canadian Army received the first six tactical armoured patrol vehicle (TAPV) from Textron Systems Canada, as part of efforts by the government to ensure the country’s soldiers have the right equipment to succeed at operations. In June 2012, the Canadian Government selected Textron Systems Canada as the prime contractor for the C$603.4m worth TAPV programme. The TAPV is a 4x4 wheeled armoured vehicle that will partially replace the army’s Coyote light armoured vehicle, completely replace the armoured patrol vehicle RG-31 and complement the light utility vehicle wheeled. Lockheed's PAC-3 MSE interceptor achieves initial operational capability Lockheed Martin's Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile segment enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor achieved initial operational capability (IOC) designation from the US Army. The PAC-3 MSE achieved IOC two years after receiving Milestone C approval. Lockheed Martin received the first US contract for the technology in 2014. Lockheed's high-velocity interceptor employs hit-to-kill technology to defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs), cruise missiles and aircraft. The PAC-3 MSE includes a larger, more powerful dual-pulse solid rocket motor for added thrust, as well as larger fins and other structural modifications to increase agility. Orbital ATK wins $400m contract to supply ballistic missile target rockets to US Orbital ATK received a contract valued at up to $400m from the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to supply medium-range ballistic missile target rockets. The MRBM T3c2 contract includes an initial order for vehicle development and production over a four-year period, as well as options for follow-on vehicle production and other activities through 2024, the company said.

There are nearly half a million open tech jobs in the United States today, and that number is projected to more than double within the next four years. These jobs pay 50 percent more than the average private sector job. That's why President Obama and Vice President Biden launched the TechHire initiative in 2015 to give more Americans access to accelerated tech training that leads to a well-paying tech job -- no matter what their zip code. Four thousand workers have already been trained and employed across the country, and communities and businesses have committed to training and placing an additional 35,000 people in the next few years.  Today, Vice President Biden headed to the LaunchCode Mentor Center in St. Louis, Missouri -- one of the first TechHire communities -- to speak with employees and employers who have benefitted from this collaborative approach that trains Americans for the jobs of the future.  Vice President Joe Biden gives remarks at a roundtable on a tech hire initiative at the LaunchCode Mentor Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Sept. 9, 2016. (Official White House Photo by David Lienemann)  Here's how it works: A qualified candidate applies for dozens of tech jobs without ever getting an interview. She has the skills, the motivation, and the self-discipline to learn how to code herself. But because she didn't go to college, she doesn’t get the job. But then she shows up to at LaunchCode, a not-for-profit that finds talented people across St. Louis and gives them the training and credibility for the tech jobs that employers are desperately seeking to fill. LaunchCode goes to bat for her and connects her with a position at a company like MasterCard. She gets hired on as an apprentice. She proves herself and gets hired fulltime. She becomes a systems engineer with a good-paying salary. She gets promoted. That's good for her. It's good for the company. In the last year, numerous companies -- including major St. Louis employers like Mastercard, Boeing, and Express Scripts -- have been hiring more candidates with non-traditional backgrounds. In the LaunchCode program alone, 310 people have been placed in apprenticeships with a 90 percent hiring rate into full time positions. These employees make salaries that are two times higher than their previous jobs. Sixty percent of these folks were previously unemployed, and 25 percent lack a college degree. And at LaunchCode, the Vice President announced that The Iron Yard, Code Fellows, and Operation HOPE will launch a Tech Opportunity Fund, which will offer $100 million in full-tuition scholarships to women and minorities who are underrepresented in the tech workforce. The fund is launching with $45 million in committed funding so far. Through partnerships with city-level government bodies and civic organizations, the fund will also assist scholarship recipients by addressing needs such as affordable housing, financial literacy, counseling and transportation as needed.   But we're not going to stop here. We will be announcing new commitments from mayors, governors, businesses, traditional and non-traditional training programs, and others to the TechHire initiative this fall. If you're not involved yet, you can get involved by making a commitment here. So make sure tune in to hear Vice President Biden talk about training Americans for the jobs of the future.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

The FAA also urged travelers not to stow the phones in checked baggage, either.

In some cases, the device’s lithium batteries sparked fires, including one that destroyed a Jeep in St. Petersburg, Fla. Samsung asked all owners to return the phones that began circulating in August. The offer was to exchange the phones for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge, along with a $25 gift certificate for the inconvenience. “We are offering this exchange because your safety and peace of mind is our top priority,” the company said last week. Rechargeable lithium batteries are widely used in electronic devices because they are lighter and are smaller than other comparable batteries. But the batteries are also susceptible to overheating when damaged or suffering from manufacturing problems. Larger lithium batteries sparked problems for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, after batteries short-circuited and damaged planes in Boston and Japan. The fleet of new planes was grounded worldwide for three months in early 2013 as Boeing developed and installed safeguards against the batteries overheating. “In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advices passengers not to turn on our charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage,” the FAA said Thursday in a statement.© Ahn Young-joon, AP A woman walks by an advertisement of Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphone at the company's showroom in Seoul, South Korea, Sept. 2, 2016.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Related Coverage Halt and catch fire: Battery woes go well beyond Samsung Samsung recalls Galaxy Note 7 after battery explosions Report: Samsung to recall phones after explosion claims WASHINGTON (AP/WPRI) — U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing “recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung” about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. In a statement published on their website, Samsung addressed the FAA warning about the Note 7: We are aware of the Federal Aviation Administration’s statement about the Galaxy Note7. Consumer safety and peace of mind are our top priority. We plan to expedite new shipments of Galaxy Note7 starting from this week in order to alleviate any safety concerns and reduce any inconvenience for our customers. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. MORE: Samsung recalls Galaxy Note 7 after battery explosions » The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can put out the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

John Harper writes DoD’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation Office estimated the cost of the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program to reach more than $85 billion in the coming years, or $23 billion more than the U.S. Air Force’s own estimate. James told reporters at the Pentagon that DoD and the Air Force used different methods, assumptions and data for the cost estimates. “The data that everybody is using to try to build up these cost estimates is somewhat dated simply because we haven’t done it in so long,” she added. The Air Force issued the request for proposals on the GBSD program in July. The report said Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman have submitted proposals for the program. “[As] we get the proposals back from industry, this will inform what I believe will be refinements in that cost estimate over time as we learn more,” James said, according to the report.

Added by Agency Staff on 9 September 2016. Saved under News, Top Tags: SAA, Samsung, South African Airways Tweet An SAA Boeing 747 photographed near OR Tambo International Airport (image: Bob Adams – CC BY-SA 2.0) South African Airways has banned the charging of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on board all its aircraft effective from Saturday, amid battery explosion reports. “South African Airways has taken a decision to prohibit the charging of Samsung Note 7 mobile phones on board all its aircraft,” SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said. “SAA will make appropriate announcements on board to remind passengers of this restriction and our crew has been briefed as well. “This does not amount to an outright ban of the device on our flights. We trust that all our customers will cooperate fully and observe this request which the airline is making based on safety considerations for passengers and crew,” he added. Tlali said that the decision will be effective as of Saturday, 10 September until further notice. The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) has also taken note of recent reports of exploding Note 7 batteries and concerns raised regarding the device. “Moreover, the SACAA has also noted the announcement by Samsung to stop the sales of the Galaxy Note7, and the company’s offer to replace similar devices already in customers’ possession,” SACAA said in a statement. “In light of these developments, the SACAA is currently and carefully looking into this matter and will take an appropriate decision in due course,” the statement read. However, the SACAA said that the current regulations do not prohibit airlines and operators from introducing additional and appropriate measures that would enhance civil aviation safety and security. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Comair, which operates Kulula.com and British Airways flights in South Africa, said that the company’s aircraft were not fitted with power sockets, so they would not be affected by faults which have been encountered with the Samsung Note 7. “It’s thus not necessary to ban the Samsung Note 7 from our flights,” Comair operations director Martin Louw said. “That said, we adhere precisely to the very specific procedures outlined by the Civil Aviation Authority and Boeing, including those procedures which involve electronic devices. The safety of our crew and passengers is always our foremost priority,” Louw said. Comair said it had not yet received instructions from regulators on the use of power banks and personal chargers. But if that changed, they would ensure adherence on board aircraft to any new instructions. “As stated, the safety of our crew and passengers is always our foremost priority,” Louw said. Samsung South Africa on Thursday put a stop all pre-orders of the Note 7 in the country after 35 cases of faulty devices as reported by the company. Initial reports suggested that charging the device without the original charger led to the risk of exploding batteries. The company said earlier that the availability date, which had initially been set as 23 September, had also been postponed until further notice. Meanwhile, the US Federal Aviation Administration has this week joined four Australian airlines in banning usage of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on board flights.

READ: Fearful airlines ban 'exploding' Samsung Note 7 “This does not amount to an outright ban of the device on our flights. We trust that all our customers will cooperate fully and observe this request which the airline is making based on safety considerations for passengers and crew,” he added.  Tlali said that the decision will be effective as of Saturday September 10 until further notice. Civil aviation authority, Comair respond The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) has also taken note of recent reports of exploding Note 7 batteries and concerns raised regarding the device.  “Moreover, the SACAA has also noted the announcement by Samsung to stop the sales of the Galaxy Note7, and the company’s offer to replace similar devices already in customers’ possession,” SACAA said in a statement to Fin24. “In light of these developments, the SACAA is currently and carefully looking into this matter and will take an appropriate decision in due course,” the statement read. However, the SACAA said that the current regulations do not prohibit airlines and operators from introducing additional and appropriate measures that would enhance civil aviation safety and security. National carrier SAA has moved to ban the charging of the Note 7 on flights.  Meanwhile, a spokesperson from Comair - which operates Kulula.com and British Airways flights in South Africa - said that the company’s aircraft were not fitted with power sockets, so they would not be affected by faults which have been encountered with the Samsung Note 7.  “It’s thus not necessary to ban the Samsung Note 7 from our flights," Martin Louw, Comair operations director, told Fin24. "That said, we adhere precisely to the very specific procedures outlined by the Civil Aviation Authority and Boeing, including those procedures which involve electronic devices. The safety of our crew and passengers is always our foremost priority,” Louw said.  READ: Samsung SA pulls plug on Note 7 pre-orders Comair said it had not yet received instructions from regulators on the use of power-banks and personal chargers. But if that changed, they would ensure adherence on board aircraft to any new instructions.  “As stated, the safety of our crew and passengers is always our foremost priority,” Louw said. Samsung halts pre-orders Samsung South Africa on Thursday put a stop all pre-orders of the Note 7 in the country, amid 35 cases of faulty devices as reported by the company. Initial reports suggested that charging the device without the original charger led to the risk of exploding batteries. The company also told Fin24 earlier that the availability date, which had initially been set as September 23, has also been postponed until further notice.  Meanwhile, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has this week joined four Australian airlines in banning usage of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on board flights. @KyleVenktess on Twitter.

Some of the largest Fortune 500 companies are bringing factory jobs back to U.S. shores. American flag photo via Pixabay A growing number of American companies are reshoring part or all of their operations to the U.S., a major theme in this election year. This blog looks at five Fortune 500 firms bringing manufacturing home, and focuses on story angles business reporters can use. General Electric Co. In 2011, General Electric brought the manufacturing of its energy-efficient water heaters back to Louisville, Kentucky after years of building the devices in China. USA Today reports that the move returned hundreds of manufacturing and engineering jobs to the States. The American Manufacturers Association also notes that over the past seven years General Electric has made high-efficiency light bulbs and batteries on American soil, adding 2,656 jobs. The Reshoring Initiative, a nonprofit advocacy group, reports the reasons for the switch: government incentives, the ability to improve business processes, and overseas issues such inventory control, currency changes, freight costs and personnel risks. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The mammoth retailer is one the biggest American companies to reshore operations. Although it remains a major importer of goods from China, 2013 saw the launch of Walmart’s Made in America initiative. The company pledged that by 2030, it would purchase $250 billion of products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. The American Manufacturers Association reports that the program has already brought 4,838 jobs back to America. Walmart hopes its efforts can create 1 million jobs in America, according to Boston Consulting Group. Ford Motor Co. In 2015, Ford brought back part of its operations from Mexico and Spain to Avon Lake, Ohio, creating 3,200 manufacturing jobs in the process. Some of the company’s truck models and engines are also being manufactured in the U.S. 24/7 Wall Street reports that along with state tax breaks, improving manufacturing quality and reducing shipping costs were the biggest incentives for these moves. Boeing Co. In Fall 2014, Boeing announced plans to reshore the manufacturing of its 777 series passenger jets to its St. Louis plant. Completing the process will likely take until 2017. Puget Sound Business Journal reports that Boeing’s incentive are tied to its goal of “zero growth in greenhouse gas emissions over the decade ending in 2017.” Caterpillar Inc. Caterpillar has brought some of its manufacturing from Japan and Mexico to several plants across the U.S., including Victoria, Texas, and Athens, Georgia. San Antonio Business Journal reports that moving its construction equipment manufacturing operations from Mexico to Texas will bring around 200 jobs to region, and benefit both dealers and customers. Reporter’s Takeaways More U.S. companies are attempting to restore jobs to Americans by bringing back part or all of its operations from overseas. The Reshoring Initiative is an excellent resource for researching specific cases. The Walmart Made in America initiative alone, through which the retailer pledges to purchase $250 billion of products made, sourced or grown in the states by 2030, hopes to restore 1 million jobs to the country. Look into the incentives for companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.; state tax brakes, supply chain costs and green initiatives may play a role. Debbi G McCullough runs Hanging Rock Media.

BUSINESS No flying Tesla? That's because electric planes are a steeper challenge than electric cars Airbus E-Fan prototype Jean-Pierre Muller / AFP/Getty Images A pilot sits inside the Airbus E-Fan prototype electric aircraft during a presentation at Bordeaux-Merignac Airport in France on April 25, 2014. A pilot sits inside the Airbus E-Fan prototype electric aircraft during a presentation at Bordeaux-Merignac Airport in France on April 25, 2014. (Jean-Pierre Muller / AFP/Getty Images) Samantha Masunaga Thousands of electric cars are on the road, with many more set to join them over the next few years. Electric planes? Not so much. There are several small, experimental aircraft out there — NASA is building an electricity-powered plane set for a test flight next year and a two-seat Airbus electric aircraft soared over the English Channel in 2015. But don’t expect an electric jet to fly hundreds of passengers anytime soon. Battery limitations all but rule that out. “A lot of the technical advances that happen start in smaller airplanes,” said Richard Anderson, director of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s flight research center and a professor of aerospace engineering. “There will be a market that stands for smaller, fully-electric airplanes.” The concept of using electric motors to power airplane systems dates back at least to World War II, when the B-29 Superfortress bomber used electric motors to power its gun turrets. Since then, other airplanes have replaced the ducts and hoses of hydraulic and pneumatic systems with electrical power to control such things as stabilizers and brakes. That can save significant weight and reduce fuel burn. Using electrical power to actually propel planes, however, is a more complicated challenge. In a conventional jet airplane, the engine sucks air in through its front, a compressor squeezes it, and fuel is sprayed in and lit, creating burning gases and forward thrust. Electric plane power is much simpler — batteries power an electric motor that spins a propeller. It’s more efficient, but involves far less thrust, which is why electric planes tend to be slow.  Airbus’ two-seat electric plane could only go a maximum speed of about 136 miles per hour. A solar-powered plane that completed an around-the-world journey this summer had an average airspeed of 47 miles per hour. The plane, called Solar Impulse 2, had more than 17,000 solar cells that powered four electric motors.  The payoff, however, could be a quieter, greener way to fly. According to a recent report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, aircraft were responsible for about 8% of the greenhouse gas emitted by the U.S. transportation sector in 2014. That compares to 23% for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and 61% for light-duty vehicles.  “As technology progresses, I think we’ll see big strides in improvements in noise, direct operating costs, reduction in fossil fuel burning and reduction in emissions,” Anderson said of electric aircraft research. An electric plane gets its energy from batteries, generally lithium-ion. An example of that is NASA’s X-57, an experimental plane that will test how electric propulsion technology can improve performance. See the most-read stories in Business this hour » A team of NASA researchers and private industry professionals is converting an Italian-designed Tecnam twin-engine plane fuselage into an all-electric plane by swapping out the original piston engines for electric motors and switching to battery power. A later iteration of the plane, if it receives funding, would have a modified wing with 14 electric motors that would turn propellers to simulate a high-lift component, which would reduce the speed that’s normally needed to take off. The conversion is taking place at Scaled Composites’ Mojave headquarters. Prime contractor Empirical Systems Aerospace is from Oceano, Calif.; Electric Power Systems of City of Industry is developing the battery system; Santa Cruz electric aviation start-up Joby Aviation is working on the cruise motors; and San Luis Obispo company Xperimental is making the wing. The efficiency of electric power enables other design advances, said Sean Clarke, principal investigator for the X-57 project at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base. For example, the electric motors’ smaller size and weight allowed engineers to experiment with a smaller wing and multiple engines for increased lift, said Matt Redifer, chief engineer for the X-57. “I think that electric propulsion technologies are going to greatly improve aircraft design over the next few decades," Clarke said. The biggest hurdle for these projects is battery technology, particularly a battery’s specific energy, or the amount of energy it can store for a given amount of weight. I think that electric propulsion technologies are going to greatly improve aircraft design over the next few decades. — Sean Clarke, principal investigator for the X-57 project Despite improvements, planes need a lot of lithium-ion batteries to achieve significant range. In electric cars, the main problem was the cost of the batteries, which is starting to come down. In planes, the biggest challenge is weight. The jet fuel capacity of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner is about 223,000 pounds, according to an airport planning document released in December. The estimated weight of a battery pack with equivalent energy would be 4.5 million pounds, Anderson said.  “Unless there’s a cosmic change in the battery, it’s just not going to work for bigger, faster airplanes,” he said. “It’s going to be a really long time before batteries weigh less than liquid fuel.” The X-57’s battery system alone weighs about 800 pounds — close to the weight of the plane’s fuselage. The weight of the entire aircraft is 3,000 pounds. To mitigate this, Empirical Systems Aerospace decided to put the batteries in the fuselage rather than in the wings, said Philip Osterkamp, lead integration engineer for instrumentation systems on the X-57 at Empirical Systems Aerospace. Tesla Autopilot upgrade is imminent, Elon Musk says Russ Mitchell Tesla Motors Inc. will announce “major improvements” for its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system Wednesday, according to Chief Executive Elon Musk. The improvements will come “primarily through advanced processing of radar signals,” Musk said in a series of tweets. He promised more details... Tesla Motors Inc. will announce “major improvements” for its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system Wednesday, according to Chief Executive Elon Musk. The improvements will come “primarily through advanced processing of radar signals,” Musk said in a series of tweets. He promised more details... (Russ Mitchell) Packing lithium-ion batteries on a plane has other drawbacks. In 2014, a federal probe found that an internal short circuit in a battery cell was the “probable cause” of a 2013 fire aboard a parked Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has since redesigned the batteries. Battery limitations grounded the Firefly, an all-electric helicopter developed several years ago by Sikorsky Innovations as a technology demonstrator. Firefly never flew and the program is no longer active. “It just wasn’t worth it for where the battery technology was at the time,” said Chris Van Buiten, vice president of innovation at Sikorsky. The company continues “internal explorations and studies” on the technology’s progress, he said. A more viable solution is a hybrid system with at least two motors: an electric motor that turns the propeller and a gas engine that drives another generator for power. Since its English Channel crossing, Airbus has modified its all-electric E-Fan into a hybrid to improve range and learn more about that technology. The aerospace giant is also developing an E-Fan 2.0 that runs only on electric power. NASA considered making its X-57 a hybrid, but because the plane is not intended as a commercial product, the team decided to focus simply on electric propulsion technologies, said Clarke of NASA. The ideas may not end up working out quite as expected, but he said the plane’s development is “trying to push the limit.” “NASA’s prepared for that kind of risk,” Clarke said. “We want to take bigger risks and learn where the technology could go.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists, the Rams break ground on their new stadium, Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration, and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing “recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung” about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. SAMSUNG ISSUES WORLDWIDE RECALL OF GALAXY NOTE 7 Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can put out the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

The Federal Aviation Authority has warned passengers not to turn on or charge their phones because of concerns about the devices. It has also told passengers not to put their phones in their checked bags. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments It is one of the first times that the FAA has warned people about a specific device, this time referring to the new Galaxy Note 7. The warning followed a global recall of the phone, after reports that they spontaneously exploded. Samsung investigated the problems and found that the rechargeable batteries inside the phones were at fault. In one case, a family in St Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive line-ups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring.

The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing “recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung” about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Shares of Samsung suffered their second worst day of the year, tumbling 4 percent Friday on the Korea Exchange. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Market News | Thu Sep 8, 2016 | 7:23pm EDT CORRECTED-ULA chief says recovery from space launch accident typically 9-12 mths (Corrects throughout to reflect that ULA chief Tory Bruno was speaking generally and not specifically talking about recent SpaceX accident.) By Irene Klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept 8 If history is any guide, Elon Musk's SpaceX could be grounded for nine to 12 months while it investigates the cause of last week's launch pad accident and makes any repairs, according to the chief executive of SpaceX's primary U.S. competitor on Thursday. "It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is," Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. Bruno did not mention SpaceX by name. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk's privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has "always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know ... how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place." Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. "Historically, it had never been the pad that's taken the longest time," he said. Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co , was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. An Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, was poised for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno said he called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend sympathies and offer help. "It's a small community and issues especially around safety - but even mission success - kind of transcend the competitive piece of this," Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by U.S. government agencies. Musk's company in May broke ULA's monopoly on flying U.S. military and national security satellites, winning an $83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on Sept. 19. Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. "It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service," Bruno said.

The project has been known since Soviet times as A-60 (A-60SE).

Source: Mil.ru Russia is working on a plane equipped with a new-generation laser, a source in the Russian defense industry has said in an interview with the TASS news agency. "The defense industry is working on a new-generation air-based laser," said the source. In his words, the plane with the laser is being referred to as the A-60. Earlier, the mass media reported (in Russian) that the weapon is being realized as part of the Sokol-Eshelon project.  The A-60 flying laser However, this is not the first time that Russia has tried to develop an effective plane-mounted laser weapon, and reflects the resurrection of an old project begun in the Soviet era. Work on the air-based laser system (LKAB) began in the Almaz scientific-productive association in June 1965. Almaz carried out the work on the aviation system along with the G. M. Beriev aviation scientific-technical plant in Taganrog (700 miles south of Moscow). Russia may soon be able to hit targets in space Together the two scientific centers created the A-60 Soviet aviation laser system, to be installed on the Il-76 airplane. Active testing of the flying laser system was conducted at an airport near Moscow in 1983. On April 27, 1984 the A-60's laser successfully struck an aerial target, which received the necessary damage after being hit with the radiation. In the 1990s, due to the collapse of the USSR and the consequent economic crisis, work on the project was halted. It was renewed only in the 2000s. Experts say that it is incorrect to attribute to the laser system "the objective to intercept combat blocks of ballistic missiles." "No one ever expected this of the LKAB," said Konstantin Makienko, deputy director of the Moscow-based Center for Strategy and Technology Analysis. Specialists have distinguished not so much the possibilities of striking the target thermally as the laser’s potential to suppress optic-electronic reconnaissance instruments: periscopes, rangefinders and other devices that modern weapons possess. Thanks to their focus characteristics, such devices significantly augment the impact of laser radiation. The laser's striking range can be hundreds and thousands of times greater in comparison to the limited range of the thermal strike, say Almaz representatives. The A-60 Soviet aviation laser system was to be installed on the Il-76 airplane. Source: Krasnaya zvezda Inexpensive, instantaneous and good for any weather Laser weapons are attractive primarily because of their possibility to unexpectedly and practically instantaneously (with the speed of light) attack the enemy. They are also interesting because of the inexpensiveness of the “shot,” their high precision, as well as the absence of the need to maintain an arsenal of "ammunition" during peacetime. Because it can be installed on a plane a laser can be used in all weather (shooting is not affected by cloudiness, for example), it can be transported to various locations and it can be easily maneuvered. What will 6th-generation fighters be like in the U.S. and Russia? In August 2009 the defense industry carried out an experiment in which the laser ray from the A-60 plane was aimed at a spacecraft at an altitude of over 900 miles (1,500 kilometers). Several dozen space apparatuses were discovered and tracked by the laser during the flight. At the end of 2012, according to the Izvestiya newspaper, the Defense Ministry ordered the renewal of work to create combat lasers that would strike airplanes, satellites and ballistic missiles. A laser weapons race? The U.S. also carried out tests of a powerful laser as part of the ABL project aimed at creating an anti-missile defense system. Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin participated in the project. In land tests conducted in 1985, the chemical laser heated up and blew up an immobile fuel tank at a distance of around 1,000 yards (about 1 kilometer). Modernized Russian bombers will be able to fly in the stratosphere This system had been assembled on the modified Boeing 747-400F cargo plane. The ABL consisted of infrared sensors for identifying the targets, three lasers and a lens system for focusing the ray. The tests were carried out almost annually, but in the end the testers were not able to reach the desired level of effectiveness. The project was abandoned in 2012. "The domestic aviation laser complex will use the excellence of laser weapons to maximum effect for solving important problems in Russia's aerospace defense. We are convinced that, by creating this innovative system, Almaz and the association of enterprises will maintain their leading position in the development of laser systems," said a spokesperson from the Almaz press service.

PHOTO | FILE  By VICTOR JUMA, vjuma@ke.nationmedia.com Posted  Friday, September 9   2016 at  09:47 In Summary The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. National carrier Kenya Airways’ decision to sub-lease five aeroplanes to foreign airlines left it with a Sh4 billion loss, the company’s latest financial statement shows. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet Related Stories Kenya Airways board to share recovery plan with shareholders KQ leases two more planes to Turkish, Oman Air KQ plane sales and leases to earn carrier Sh11bn The multi-billion shilling loss is the difference between revenues earned from the sub-leasing contracts and payments to be made to primary lessors in the same period. Kenya Airways yesterday said that the prevailing business circumstances had made it prudent to reduce excess capacity through leasing, adding that the Sh4 billion loss is an accounting treatment covering the entire period of the sub-lease. The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ, as the airline is popularly known, signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. “The airline has sub-leased certain aircraft that are held on operating and finance lease at lease rentals that are lower than that charged by the primary lessors resulting into onerous lease provision,” the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm says in its latest annual report. KQ last year leased five Boeing aeroplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines in the middle of a liquidity crisis that it only navigated with the help of the government. READ: KQ leases two more planes to Turkish, Oman Air ALSO READ: KQ plane sales and leases to earn carrier Sh11bn The airline recognised a Sh1.4 billion loss in the year ended March 2016, with the balance of Sh2.5 billion expected to filter through over the coming years as the contracts roll on in the medium term. KQ chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze said at the time of signing the lease contracts that they would reduce fleet costs by Sh8.4 billion annually, indicating that sub-leasing at a loss (which was not disclosed at the time) represents a lesser evil compared to maintaining a bloated fleet. “These actions will reduce our monthly fleet costs by over $7 million (Sh707 million), and improve our liquidity, and is part of our strategy to return Kenya Airways to profitability in the next 18 to 24 months,” Mr Ngunze said on a May 26, 2016 statement, adding that while it was sad to see brand new aircraft going to other airlines, it was important to understand the context in which the decision was made.  READ: Kenya Airways board to share recovery plan with shareholders KQ leased two B787s to Oman Air for three years and is set to take a loss of Sh918 million in that transaction. Besides, its lease of three B773s to Turkish Airlines for four years is expected to result in a loss of 3.1 billion, bringing the total loss to Sh4 billion. Sub-leasing the aircraft, non-renewal of other leases and sale of several aeroplanes saw KQ’s fleet drop to 47 planes in the year ended March compared to 52 units the year before. 1 | 2 Next Page » Latest from Daily Nation: Business State bets on new pest-proof storage bags to reduce maize wastage GE Africa celebrates breast cancer awareness month Big GE digital acquisition uses cloud analytics to keep machines in shape GE Africa and USADF launch 2017 Off-Grid Energy Challenge for women Loss-making Portland set to send home 1,000 workers NSE top gainers & losers n-soko About us Contact us Digital Editions Syndication Help Privacy Policy Terms RSS

The airline has warned about Samsung devices after some caught fire overseas. Photo / Alan Gibson Air New Zealand has joined other airlines of warning passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The US Federal Aviation Administration has warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. "On recommendation from the FAA all Air New Zealand customers carrying Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices must ensure that they are carried in the cabin only and not turned on or charged while onboard any Air New Zealand service," an airline spokeswoman said. The devices must not be carried in checked in baggage. Airlines in Australia have taken similar action. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Continued below.

The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws.

That’s what the history is,” Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. Bruno did not mention SpaceX by name. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk’s privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has “always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know … how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place.” Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. “Historically, it had never been the pad that’s taken the longest time,” he said. Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co, was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. The Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, blasted off at 7:05 p.m. EDT (2305 GMT) on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno also said he had called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend his sympathies and offer help. “It’s a small community and issues especially around safety – but even mission success – kind of transcend the competitive piece of this,” Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by U.S. government agencies. Musk’s company in May broke ULA’s monopoly on flying U.S. military and national security satellites, winning an $83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on Sept. 19. Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. “It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service,” Bruno said.

By: AP | Washington | Updated: September 9, 2016 9:15 am Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery exploding issue: US FAA warns passengers from using  the smartphone inside a flight.  US aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing “recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung” about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad ULA chief says recovery from space launch accident typically 9-12 months By Reuters Published: 19:42 EST, 8 September 2016 | Updated: 19:42 EST, 8 September 2016 e-mail By Irene Klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept 8 (Reuters) - If history is any guide, Elon Musk's SpaceX could be grounded for nine to 12 months while it investigates the cause of last week's launch pad accident and makes any repairs, according to the chief executive of SpaceX's primary U.S. competitor on Thursday. "It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is," Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. Bruno did not mention SpaceX by name. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk's privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has "always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know ... how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place." Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. "Historically, it had never been the pad that's taken the longest time," he said. Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co , was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. The Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, blasted off at 7:05 p.m. EDT (2305 GMT) on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno also said he had called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend his sympathies and offer help. "It's a small community and issues especially around safety - but even mission success - kind of transcend the competitive piece of this," Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by U.S. government agencies. Musk's company in May broke ULA's monopoly on flying U.S. military and national security satellites, winning an $83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on Sept. 19. Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. "It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service," Bruno said.

"It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is," Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. Bruno did not mention SpaceX by name. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk's privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has "always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know ... how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place." Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. "Historically, it had never been the pad that's taken the longest time," he said. Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co , was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. An Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, was poised for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno said he called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend sympathies and offer help. "It's a small community and issues especially around safety - but even mission success - kind of transcend the competitive piece of this," Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by U.S. government agencies. Musk's company in May broke ULA's monopoly on flying U.S. military and national security satellites, winning an $83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on Sept. 19. Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. "It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service," Bruno said.

Sep 8, 2016 Comments Dear President Obama, There is much commentary these days about your legacy and your continued strivings to further extend your administration’s reach in the remaining months of your second term of office. Your recent expansion of public land reserves and the large expansion of our country’s ocean sanctuaries in the regions surrounding Hawaii and Guam are described as part of your environmental legacy. I write once again to invite you to meet with the Washington-based, full-time nonprofit civic action and service community. On several occasions during your presidency, I have recommended that you speak to a thousand or more leaders of the national civic community in a downtown D.C. hotel ballroom or auditorium such as historic Constitution Hall. Nonprofit organizations have millions of dues-paying members throughout the country supporting the fundamental bulwarks and seed corns of our beleaguered democracy. They cover the important advocacy areas of peace, civil liberties and civil rights, antipoverty and health, consumer protection, environment, labor safety, access to justice, worker rights and many traditional secular and religious charities that minister to the needy. Yet there has been no response to these invitations except a reply by the office of Michelle Obama on July 17, 2011 saying the President was too busy. Of course, Presidents are very busy, but they find time, as you did to attend nearly 500 fundraisers around the country and to visit numerous factories and other corporate destinations. Even during a visit to India, you found time to extol Boeing Airplanes and Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. No President has explicitly reached out to the broad civic community since President-elect Jimmy Carter attended such a special mass convocation in Washington, D.C., late in 1976. He came to listen and to meet the constituency that he knew was crucial to enacting many of the substantive programs he was planning at the time. It was a grand, motivating success. Late in your second term, you could come to serve several other purposes. First, you can give necessary visibility to those committed people whose groups are left in the shadows during presidential election years despite their ability to enrich the content of such electoral activities with their exceptional hands-on knowledge and experience. Second, you can make recommendations regarding various facilities, checkoffs and new directions which can enlarge nonprofit membership and programs. Third, you can educate the public about the critical role this “voluntary sector” has played in American history. Fourth, you can herald the significant number of jobs and economic activity—millions of staff and tens of billions of dollars coursing through the economy—which can only expand with larger philanthropy by billionaires, mega-millionaires, and regular citizens you might inspire to contribute to nonprofit organizations. Your address can become a presidential marker for your successors and for future generations of Americans inspired by your concrete words and proposals. It is difficult to understand why you have not yet embraced this opportunity. Certainly you have mentioned civic duty, civic engagement and civic visions for posterity on a number of occasions. Especially now when all elections are behind you, isn’t it time to highlight the civic values and the civic heroes who reflect them in ways both dutiful and dramatic? Lastly, such a presentation will set a finer, higher stage for your successor to inherit. What say you, President Obama? Ralph Nader P.S.

(Photo by Watchara Phomicinda, San Gabriel Valley Tribune/ SCNG) When a manufacturing company can hang around for 65 years and still remain vital despite increasing global competition, that says a lot about how well the business is run. Gordon Brush Mfg. Co. Inc., based in the City of Industry, has managed to do both. The company recently moved from Commerce to a new $16 million, 183,000-square-foot building in Industry that’s three times bigger than its previous facility. “We’re continuing to grow and we added over 750 customers this year,” said Alan Schechter, the company’s vice president of sales and marketing. “We tried to expand many times in Commerce, but there was a lot of red tape. We were also heavily recruited by other states. We had a private meeting with the governor of Arizona — they were rolling out the red carpet for us. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was also interested. We pride ourselves on being an American manufacturer.” Company opts to remain in California That philosophy is what prompted Rep. Grace F. Napolitano, D-El Monte, and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, to visit Gordon Brush a couple of weeks ago to thank the company for staying in Southern California. “Despite foreign competition and companies replicating their products, Gordon Brush, one of the last brush makers in the U.S., continues to manufacture its goods right here in the San Gabriel Valley, employing local residents and stimulating our region’s economy,” Napolitano said during her visit. More than 15,000 types of brushes made Founded in 1951, Gordon Brush is a leading manufacturer of specialty, custom and standard brushes for industrial, commercial and consumer uses. The company employs about 125 full-time workers. Many of them have been with Gordon Brush for 30 to 40 years. And brushes? The company makes more than 15,000 types that are used in the aerospace, medical, electronics, janitorial, military, aerospace and pharmaceutical industries. Duster brushes, strip brushes, bore brushes, detail brushes, flow-thru brushes — the list is long and this specialty manufacturer has amassed a roster of clients that includes Boeing, McMaster-Carr, Motion Industries and Techni-Tool, among others. A big investment in equipment “Fifty percent of our business is custom brushes,” Schechter said. “Many times we don’t even know what the brushes are used for. A company will send us the specs and we make them.” The company’s facility at 3737 Capital Ave. in Industry houses an array of high-tech equipment — with some of the machines valued at more than $1 million — but some of the work is still done by hand. On Wednesday, 30-year employee Roberto Valenzuela, 68, placed a couple of steel wires between two clamps on a machine that proceeded to twist the wires tightly together. When that process was completed he inserted the bristle material onto the wires and the machine bound them together. Advertisement “I like this job,” said Valenzuela. “Been here a long time.” Products for the military and the public Gordon Brush produces custom-made brushes that the U.S. Army uses to clean the main gun on its Abrams tanks. The effectiveness of the brushes — and the fact that they were produced and delivered when the Army desperately needed them — combined to save the Department of Defense more than $1.5 billion. The company’s products have been used on NASA space shuttles and lunar modules and its brushes are also used to clean the guidance system and guns on the Apache helicopter. At the other end of the spectrum, one of the company’s more popular products is the FootMate System. The unit includes a set of brushes that are attached to a rubber base lined with small suction cups. The FootMate can be placed on the floor of a shower stall or bathroom. After a gel is applied, users can rub their feet back and forth through the brushes, which massage tender areas of the foot and remove dead skin. Gordon Brush has managed to thrive amid economic ups and downs in the economy. But the threat of competition remains real as lower-priced Chinese products continue to flood the market. “Companies that have nothing to differentiate themselves on besides price are the most vulnerable to the threat of lower-priced Chinese-made products,” company President and CEO Ken Rakusin said in a statement. “In spite of all of these issues, I was determined to build and grow my business in the United States by reinvesting profits into the purchase of millions of dollars in manufacturing equipment and machinery. Pride in contributing to the American economy is near and dear to my heart.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reach the author at Kevin.Smith@sgvn.com or follow Kevin on Twitter: @SGVNBiz.

System Architecture: Pivotal Decisions in Complex Systems A new online-only MIT certificate course explores how a small number of key decisions makes a big impact on system performance. by Dr. Bruce G. Cameron September 8, 2016 Provided by Our world runs on increasingly complex systems. From cars to power plants, we increasingly expect immediate connectivity, machine learning on product data, and technology infusion, all of which are driving up the complexity of modern systems. These systems—found in industries ranging from aerospace to automotive, from high technology to healthcare, and beyond—rely on professionals who have a deep understanding of both the components of the system and their system-level behaviors, desirable and undesirable alike. Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems New four-course online certificate program begins September 12. Register today! Consider Twitter. Follow a spate of outages during the 2010 World Cup, where peak activity crashed its infrastructure, Twitter re-architected its entire monolithic codebase. Today, it routinely processes about 5,700 tweets per second, and has handled a peak of 143,199 tweets per second (on August 3, 2013, during the airing of a popular TV show in Japan). That’s just one example of the rising demands users put on these systems. These demands go beyond surges and scalability. For products to capture market share, we ask systems to innovate on existing offerings, incorporate novel technologies, and address multiple markets. For companies to compete on tight margins, we ask that systems be designed to optimize manufacturing cost and be delivered through multi-tiered supply chains. My experience is that a substantial portion of a system’s performance is determined by a relatively small set of decisions—architectural decisions. For engineers, program managers, and business owners, such decisions make all the difference. I’m excited to announce that MIT is launching a new four-course professional-certificate program to explore these architectural decisions along with industry leaders. The online-only program, Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems, begins Sept. 12, 2016. Every Built System Has an Architecture Products such as mobile phone software, cars, and semiconductor capital equipment are defined by a few key architectural decisions made early in the program lifecycle. Those early decisions drive downstream decisions. In the real-world design of complex systems, however, engineers often don’t have full knowledge of those systems’ eventual scope before making decisions that may have a big impact—from creating bottlenecks that constrain performance, to restricting potential manufacturing sites, to reducing after-market revenue share. For example, MIT worked with NASA on the architecture of next-generation communication satellites. NASA currently operates three sets of relay satellites, each the size of a school bus, to convey government data from science and military space missions. NASA officials felt an architectural change was needed to reduce costs, which today are two to three times more than those of commercially operated satellites. MIT worked with NASA over a three-year period to identify the architectural decisions—such as the presence or absence of on-board data storage, the choice of orbit, the number of satellites per orbital plane, and technology development for inter-satellite links—and analyzed millions of combinations of decisions to identify the top candidates for new architectures. Despite the uncertainty around scope, my experience is that spending time upfront on architectural decisions—whether you are sequencing the decisions to be made based solely on your team’s experience or sequencing them more explicitly using decision models to estimate sensitivities—can have a substantial return on investment. In other words, good architectural decisions can create competitive advantages in difficult markets, but bad decisions can hobble large development programs down the road. Models and Methods In launching the new Architecture and Systems Engineering program, we’re excited to be exploring such decisions with industry leaders. We’ve brought together some of the biggest organizations involved in complex systems—including GE, Boeing, Raytheon, GM, NASA, and Caterpillar, among others—to talk about the state of the practice today.   One of the trends we’re most interested in exploring is the movement away from paper-based design that’s often known as “model-based system engineering” (MBSE). The big idea behind MBSE is to digitize the design process. Despite big improvements in software, from product lifecycle management software (PLM) such as Siemen’s Team Center or PTC’s Windchill, to simulation software such as large airflow simulation or mature structural codes, much of the design process is still based on paper documents. These documents carry a legacy of long rework cycles and are often the culprits in quality issues. The vision of MBSE is to combine large models to where the team works on a central model with a focus on concurrency. “Systems engineers who are working on these complex systems really have to be the ones that understand where the margin is, understand the system performance, and then advocate for the entire system,” explains Greg Hyslop, Boeing CTO and senior vice president of Boeing Engineering Test and Technology Group. We will discuss the promise of MBSE for making system architecture decisions, and we’ll explore the failure modes and management issues that underpin it. The computer-aided design (CAD) revolution took decades to mature—our approach to MBSE is to take a hard look at the challenges, and to foster a discussion about the implementation that’s grounded in the experience of a consortium of companies. Making Better Architectural Decisions Which architectural decisions did Twitter engineers make in their search for scalability after the 2010 World Cup? They decided the gains from their original, monolithic code base had been exhausted—at the time, it was one of the world’s largest Ruby on Rails installations. So they reinvented their architecture as a Java Virtual Machine installation, modularizing its functionality and placing more emphasis on concurrency. It may sound like motherhood and apple pie, but architectural changes like these take a measure of courage — we’d prefer to make them from a position of analysis and strength rather than as a gamble. Join us in exploring these issues in more depth in MIT’s new Architecture and Systems Engineering professional-certificate program, beginning Sept. 12. Bruce G. Cameron is faculty director for MIT’s new professional-certificate program, Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems. He is the director of MIT’s System Architecture Lab, a lecturer in engineering management in MIT’s existing System Design and Management master’s degree and distance programs, and a co-founder of Technology Strategy Partners, a boutique consulting firm. His research interests at MIT include technology strategy, system architecture, and the management of product platforms.

The recall will cost about $640 million, which will be booked in its third-quarter earnings, Ford said Thursday in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company had said in July that this year’s pretax profit would match or exceed last year’s $10.8 billion but that the outlook was “at risk” due to slowing sales and rising costs. Ford said it still expects pretax profits in the third quarter to be about 10 percent of its full-year earnings. Ford said it is expanding the door latch recall to almost 2.4 million vehicles in North America, an increase of 1.5 million, at the request of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said a side-door latch could break, possibly resulting in the door opening while the vehicle is moving. Ford said it has identified one accident and three injuries that may be related to the faulty latches.

Dealers will replace the latches, the automaker said. Ford shares rose 0.1% to $12.71 at 12:14 p.m. in New York. They declined 9.9% this year through Wednesday. Leadership Change Also today, Ford announced it will add John S. Weinberg, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice chairman whose grandfather helped take the automaker public in 1956, to its board. Weinberg, 59, will join Ford’s board on Oct. 1, the company said in a statement Thursday. He retired from Goldman last year after more than three decades at the firm. While at Goldman, Weinberg advised Ford for more than 15 years, as well as working with General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. and leading the firm’s team on initial public offerings for Visa Inc. and Under Armour Inc., the automaker said. “John is a trusted advisor with a deep understanding of Ford, our history and the future needs of our business,” Bill Ford, executive chairman and great-grandson of founder Henry Ford, said in a statement. Weinberg brings expertise in finance, banking and the capital markets, he said. Weinberg’s grandfather, Sidney Weinberg, ran Goldman from the Great Depression until 1969 and worked with Henry Ford II on the automaker’s initial public offering 60 years ago. Weinberg’s father, John L. Weinberg, was senior partner and chairman of the firm from 1976 to 1990. As Weinberg was leaving Goldman last year, Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said: “We appreciate all of the support he has given us, wish him all the best and look forward to the opportunity to work with him again in the future.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Credit: Thinkstock/Wikimedia More like this Star Trek tech: From science fiction to science fact Star Trek stars' remains to be launched into space Sizing up security in Star Trek Video How open space fosters innovation in IT For Robert Hurt, some of his earliest memories are of sitting with his dad in their den watching the original Star Trek and dreaming of space travel and astronomy. Now 50 years later, Hurt is a physicist working at the California Institute of Technology on NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, peering deep into areas of space that have always been hidden from us. Like Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise, Hurt is a space explorer. After Star Trek first aired - 50 years ago today - on Sept. 8, 1966, people could envision a time when the human race would explore space and "boldly go where no man (or woman) has gone before." The show, which ran for three seasons, also began to inspire those kids in PJs or hanging out with friends watching Kirk and Mr. Spock meet aliens and explore distant planets. For many researchers today, their passion for science was fed by the original series, along with the later spin-offs and movies that followed. Robert Hurt Robert Hurt, a physicist working at the California Institute of Technology. "It really fueled our interests," said Hurt, adding that there's a good chance he wouldn't be a scientist today without Star Trek's inspiration. "One of the things that was most formative for me as a child was that...with Star Trek, science isn't something we fear. The second in command of the Enterprise was the science officer. That was a really powerful symbol growing up. Science doesn't create monsters. Science is what we use to face problems and solve problems." That original show has been followed by five more TV series, including The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager. And the franchise isn't dormant. A seventh television series, Discovery, is expected to begin airing on CBS All Access in January. There also have been 13 Star Trek films, including this year's latest movie Star Trek Beyond. All served to create a mythology around space exploration, multi-cultural diversity and cooperation and an optimism around science. John Smith, who does trajectory design for outer planets missions at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said Star Trek was one of the very first shows he can remember watching as a kid. It influenced his career, as well as his outlook on life. John Smith John Smith, who does trajectory design for outer planets missions at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "It drove me towards aerospace engineering," Smith said, noting that he's seen each of the original episodes at least a dozen times. "For that time period, there were few shows that reflected the optimism and the acceptance that was present in that show.... It was very revolutionary for the day and it was present throughout Star Trek." For Lee Sheldon, who today is a professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) but was a writer and producer on the fourth season of The Next Generation, it was important to carry the message that science is cool and important throughout the different series. Lee Sheldon Lee Sheldon, a WPI professor who was a writer/producer on the fourth season of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." He also noted that in his conversations with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, the people involved in the shows were conscious of the influence the series and movies had on kids and on the scientific community. "Oh, I think we were all very aware," Sheldon said. "Even though it's set centuries in the future, we were very aware that the science should be as good as it could be. If we were going to speculate, it should be an extrapolation of science. It set goals for scientists today." Star Trek writers and actors even went out to talk to students about the importance of science. "Everyone was very aware that we had something important to say and that we could affect the future," said Sheldon. "I think a lot of kids were incredibly inspired." Seeing that you could have an exciting job working in science was an 'Aha' kind of moment for Emily L. Howard, a senior technical fellow with The Boeing Company. "Many of the women were scientists on the show," she said. "I don't know that I knew I was destined for a future in science, but seeing women who were solving problems and using their creativity absolutely inspired me." The real-life Apollo space program, the first moon landing in 1969 and physicist Sally Ride's becoming the first female NASA astronaut, offered a lot of positive scientific influences for Howard. But the fictional world of Star Trek carried its own importance. "I can't give all that power to a single show, but it certainly helped fuel my interest," she said. "There were other things happening at the time, but at that young [age] to be exposed to these amazing possibilities about the future, planted a seed very deeply in me." It planted a similar seed in Marc Rayman, the director and chief engineer of NASA's Dawn mission. Marc Rayman, director and chief engineer of NASA's Dawn mission. Rayman has been a serious Trekkie since the original show began when he was in the seventh grade. The first class he ever skipped in his life was when a Star Trek movie was opening at same time as his graduate class in statistical mechanics. He would not only go on to himself be involved with spacecraft that explore alien worlds. And when he worked on NASA's Deep Space 1 program, the first interplanetary mission to use low-thrust propulsion technology, Rayman began calling it ion propulsion -- in honor of Star Trek. "Star Trek didn't so much inspire me, but it fueled the passions that were already burning within me," he said. "Star Trek showed the future I wanted to be a part of.... It would never have occurred to me that in the year 2016 -- 50 years after the first show was on -- that the show would have that kind of longevity. That's a testament to how powerful it was and how much it meant to so many people." Rayman said he found out a few years ago that he was working with a colleague who didn't know the original series or the spinoffs. "You kind of wonder how JPL could even hire a guy like that," he said, laughing. "You'd think NASA would be a little more discriminating. Apart from that he's a good guy, but this major deficiency in his education was troubling." Rayman has set about "rectifying this major flaw." Robert Federking Robert Frederking, an associate dean for Carnegie Mellon University's school of computer science. That kind of education wouldn't have been an issue for Mike Ciaraldi, a professor of computer science and robotics engineering at WPI. Ciaraldi still remembers watching the first episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap," when it premiered. For him, science fiction in general, and Star Trek in particular, is all about using your brain to solve problems and how a hero avoids a fight or outright calamity by out-thinking an opponent. Star Trek also let kids know there were other people interested in science. Robert Frederking, an associate dean for Carnegie Mellon University's school of computer science, had a fan club membership -- and he still owns a set of blueprints of the starship enterprise. "It made me think about things like were would warp drives really be possible and would transporters work. It made me think," he said. "It certainly encouraged me. I think it's safe to say I still think it's interesting. Like Spock, I would say it's fascinating."

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Sep 8, 2016 at 12:47PM Drones are starting to be a big business for Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of defense contractor Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc (NASDAQ:KTOS) jumped a whopping 58.3% in August, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after reporting earnings and some key contract wins. So what Second-quarter revenue grew 4.8% to $168.2 million and net loss improved from $15.0 million a year ago to $10.4 million, or $0.17 per share. Within that, the unmanned systems division showed a 25.3% increase in revenue to $17.8 million, showing strong performance in drones.   Kratos also won a $20 million contract to provide a tanker training system to Boeing and got a $14 million drone order during the month. New contracts are key because the company has been keeping engineering staff in high anticipation of winning drone contracts in the future. Some of those orders are now coming to fruition, which should lead to better financials over the next year. Now what It's important to keep in mind that Kratos is still losing money, so there's still a lot of financial risk for investors. But shares had fallen so far -- as low as $2.80 per share in the last 52 weeks -- that good news could result in huge gains for investors. As losses shrunk and new contracts poured in during August, the stock started to see that leverage in action. Just keep an eye out for more momentum in sales, because Kratos needs to show continued growth or the losses will persist. Travis Hoium has no position in any stocks mentioned.

By Dan Cancian September 8, 2016 17:35 BST IAG CEO Willie Walsh's comments are another warning for Airbus and Boeing, the world's leading aircraft manufacturersReuters International Consolidated Airlines Group said it will review its plane orders amid a global economic slowdown and the outcome of Britain's decision to leave the European Union. The owner of British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus said after the referendum in June that it would have to cut spending on the back of weaker demand from business customers, while the sharp decline suffered by the pound only exacerbated the problem. Both issues are yet to be resolved, group chief executive Willie Walsh said on Thursday (8 September), while speaking at an airline conference in London. He added that the FTSE 100 giant and its sector peers were likely to rein in spending on new aircraft for the foreseeable future. "Without doubt all airlines, including airlines within IAG, are reassessing their requirements for new aircraft, as the outlook for growth has softened," he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg TV. "I don't think we're going to see growth rates that were anticipated." Walsh's latest comments are another warning for Airbus and Boeing, the world's leading aircraft manufacturers, which have registered their lowest order figures in six years, as the aviation sector continues to swim against the tide amid a challenging environment. Last year IAG ordered 20-single single-aisle Airbus A320neo and, earlier this year, the group indicated it would purchase used widebody Boeing 777s and lease Airbus's double-decker A380s for some of its British Airways routes. However, IAG's chief executive was more optimistic over the outlook for the sector, indicating a number of airlines wanted to join the conglomerate, although the company was not looking to consolidate its operations at the moment. "We're always looking for the opportunity," he said. "We're structured to facilitate further consolidation if the right opportunity comes along. We're not actively looking at anything in particular at the moment."

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FL – Today is ‘Earth Departure Day’ for OSIRIS-REx, NASA’s first mission to snatch “pristine materials” from the surface of a near Earth asteroid named Bennu and deliver them back to Earth in seven years on a mission to unlock mysteries on the formation of our Solar System and ourselves 4.5 Billion years ago. The 4.5 Billion mile roundtrip ‘Journey to Bennu and Back’ begins today. All systems are GO for a spectacular dinner-time blastoff of NASAs OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from the Florida Space Coast. Earth departure for NASA’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security – Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is slated for shortly before sunset this evening, Thursday, September 8 at 7:05 p.m. EDT. Excited spectators are filling local area hotels for this once in a lifetime mission to ‘Bennu and Back.’ Bennu is a small, carbon-rich asteroid – meaning it contains significant amounts of organic molecules, the stuff of which life is made. Bennu is only about a third of mile in diameter, measuring 500 meters or 1,614 feet across and it crosses Earth’s orbit around the sun every six years. You can watch the sure to be a spectacular launch live in person here in sunny Florida or live via a choice of webcasts. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx launch coverage will be broadcast on NASA TV beginning at 4:30 p.m. EDT Sept. 8, as well as on a ULA webcast. You can watch the launch live at NASA TV at – http://www.nasa.gov/nasatv You can watch the launch live at ULA at – www.ulalaunch.com Today’s weather forecast remains very promising and is currently 80% GO for favorable conditions. The only concern is for cumulus clouds. There are 3 opportunities in a row to launch OSIRIS-Rex. In case of a delay 24 or 48 hour delay, the forecast drops only slightly to 70% GO.

Watch this OSIRIS-Rex trailer from NASA Goddard illustrating the probes Earth departure launch phase: NASAs OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is on a mission to explore asteroid Bennu and return a sample to Earth. The OSIRIS-REx launch window opens on September 8, 2016, when the spacecraft begins its two-year journey to Bennu aboard an Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral, Florida. After arriving at Bennu in 2018, OSIRIS-REx will spend over a year exploring the asteroid before approaching its surface to grab a sample. This pristine material, formed at the dawn of the solar system, will be returned to Earth in 2023, providing clues to Bennus origins and our own. Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/David Ladd OSIRIS-REx will gather rocks and soil and bring at least a 60-gram (2.1-ounce) sample back to Earth in 2023. It has the capacity to scoop up to about 2 kg or more. The mission will help scientists investigate how planets formed and how life began. It will also improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth by measuring the Yarkovsky effect. Bennu is an unchanged remnant from the collapse of the solar nebula and birth of our solar system some 4.5 billion years ago.

Probe is slated for Sep. 8, 2016 launch to asteroid Bennu from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com It was chosen as the target because it is little altered over time and thus ‘pristine’ in nature. Bennu is a near-Earth asteroid and was selected for the sample return mission because it could hold clues to the origin of the solar system and host organic molecules that may have seeded life on Earth.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The 189 foot tall ULA Atlas V rocket is launching in the rare 411 configuration for only the 3rd time on this mission – which is the 65th for the Atlas V. The Atlas 411 vehicle includes a 4-meter diameter payload fairing and one solid rocket booster that augments the first stage. The Atlas booster for this mission is powered by the RD AMROSS RD-180 engine and the Centaur upper stage was powered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C-1 engine. The RD-180 burns RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly purified kerosene) and liquid oxygen and delivers 860,200 lb of thrust at sea level. The strap on solids deliver approximately 500,000 pounds of thrust. The solids will be jettisoned about 2 minutes after liftoff. OSIRIS-REx will return the largest sample from space since the American and Soviet Union’s moon landing missions of the 1970s. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers Program, following New Horizons to Pluto and Juno to Jupiter, which also launched on Atlas V rockets. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is responsible for overall mission management. OSIRIS-REx complements NASA’s Asteroid Initiative – including the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) which is a robotic spacecraft mission aimed at capturing a surface boulder from a different near-Earth asteroid and moving it into a stable lunar orbit for eventual up close sample collection by astronauts launched in NASA’s new Orion spacecraft. Orion will launch atop NASA’s new SLS heavy lift booster concurrently under development.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version September 8, 2016 - 12:31 AMT SHARE NASA’s record-breaking astronaut, Russian crew return safely to Earth NASA astronaut and Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams returned to Earth Tuesday after his U.S. record-breaking mission aboard the International Space Station, NASA website reports. Williams and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, landed in their Soyuz TMA-20M at 9:13 p.m. EDT southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan (7:13 a.m. Sept. 7, local time). Having completed his fourth mission, Williams now has spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. Skripochka now has 331 days in space on two flights, while Ovchinin spent 172 days in space on his first. Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins Aug. 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter’s main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. During his time on the orbital complex, Williams ventured outside the confines of the space station for a second spacewalk with Rubins to retract a spare thermal control radiator and install two new high-definition cameras. Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity’s only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Williams was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft in March, the company's fourth commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX’s eighth Dragon spacecraft cargo delivery in April, and welcomed a second Dragon delivery in July. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft also docked to the station in April and July delivering tons of supplies. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command. He, Rubins, and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, will operate the station for more than two weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Sept. 23, U.S. time, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
