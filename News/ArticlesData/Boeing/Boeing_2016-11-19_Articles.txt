Along with that, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala. Similarly, many positions in Kent, Wash., will move to nearby Tukwila. Boeing also will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. With the moves, Los Angeles County gains about 1,600 positions, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400. “Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,” Caret said. “This will help drive our global growth in Boeing’s second century.” To bolster that effort, Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom will be aligned and managed in a new global operations group led by David Pitchforth. He will also continue as managing director of Boeing Defence UK. While Pitchforth will report directly to Caret, those three organizations will continue operating independently.

The first of its new generation Boeing 777-300ER aircraft is expected to be delivered later this month and will feature upgraded Business Class seats amongst other features. Next Generation Emirates Airbus A380 In addition to its iconic Onboard Lounge and First Class Shower Spa, the new generation Emirates A380 – 388Q will have several new features including a new seat configuration.

First and Business Class seats will remain at 14 and 76 respectively. Among the features is an elegant new design in the Business Class cabin with a higher ceiling to create a more spacious and luxurious feel for customers. Overhead cabin lockers on the new A380 aircraft will be concentrated in the middles aisles and will be 28% larger in volume.

It landed at Queen Alia International Airport straight from Boeing manufactures in Seattle and is the sixth 787 (Dreamliner) to become part of the airline fleet. RJ president/CEO Captain Suleiman Obeidat, who received the aircraft upon its arrival, expressed satisfaction with the addition of this new 787 to the currently operating five aircraft of the same type, which RJ introduced at the end of 2014 as part of the plan to modernize its long-haul fleet. He said that this aircraft along with the seventh aircraft which will be joining the fleet at the beginning of 2017 are on capital lease, while the first five are operationally leased. The Dreamliners replace the Airbus 340s and 330s the company previously had; five aircraft of these two last models were phased out two years ago and two A330s will retire soon. Captain Obeidat said the 787s paved the way for RJ to step into a significant new era, a step that pushes the national carrier of Jordan forward in terms of inflight services and route network, enhancing its regional and international competitiveness. Advertisement He added that all new 787s, together with the operating A320 family and Embraer jets, help RJ meet its operational needs and leverage passengers’ experience. Today RJ’s fleet age does not exceed five years, a young, and modern, fleet when compared internationally. Captain Obeidat pointed out that the wide-body, revolutionary aircraft is capable to fly long distances with full load non stop, making it a suitable choice for RJ to run it to North America, the Far East and Europe. The state-of-the-art features and high specifications of the 787s offer higher levels of comfort and luxury to the RJ clients. The Dreamliners have improved ventilation and humidity levels onboard, taking the travel experience to a new level, offering passengers more comfort and significantly reducing jetlag. It is also designed to be able to monitor safety and inform the ground systems about the need of maintenance. Customers in all classes experience cabin environment improvements, such as LED mood lighting, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, lower cabin altitude and enhanced ventilation systems, among other features. The aircraft is built of carbon-fiber composite materials and has a powerful electrical system to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. It consumes 20 per cent less fuel than today’s similarly sized airplanes, enabling it to offer an exclusive eco-friendly performance. The new planes also enable airlines to increase their cargo revenues by providing about 20 to 30 per cent more cargo capacity than the current airplanes of the same size. -Ends- © Press Release 2016 © Copyright Zawya.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday November 21, 2016 Life & Style Travel Larger / SmallerNight Mode Emirates airline to only fly Airbus A380s, Boeing 777s after retiring older planes Craig Platt 14 Nov 2016, 12:59 p.m. Emirates has become the first airline in the world to only operate Airbus A380 superjumbos and long-range Boeing 777s in its passenger fleet. Emirates airline to only fly Airbus A380s, Boeing 777s after retiring older planes Emirates is the largest customer for the Airbus A380. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Emirates has become the first airline in the world to only operate Airbus A380 superjumbos and long-range Boeing 777s in its passenger fleet. The Middle East carrier recently retired its last remaining Airbus A330 and A340 planes from active service. Emirates retired its last A330, registered A6-EAK after 14 years of service. The plane flew more than 60,000 hours and 45 million kilometres during that time. Emirates' A380s and 777s are relatively new planes with similar interiors, both feature a 3-4-3 layout in economy class. This means passengers on the narrower 777s get one inch (2.54 centimetres) less width for their seats. Seat pitch (legroom) varies from 32 inches to 34 inches on both aircraft types, depending on the location of the seat. See: Airline review - Emirates A380 economy class The airline recently announced it would start flying the world's shortest A380 route from December, a 379-kilometre hop from Dubai to Doha, Qatar. The A380's maximum range is more than 15,000 kilometres. Emirates is the largest operator of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft with 85 Airbus A380s and 160 Boeing 777s in its fleet. The airline has 150 orders on its books for the new Boeing 777X aircraft. It's is due to take delivery of its first 777X in 2020. The new version of the 777 is designed to compete with Airbus' A350. Boeing says the plane will be the largest and most efficient twin engine jet in the world. The interiors will feature some elements taken from the company's 787 Dreamliners, including larger windows and mood lighting. Emirates has grown rapidly over the past decade and in 2016 alone has taken delivery of 36 new aircraft – 20 Airbus A380s and 16 Boeing 777. However, the election of Donald Trump in the US may curb the carrier's ambitions in North America. The US aviation industry has been lobbying the federal government for some time about the influx of Middle-Eastern carriers – specifically Emirates, Etihad and Qatar – into the American market. The industry argues these carriers receive billions in unfair subsidies from their respective governments.

(AP/NASA/Neil Armstrong) Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business November 19, 2016 NASA’s scientific mission doesn’t make the US space agency immune to the politics of presidential transitions. After all, there are billions of dollars of programs and funding at stake. Witness the hand-off in 2008 from US president George W. Bush to Barack Obama: The future of an expensive plan known as the Constellation program, which would replace the Space Shuttle and return Americans to the moon by 2020 on a rocket built by Lockheed Martin, led to open arguments between the outgoing administrator, Mike Griffin, and the head of Obama’s transition team, Lori Garver. The Orlando Sentinel reported on a confrontation between the two at a book party—this is still NASA—that ended with Griffin telling Garver that “if you are looking under the hood, then you are calling me a liar.” Two years later, Obama would cancel the Constellation program, after $11 billion in spending, and abandon the goal of returning to the moon. Instead, NASA’s focus shifted toward more ambitious science missions into the solar system, and particularly to Mars. At the same time, the Space Shuttle’s low-earth orbit transportation work was handed to private companies, setting up SpaceX and Orbital ATK to fly cargo to the International Space Station, and launching a race between SpaceX and Boeing to become the first private company to fly humans in space. What will happen to those efforts under a Donald Trump presidency? One thing seems likely: Set aside Mars. Private companies are going to get a chance to do business on the moon. A question for the Trump transition team: Who will run NASA next? Trump had little to say about space during the campaign, but did drop some hints during an October campaign appearance on Florida’s space coast. “A cornerstone of my policy is we will substantially expand public private partnerships to maximize the amount of investment and funding that is available for space exploration and development,” Trump said. “I will free NASA from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-earth orbit activity. Big deal. Instead we will refocus its mission on space exploration.” That’s a very Obama administration-like idea. Combined with an op-ed by two Trump advisers, economist Peter Navarro and aerospace-focused lobbyist Robert Walker, which praised the “vibrant companies” picking up the slack for NASA in low-earth orbit, the firms bidding to do NASA’s trucking may not need to fear a shift back to the old model, where NASA’s designs were realized by contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin at cost plus a guaranteed profit, rather than a fixed fee. Trump has otherwise said little about NASA’s other programs. And one very relevant question in this season of appointments is who he will tap to be NASA administrator. Within the rough and tumble transition, it’s still hard to say who will come out on top, but conversations with numerous current and former government officials, lobbyists, and space company executives offer a few ideas. Trump’s NASA transition leader, Mark Albrecht, is a longtime space-policy hand who chaired a now-defunct government organ called the National Space Council. This was during president George H.W. Bush’s administration, when he pushed initiatives to streamline NASA operations. It’s now thought that the NSC will be revived for a Trump presidency, led by US vice president Mike Pence. If so, it would be with the goal of uniting space policy across government, particularly on national security issues, but it also risks turf wars with NASA over what to prioritize. Both Albrecht and Walker are associated with Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House and Trump confidant, who has nursed a legendary obsession with space and promised to build a lunar colony during an abortive 2012 run for president. Those who see Gingrich as a driving force in Trump’s space policymaking expect that commercial space and a lunar focus will take the place of big government programs like the expensive Space Launch System and Orion, which is designed to bring astronauts to Mars, or even the International Space Station. The insider candidates Yet there are still voices advising Trump who might implement a more traditional, government-centered approach to space exploration. Griffin, the NASA administrator who kickstarted the Constellation program and clashed with Obama’s team, is mentioned for the NASA job but is seeking the role of Secretary of the Air Force, a role that would give him influence over the lucrative business of launching national security satellites—until a recently a monopoly held by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Eileen Collins, a former astronaut who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, also is a dark horse possibility. A likelier establishment candidate is Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now leads the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. Pace has criticized the Obama administration’s space leadership and its decision to cancel the Constellation program and has been skeptical of commercial space, but he represents a nod towards continuity. Indeed, he may have difficulty fitting him in with Trump’s burn-it-all-down crowd because of his establishment history, including backing Jeb Bush during the Republican primary and advising Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012. But like the Gingrich crowd, Pace still leans toward a lunar focus with international partners. “From a policy standpoint, I’m more in favor of a US-led international return to the moon with commercial partnerships,” Pace told Quartz in September. “A lunar return has more opportunities for international engagement, more opportunities for commercial partnerships and commercial service contracts. Mars is fine as a long-term goal and something to aspire toward; in terms of it being a realistic next step, I don’t know that would be my choice.” Who else could end up leading NASA? Oklahoma Republican representative Jim Bridenstine is an unabashed fan of Trump, lunar exploration, and commercial space, making him a possible choice if the administration is searching for an outsider who shares it goals. He, too, is up for consideration as a potential Secretary of the Air Force. But his appointment at NASA would likely be a tough sell to some of the agency’s scientists, since he is a prominent critic of research into how humanity is changing Earth’s climate. NASA and the politics of climate change Besides the expensive exploration programs, NASA’s efforts to track climate change using Earth-observing weather satellites are its most politically controversial work. Bridenstine and other Republicans have moved to cut funding from those areas. Whether or not Bridenstine becomes the administrator, it is likely that the Trump administration and a Republican Congress will succeed in reducing government funding to research climate change from space. But any resulting damage to the research program might be constrained in the short term, since many of the projects underway have substantial termination costs or have already been fully funded. Bridenstine’s exploration ambitions are clear. In a speech delivered the day before the election, he outlined his view that the US must create a permanent base on the moon. He argues that the moon’s resources, including water and metal oxides, could “profoundly alter the economic and geopolitical balance of power on Earth”—especially if China is the first to exploit them. In his view, the US “is the only nation that can protect space for the free world and responsible entities, and preserve space for generations to come.” With competition from China another likely theme of the Trump presidency, it’s easy to imagine the US space program’s return to the moon being built around that rivalry. Lunar hotels: The ultimate Trump space ambition? Under legislation backed by Bridenstine, NASA already has begun a pilot program with private companies to develop moon habitats. One of the companies participating is Bigelow Aerospace, founded by the billionaire Las Vegas real estate investor Robert Bigelow. The company has been developing inflatable space habitats for years. SpaceX flew one to the International Space Station earlier in 2016, where it was inflated so that astronauts could assess its performance. Bigelow’s dream is to build hotels in space. “It’s just real estate in a different location,” he told Bloomberg News in 2013. “So you can sell these space buildings; you can lease these space buildings; the person that you lease them to can sublet them. You just better be sure that you have a way of getting back and forth to it. Otherwise, you’re really screwed.” It’s easy to imagine the appeal of this idea to a real estate developer president with big ambitions and a taste for brash concepts. Climate change, exo-planets, and long-shot trips to Mars may ignite space geeks, but the idea of the world’s first space hotel may win out in Trump’s oval office.

Ajai Shukla reports from St Louis, Missouri. Following the lead of Swedish company Saab, Boeing has linked its offer to build a fighter aircraft in India with the promise of assistance in designing and building an Indian fifth-generation (Gen-5) fighter. In a presentation to the Indian media in St Louis, Missouri, where Boeing builds the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter, Boeing's Dan Gillian outlined a detailed road map from the Super Hornet to India's Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, the Gen-5 fighter that the Defence Research and Development Organisation hopes to build. Boeing's plan involves first setting up an Indian factory and the aerospace ecosystem to build the Block II Super Hornet, which will then be improved into the 'Advanced Super Hornet.' That infrastructure and design capability would give Indian designers the instruments to build the AMCA. Boeing's India chief Pratyush Kumar hardly disguises his scepticism of Saab's promise to help India in designing the AMCA. "America is the only country that has actually designed and manufactured stealthy, Gen-5 fighters," points out Kumar. "Stealth design is not a science. It is an art that is developed only after years of trial and error. Boeing has actually mastered that art while co-designing the F-35 joint strike fighter." Boeing is not in direct competition with Saab, which is pitching to build 100 to 200 single-engine fighters in India. Instead, Boeing will compete with European manufacturers, Dassault, and Eurofighter, to establish a factory that will churn out a similar number of twin-engine fighters. The Indian Air Force has already solicited interest from global aerospace vendors in the single-engine category, and a similar request is expected soon for building twin-engine fighters. Kumar claims the F/A-18E/F, which was designed in the 1990s, is a decade more contemporary than its rivals like the Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon, which started being designed in the 1980s. "The Super Hornet is sometimes confused with the older F/A-18A/B Hornet fighter, which dates back to the 1970s. While they are superficially similar, the Super Hornet's brand new design incorporates a high degree of stealth." "For America, the Super Hornet was a stepping stone to the F-35, and it can be a stepping stone to the AMCA for India," argues Kumar. Boeing's new Super Hornet factory in St Louis is churning out two Super Hornets each month for the US Navy, which will continue inducting the fighter well into the 2020s. Each of America's 9-12 aircraft carriers (the final number will depend upon President Donald Trump's defence policy) will embark four squadrons of Super Hornets until 2028, when the F-35 Lightning II starts being inducted in significant numbers. By 2028, each carrier will have one squadron of the F-35, and by 2035 there will be two squadrons each of the Super Hornet and the F-35. "But the fighter will remain in service out to the 2040s and, until then, we will be developing upgrades every two years as part of a continuous development programme," says Gillian. The first improvement on the cards is an advanced cockpit system in 2018-2019. Also being developed, even without US Navy sanction and funding, are 'conformal fuel tanks' that will extend the fighter's 1,000-km strike range by 200 km; and a more powerful and fuel-economical F-414 engine that will increase the thrust by 18 per cent. Gillian says the Super Hornet is highly regarded by the US Navy not just because it is a capable and easy-to-maintain fighter, but also because it is the cheapest to operate in the entire US fighter fleet, even cheaper than the single-engine F-16. "The US Government Accountability Office rates the F/A-18E/F as the most economical fighter to operate on a cost per hour basis," says Gillian. The challenge for Boeing will be to build a supplier chain in India, like the one that feeds into the Super Hornet line at St Louis. This consists of 800 vendors in 44 states, which employ 60,000 people. Boeing's current Super Hornet vendors in India include Bharat Electronics Ltd, which builds electrical panels. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is building wire bundles and gun bay doors. Smaller companies are also joining the supply chain, including Rossell and SASMOS, which supply electrical equipment.

Here’s how Washington state’s members of Congress voted on major issues in the week ending Nov. 18. This coming week they’ll be on Thanksgiving recess. Share story By Voterama in Congress The Seattle Times House Ban on aircraft sales to Iran The House on Nov. 17 voted, 243 to 174, to block Boeing and Airbus from selling commercial aircraft to Iran. The bill (HR 5711) would revoke Treasury Department licenses that authorize U.S. banks to finance the companies’ planned sales of more than 100 aircraft to Tehran. These deals follow the lifting of international economic sanctions on Iran as part of an international nuclear agreement. This is the sixth bill the House has passed this year that would roll back or weaken Iran’s nuclear pact with the U.S., China, Russia, Great Britain, France and Germany. Voting yes: Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Camas; Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside; Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane; Dave Reichert, R-Auburn Voting no: Suzan DelBene, D-Medina; Rick Lar­sen, D-Lake Stevens; Derek Kilmer, D-Gig Harbor; Jim McDermott, D-Seattle; Adam Smith, D-Bellevue; Denny Heck, D-Olympia Russian role in U.S. elections Voting 181 to 235, the House on Nov. 17 refused to amend HR 5711 (above) to prohibit American companies from conducting business with Russia or any other country that uses cyber attacks to seek to influence the outcome of U.S. elections.

Voting yes: DelBene, Lar­­sen, Kilmer, McDermott, Smith, Heck Voting no: Herrera Beutler, Newhouse, McMorris Rodgers, Reichert Mass repeal of federal rules By a vote of 240 to 179, the House on Nov. 17 passed a GOP-sponsored bill (HR 5982) that would enable Congress, by adopting a single resolution, to kill all regulations issued by the administration since May. This would override a Congressional Review Act requirement that any repeal of federal rules must occur on a one-by-one basis. Backers said the bill would prevent the administration from issuing “midnight regulations” as it leaves town, while critics called it a backdoor attempt to kill numerous regulations that Republicans find objectionable. Voting yes: Herrera Beutler, Newhouse, McMorris Rodgers, Reichert Voting no: DelBene, Lar­­sen, Kilmer, McDermott, Smith, Heck Rules to boost jobs, spur economy By a 181-239 vote, the House on Nov. 17 defeated a bid by Democrats to exempt from HR 5982 (above) any Obama administration regulations designed to create jobs, enlarge paychecks and make the U.S. economy more competitive in global markets. Voting yes: DelBene, Lar­sen, Kilmer, McDermott, Smith, Heck Voting no: Herrera Beutler, Newhouse, McMorris Rodgers, Reichert Rules on climate change By a vote of 180 for and 237 against, the House on Nov. 17 defeated a Democratic-sponsored amendment that sought to exempt federal regulations addressing climate change and carbon emissions from the reach of HR 5982 (above). Voting yes: DelBene, Lar­sen, Kilmer, McDermott, Smith, Heck Voting no: Herrera Beutler, Newhouse, McMorris Rodgers, Reichert Senate Gulf of Mexico oil drilling The Senate on Nov. 17 failed, 51-47, to reach 60 votes needed to advance a GOP-sponsored bill that would expand the area of the eastern Gulf of Mexico that is open to oil and gas drilling. Now shelved until next year, the bill would reduce from a minimum of 125 miles to a minimum of 50 miles the buffer zones offshore of Florida and Alabama where drilling is prohibited. The bill would also expand states’ shares of royalties the Treasury receives from energy firms. Voting no: Maria Cantwell, D; Patty Murray, D © Copyright, 2016, Thomas Voting Reports, Inc.

The new facility was officially inaugurated by HE Darwish Bin Ismail Al Balushi, the Honourable Minister of Finance and the Chairman of Oman Air. The launch took place at a ceremony which was held at the centre and attended by government ministers, Oman Air’s Board of Directors, senior airline managers, senior representatives of the Public Authority for Civil Aviation (PACA), Oman Airport Management Company (OAMC) and members of the media. At the heart of the facilities provided at OAFTC will be cutting edge flight simulators. In addition to being a requirement under international flight safety regulations, flight simulator training is essential to the provision of high quality training programmes for flight deck crew. The flight simulators are being supplied by one of the world’s best-known simulator manufacturers, Canada-based TRU-Simulation and Training Company. Based at Oman Air’s headquarters in Muscat, OAFTC offers Oman Air the opportunity to provide its pilots and cabin crew with the highest standards of in-house training, in line with both civil aviation regulations and industry good practice. Furthermore, the innovative technology that is integral to OAFTC, together with its strategic location, enhances the high level of efficiency to which Oman Air is required to work. And by operating world-class training facilities in-house, and offering its services to commercial partners, Oman Air is able to make substantial cost savings which can subsequently be invested to the benefit of its customers. Advertisement Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Oman Air’s Chief Executive Officer, Paul Gregorowitsch, said: “Oman Air is pleased and proud to be opening this outstanding new facility. The Oman Air Flight Training Centre will enable Oman Air to continue operating to the highest safety standards and with absolute professionalism. Furthermore, Oman Air’s investment in this training facility – the first of its kind in Oman - will add an important milestone in the airline’s contribution towards the development of the Sultanate. “I would like to thank His Excellency the Chairman, and his colleagues on Oman Air’s Board of Directors for their unwavering support. I would also like to express my gratitude to Captain Ali Hassan Sulaiman, Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, his colleagues and all at Oman Air whose hard work and commitment have ensured that this training centre has been completed within a very tight timeframe.” Development of OAFTC was announced in November 2015 and by September 2016 the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was able complete both its Compliance Monitoring System and Simulator Audits. Captain Ali Hassan Sulaiman added: “OAFTC offers one Full Flight Simulator for Airbus 330 training, and another one for Boeing 737 training. In addition, one Flight Training Device for Boeing B737 training has been installed as a training tool for cadet training programmes. “The centre also includes the facilities needed to train Oman Air’s cabin crew. These include A330 and B737 mock-ups, along with a B787 door trainer. Each of these is designed to enable crew to train for, and practice, all the emergency procedures required as part of our cabin crew training and qualification courses. “Furthermore, having the flight simulator trainers close to Oman Air’s premises will support Oman Air’s strategy to ensure cost-effectiveness in all areas of its operations by avoiding expensive excessive training expenses overseas. We also have the option of offering our facilities to commercial partners, creating an additional revenue stream for Oman Air.” Oman Air places the highest importance on safeguarding and maintaining the safety of all its passengers and crew, and the Oman Air Flight Training Centre underlines this commitment. Furthermore, the benefits delivered by OAFTC to the Sultanate of Oman as a whole include employment opportunities for Omanis, maintenance of the country’s impressive safety records, improvement of national aviation standards, and the continued achievement of the regulatory requirements of PACA. The opening of OAFTC represents the latest step in Oman Air’s ongoing investment in training and capacity building. In addition to intensive training for all cabin crew, Oman Air has provided practical and financial support for Omani citizens to train as airline pilots and join the Oman Air workforce. -Ends- © Press Release 2016 © Copyright Zawya.

Jon Talton / Columnist Dilemma of playing to the ‘working class’ Originally published November 19, 2016 at 8:00 am Updated November 19, 2016 at 2:17 pm Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant has made helping the working class the centerpiece of her time on the council.

Share story Republican President-elect Trump and Socialist Alternative Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant don’t have much in common. But the billionaire and the professional activist both claim to be fighting for the working class. It’s become widely accepted that Trump won the election (although not the popular vote) by besting Hillary Clinton in some critical states of the industrial Midwest, specifically those with a disaffected white working class. All the factors that swayed this election — including anti-establishment sentiment, the “third-term curse,” low Democratic turnout, WikiLeaks, Russian intelligence and the media’s obsession with Clinton’s email server — may not be fully assessed for months or even years. But the working class narrative undoubtedly carries weight. Sawant has made helping the working class the centerpiece of her time on the City Council, including pushing the $15 minimum wage, rent control and numerous other progressive policies. She also called for demonstrations large enough to shut down Trump’s inauguration.

So here’s the dilemma: What is the working class, and who speaks for it? And of course, we should be cautious about whisking all individuals into oversimplified baskets. One of America’s most cherished myths is that we’re a classless society. Historically, this was true for most white people, compared to the stratified societies of Europe or Latin America. But economic interests have always divided Americans. This proved a critical element in detonating the Civil War. In the Great Depression, as President Franklin Roosevelt experimented to help suffering average Americans, his fellow toffs considered him “a traitor to his class.” The United States did create the largest middle class in history. This is a bragging right so treasured that even many wealthy people consider themselves middle class. And with this went economic mobility and a modicum of equality. But according to a Gallup survey last year, 51 percent of respondents said they were middle or upper-middle class, down from an average of more than 60 percent in polls from 2000 to 2008. On the other hand, 48 percent said they were “working or lower class,” compared with 33 percent in 2000. The Pew Research Center confirms that the middle class (meaning households earning from two-thirds to twice the median household income) has lost ground across the country, including in metro Seattle. Many blue-collar workers proudly consider themselves middle class, not necessarily “working class.” I knew and spoke with many of them when I was working for newspapers in Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio. The same is no doubt true of Boeing’s well-paid machinists and other workers in the Puget Sound region. And many such voters went for Trump, and not just in the Midwest. One is Cynthia Cole of Bellevue, who was featured in a Times postelection roundup. She’s retired from Boeing and the former head of its engineering union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. “He really hit a lot of people who thought the government was not listening to their needs,” she said. “The people who are Trump supporters got tired of being told they were stupid and they’re racist or bigoted if they were supporting Trump.” If we take such voters at their word, Trump’s promise to keep and return good manufacturing jobs and sharply limit immigration helped seal the deal. In a perceptive article in the Harvard Business Review, Joan Williams noted that the white working class doesn’t dislike the rich, but does hold antipathy toward professionals. And why not? Their interactions (often distasteful) are usually with managers, not millionaires. Williams, a professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, comes from a blue-collar background. To her, Trump tapped into a blue-collar appreciation of “straight talk” (no matter the facts) and white-male resentment of lost status, especially being the primary breadwinners. She also cautions that writing off white working-class resentment “as nothing more than racism is intellectual comfort food, and it is dangerous.” Most provocatively, she argues that this working class doesn’t see its interests aligned with the bottom 30 percent of families. Yet this lowest third is a working class, too, and the one most represented by Sawant and often championed by Democrats. Williams writes, “ ‘The thing that really gets me is that Democrats try to offer policies (paid sick leave! minimum wage!) that would help the working class,’ a friend just wrote me. “A few days’ paid leave ain’t gonna support a family,” she continues. “Neither is minimum wage. (White working class) men aren’t interested in working at McDonald’s for $15 per hour instead of $9.50. What they want is what my father-in-law had: steady, stable, full-time jobs that deliver a solid middle-class life …” She doubts that Trump will deliver, but credits him with understanding what these voters desire. One problem is that many of those good jobs were done in by the greed and financial machinations that the president-elect and his party embody. Many of those jobs moved out of the Midwest to the South, not always to Mexico. And how many were killed by the white working class’s love affair with Wal-Mart, whose business model set a template for lowering wages, union busting and importing products? Another problem is we can’t really escape from the racial divide. A good number of Trump supporters believe brown people are getting things they don’t deserve. This anger is heightened when the economic pie is growing so slowly that life seems like a zero-sum game. Now the new team has its chance. But the working class, whoever they are, should remember that the Southern gentry kept poor whites and blacks down for a century by playing them off against each other.

Companies without contracts don't do much better. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 19, 2016 at 10:13AM On Oct. 15, 2016, the U.S. Navy commissioned its largest gun-toting surface warship since battleships prowled the seas: the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000). The USS Zumwalt sports two powerful "advanced gun systems" (the two pillboxes up front) -- but has fewer than 90 bullets between them. Image source: U.S. Navy. Technically a destroyer, Zumwalt is actually bigger than the Navy's current fleet of Ticonderoga-class cruisers -- weighing in at 14,800 tons to the Tico's 9,800. It also carries more powerful guns than the Navy's big cruisers: two 155-mm Advanced Guns System (AGS) cannon, each capable of firing a 225-lb. Long Range Land-Attack Projectile (LRLAP) and striking a target 80 miles distant with pinpoint accuracy. There is, however, one small problem with these guns... They have no bullets. Bullets for battleships Well, they have almost no bullets. Although in 2015, Congress approved $113 million in funding for 150 rounds of LRLAP ammunition for the Zumwalt and her two sister ships (not yet commissioned), as of today only 90 rounds  have actually been purchased -- and some of those have already been used in testing. Worse news for Zumwalt: Earlier this month the Navy confirmed that it has decided to halt purchases of LRLAP ammunition entirely. The reason: While by all accounts, LRLAP has worked admirably in testing, the fact is that it was designed to be produced in bulk to arm a fleet of more than two dozen Zumwalt-class destroyers. As plans evolved, though, the Navy ultimately cut its anticipated purchases of Zumwalts to just three ships. The corresponding reduction in volume of ammunition needed means that LRLAP producer Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is unable to produce the ammunition at scale, unable to cut prices accordingly, and must charge the Navy somewhere between $800,000 and $1 million per each round of ammunition. Million-dollar bullets $1 million. That's nearly as much as the Navy pays to buy Harpoon missiles from Boeing -- and Boeing's Harpoons carry 500-pound warheads, 20 times the size of the 24 pounds contained in the LRLAP. This being the case, the Navy is probably making the right decision to cancel further purchases of the LRLAP. It does, however, leave open the question of what to load into those big, beautiful AGS cannon instead. Desperately seeking ammunition What's the alternative? And which company might ride to the Navy's rescue (from what's looking like a real PR nightmare) to suggest this alternative? Currently, two options seem most likely. Given that accuracy was the defining characteristic that made LRLAP so attractive to the Navy, Raytheon's (NYSE:RTN) uber-accurate Excalibur howitzer round might make for a good substitute. True, at $70,000 a pop, Excalibur is not what you'd call a "cheap" bullet. But it's a durned sight cheaper than $1 million, and Raytheon has proven in real-world testing that Excalibur can strike targets 30 miles distant -- and hit within two meters of what it was aiming at. Even better, as a 155-mm round, Excalibur should slide right into the AGS' borehole -- albeit its smaller size will probably necessitate changes to other aspects of the weapons system (such as for loading). A second alternative, and one that's been talked about for years, is the Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) that BAE Systems (NASDAQOTH:BAESY) has been developing for use in the Navy's experimental electromagnetic railgun program. BAE says that HVP is the right size for use in Zumwalt's AGS cannon. What's more, its potential use as the projectile of choice for future railguns, and its suitability for firing from the 5-inch guns mounted on Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyers (of which we have dozens), means that manufacturing HVPs in volume and at low cost should never be a problem. Who will win? Which alternative the Navy ultimately will elect on remains to be seen. Ultimately, though, if the Navy has decided not to buy Lockheed Martin's LRLAP for its AGS, it simply must choose a different bullet -- or render the AGS useless, and its Zumwalt-class destroyers disarmed. One way or another, Lockheed Martin's loss must turn into Raytheon's or BAE Systems' gain. Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

(NYSE: BA) currently expects to deliver about 745 to 750 commercial aircraft to its customers this year. Through the end of October the company had delivered 617 planes. In October Boeing delivered 54 new commercial jets. If it can maintain that pace — or something near it — the company should easily meet its sales target. The bad news is that orders for the first 10 months of the year total just 457. Ideally, Boeing would like a 1-to-1 book-to-bill ratio, but in late September the company said it is angling for 535 new orders in 2016. Even that total may be out of reach given the recent vote in the U.S. House of Representatives killing the company’s opportunity to sell planes to Iran. Of the 617 planes delivered so far this year 402 have been the stalwart 737. The company has delivered 117 models of the 787 Dreamliner and 80 of the 777 series. It has delivered 10 of its 767 planes so far this year, all to FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX). It has also shipped eight of the venerable 747 jumbo jets. Boeing’s order backlog as of October 31 totaled 5,635 aircraft, including 4,321 single-aisle 737s; 29 jumbo 747s, of which 20 are freighters; 96 dual-aisle 767s; and 728 Dreamliners. For the first 10 months of the year, here are the 10 Boeing customers who received the most new planes: Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ: RYAAY): 49 planes, all 737s Southwest Airlines Corp. (NYSE: LUV): 27 planes, all 737s Turkish Airlines: 26 planes, 20 737s and 6 777s American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL): 25 planes, 16 737s, 2 777s, and 7 787s China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. (NYSE: CEA): 24 planes, 17 737s and 7 777s Air Lease Corp. (NYSE: AL): 22 planes, 15 737s, 5 777s, and 2 787s GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS): 21 planes, 17 737s and 4 777s Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK): 18 planes, all 737s Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL): 16 planes, all 737s Norwegian, Air China, United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL): 15 deliveries each The U.S. Navy also received 16 767s this year. These are being adapted for the KC-46A tanker fleet. Of the 228 new airplanes delivered to Boeing’s top commercial customers, 195 (86%) were 737s. Of Boeing’s total backlog, about 77% are 737s. Another way of looking at Boeing’s top customers is to see which have the most orders in the aircraft maker’s backlog. Here are the 10 customers with the most orders waiting to be filled: Southwest: 229 planes, all 737s Lion Air: 214 planes, all 737s Ryanair: 205 planes, all 737s Emirates: 178 planes, 28 777-300ERs and 150 777Xs Air Lease Corp.: 176 planes, 118 737 MAXs, 11 737-800s, 3 777-300ERs, 30 787-10s and 14 787-9s United Airlines: 173 planes, 99 737 MAXs, 37 737-700s, 4 737-800s, 14 777s, and 19 787s Norwegian: 148 planes, 108 737 MAXs, 21 737-800s, and 19 787-9s American Airlines: 146 planes, 100 737 MAXs, 24 737-800s, and 22 787s GECAS: 133 planes, 95 737 MAXs, 16 737-800s, 2 777-300ERs, 10 787-10s Qatar Airways: 105 planes, 10 777-300ERs, 5 777Fs, 60 777Xs, and 30 787-9s United Airlines last week shifted an order for 65 of Boeing’s 737s, switching four that are scheduled for delivery next year from 737-700s to 737-800s, and deferring the delivery of the other 61, which are a mix of 737-700s and 737 MAXs. This was interpreted as bad news for Boeing, but it was actually pretty good, as we discussed on Friday. One last list: the airlines that have flown the most Boeing planes in the 100-year history of the aircraft maker. According to Boeing’s bookkeeping, and including McDonnell Douglas (MD) aircraft, the company’s best customers over the years have been: United Airlines: 1,550 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1959 American Airlines: 1,207 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1958 Delta: 1,172 Boeing and MD aircraft, including 286 from Northwest; first delivery in 1959 International Lease Finance Corp.: 763 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1978 Southwest: 712 Boeing 737s; first delivery in 1971 GECAS: 522 Boeing aircraft; first delivery 1995 Ryanair: 426 Boeing 737s; first delivery in 1999 Japan Air Lines: 374 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1960 All Nippon Airways: 364 Boeing aircraft; first delivery in 1964 Eastern Airlines: 342 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1960 British Airways: 341 Boeing aircraft; first delivery in 1965 Lufthansa: 322 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery 1960 Boeing has delivered a total of 21,318 commercial airplanes to its customers, beginning with just 8 in 1958. In 2015 the company delivered 762 new planes, the most in its history.

Oman Air Flight Training Centre (OAFTC) was officially inaugurated by Darwish Bin Ismail Al Balushi, the Minister of Finance and the chairman of Oman Air, at a key ceremony held in the presence of government ministers, Oman Air’s board of directors, senior airline managers, representatives of civil aviation department and Oman airport authorities. Based at Oman Air’s headquarters in Muscat, OAFTC offers Oman Air the opportunity to provide its pilots and cabin crew with the highest standards of in-house training, in line with both civil aviation regulations and industry good practice. At the heart of the facilities provided at OAFTC will be cutting edge flight simulators being supplied by  Canada-based TRU-Simulation and Training Company, one of the world’s best in the field, said a statement from Oman Air. In addition to being a requirement under international flight safety regulations, flight simulator training is essential to the provision of high quality training programmes for flight deck crew, it stated. Speaking at the launch, Oman Air’s chief executive Paul Gregorowitsch, said the training centre will enable Oman Air to continue operating to the highest safety standards and with absolute professionalism. "Furthermore, Oman Air’s investment in this training facility – the first of its kind in Oman - will add an important milestone in the airline’s contribution towards the development of the sultanate," he noted. Development of OAFTC was announced in November last year and by September, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was able to complete both its compliance monitoring system and simulator audits, he added. Captain Ali Sulaiman Hassan, the executive VP and chief operations officer, said: "OAFTC offers one Full Flight Simulator for Airbus 330 training, and another one for Boeing 737 training. In addition, a flight training device for Boeing B737 training has been installed as a training tool for cadet training programmes." According to him, the centre also boasts key facilities needed to train Oman Air’s cabin crew. "These include A330 and B737 mock-ups, along with a B787 door trainer. Each of these is designed to enable crew to train for, and practice, all the emergency procedures required as part of our cabin crew training and qualification courses," he noted. "Furthermore, having the flight simulator trainers close to Oman Air’s premises will support Oman Air’s strategy to ensure cost-effectiveness in all areas of its operations by avoiding expensive excessive training expenses overseas," stated Hassan. "We also have the option of offering our facilities to commercial partners, creating an additional revenue stream for Oman Air," he added.-TradeArabia News Service Tags: airbus | Boeing | Oman Air | Pilots | Flight training | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Enjoy two holidays in one with Qatar Airways Steigenberger marks one-year milestone with two top awards Ritz Carlton, Doha awarded prestigious ISO certification New F&B outlets are bucking the market trend, says expert Emirates, DCAA ink innovation MoU Emirates Palace gears up for 45th UAE National Day Symphony Style Hotel Kuwait welcomes new finance director City Centre Bahrain offers hotel guests new shuttle service Music legend Quincy Jones opens first outlet in Dubai Royal Jordanian adds 6th Dreamliner to its fleet Bahrain introduces two new visas Bahrain mulls deployment of air marshals on flights Turkish Airlines to fly thrice to Cuba, Venezuela Dubai celebrates the opening of Bollywood Parks AirBaltic lowers checked-in baggage charges UAE National Day celebrations at Al Maryah Island Ramada Downtown Dubai launches new anniversary promotion Premier Inn ME deploys Ideas solutions for revenue growth SR Technics opens training centre in Abu Dhabi Dutch chef wins Etihad's 'Taste The World' title Dubai Miracle Garden all set to 'bloom' this winter ME airlines to spend $345bn to boost capacity Emirates offers LinkedIn Learning courses on ice Sharjah’s Al Bait Hotel $27m revamp on track WTM London 2016 most successful edition in event history Etihad, Hong Kong Airlines expand codeshare New executive chef for Alila Jabal Akhdar Rotana launches second hotel in Amman Etihad, Airbus to develop A380 MRO services Boeing to consolidate defence and space sites Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds
International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies Is the iconic commercial aircraft Boeing 747 being retired? Boeing's iconic aircraft is set to be retired, with better technology arriving on the scene. Aditya Bhat   November 19, 2016 09:29 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares Several airlines are retiring their 747 fleet. In Picture: British Airways Boeing 747-400 takes off from London Heathrow Airport, England.Wiki Commons/Adrian Pingstone One of the most iconic US aircraft, the Boeing 747, dubbed a symbol of American ingenuity, is facing retirement. Boeing has announced that it may not produce any more of these jumbo jets, 45 years after it was first deployed in service. Reason The huge commercial jet is finding few buyers now, since it guzzles more fuel. Also, with improvement in engine technology, two engines are considered more economical than the four engines found in the 747. Why advertise with us?

Two of the biggest commercial airliners in US -- United and Delta -- have said they will be retiring their 747 fleet. United announced on November 17 that it would retire all 20 of the 747s in its fleet by October 2018. Delta too has said that it would be retire 747 by the end of 2017. Cathay Pacific has also given similar indications.  History Started as a military project, the 747 was promoted by Juan Trippe, the then president of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). The development of the aircraft was a technical and financial challenge and those on the project were billed "The Incredibles." Boeing had to build an assembly plant for the giant airliner. The first aircraft was rolled out in September 1968, with the first flight of the new aircraft taking place in February 1969. Boeing rolled out its first 747 aircraft in September 1968.

It was one of the fastest airliners in the world, reaching Mach.92. One of iconic images has been the modified 747, carrying NASA space shuttle piggyback style. The aircraft could seat over 300 passengers and featured four prominent engines. The US president's Air Force One uses a modified version of the commercial 747-8. What would be flown instead of the 747s? United airlines would be flying the newer Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 777 models. Delta would be using the new Airbus A330s that have been delivered to it and also the new Airbus A350s. Now only a few airlines are ordering the 747s. Marketplace quoted Scott Hamilton, an aviation consultant, as saying that Lufthansa and Korean airlines are among those who are still ordering it. The order is about 30 or 40 planes between them. Apart from the above airlines, UPS, world's largest package delivery company, has ordered 14 Boeing 747-8 cargo freighters and took an option for another 14. Hence, it may still be some years before the Boeing shuts down its 747-8 production line.

 UPDATE 1-U.S. weather satellite's launch promises 'quantum leap' in forecasts Reuters Nov. 19, 2016, 7:14 PM 17 facebook linkedin twitter email print (New throughout, adds launch) By Irene Klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. weather satellite that will "revolutionize" forecasting blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Saturday, promising to deliver continuous high-definition views of hurricanes and other storms over the Western Hemisphere. A detailed stream of images provided by the satellite is expected to sharpen weather forecasts, provide more advanced warning of floods and better tracking of wildfires, plumes and volcanic ash clouds. Carried atop an Atlas 5 rocket, the GOES-R satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:42 p.m. EST (2342 GMT). The launch was delayed an hour to resolve a technical issue with the rocket, developed by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. , said NASA launch commentator Mike Curie. A second, unrelated issue also contributed to the delay. Once in position 22,300 miles (35,888 km) above the equator, GOES-R is designed to take a complete picture of the hemisphere every five minutes while simultaneously zooming in on specific regions to monitor fires, volcanic eruptions, heavy rainfall and storms. The satellite, the 17th in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, is the first to be launched since 2010. It is a step up from its predecessors, which take 30 minutes to image the hemisphere and are not capable of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. "This is a quantum leap," Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of Earth Sciences at NASA, said at a press conference on Thursday. "It will truly revolutionize weather forecasting." The heart of the new satellite is a high-resolution camera, designed and built Exelis Inc., a subsidiary of Harris Corp . It can see in 16 wavelengths, compared with five available with the current system. GOES-R, developed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has four times better resolution and can take images five times faster than its predecessors, said NOAA program scientist Steven Goodman. The satellite's capabilities go beyond weather forecasting. The sharper view will enable forecasters to see waves in clouds, for example, so pilots can avoid turbulence and give airline passengers smoother rides. GOES-R, built by Lockheed, includes the first operational lightning mapper, which will image lightning fields in the western hemisphere 200 times a second, NOAA said. It is the first of four satellites in a system upgrade that will cost $11 billion, including launch fees, said NOAA Assistant Administrator Stephen Volz. The next satellite is slated for launch in 2018. GOES, along with a second, polar-orbiting weather satellite network operated by NOAA, has faced cost overruns and program delays due to technical issues and mismanagement, according to a December 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Once in orbit, the new satellite will undergo about 11 months of testing before it joins the operational fleet, which now numbers three units, NOAA said.

A detailed stream of images provided by the satellite is expected to sharpen weather forecasts, provide more advanced warning of floods and better tracking of wildfires, plumes and volcanic ash clouds. Carried atop an Atlas 5 rocket, the GOES-R satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:42 p.m. EST. The launch was delayed an hour to resolve a technical issue with the rocket, developed by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT.N) and Boeing Co. (BA.N), said NASA launch commentator Mike Curie. A second, unrelated issue also contributed to the delay. Once in position 22,300 miles (35,888 km) above the equator, GOES-R is designed to take a complete picture of the hemisphere every five minutes while simultaneously zooming in on specific regions to monitor fires, volcanic eruptions, heavy rainfall and storms. The satellite, the 17th in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, is the first to be launched since 2010. It is a step up from its predecessors, which take 30 minutes to image the hemisphere and are not capable of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. “This is a quantum leap,” Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of Earth Sciences at NASA, said at a press conference on Thursday. "It will truly revolutionize weather forecasting.” The heart of the new satellite is a high-resolution camera, designed and built Exelis Inc., a subsidiary of Harris Corp (HRS.N). It can see in 16 wavelengths, compared with five available with the current system. GOES-R, developed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has four times better resolution and can take images five times faster than its predecessors, said NOAA program scientist Steven Goodman. The satellite's capabilities go beyond weather forecasting. The sharper view will enable forecasters to see waves in clouds, for example, so pilots can avoid turbulence and give airline passengers smoother rides. GOES-R, built by Lockheed, includes the first operational lightning mapper, which will image lightning fields in the western hemisphere 200 times a second, NOAA said. It is the first of four satellites in a system upgrade that will cost $11 billion, including launch fees, said NOAA Assistant Administrator Stephen Volz. The next satellite is slated for launch in 2018. GOES, along with a second, polar-orbiting weather satellite network operated by NOAA, has faced cost overruns and program delays due to technical issues and mismanagement, according to a December 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Once in orbit, the new satellite will undergo about 11 months of testing before it joins the operational fleet, which now numbers three units, NOAA said.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Atlas V successfully launches with GOES-R advanced weather satellite November 19, 2016 by William Graham An Atlas V rocket has successfully deployed a next-generation weather satellite for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Saturday evening. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket launched from SLC-41 at Cape Canaveral at the end of a one hour-long window at 18:42 local time (23:42 UTC). GOES-R Launch: The GOES-R satellite, which rode aboard Saturday’s launch, begins a new fifth generation of geostationary weather satellite for the United States. It is the first of four satellites in its class which are expected to launch over the next eight years. GOES-R is part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) program, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). GOES consists of two operational satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the United States, providing images and data for weather forecasting across the western hemisphere. One satellite is located at a longitude of 75 degrees West – a station designated GOES-EAST – covering the Eastern United States, the Central and West Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. The second satellite, designated GOES-WEST, is positioned at 137 degrees West and covers the western States – including Alaska and Hawaii – as well as the Eastern and Central Pacific. At present, the GOES-EAST slot is occupied by GOES 13, while GOES-WEST coverage is provided by GOES 15. These satellites launched in May 2006 and March 2010 as GOES-N and GOES-P respectively. The GOES 14 satellite, formerly GOES-O, has served as an on-orbit spare since its launch in 2009 and has occasionally been called into service to cover outages as GOES 13 begins to show its age. In addition to weather forecasting, the GOES satellites are used to study space weather phenomena and conduct research into the Earth’s magnetosphere and radiation environment. Before launch, GOES satellites are designated with a letter to identify their place in the program’s launch order. Upon successfully reaching orbit this is replaced with a sequential number. GOES-R will become GOES 16 after a successful launch, following GOES-P which became GOES 15. Numbers are only given to satellites that launched successfully; GOES-G would have become GOES 7 but was lost in a launch failure, so GOES-H instead became GOES 7 after its launch the following year. There was no GOES-Q satellite; the designation was assigned to an option in the contract for the GOES-N class satellites, which was not exercised. The GOES program evolved from the NOAA’s earlier Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (SMS) series, which consisted of two prototype spacecraft launched in May 1974 and February 1975 atop Delta 2914 rockets. With the success of these missions, the NOAA began the GOES series with three satellites – GOES 1 to 3 – manufactured by Ford and based on the SMS design, launched between October 1975 and June 1978. These early satellites were spin-stabilised with spin-scan radiometers to image the Earth as the satellites spun. After their retirement as weather satellites, GOES 2 and 3 were used as communications satellites over the Pacific Ocean, with GOES 2 operating until 2001. As its orbital inclination increased naturally over time, GOES 3 became an important communications relay for the Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole which does not have a line-of-sight to geostationary satellites. GOES 3 operated in this role until it was decommissioned on 29 June this year, thirty-six years after launch. The second generation of the GOES constellation consisted of five satellites constructed by Hughes based around the HS-371 bus. These were launched by Delta 3914 rockets between September 1980 and February 1987. Like their predecessors these satellites were spin-stabilised, with an improved imaging payload over the first-generation. The series initially consisted of four satellites plus a ground spare. The fourth satellite, GOES-G was lost at launch on 3 May 1986, after the Delta rocket’s first stage engine cut out 71 seconds after liftoff. Even before the failure, the ground spare had been called up to launch due to delays with the procurement of the next generation of satellites. Because of the delays to the third generation – or GOES-I series – satellites and the loss of GOES-G, the retirement of GOES 4 in November 1998 left the NOAA with no spare satellites in orbit. When the imaging payload aboard GOES 6 failed three months later, the agency was left with no satellite to cover the West Coast of the United States. GOES 7 was moved from the Eastern slot to a more central position where it could cover the continental US, and in 1992 NOAA leased Europe’s spare Meteosat-3 satellite, allowing GOES 7 to move further West. Third-generation satellites finally began to launch in April 1994, with an Atlas I carrying GOES 8 into orbit. Following on-orbit testing it entered service at the GOES-EAST position in 1995, allowing Meteosat-3 to be returned to the European Space Agency for decommissioning and GOES 7 to move west again into the regular GOES-WEST position resuming the constellation’s normal service. GOES 7 was relieved by GOES 9, which launched in May 1995. Like GOES 2 and 3, GOES 7 was used as a communications satellite over the Pacific following the end of its operational service. It was finally decommissioned in 2012. GOES 10 was launched as an on-orbit spare in April 1997. A year later it swapped roles with GOES 9 after a fault was identified in the latter’s attitude control system, although GOES 9 would later be leased to the Japan Meteorological Agency to replace its failing Himawari-5 satellite. Two further third-generation GOES satellites, GOES 11 and 12, were launched in 2000 and 2001 by Atlas IIA rockets. The more powerful rockets allowed the satellites to carry additional fuel, allowing a greater potential for extended operations after the end of their normal service lives. GOES 12 carried an additional space weather instrument, the Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI). The third-generation satellites were built by Space Systems Loral, and were the first GOES spacecraft to be three-axis stabilized. The contract for two fourth-generation GOES satellites, the GOES-N series, was awarded to Hughes in February 1998 along with options for two further satellites, one of which was exercised. The satellites were manufactured by Boeing following its 2000 purchase of Hughes’ satellite manufacturing division and launched atop Delta IV rockets between 2006 and 2010. The three third-generation satellites, GOES 13, 14 and 15, are now the only operational GOES spacecraft following the decommissioning of GOES 12 in 2013. GOES-R is the first of four GOES-R-class satellites that form the fifth generation of the GOES constellation. Constructed by Lockheed Martin and based on the A2100A satellite bus, each satellite has a dry mass of 2,857 kilograms (6,299 lb) which increases to 5,192 kilograms (11,466 lb) when fully-fuelled at launch. The spacecraft measure 6.1 by 5.6 by 3.9 meters (20 x 18 x 13 feet) and have fifteen-year design lives; expected to consist of ten years of operational use and up to five years of storage as an on-orbit spare. GOES-R carries six scientific payloads and a data relay payload. Its nadir-pointing – Earth-facing – instruments are mounted on the side of the satellite which will be pointed towards Earth in orbit. Solar-pointing instruments are located on the arm which holds the satellite’s solar array; to provide power to the spacecraft this arm must track the sun, allowing its instruments to make near-constant observations. Further sensors will allow the satellite to study its surrounding environment. The primary instrument aboard GOES-R is its Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), built by Harris Corporation of Florida. Producing images across sixteen spectral bands from visible to infrared, ABI can achieve a spatial resolution of 500 metres (547 yards) at its primary visible-light wavelength of 0.64 nanometres and 2,000 metres (2,187 yards) in the infrared; roughly twice the resolution of the imager aboard the GOES-N series, which only operates in five spectral bands. The imager can be used to produce full-disc images of the Earth or more targeted regional scans – including of the continental United States or in a mesoscale imaging mode that allows it to image a square box with sides of one thousand kilometers (621.4 miles, 540.0 nautical miles). In normal operation, the spacecraft will take four full-disc images, twelve scans of the continental United States and up to 120 mesoscale images every hour. Unlike the previous two generations of satellite, GOES-R does not carry an atmospheric sounding payload. One was to have been included as part of the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES), a set of additional instruments which were part of the spacecraft’s original design but were removed in 2006 after proving too complicated to develop. Instead, data which would have been provided by the sounder will be interpolated from ABI’s images. The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is a new instrument for the GOES-R series, a near-infrared sensor designed to detect and capture sudden visual events across the area it is monitoring. GLM will record and map lightning activity over the Americas, the West Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. GLM is expected to improve forecasters’ ability to predict storms as they develop, giving advance warning of severe weather activity. The Solar Ultraviolet Imager, or SUVI, is one of two payloads which will study the Sun. It is designed to capture full-disc images in the extreme ultraviolet. SUVI will be used in space weather forecasting, monitoring activity across the face of the sun and eruptions and solar flares. SUVI is the successor to the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) that was introduced with the GOES 12 satellite. The second Solar-monitoring payload, the Extreme Ultraviolet and X-Ray Irradiance Sensors, or EXIS, consists of two instruments. Its Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS) contains three grating spectrographs which will be used to measure variations in three particular spectral emission lines – from Helium, Hydrogen and Magnesium – in light coming from the Sun. These lines correspond to emissions from different regions of the Sun and can be used to model the Sun’s entire ultraviolet spectrum. The X-Ray Sensor (XRS) is a successor to an X-ray monitoring payload that has been carried on all GOES satellites since the beginning of the program, which is used to measure solar irradiance and characterize solar flares. XRS uses silicon photodiodes to measure incident radiation within two spectral bands: 0.05 to 0.4 nanometres and 0.1 to 0.8 nanometres. The Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS) consists of five sensor packages to study and characterize the space environment in which GOES-R will operate. Its Energetic Heavy Ion Sensor (EHIS) will measure the flux of larger energized particles both within the magnetosphere and incident from solar or cosmic sources. Two Magnetic Particle Sensors, MPS-Hi and MPS-Lo, will measure proton and electron flux; the former monitoring high-energy particles while the latter will study particles at lower energies. Two identical Solar and Galactic Proton Sensor (SGPS) packages complete the suite, measuring the incidence of Protons into Earth’s magnetosphere from the Sun and from cosmic sources. The final scientific payload, a magnetometer, is mounted at the end of an extendible boom which GOES-R will deploy once in orbit. The magnetometer will be used to characterize activity in the outer region of Earth’s magnetosphere. In addition to its scientific instruments, GOES-R carries a communications payload which is mounted on the solar array arm alongside the solar research payloads. Unique Payload Services, as this is named, consists of transponders to relay data for the GOES Rebroadcast (GRB), Data Collection System (DCS), Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) and Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) projects. GOES Rebroadcast allows anyone with a compatible receiver to downlink observational data directly from the satellite. DCS collects data from unmanned environmental research stations and relays it back to a ground station. EMWIN is used to make weather forecasting data and warnings available for emergency management, while SARSAT is a worldwide program using satellites in low and geostationary orbits to detect distress signals from land, ships and aircraft and relay them to rescue services. GOES-R was launched by United Launch Alliance (ULA), using an Atlas V rocket. The vehicle, with the tail number AV-069, flew in the 541 configuration, with a five-metre (16.4-foot) payload fairing, four AJ-60A solid rocket motors augmenting a Common Core Booster first stage, and a single-engine Centaur upper stage. Saturday’s launch was the sixty-seventh flight of an Atlas V, and the fourth for the Atlas V 541. The Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin under the US Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, and first flew in August 2002 deploying Eutelsat’s Hot Bird 6 satellite. Boeing developed the Delta IV – which has made 33 flights to date – under the same program and Saturday’s launch was the one-hundredth between the two rockets. Since December 2006 both the Atlas V and Delta IV – along with the older Delta II rocket – have been operated by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The launch of GOES-R took a little over three and a half hours from liftoff to spacecraft separation, with the satellite expected to be deployed into a geosynchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 8099 kilometres (5032 miles, 4373 nautical miles), an apogee of 35,286 kilometres (21,926 miles, 19,053 nautical miles) and 10.6 degrees inclination to the equator. ULA had a one-hour window in which to launch GOES-R on Saturday, which began at 17:42 Eastern Standard Time, or 22:42 UTC. Weather forecasts ahead of the launch were optimistic, with a 10% probability of unacceptable conditions predicted. However, a technical hold, followed by a Range issue, resulted in the launch moving to the end of the window. The launch took place from Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A former Titan launch complex which was originally constructed in the 1960s, SLC-41 has been the East Coast home of the Atlas V since it was introduced in 2002. Atlas vehicles are assembled atop a mobile launch platform in the nearby Vertical Integration Building and rolled to the launch pad shortly ahead of launch. AV-069 was moved to the pad Friday morning. See Also Atlas V/GOES-R UPDATES ULA Forum Section 65 Launch Vehicle Manuals (L2) Click here to Join L2 The Atlas is a two-stage vehicle, consisting of a Common Core Booster (CCB) first stage and a Centaur upper stage. The CCB is powered by a single RD-180 engine, manufactured by NPO Energomash of Russia, which burns RP-1 propellant oxidized by liquid oxygen. Igniting 2.7 seconds ahead of the planned liftoff, the RD-180 is the rocket’s principal source of thrust during the early stages of flight as Atlas climbs through Earth’s atmosphere. At liftoff, four Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ-60A solid rocket motors (SRMs) will ignite to provide additional thrust. Following first stage ignition, it took a few seconds for the RD-180 to reach launch thrust. Liftoff occurred at about 1.1 seconds after the zero mark in the countdown, when the force generated by the main engine and solid rocket motors exceeds the weight of the loaded vehicle. AV-069 began her ascent away from Cape Canaveral, beginning a series of pitch and yaw maneuvers 5.2 seconds after launch. The rocket flew along an azimuth of 100.7 degrees, taking it East and slightly South over the Atlantic Ocean. Thirty-five and a half seconds after liftoff, Atlas’ velocity reached Mach 1, the speed of sound. The rocket experienced maximum dynamic pressure – or Max-Q – 10.7 seconds later as it continued to climb. The SRMs burned out around 85 to 90 seconds into flight and separated in pairs; the first pair detaching at 110.4 seconds after liftoff and the second pair a second and a half later. At three minutes and 29.9 seconds after launch, the payload fairing separated from around GOES-R at the nose of the rocket. By this stage, Atlas was at an altitude in excess of 100 kilometers (62 miles, 54 nautical miles), above the denser regions of the atmosphere which would damage the spacecraft if it were unprotected. Because the five-metre fairing encapsulates not just the satellite but also the Centaur upper stage, it must be jettisoned before the first stage can separate. First stage flight ended with Booster Engine Cutoff, or BECO, four minutes and 21.8 seconds after liftoff. The spent stage separated six seconds later. Following staging, the Centaur’s single RL10C-1 engine began a prestart sequence ahead of its ignition ten seconds later. Powered by the combustion of liquid hydrogen propellant, oxidized by liquid oxygen, the Centaur made three burns during Saturday’s mission. From separation, the first burn lasted seven minutes and 37.8 seconds. Following a nine-minute, 43-second coast phase, the Centaur restarted for a five-minute, 38-second burn that raised its orbital apogee towards geosynchronous altitude. Following the burn, Centaur coasted towards its apogee, with its third burn eighteen-tenths of a second short of three hours later. The third and final burn lasted 93.3 seconds, raising the orbit’s perigee and reducing its inclination; decreasing the amount of propellant GOES-R will need to burn to reach its final geostationary station. Spacecraft separation occurred 69 seconds after the end of the third burn, at three hours, 31 minutes and 54.9 seconds mission elapsed time. Following separation GOES-R will use its LEROS-1C apogee motor to perform a series of orbit-raising maneuvers. Upon arrival in geostationary orbit, the satellite will undergo around a year of test and checkout operations. It is currently expected to replace GOES 13 in the GOES-EAST slot late next year, with GOES 13 becoming an additional on-orbit spare. GOES-R is designed for up to ten years of operational life plus five years of on-orbit storage; it is currently scheduled to be replaced by GOES-T in late 2025. Saturday’s launch was the seventh of eight Atlas V missions planned for 2016, coming just eight days after the launch of the WorldView-4 commercial imaging satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base, a mission which had been delayed from September by brush fires around the launch site. One further launch is planned before the end of the year, which will fly from Cape Canaveral in mid-December with the EchoStar XIX communications satellite. For United Launch Alliance, who have also conducted three Delta IV launches this year, it was the tenth flight of the year. ULA’s next launch will be on 7 December when the last Delta of the year will carry a Wideband Global Satcom spacecraft into orbit.

Follow us on Home Oman Region World Opinion Sports Business Features Videos About us Archives Blogs First commercial flight training centre inaugurated in Oman Muscat Daily staff writer November 19, 2016 Muscat -  H E Darwish bin Ismail bin Ali al Balushi, Minister Responsible for Financial Affairs and the Chairman of Oman Air inaugurated the Oman Air Flight Training Centre (OAFTC) last week. The state-of-the-art facility will enable pilots and cabin crew to train realistically for operating Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The launch ceremony was attended by ministers, Oman Air’s Board of Directors, senior airline managers, senior representatives of the Public Authority for Civil Aviation, Oman Airports Management Company and members of the media. At the heart of the facilities provided at OAFTC will be cutting edge flight simulators. In addition to being a requirement under international flight safety regulations, flight simulator training is essential to the provision of high quality training programmes for flight deck crew. The flight simulators are being supplied by one of the world’s best-known simulator manufacturers, Canada-based TRU-Simulation and Training Company. Based at its headquarters in Muscat, OAFTC offers Oman Air the opportunity to provide its pilots and cabin crew with the highest standards of in-house training, in line with both civil aviation regulations and industry best practices. The innovative technology that is integral to OAFTC, together with its strategic location, enhances the high level of efficiency to which Oman Air is required to work. And by operating world-class training facilities in-house, and offering its services to commercial partners, Oman Air is able to make substantial cost savings which can subsequently be invested to the benefit of its customers. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Paul Gregorowitsch, CEO, Oman Air said, “Oman Air is pleased and proud to be opening this outstanding new facility. OAFTC will enable Oman Air to continue operating to the highest safety standards and with absolute professionalism. Furthermore, Oman Air’s investment in this training facility - the first of its kind in Oman - will add an important milestone in the airline’s contribution towards the development of the country. “I would like to thank His Excellency the Chairman, and his colleagues on Oman Air’s Board of Directors for their unwavering support. I would also like to express my gratitude to Captain Ali Hassan Sulaiman, executive vice president and chief operations officer, his colleagues and all at Oman Air whose hard work and commitment have ensured that this training centre has been completed within a very tight timeframe.” Captain Sulaiman added, “OAFTC offers one full flight simulator for Airbus 330 training, and another one for Boeing 737. In addition, one flight training device for Boeing B737 has been installed as a tool for cadet training programmes. “The centre also includes facilities needed to train Oman Air’s cabin crew. These include A330 and B737 mock-ups, along with a B787 door trainer. Each of these is designed to enable crew to train for, and practice, all the emergency procedures required as part of our cabin crew training and qualification courses. “Furthermore, having the flight simulator trainers close to Oman Air’s premises will support Oman Air’s strategy to ensure cost-effectiveness in all areas of its operations by avoiding expensive excessive training expenses overseas. We also have the option of offering our facilities to commercial partners, creating an additional revenue stream for Oman Air.” Similar content Oman Air to build training centre First commercial flight training centre inaugurated in Oman RAFO to get C295 flight simulator PDO launches simulation centre to train oil well drillers MUSCATDAILY POLL Do you support new taxes on sugary drinks and fast food?  Yes  No Contact us  Privacy policy Sitemap  RSS feeds  To subscribe Ⓒ​  2014   Apex Press and Publishing ,  PO Box 2616,  Ruwi 112, Muscat,  Sultanate of Oman   Telephone: +968-24799388, Fax : 24787573

The deal is expected to be finalized at a Nov. 23 board meeting. “The new, yet-to-be named airline will have a market share in the Germany/Austria/Switzerland leisure business of 35%,” a source involved in the negotiations told ATW. “The transaction will be completed within the next weeks. The airline will be a completely new company on the market.” The source said the current project name of the company is Blue Sky. TUIfly employees have also agreed to the latest development and are now confident the new airline will offer future growth potential. On Oct. 6, TUIfly had to cancel flights and decided to completely shut down flight operations after many aircraft crew called in sick on short notice. The action followed concerns about the merger between the two companies. The source said the new holding company is expected to be based in Austria, with Etihad 25% and TUI taking a 24% stake. The remaining 51% is expected to be held by an Austrian foundation, to ensure Austrian majority ownership and maintain international traffic rights. The airline is planning a fleet of 14 Boeing 737s (currently operated by TUIfly for airberlin under a wet-lease agreement), 27 TUIfly 737NGs, as well as 17 Airbus A320 family aircraft from Austrian airberlin subsidiary FlyNiki, total 58 aircraft. But the airline plans to operate 60 aircraft initially. “However, the new owner will then decide on a future harmonized fleet (either Airbus or Boeing). But this is not our decision [for TUI Group] anymore. For now, both companies will operate separately in their own identities. The transformation [bringing both companies together] will take some time and will be a slow process,” the source said. In addition, the airline will have its own independent marketing and distribution system.  TUIfly is part of TUI Group, which has a portfolio of six European airlines and around 140 aircraft, a distribution network of more than 1,800 travel agencies and online portals, around 300 hotels and 14 cruise liners. “We, the TUI Group, have ambitious growth plans to add more hotels and cruise liners [to the portfolio],” the source said. The TUI Group handles 20 million guests annually. ATW understands the other TUI Group airlines are not part of the deal. These comprise UK-based Thomson Airways (63 aircraft), Sweden’s TUIfly Nordic (eight aircraft), TUI Airlines Belgium (21 aircraft), TUI Airlines Netherlands (10 aircraft) and France’s Corsair International (seven aircraft).

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out travel Search Destinations Themes News Travel Troubles Cruising Snow Kiwi Traveller Flight test: Auckland to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific on the new Airbus A350 SIOBHAN DOWNES Last updated 05:00, November 20 2016 CHRIS MCKEEN/Stuff.co.nz The world's newest airliner - the Airbus A350 - has landed at Auckland International Airport. We tested out the world's newest aircraft, Cathay Pacific's jetlag-beating A350.  THE AIRLINE: Cathay Pacific. THE ROUTE: Auckland to Hong Kong, an 11-hour flight. We were scheduled to leave at 2.50pm, but delayed because of the late arrival of the aircraft. We took off shortly after 4pm, landing in Hong Kong just before 10pm (local time). SUPPLIED Cathay Pacific flies the A350 daily from Auckland to Hong Kong. THE PLANE: The new generation Airbus A350-900. Cathay Pacific is the first airline to operate the aircraft to New Zealand, and Auckland is its third long-haul A350 destination, after Dusseldorf and London Gatwick. The A350 competes with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, and boasts all sorts of snazzy features. There's special LED lighting which is meant to recreate sunrise and sunset to make sleeping easier and reduce jet lag. There's advanced air conditioning, with cabin air recycled every three minutes. It's supposed to be 25 per cent more fuel efficient than other aircraft in the fleet, and so quiet that passengers are able to talk in a whisper. THE LOYALTY PLAN: The Marco Polo Club. Cathay Pacific also has an alliance with Air New Zealand for the Auckland to Hong Kong route, which means if you book through Air New Zealand and end up travelling on Cathay Pacific, you can still earn Airpoints. Siobhan Downes Economy seats on the Cathay Pacific A350. UP THE BACK OR AT THE POINTY END: Somewhere in the middle. I was seated in economy, in row 41 - just behind the premium economy cabin. By some great stroke of luck, I ended up having the whole row to myself. THE SEAT STUFF: Economy seats have an 81cm pitch, 46cm seat width and 15cm recline. The new headrests can apparently be adjusted six ways - up, down, and angled at the sides - but I couldn't figure out how to do this, so just left mine as it was. Other new features include a tablet holder, cup holder and USB port. The tray table seemed a little bit smaller than usual. BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE: 23kg for checked baggage, and 7kg for carry on. COMFORT FACTOR: The new pillows and blankets were lovely and soft. Of course, it helped that I had the whole row to stretch out in, but my seat did feel wider than other economy cabins. Ad Feedback THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT: There was an 11-inch touchscreen TV on the back of the seat in front which worked like a dream - it responded to the lightest touch without lagging. There was a mixture of Western and Asian inflight movies, and I was surprised by the number of Kiwi offerings - Taika Waititi's Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows, as well as The Lord of the Rings. You can also watch satellite TV news, and inflight wi-fi is available for a fee. THE SERVICE: Overall it was friendly and efficient, except for a hiccup at the check in desk at Auckland Airport. We were lined up waiting for the counters to open, but when they did, we were rather haphazardly directed to self service kiosks. All of the machines ended up crashing, so we had to be shepherded back into the line for the "human" counters. The staff seemed frazzled, and it made for a bit of a stressful experience. FEEDING TIME: In economy, we were handed a dining menu before takeoff, which was a nice touch. Lunch was served shortly after, with a choice of three meals. I had whiting fish with hot bean sauce and rice, followed by New Zealand ice cream. It was tasty and I polished off the lot - and I can never usually finish all of my plane food. Teatime was about halfway through the flight - this time there were two choices, and I got the black pepper beef and rice, followed by mango mousse cake. Again, I managed to eat it all. I think the portion sizes are on point, but if you get peckish, there are also cup noodles available as a snack throughout flight. ONE MORE THING: I have to mention the facial moisturiser in the bathrooms. Usually I come off a long-haul flight with my face resembling a pizza, but this time my skin stayed miraculously clear, and I think it was because of this magical moisturiser (unfortunately, Cathay Pacific are unable to tell me exactly what the brand is). I liked that it was freely available for anyone to use - usually that sort of luxury is reserved for the business class amenity kits.  THE VERDICT: I can report that I felt well-rested and fresh at the end of my flight. But it's hard to know if that was because of the A350's whizz-bang technology, or if my body was just being kind to me on that particular day. For the record, I was upgraded to business class on the way back, and felt rotten the whole time. No matter how good the plane is - or your seat, for that matter - sometimes travelling simply takes its toll. FREQUENCY: Cathay Pacific flies the A350 daily from Auckland to Hong Kong.

The TBAL facility, a joint venture between the Tata Advanced Systems Ltd and Boeing, is expected to start operations next year. Fuselage is the central body of an aircraft, to which the wings and tail assembly are attached and accommodates the crew, passengers, and cargo. Apache is a twin engine multi-mission attack helicopter. India has ordered 15 heavy-lift helicopter Chinook and 22 Apaches, which are expected to be delivered in 2019. More than 50 per cent of the Apache helicopters currently in operation are used by the US defence forces. "The building is being erected right now and we expect our first Apache fuselage to be delivered in the second quarter of 2018 for the US army. "So, our strategy for this factory is not to only build fuselages for the Indian Apaches. The plan is to build them for every Apache from 2018 on wards in our factory in Hyderabad," said Dave KooperSmith, Vice President, General Managar Vertical Lift of Boeing and board member of the TBAL. "We are in the middle of negotiating over 240 aircraft for the US Army and 450 aircraft for all customers. From 2018 onwards all of those fuselages will be built in India," said KooperSmith.

November 20, 2016 0601 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:172355 Publish Date: Sat, 19 Nov 2016 09:56:50 GMT Service: Iran US wrapping up sale of 104 warplanes to Qatar, Kuwait The US State Department has authorized the sale of 104 F-15 Strike Eagle and F/A-18 warplanes to Qatar and Kuwait, a move that Washington says is aimed at bolstering foreign policy interests. With an estimated cost of $21.1 billion, the deal with Qatar would include 72 F-15s together with “weapons and related support, equipment, and training,” said the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency in a statement. “This proposed sale enhances the foreign policy and national security of the United State by helping to improve the security of a friendly country and strengthening our strategically important relationship,” the agency added. American officials claim that the sale of the multi-role fighters would not affect the military balance of the Middle East, which is already struggling with years-long foreign-backed militancy and Western intervention. Additionally, America’s “defense readiness” would not take a hit from the deal, the statement further noted. The deal would benefit American aerospace giant Boeing the most, but other companies like Lockheed Martin and Britain's BAE Systems would benefit too. If Congress approves the deal, Boeing would be allowed to extend the aircraft’s production line. The company had earlier warned that it was going to shut down both production lines by the end of this decade due to excessive costs and inadequate demand. Saudi Arabia and Israel are two other regional customers for the twin-engine aircraft. The State Department has also authorized a deal with Kuwait, another Arab state in the Persian Gulf region, which had put an offer for 32 F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets worth $10.1 billion. Each F/A-18 Hornet, and its upgraded version, the F/A-18 Super Hornet, costs at least $57 million, making it "the most cost-effective aircraft" in the US aviation fleet, costing less per flight hour than any other in the US forces inventory, the Navy says. The massive deals came as Middle Eastern nations had been experiencing budget pressure due to the plummeting oil prices. A number of US senators have been building up pressure on the administration of President Barack Obama to approve the deals, although some government officials had initially opposed them, saying they would risk Israel’s security.     KeyWords US wrapping Qatar   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran ready to help Iraq hold Arba’een rituals: First VP Iran sympathizes with India over fatal train derailment Iranian snatch six world taekwondo medals Martial skills fetch Iran four Taolu World Cup medals Iran dives to take third title out of Japan's water Iran finishes fourth at Asian Water Polo Championship Jahangiri: Iran on the side of Iraqi nation and govt. in anti-terror fight Iran's referees judged best by AFC Iran urges ICC to address reasons behind member states’ withdrawal Iran: Oil may rise to $55 if all producers cooperate Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0751 sec

GOES-R will soon deliver a quantum leap in America’s weather forecasting capabilities. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FL – GOES-R, the first in a new series of revolutionary NASA/NOAA geostationary weather satellites blasted off on an awesome nighttime launch to orbit this evening from the Florida Space Coast. Liftoff of the highly advanced Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) weather observatory bolted atop a ULA Atlas V rocket came at 6:42 p.m. EST on Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016 from Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The launch was delayed for an hour until the very end of the launch window to deal with unexpected technical and Eastern range issues, that only added more drama and changed the sunset launch into a night launch for the hordes of spectators who gathered here from around the world – appropriate since this probe will touch the lives of humans world wide. “It’s a dramatic leap in capability – like moving from black and white TV to HDTV,” explained Greg Mandt, the NOAA GOES-R program manager during a prelaunch media briefing in the cleanroom processing facility at Astrotech. “This is a very exciting time,” explained Greg Mandt, the NOAA GOES-R program manager during the Astrotech cleanroom briefing. “This is the culmination of about 15 years of intense work for the great team of NOAA and NASA and our contractors Lockheed Martin and Harris.” “We are bringing the nation a new capability. The GOES program has been around for about 40 years and most every American sees it every night on the weather broadcasts when they see go to the satellite imagery. And what’s really exciting is that for the first time in that 40 years we are really end to end replacing the entire GOES system. The weather community is really excited about what we are bringing.” GOES-R will bring about a “quantum leap” in weather forecasting capabilities that will soon lead to more accurate and timely forecasts, watches and warnings for the Earth’s Western Hemisphere when it becomes fully operational in about a year. But the first images are expected within weeks! And both researchers and weather forecasters can’t wait to see, analyze and put to practical use the sophisticated new images and data that will improve forecasts and save live during extreme weather events that are occurring with increasing frequency.

GOES-R will deliver a quantum leap in America’s weather forecasting capabilities. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com Over the next year, teams of engineers and scientists will check out and validate the state of the art suite of six science instruments that also includes the first operational lightning mapper in geostationary orbit – dubbed the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). “The launch of GOES-R represents a major step forward in terms of our ability to provide more timely and accurate information that is critical for life-saving weather forecasts and warnings,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “It also continues a decades-long partnership between NASA and NOAA to successfully build and launch geostationary environmental satellites.” GOES-R, which stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite – R Series – is a new and advanced transformational weather satellite that will vastly enhance the quality, speed and accuracy of weather forecasting available to forecasters for Earth’s Western Hemisphere. The science suite includes the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI), Extreme Ultraviolet and X-Ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS), Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS), and the Magnetometer (MAG). ABI is the primary instrument and will collect 3 times more spectral data with 4 times greater resolution and scans 5 times faster than ever before – via the primary Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument – compared to the current GOES satellites. So instead of seeing weather as it was, viewers will see weather as it is. Whereas the current GOES-NOP imagers scan the full hemispheric disk in 26 minutes, the new GOES-ABI can simultaneously scan the Western Hemisphere every 15 minutes, the Continental U.S. every 5 minutes and areas of severe weather every 30-60 seconds.

The detailed view provided by the satellite is expected to sharpen hurricane forecasts, provide more advanced warning of floods and better tracking of wildfires, plumes and volcanic ash clouds. Scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 5:42 p.m. EST (2242 GMT), the GOES-R satellite is capable of taking a complete picture of the hemisphere every five minutes while simultaneously zooming in on fires, volcanic eruptions or severe rain in specific regions. The satellite, the 17th in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, is the first to be launched since 2010. It is a step up from its predecessors, which take 30 minutes to image the hemisphere and are not capable of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. “This is a quantum leap,” Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of Earth Sciences at NASA, said at a news conference on Thursday. “It will truly revolutionize weather forecasting.” The satellite rests on top of an Atlas 5 rocket developed by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co.. The heart of the new satellite is a high-resolution camera, designed and built by Exelis Inc, a subsidiary of Harris Corp.. It can see in 16 wavelengths, compared with the five available with the current system. GOES-R, developed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has four times better resolution and can take images five times faster than its predecessors, NOAA program scientist Steven Goodman said. The satellite’s capabilities go beyond weather forecasting. The sharper view will enable forecasters to see waves in clouds, for example, so that pilots can avoid turbulence and give airline passengers smoother rides. GOES-R, built by Lockheed, includes the first operational lightning mapper, which will image lightning fields in the western hemisphere 200 times a second, NOAA said. GOES-R is the first of four satellites in a system upgrade that will cost $11 billion, including launch fees, said NOAA Assistant Administrator Stephen Volz. The next satellite is slated for launch in 2018. GOES, along with a second, polar-orbiting weather satellite network operated by NOAA, has faced cost overruns and program delays due to technical issues and mismanagement, according to a December 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Once in orbit, the new satellite will undergo about 11 months of testing before it joins the operational fleet, which now numbers three units, NOAA said.

"Capture confirmed," a NASA commentator said as the spacecraft docked at the ISS at 4.58pm yesterday Florida time (2158 GMT). The trio of astronauts - Frenchman Thomas Pesquet, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and American astronaut Peggy Whitson - launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday. NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, Oleg Novitskiy of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and Frenchman Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency, wave after docking at the International Space Station. (AFP / NASA TV) Mr Pesquet, 38, a rookie astronaut and amateur saxophone player, is the first French national to be sent to the ISS by the European Space Agency since 2008. Mr Novitskiy, 45, a Russian Air Force pilot and decade-long veteran of the space agency Roscosmos, and is making his second trip to the ISS. Ms Whitson is an experienced veteran and biochemistry expert who will break records with this space mission, including the title of the most days in space by a US astronaut. She is scheduled to surpass NASA astronaut Jeff Williams's 534 days on April 24. In February, Ns Whitson, 56, will become the first woman to command the space station twice. She previously commanded the station in 2007, when she became the first woman to hold this post, NASA said. The Soyuz MS-03 spacecraft approaches the International Space Station. (AFP / NASA TV) Their arrival means the staff at the orbiting outpost goes back up to six. Already staffing the ISS are Russians Andrei Borisenko and Sergey Ryzhikov, and American Shane Kimbrough. But even after a two-day journey in cramped quarters, the three new arrivals were not allowed to exit the spacecraft right away. About two more hours of checks were needed to make sure the seal was airtight between the station and Soyuz before the astronauts would be able to open the hatch, get out and stretch their legs, NASA said. Russia's Soyuz capsules offer the only way for global astronauts to reach the space station since the American space shuttle program was retired in 2011. It costs more than $71 million per seat for a ride on the Soyuz, which carries three people at a time. Private industries including SpaceX and Boeing are designing spacecraft to once again ferry astronauts from US soil. Their first flights are not expected until late next year or in 2018. Humans have lived continuously at the space station for more than 15 years.

Miami, United States:  Russia's Soyuz spacecraft arrived at the International Space Station on Saturday, carrying a European, a Russian and an American astronaut for a four-month mission at the orbiting outpost. "Capture confirmed," said a NASA commentator as the spacecraft docked at the ISS at 4:58 pm (2158 GMT), live US space agency television images showed. The trio -- Frenchman Thomas Pesquet, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and American astronaut Peggy Whitson -- launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday. Pesquet, 38, a rookie astronaut and amateur saxophone player, is the first French national to be sent to the ISS by the European Space Agency since 2008. Novitskiy, 45, a Russian Air Force pilot and decade-long veteran of the space agency Roscosmos, is making his second trip to the ISS. Whitson is an experienced veteran and biochemistry expert who will break records with this space mission, including the title of the most days in space by a US astronaut. She is scheduled to surpass NASA astronaut Jeff Williams's 534 days on April 24. In February, Whitson, 56, will become the first woman to command the space station twice. She previously commanded the station in 2007, when she became the first woman to hold this post, NASA said. Their arrival means the staff at the orbiting outpost goes back up to six. Already staffing the ISS are Russians Andrei Borisenko and Sergey Ryzhikov, and American Shane Kimbrough. But even after a two-day journey in cramped quarters, the three new arrivals were not allowed to exit the spacecraft right away. About two more hours of checks were needed to make sure the seal was airtight between the station and Soyuz before the astronauts would be able to open the hatch, get out and stretch their legs, NASA said. Russia's Soyuz capsules offer the only way for global astronauts to reach the space station since the American space shuttle program was retired in 2011. Astronauts pay more than $71 million per seat for a ride on the Soyuz, which carries three people at a time. Private industries including SpaceX and Boeing are designing spacecraft to once again ferry astronauts from US soil. Their first flights are not expected until late next year or in 2018. Humans have lived continuously at the space station for more than 15 years. More than 200 people from 18 countries have visited the microgravity laboratory that circles Earth at a height of about 250 miles (400 kilometers), NASA said.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Nov 19 – A U.S. weather satellite that will “revolutionize” forecasting was launched from Florida’s Cape Canaveral on Saturday, promising to deliver continuous high-definition views of hurricanes and other storms over the Western Hemisphere. The detailed view provided by the satellite is expected to sharpen hurricane forecasts, provide more advanced warning of floods and better tracking of wildfires, plumes and volcanic ash clouds. Story continues below Blasting off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:42 p.m. EST, the GOES-R satellite is capable of taking a complete picture of the hemisphere every five minutes while simultaneously zooming in on fires, volcanic eruptions or severe rain in specific regions. READ MORE: Calgary researcher forecasts wildfires with NASA satellite images The satellite, the 17th in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, is the first to be launched since 2010. It is a step up from its predecessors, which take 30 minutes to image the hemisphere and are not capable of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. “This is a quantum leap,” Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of Earth Sciences at NASA, said at a news conference on Thursday. “It will truly revolutionize weather forecasting.” The satellite rests on top of an Atlas 5 rocket developed by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. The heart of the new satellite is a high-resolution camera, designed and built by Exelis Inc, a subsidiary of Harris Corp. . It can see in 16 wavelengths, compared with the five available with the current system. GOES-R, developed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has four times better resolution and can take images five times faster than its predecessors, NOAA program scientist Steven Goodman said. The satellite‘s capabilities go beyond weather forecasting. The sharper view will enable forecasters to see waves in clouds, for example, so that pilots can avoid turbulence and give airline passengers smoother rides.

GOES-R is the first of four satellites in a system upgrade that will cost $11 billion, including launch fees, said NOAA Assistant Administrator Stephen Volz. The next satellite is slated for launch in 2018. GOES, along with a second, polar-orbiting weather satellite network operated by NOAA, has faced cost overruns and program delays due to technical issues and mismanagement, according to a December 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Once in orbit, the new satellite will undergo about 11 months of testing before it joins the operational fleet, which now numbers three units, NOAA said. © 2016 Thompson Reuters Report an error Cape Canaveral GOES-R satellite NASA nasa satellite Outer Space rocket launch satellite launch weather satellite Editor's Picks Consumer How Trump's immigration crackdown could raise food prices for Canadians Politics Trudeau Liberals ‘trampling’ on women’s rights with new CPP regime: opposition Money Here's how much mortgage payments will go up as banks hike rates Consumer Text message fraud cost Canadians half a million dollars so far in 2016 Investigations Ontario schools are missing ‘perfect opportunity’ to address mental health amid rash of youth suicides Health Drugs aren’t tested on women like they are on men, and it could have deadly consequences Investigations How mental health should be taught in Canadian schools FLYERS More Weekly Flyers Comments Popular Now Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump starts to feel pressure of presidency in 'SNL' cold open 54719 Tucson Roadrunners captain collapses on ice shortly before game against Manitoba Moose 27141 Sabra hummus products recalled across Canada, US for listeria concerns 24108 Moose found frozen in lake in the middle of a fight 10802 Justin Trudeau, APEC leaders meeting a direct response to Trump's anti-trade rhetoric 8731 Sponsored content Popular Videos CNN’s Anderson Cooper malfunctions in ‘SNL’ ‘Westworld’ parody WATCH NOW Chris Rock makes SNL cameo to mock white liberals shocked by Trump win WATCH NOW WATCH: Road rage incident caught on camera WATCH NOW 10-year-old saves mom after witnessing violent attack: ‘I saw his footsteps under the door’ WATCH NOW Vice President-elect heckled at ‘Hamilton’ show in New York City WATCH NOW Jump to a Region BC Calgary Edmonton Halifax Lethbridge Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg Connect Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest RSS Contact Us Global News About Us Privacy Policy Principles & Practices Terms & Conditions Copyright Corus Entertainment Advertise Branded Content Open Data © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

No, Milwaukee has not landed nonstop service to Dubai or some other hub where the hometown airline flies the superjumbo jet. Instead, this A380 is in Milwaukee for two weeks of engine testing. Milwaukee airport officials tell Today in the Sky the aircraft is there for cold-weather testing with the new Rolls Royce Trent XWB97 engine that is being developed to power the new A350-1000. BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news | VIDEO: A380 landing at Milwaukee USA TODAY Watch: How long does it take Emirates to repaint an A380? The A350-1000 is the latest and biggest variant of Airbus’ new A350 model, which began flying passengers for the first time just in January 2015. The A350-1000 variant of the jet is expected to enter commercial passenger service sometime next year. Airbus’ double-decker A380, of course, is the world’s biggest passenger aircraft. Most airlines that fly the A380 have configured the cabin to seat between 400 and 520 passengers. Emirates – by far the largest operator of the plane – flies some of its A380s in a "high-density" configuration with 615 seats, though most of the carrier's superjumbo jets have fewer. As for the A380's appearance in Milwaukee, planespotters take note. "For a great view of the aircraft while it is parked here, check out the sixth floor of the parking garage on the north end," General Mitchell airport says via its Facebook page.

Two of our top contributors offer up reasons you should and shouldn't buy these two companies. Jason Hall (TMFVelvetHammer) Nov 19, 2016 at 9:41AM Image source: Alcoa.  Since Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) was spun out of Arconic Inc. (NYSE:ARNC) on Nov. 1, the market has responded in an unexpected way, bidding up shares of the pure-play metals company, while shares of Arconic, which was expected to be the more in-demand investment, haven't fared nearly as well: AA data by YCharts. What should investors do? We reached out to two of our contributors and asked them to break things down. Here's what they had to say.  Arconic looks interesting; Alcoa may be ahead of itself Jason Hall: Count me among the many people surprised by how far Alcoa's shares have run, and so quickly after being spun out as a pure-play bauxite miner and alumina/aluminum producer. This is particularly astonishing considering that absolutely nothing has happened in the past couple of weeks to support this quick run-up.  Let's start with the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, which corresponds with the vast majority of Alcoa's stock gains. The catch? Trump's "Make America Great Again" platform, which is largely pro-American industry, may not offer much value for Alcoa, which actually does very little production in the U.S. The vast majority of the world's bauxite reserves are outside North America, and the primary alumina refining is done near the mines. In other words, some of the potential economic benefits that domestic manufacturers could get under a Trump administration just may not carry over to Alcoa in the same way.  Furthermore, as Alcoa is a primary producer of aluminum and its precursor materials, its fortunes are largely tied to commodity prices. There's some potential good news on that front, as global production has been in a deficit in 2016, with demand growth outpacing production. There's a good chance this will lead to higher prices, but so far that hasn't happened. Put it all together, and Alcoa's stock looks like it's gotten ahead of the fundamentals that will drive its results.  Arconic, on the other hand, is pretty appealing. Not only -- as Tyler discusses below -- does it seem to be trading for what could be a big discount today, but there's a very strong long-term tailwind that should at the very least support steady profits over the next decade-plus. Demand from the aerospace industry alone could be massive, with Boeing and Airbus having a combined $1.6 trillion order backlog for more than 12,000 aircraft.  The caveat? Arconic took on a substantial amount of debt in the spinout of Alcoa, but also retained just under a 20% stake in the aluminum producer. I'd like to see Arconic monetize that Alcoa stake and pay down its debt. Furthermore, I'm of the opinion that until we have a couple of quarters of financial and operating results in, it's not completely clear what the corporate costs will be for these now-stand-alone companies.  Between the two, Arconic seems to be the safer bet to be a winning investment from here. But I'd prefer to see a quarter or two of financial and operating results from the stand-alone companies before taking a big stake in either.  Alcoa's international mining and refining operations will still be driven by commodity prices. The market may have gotten ahead of this fundamental thing. Image source: Alcoa.  No rush to buy now Tyler Crowe: I'm not saying that it's a bad idea to buy Alcoa's or Arconic's stock, because there are plenty of reasons to like them both. Alcoa is one of the premier aluminum producers globally, and Arconic has developed an impressive portfolio of high-end manufactured products for the aerospace and automotive industries. Rather, I think the best course of action regarding these stocks is to take a wait-and-see approach until we get a couple of quarters of financial reports from the two companies before making any real investment decisions. I can totally understand why investors might want to get in early, because the market might not realize the value of these stocks. Let's start with Arconic. Today, the company trades at 0.9 times sales and 1.2 times tangible book value. That seems like a steal when you consider that another engineered-product manufacturer -- Precision Castparts -- was bought at a price of 3.3 times sales. That would suggest that the current price of Arconic is undervalued.  As tempting as jumping in may sound, it's worth waiting for some issues to resolve. Arconic ended up taking the lion's share of the debt during the split in hopes of breathing new life into the legacy mining and smelting business. This could be a big drag on Arconic for some time, while Alcoa will likely continue to suffer from low commodity prices even with a cleaner balance sheet. But these are all assumptions; until we actually see reported financial results over the next few quarters, there's a lot of guesswork involved that some investors may not be completely comfortable with. Once we get at least a quarter or two of financial results to see how these two separate entities handle being on their own, it's probably best to take a wait-and-see approach.  Jason Hall has no position in any stocks mentioned.

​​ Singletrack Mountain Bike Magazine Subscribe Buy Issue 109 Home Magazines Forums Reviews Columns Partners Shop Trail Guide Subscribe Gorgeous Custom Titanium From Lithuania If ever there was a type of metal that we could eat, it would be titanium. Undoubtedly the most delicious of all metals, there is something so alluring and exotic about titanium that just seems to get us salivating every time we see it. And what about when we actually get the chance to touch it? Best we keep that to ourselves… Looking to sate cyclists appetite for titanium, Wittson is a bespoke frame manufacturer based in Lithuania that only builds with European Grade 9 Ti. Our attention was first brought to the Wittson name when the company launched a drop-dead gorgeous welded titanium rigid fork. In addition to that striking piece of art, Wittson also produces a full mountain bike hardtail frame, called the ‘Bestia’. Whilst being equally as lovely, there’s actually a lot of features on the Bestia that aren’t so common with titanium mountain bike frames. It may be expensive and niche-y, but that doesn’t stop us from wanting one BAD! Firstly though, some background. Wittson is still a relatively new name in the cycling scene, but its master frame builder, Vidmantas “Vitas” Zukauskas is not. Having previously worked with the likes of Colnago, Argon 18 and a host of other high-end companies, Vitas has over two decades of experience with building titanium road, cyclocross and mountain bike frames. Vitas has such a reputation amongst high-end Ti frame builders, because it’s the only material he chooses to work with. Full-length integrated seat tube on the Bestia. It’s like looking at the back of an aggravated cat. Most of the frames that Wittson produces are custom numbers, but the Bestia is a stock mountain bike frame that’s available with 27.5in wheels (Small, Medium, Large) and 29in wheels (Medium, Large, X-Large), and is designed around a 100mm travel suspension fork. Like all of Wittson’s frames, the Bestia is made from Grade 9 Titanium that’s welded up in their small Lithuanian-based workshop. “All of the frames are made of European Grade 9 Ti supplied by a Swedish company called VSMPO Titan Scandinavia“, states Vitas. “This is one of the world’s number-one titanium suppliers. It’s the same titanium that BOEING and AIRBUS use. The key difference to Chinese suppliers is that VSMPO don’t use recycled titanium, so that means better alloy characteristics.” The hand brushed finish on the Bestia is an exercise in subtlety. Some other brands could learn a thing or two here…   The Bestia is built as a purist XC race machine, and has the geometry to match. For 2017, Wittson has actually sharpened the head angle to 70.5-degrees, and shortened the top tube length, which would appear to be going against current trends. But Wittson don’t care. The new frame also features Wittson’s wishbone seat stays, which is a very unique feature for a titanium frame, as it requires quite a complex process to achieve. At the rear wheel you’ll find a 142x12mm Syntace screw-in axle, along with US-made Paragon dropouts. Possibly the most striking feature of the Bestia is that full-length integrated seat mast Go full race-spec with a carbon rigid ENVE fork. The Wittson Bestia Features: XC hardtail race bike 27.5in or 29in wheels Grade 9 Titanium Oversized externally and internally butted headtube for conical 1.5″ fork Bi-ovalized toptube Hydroformed curved downtube Integrated seatpost with an support on toptube/seatsatays cross section Ti seatmast with ti bolts Hydroformed wishbone seatstays Hydroformed chainstays Internal brake and gear routing PressFit 30 bottom bracket Made in USA PARAGON x SYNTACE X-12 thru axle dropouts Hand brushed finish Custom sandblasting Ti headbadge Anodized bolts Max tyre clearance: 2.25in Claimed weight: 1870 grams (size M / seattube uncut) Includes: Chris King InSet 7 headset, Wittson seatmast (grade 9 ti), removable Syntace alloy hanger, 142x12mm Syntace thru-axle RRP: €2489 Oooh, well that is quite lovely. Single-piece seat stay assembly that uses a wishbone junction up at the seat tube. Wittson claims this adds more ‘spring’ to the back of the Bestia, but it looks incredible too. Big cowled PMW dropouts from the US, and a Syntace X-12 screw-in axle locking it down. Elegant post-mount brake tabs too. Hydroformed downtube, chain stays and seat stay provides curves in all the right places. Along with full custom butting, the Bestia highlights Vitas’ years of experience of working with titanium. While the Bestia is a stock frame, there are multiple custom features available. Rather than the stock PF30 bottom bracket shell, you can get a new T47 BB, and you can even spec Boost 148x12mm dropouts too. Want a belt drive? Maybe you want the frame built with a Pinion gearbox? Wittson will do that for you, and they’ll even build the Bestia around a longer travel suspension fork. So be prepared to waste A LOT of time choosing options! Head to wittson.com for more info.

Dislike with a passion bent downtubes, they look particularly worse on Ti frames though. Curious as to how the integrated seatpost works. oceandweller said on November 19, 2016 OK. Who do I hafta kill? akira said on November 19, 2016 Chop seatpost to length and fit clamp on top, measure repeatedly before chopping I imagine. footflaps said on November 19, 2016 Wow – that is gorgeous! A bit pricy mind… bedmaker said on November 19, 2016 Stealth dropper routing? singletrackwil said on November 19, 2016 @bedmaker – Yup, and there’s a lot load of other options too. You can get a singlespeed-specific frame, internal or external routing, PF30 bottom bracket or T47 bottom bracket, 142x12mm or 148x12mm dropouts, setup for longer travel forks etc. It appears to be a long list! tang said on November 20, 2016 We have them at Bespoked show, lovely guys.

 The 'trickiest' part of Elon Musk's Mars spaceship — a giant black orb — just passed a critical test Dave Mosher Nov. 16, 2016, 12:57 PM 50,493 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars with SpaceX. Getty Images/Shutterstock/NASA; illustration by Dave Mosher/Business Insider SpaceX announced on Wednesday that it had successfully completed a critical test of a huge piece of its Mars spaceship — a giant and potentially explosive black orb. Elon Musk in September shared his audacious plan to launch a million people to Mars — just in case some apocalyptic calamity dooms Earth. Called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), the 400-foot-tall rocket and spaceship aims to ferry 100 to 200 people to the red planet at a cost of less than $200,000 per ticket sometime this century. (And following Donald Trump's election, there's apparently a lot of interest in a ride.) SpaceX has been pretty mum on its progress with ITS' systems. In October, however, Musk revealed during an "Ask Me Anything" session that the most essential part of his giant Mars spaceship is an enormous, 40-foot-wide carbon-fiber tank, shown below. "This is really the hardest part of the spaceship," Musk said at his September 27 talk during the International Astronomical Congress (IAC). "The other pieces ... we have a pretty good handle on, but this was the trickiest one. So we wanted to tackle it first." Musk also told redditors that his engineers would haul the prototype out to sea and "take it up to 2/3 of burst pressure" in the coming weeks. SpaceX is now saying that test not only happened, but that it went swimmingly. "Successfully tested the prototype Mars tank last week. Hit both of our pressure targets – next up will be full cryo testing," the company wrote on Twitter, sharing a photo of the experiment: SpaceX/Twitter And if you're wondering how in the heck they got the tank on the barge, wonder no more: SpaceX posted a time-lapse video of the process to its Instagram account: Moving the prototype Mars tank in preparation for testing out at sea. A video posted by SpaceX (@spacex) on Nov 16, 2016 at 9:09am PST on Nov 16, 2016 at 9:09am PST 'The hardest part of the spaceship' The tank is the spaceship's core structure, which has to withstand incredible pressures and stresses at blisteringly cold temperatures from liquid oxygen propellant — otherwise it might leak or even explode. Musk originally shared images of the massive structure toward the end of his IAC talk. And it's huge, standing several stories tall and dwarfing its designers and builders: Elon Musk/SpaceX When user nalyd8991 asked Musk for more information about it in the r/SpaceX subreddit, Musk said the gargantuan carbon-fiber tank "was really the big news" of his IAC talk — or at least "for those that know their stuff." In short, the entire spaceship will be built around such a tank — so getting it right is crucial. Here's where the latest designs place the tank in the spaceship, which will sit atop a rocket booster that's more than 250 feet tall: Elon Musk/SpaceX; Business Insider Carbon-fiber tanks for spacecraft aren't a new concept — Boeing and NASA began work on a huge one in 2014. However, we've never seen one this enormous. Here's what it looks like from the inside: SpaceX/YouTube And another inside shot: SpaceX/Elon Musk Engineers most likely chose carbon fiber because that material is lighter, shrinks less, and is stronger than the metal alloys that many cryogenic tanks are made out of. So it will presumably make for safer transport to Mars while using less propellant (though at a considerably higher cost of construction). The material isn't easy to work with, though, as Musk explained during his IAC talk: "Even though carbon fiber has incredible strength-to-weight, when you want one of them put super-cold liquid oxygen and liquid methane — particularly liquid oxygen — in the tank, it's subject to cracking and leaking and it's a very difficult thing to make. "Just the sheer scale of it is also challenging, because you've gotta lay out the carbon fiber in exactly the right way on a huge mold, and you've gotta cure that mold at temperature, and then it's ... just really hard to make large carbon-fiber structures that can do all of those things and carry incredible loads." During his Reddit AMA in October, Musk dropped a few bits of new information about the tank as well: "The flight tank will actually be slightly longer than the development tank shown, but the same diameter," Musk said. He also said it was "built with latest and greatest carbon fiber prepreg," or carbon fiber that's pre-impregnated with a resin to make it tougher. "In theory, it should hold cryogenic propellant without leaking and without a sealing linker," he said. "Early tests are promising." Prior to the barge pressure test in early November, Musk said SpaceX performed "initial tests with the cryogenic propellant" that "actually look quite positive." "We have not seen any leaks or major issues," he added. If the company has already pumped liquid oxygen into the spherical tank before, it stands to reason that it will try again to get even more data on its performance for incorporating into a flight version. Business Insider asked a SpaceX representative for more details on the upcoming "full cryo test", which is presumably when the carbon-fiber tank will be pumped full of a liquid oxygen propellant or liquid methane fuel. However, the company declined to tell us more about that test, when it would occur, or what cryogenic liquid it'd be using. Whatever the case, the fact that it's happening on ocean barge is telling: It says there's a chance the device could not just merely leak but burst or explode. If no one is around and it does, the shrapnel (and possibly flames) can't hurt anyone. After all, SpaceX does have a history of testing its gear on ocean barges, sometimes with catastrophic effect: Rebecca Harrington contributed additional reporting to this post.

The billionaire businessman won the presidency after a tumultuous and divisive election, partly by blaming what he called bad trade deals for massive job losses in U.S. manufacturing. As a result, the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation free-trade zone that, combined, accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world’s economic output, is essentially dead in Congress. Scrapping TPP may be a missed opportunity for the United States, says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan. “There are already concerns around Asia about the reliability of the United States as an ally,” Kingston said. “Clearly, Trump’s election will amplify those concerns and anxieties. And I think that this means that there’s going to be a significant decline in American influence in Asia.” “If we don’t take the lead in writing the rules for the economy of East Asia, the Chinese will, and we are not going to like the outcome,” said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, referring to President Barack Obama’s argument for creating a level playing field for Pacific trade. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is already capitalizing on the U.S. Congress’ failure to vote on a Trans-Pacific trade deal. It has announced plans to propose a rival trade pact at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in Peru that would create a Beijing-led regional trade zone in Southeast Asia excluding the United States. Trade war potential Trump, who once called China “a cheat” and a currency manipulator, has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods by 45 percent to correct the trade deficit between the two countries. Beijing responded quickly with its own threats, raising the possibility of an all-out trade war. Galston said the possibility of a damaging trade war has never been higher, and he outlined a number of options China could take. “To start, they could cancel the orders they placed with Boeing and redirect those orders to Airbus, and that would have a large effect on the economy of the Pacific Northwest,” he said. Beijing could also impose tougher regulations on companies that do business in China, or severely limit iPhone sales, for example, to Chinese customers. “The idea that this is a one-way street, that we can threaten China and China can’t threaten us back, I think, is too simple,” Galston said. If a trade war were to break out, Galston said, there would be no winners. However, given the asymmetry between Chinese exports to the U.S. and American exports to China, Galston said Trump might be gambling that both sides would have enough to lose to come to the table to work things out. Other trade agreements Trump has also signaled his intention to renegotiate what he called “the worst trade deal ever,” NAFTA, the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Analysts say such a move is unlikely to create new jobs. Despite its flaws, Galston credits NAFTA for helping to create a continental supply chain that has made the U.S. auto industry among the most competitive in the world. “If that relationship were to be disrupted, then it could have serious consequences. And it’s not clear to me that it would have the effect of bringing auto jobs back to the United States,” he said. Given Trump’s protectionist rhetoric, European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom thinks a pending U.S. free-trade deal with Europe — TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership — is probably not moving forward anytime soon. “There is strong reason to believe that there would be a pause in TTIP, that this might not be the biggest priority for the new administration,” Malmstrom said. Labor unions have been among the most vocal critics of free trade. The AFL-CIO blames NAFTA for the loss of nearly a million jobs and claims those who manage to find new jobs earn on average about 23 percent less than they used to. Labor groups insist any future free-trade agreements must include protections and a larger retraining budget for laid-off American workers.

That's where the Army figures out exactly what they are looking for. Milestone B is the point at which an RFP or Request for Proposal is sent to companies. According to the timeline shown at the conference, Milestone B is set for FY24, giving five years to work on the project.  Right now the Army is conducting the Joint Multi-Role/Technical Demonstration or JMR/TD, which is used to demonstrate the technologies that will be used in FVL. The work done on JMR/TD will be folded into FVL, which will save time and money.  There are two entries in the JMR/TD, Bell's V-280 Valor, which is a tilt-rotor and the Boeing/Sikorsky SB-1 Defiant. Valor is a tilt-rotor, while Defiant is a unique push-prop/helicopter.  But as with any major project, budget uncertainty is dominating thinking right now. According to Ross Guckert, the acting deputy for PEO Aviation, that's something that influences Future Vertical Lift, especially as they try to possibly move the program faster.  "Its really going to depend on what the budget ends up being next year, and where the priorities lie within the Army and the department to be able to put more money against that program and move it to the left", he said.  The presentation which was part of the AAAA's Aircraft Survivability Equipment Symposium, and it continues with the Joseph P. Cribbins Aviation Product Symposium that runs until Thursday.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily! Your notification has been saved.

To help ease the transition, NASA issued a request for information Friday asking for ideas on how to cut development and production costs of its SLS rocket and Orion crew capsule and ideas on competing spacecraft. “NASA is transitioning from design and development to long-term affordability and sustainability within a broader exploration framework.” The Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion crew vehicle are the backbone of NASA’s plan to launch a manned Mars mission sometime in the 2030s. [Image by NASA/MSFC] The space agency would prefer to use the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft it has been designing and building at the cost of some $3 billion annually, but admits the construction effort has been costly. In August, the Government Accountability Office audited the space agency and released a report saying NASA probably won’t complete the SLS or Orion on time or on budget. A few weeks later, the NASA engineer responsible for the production of the SLS and Orion told Ars Technica the development of the spacecraft was getting to be too expensive for the agency to handle. “We’re just way too expensive today. It’s going to take some different thinking and maybe a little bit more risk taking than what we’re wanting to do today.” NASA receives 0.5 percent of the national budget, and building such an expensive spacecraft has left little room for actual exploration. Their funding levels probably won’t increase once Donald Trump takes office. [Image by NASA] Shortly before Trump won the election, he outlined a plan to move NASA away from being an Earth-monitoring agency and focus it on exploring space. He plans to use the reconstituted National Space Agency to manage federal, military, and commercial activities to eliminate redundant programs. In this request for information, NASA has signaled its willingness to consider alternatives provided by its commercial partners if that means costs will be cut. SpaceX is hip deep into development on its Falcon Heavy rocket, and Blue Origin is working to build its New Glenn boosters, both of which are in the same class as the SLS and cheaper to fly. The United Launch Alliance is also building its own Vulcan rocket with a reusable first stage and a second stage designed to stay permanently in orbit where it will ferry cargo shuttled up by other spacecraft. It would feel good to have an official American spaceship, but with cheaper commercial spacecraft probably available for government contract work in the coming years, it’s easy to see why Trump would consider ditching the SLS. [Image by Tony Landis/NASA] Boeing and Lockheed Martin are building the Orion and its SLS rocket, but NASA’s request for information also covers the possibility of using components from different companies if that makes construction cheaper. Anyone looking to respond to NASA has until December 23 to respond. Since the heyday of the space program, when Kennedy told NASA to beat the Soviets to the moon, the agency has struggled with funding and changing goals, USC astronautics professor Mike Gruntman told the International Business Times. “The main problem is that we do not have a clear long-term goal for the national human spaceflight program. Being rudderless does not help in bringing public excitement and support.” Trump’s plan to coordinate civilian, federal, and military efforts to explore space may be the alternative to increased funding for the space agency.

However, Apple has long said the barrier to moving iPhone production to the U.S. is expertise, in addition to cost. "Foxconn follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products," a company spokesperson told CNBC via email. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Pegatron assemble iPhones in China. The news comes following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The Republican president-elect has been vocal about how U.S. companies should be building their products in America. "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries," Trump said in a speech in January.

But Beijing has hit back: In an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned that iPhone sales and other American goods could suffer if such a plan were to go through. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Manufacturing the iPhones abroad allows Apple to maintain a strong margin on its product. Apple is Foxconn's biggest customer but Chairman Terry Gou is worried about the rising production costs of such a move, the Nikkei reported, citing a source saying that costs will double. It's important to note that the discussions began in June, five months before Trump won the election. Analysts said it is still hard to quantify what such a move would mean for Apple's finances, but warned that there will be an impact. "If the world moves to a more nationalistic approach 'made in America, by Americans, for Americans' or 'made in China, by Chinese, for Chinese'... these variable conditions will likely impact margins, growth and suppliers exposed to the globalization trend of the last decade," wrote Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, in a note on Friday. "The same will likely make global tech a tougher place to invest in 2017," he said.

NASA Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Two days after launch from Kazakhstan, a Russian Soyuz ferry ship glided to a smooth docking with the International Space Station Saturday, bringing a veteran cosmonaut, a Frenchman making his first flight and NASA’s most experienced female astronaut to the lab complex. With commander Oleg Novitskiy at the controls, flanked on the left by European Space Agency flight engineer Thomas Pesquet and on the right by NASA’s Peggy Whitson, the Soyuz MS-03/49S spacecraft moved in for a docking at the Earth-facing Rassvet module at 4:58 p.m. EST. After extensive leak checks to verify structural integrity and an airtight seal, hatches were opened just after 7:30 p.m. and the crew was welcomed aboard by Expedition 50 commander Shane Kimbrough, Soyuz MS-02 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko, who were launched to the station Oct. 19. Floating in the Russian Zvezda module, the combined six-member crew held a traditional video conference with program managers, family and friends gathered at the Russian mission control center near Moscow. The station’s expanded six-member crew gathered in the Russian Zvezda module shortly after docking for a video conference with family and friends in Moscow. Front row, left to right: Peggy Whitson, Soyuz MS-03 commander Oleg Novitskiy and flight engineer Thomas Pesquet. Back row, left to right: station commander Shane Kimbrough, Soyuz MS-02 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko. NASA “Hello, Dad, how are you,” Novitskiy’s daughter radioed. “How are you, did you cry much?” he asked. “No crying at all.” “Well, I was hoping someone would cry!” Novitskiy joked. “We were all worried, of course, but we were being brave,” his daughter said. Novitskiy’s grandmother called up her congratulations, saying “we, the earthlings, need to follow your example, we need to all love each other. Good health to you and your crew and your colleagues. ... We’ve started the countdown to your landing!” This is Novitskiy’s second trip to the station. He spent 144 days at the laboratory in 2012-13. Whitson, 56, is a veteran of two long-duration stays in 2002 and 2007-08 totaling nearly 377 days. She served as commander of the station during her second visit and later served as chief of NASA’s astronaut office at the Johnson Space Center. On April 24, Whitson will set a new record for most time in space by a U.S. astronaut, surpassing the 534-day mark set in September by astronaut Jeff Williams. “She is an absolutely incredible role model for women everywhere in the world, and I could not be more proud to be able to call her a friend and colleague,” NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, a former shuttle commander, said from the Russian mission control center where he watched the docking. Bolden took a moment to mark the 18th anniversary of the first space station launch, saying the outpost stands as an example of international cooperation that will help pave the way for eventual missions beyond Earth orbit. “We’re going to use it to the best of our ability, maximize its utilization to learn as much as we can about the human body and about technologies necessary to get humans to Mars,” he said. “That’s what we’re doing.” As for increased tensions between Washington and Moscow, Bolden said he was confident the space station project would continue to weather “the political and diplomatic changes and trauma that go on down here on Earth.” Even “incursions by one of our partners into other countries, that has not deterred or slowed the work that we’ve done on the International Space Station,” he said, in a not-so-veiled reference to Russia’s actions in Crimea. “I look to that to be the case for years to come.” Whitson and her crewmates face a particularly busy mission, with a full slate of scientific research, at least two spacewalks and multiple visiting vehicle arrivals and departures. This first of those is on tap Monday when an Orbital ATK Cygnus cargo ship loaded with trash and no-longer-needed equipment is detached from the station by the lab’s robot arm. After moving a safe distance away, the spacecraft will operate autonomously while an untended experiment is carried out in its pressurized cabin to learn more about how flames propagate in weightlessness. The Cygnus then will be commanded to plunge back into the atmosphere, burning up harmlessly over the Pacific Ocean. The station crew will welcome a Russian Progress cargo ship in two weeks and a Japanese HTV freighter on Dec. 13. The HTV is loaded with six state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries that will replace 12 aging nickel-hydrogen batteries in one set of the station’s solar arrays. They will be installed during at least two spacewalks in January. A SpaceX Dragon cargo ship is expected to arrive in late January, followed by another Progress in early February, another Cygnus later that month and another Dragon in early March. The SpaceX dates assume the company completes its recovery from a Sept. 1 launch pad explosion that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket. Additional spacewalks are planned in the spring to attach a short tunnel-like pressurized mating adapter to a port on the forward Harmony module that eventually will be used by commercial crew ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX. One such port already is attached to the front of the station. Kimbrough, Ryzhikov and Borisenko are scheduled to return to Earth in late February. They will be replaced by Soyuz MS-04 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and NASA astronaut Jack Fischer, the first of two two-person ferry flights now planned for 2017. Launch is targeted for March 27. Whitson’s crew plans to wrap up their stay aloft in May, landing in Kazakhstan around the middle of the month. They will be replaced by another three-person crew made up of Soyuz MS-05 commander Sergey Ryazanskiy, European Space Agency astronaut Paulo Nespoli and NASA astronaut Randy Bresnik. That launch is planned for May 29. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The powerful jet was spotted on Wednesday but multiple military officials failed to identify the plane’s origin or even its flight destination sparking panic among some onlookers. ABC News 2 A mystery jet spotted by thousands in the skies over Denver has been identified as a E-6B mercury Now the plane has been identified as an E-6B mercury – a US Airforce mobile command centre used to launch nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. According to the Navy’s website, the E-6B is a high-tech and large plane, each of which is equipped with an airborne launch control system that can reliably launch intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It would be called into action if the States was ever dragged into another world war. Local news began tracking the top secret flight – codenamed IRON99 – as it moved over the Pacific, reports the Daily Star.

HELLBENT ON WAR North Korea will never ditch its nukes, intelligence expert warns After circling the skies for over an hour it eventually landed at Tinker Airforce base in Oklahoma. Top officials at nearby Buckley Air Force base added to the plane's mystery when they claimed the aircraft never checked in with its traffic control towers. Denver International Airport staff also confirmed no such plane came into contact with them. Although the Navy later said the plane simply was flying from its forwarding base back to home base, a high-ranking federal official who wasn't authorised to speak on the matter said the plane was involved in a classified training mission organised by the Department of Defense. The training mission reportedly centred around electronic surveillance and involved several agencies which aren't likely to comment on the mission, the source said. AFP 2 The state-of-the-art communications planes can harness the awesome power of the US nuclear weapons The source said the mission wasn't out of the ordinary despite its size, noting the public isn't usually aware of such training missions. And top military organisations including The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) said they couldn’t locate the mysterious flight or even confirm it existed. The planes from the ground up look a lot like Boeing 707 units because the plane is modelled off the old Boeing product. Often painted bright white to look nondescript, the planes have more than six hours of loiter time in the air and have a range of just over 7,500 miles.
