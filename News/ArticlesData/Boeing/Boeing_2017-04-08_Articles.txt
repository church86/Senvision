The shift, scheduled to take effect at the end of October, will not affect the Chicago-based airline's international flights out of Houston, and none of the company's Houston-based pilots will lose their jobs. "We think these changes will help us to best utilize our resources," said United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy. The Boeing 787 models, among the largest in United's fleet, seat as many as 252 passengers. They're commonly used for international flights. AWARD WINNER: Bush Intercontinental takes home prizes When the changes take effect, United plans to place Boeing 777s on its route from Houston to Frankfurt, German,  and Boeing 767s on its route from Houston to Rio de Janiero, Brazil, McCarthy said. "Houston remains a very important hub for us," she said. The company plans to use the 787s now operating out of Houston for flights from Dulles International Airport to Beijing, London, Paris and Sao Paulo, Brazil. United operated 30 787 models last year, according to securities filings. It expects to add three more to its fleet this year. United Airlines went through a PR nightmare after not allowing two girls to board a flight because they were wearing leggings. The controversy started after a person waiting to board witnessed the situation and tweeted about it. The tweet was retweeted more than 5000 times and even some celebrities joined the conversation. The problem? Crucial information was missing in the tweet. The two girls were traveling on employee passes. Such passes allow family and friends of airline employees to fly for free or at deep discounts. The catch? You need to follow the company's dress codes. Chicago-based United sought to clarify its stance in a post on its website late Sunday titled, “To our customers … your leggings are welcome!” Media: Wibbitz Scroll through the above gallery to see some of the planes spotted flying above Houston this year Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Apr 8, 2017 at 2:10PM Over the past few years, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has typically trailed its top rival Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) in terms of bringing in aircraft orders. This has been a recurring concern for investors. However, Boeing may be able to snap its losing streak this year. With the first quarter in the books, Boeing is far ahead of Airbus in the order race for 2017. Boeing starts 2017 on a tear Order activity has been slowing across the aerospace industry since 2014, driven by a combination of buyer fatigue after several years of strong orders, economic weakness in certain markets, and lower fuel prices (which made it less urgent to replace older planes). Last year, for the first time since 2009, Boeing failed to sell as many planes as it delivered. Boeing fell short of its aircraft sales target in 2016. Image source: Boeing. As a result, Boeing entered 2017 with fairly modest sales expectations for the year. On the company's January earnings call, CEO Dennis Muilenberg said that Boeing would probably capture a similar number of net orders to the 668 it brought in during 2016. So far, Boeing has had no trouble finding buyers for its planes. Last week, it reported that it received 198 net orders during Q1. This was far ahead of the 121 net orders it logged in the first quarter of 2016. As always, the 737 family led the way, with 167 net orders: 70 for the current version and 97 for the upcoming 737 MAX. Boeing also received 15 orders for the 767 as part of the U.S. Air Force tanker program and 11 orders for the 787 Dreamliner. Most importantly, the struggling current-generation 777 won nine orders last quarter. This will help Boeing avoid any further production cuts beyond what it has already announced. Of note, Boeing's Q1 order activity did not include the company's previously announced deal with Singapore Airlines for 39 widebodies. That order hasn't been finalized yet. Airbus flops While Boeing's Q1 order performance was all the company could have hoped for and more, Airbus had an extremely quiet quarter. In fact, as of the end of February, it had more cancellations than orders for the year. Airbus' order momentum has cooled off in the first few months of 2017. Image source: Airbus. During March, Airbus at least managed to get back into positive territory. The company ended Q1 with just six net orders year to date, consisting of nine net orders for the popular A320 narrowbody family and three orders for the A350 widebody, offset by four A330neo cancellations and two A380 cancellations. The A330neo and A380 cancellations were widely expected. However, they hit Airbus' two weakest products. The A380 backlog continues to shrink and Emirates seems to be the only airline truly committed to the jumbo jet. Meanwhile, the A330-800neo is down to just six orders from a single customer, making it doubtful that Airbus will proceed with development. Thus, the A330neo "family" may end up having just one member: the larger A330-900neo. It's still early Clearly, Boeing had a strong start to 2017, while Airbus did not. However, it's way too early for Boeing executives -- or investors -- to take a victory lap. Aircraft orders tend to come in spurts, and three months isn't a very long time. Airbus could catch up in a hurry if it reels in two or three big deals. Furthermore, Airbus is still well ahead of Boeing in terms of its total order backlog. As of the end of March, Airbus had 6,744 unfilled airplane orders, exactly 1,000 more than Boeing. These massive backlogs mean that Boeing and (especially) Airbus have most of their production locked in for the next decade. For now, they should focus on filling in the remaining gaps relative to their production plans. Boeing did a great job in that respect last quarter. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

Nathan Neal, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, Delta president Glen Hauenstein, Delta Flight Museum chair and president John Boatright, Boeing VP formarketing Randy Tinseth, and Delta employees inaugurate the “747 Experience.” —PHOTOS BY CHECHE V. MORAL ATLANTA—The first “Queen of the Skies” may have retired, but she’s not quite quietly riding off into the sunset. Even in retirement, she’s once more ready to accept guests—albeit this time, it’s not to ferry them to long, physical distances, but to take them on a nostalgic ride. Delta Ship 6301, the first passenger Boeing 747-400 ever built, is now a permanent interactive museum at the Delta Flight Museum grounds here. Delta Air Lines inaugurated the “747 Experience” March 28 at the Delta Flight Museum grounds in the airline’s global headquarters, attended by Georgia Gov. Nathan Neal, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, Delta president Glen Hauenstein, Delta Flight Museum chair and president John Boatright, Boeing VP for marketing Randy Tinseth, and employees of the airline. ADVERTISEMENT Delta Ship 6301, built in 1988, was retired on Sept. 9, 2015, after logging 61 million miles and ferrying roughly 4.9 million passengers, as part of the airline’s move to modernize its fleet with more fuel-efficient aircraft. First-generation jumbo jet Delta inherited Ship 6301 from Northwest Airlines following the two companies’ 2008 merger. The 747-400 is a spawn of the first-generation jumbo jets, built in the late 1960s, and is fondly called “The Whale” by pilots and aviation enthusiasts for its iconic and distinctive hump design. Unlike another popular aircraft exhibit at the museum, the sentimental “The Spirit of Delta”—the Boeing 767 that was famously acquired through employees’ fundraiser and donations when the airline suffered a slump, and was retired in 2006—“747 Experience” is more of a tribute to the revolutionary design of the aircraft. Visitors are allowed an intimate look into the internal workings of the aircraft, with parts of its underbelly exposed, via a see-through glass that shows large ducts, air filters and electrical wirings beneath, as well as a fuel tank and lavatory waste pipes. The ceilings are also exposed, revealing more technical wirings and insulation. A patio has also been created to allow visitors a “wing walk”—the 747-400 has a wingspan of 211 feet. On the upper deck, where part of the business-class (Delta One) seats were located, visitors can also walk all the way to the cockpit, and the pilot’s resting area adjacent to it. The first “Queen of the Skies,” a.k.a. the “747 Experience,” in its permanent plaza at the Delta Flight Museum grounds. Interactive exhibits The 68,000-sq-ft Delta Flight Museum opened in 1995 and was recently renovated, showcasing interactive exhibits and various aircraft celebrating aviation history. ADVERTISEMENT “The ‘747 Experience’ will provide a look into the history of this iconic ship,” said Boatright. “It was a technological wonder when it was placed in service in 1989, and it will remain a technological wonder for years to come. We hope this exhibit will educate and inspire current and future generations to get involved in aviation.” For many years, the Ship 6301 traveled regularly from its United States hubs to long-haul destinations like Manila, Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul. “I flew on that plane on so many flights to Manila,” a flight attendant, who’s a 43-year veteran at Delta, told this writer. “My son has just started to learn how to fly, and I can’t wait to bring him to the exhibit.” “While in some ways it pangs in our heart that we’re retiring such a beautiful and important aircraft, it’s also opening a new chapter as we bring on new state-of-the-art airplanes with even more amenities, services and comfort and better fuel economy for a greener and brighter future,” said Hauenstein at the inaugural. Delta inherited 16 747-400s from Northwest, and all seven remaining will be decommissioned by end of the year. The aircraft’s interiors and internal workings revealed End of an era Like other airlines, Delta has started replacing its 747s with more fuel-efficient, two-engine aircraft, marking the end of an era for jumbo jets. The four-engine 747-400 had, at Delta, a seating capacity of 376, flown by two pilots, with an 11-member flight crew. Its replacements, like the B777-200ERs and A330-300, have each nearly 100 less seats than the 747, but consume about 20 percent less fuel. Boeing’s Tinseth, in his speech, paid homage to Joe Sutter, who designed the 747 and died at age 95 in 2016. The 747 was built as a response to the aviation industry’s demand for a faster, wide-body jet that could ferry more passengers and freight. Its hump design was intended to elevate the cockpit above the main deck, thus allowing for easier front loading of cargo. Its wide fuselage also efficiently stored cargo containers, and meant increased revenue potential for airlines. Visitors can even walk on its wing Redundancy for safety The key to safety, Sutter believed, was about redundancy. The system had backups, and backups of backups, in case one failed. Quadruple redundancy was employed in the flight controls, flight surfaces, avionics, main landing gears. While many who have flown a 747-400 remember the upper deck as the business-class cabin, it was originally designed as a lounge space with only three windows. Pretty soon, airlines wanted the area to accommodate passenger seating. Boeing sold 694 747-400s from 1988 to 2009. Delta Ship 6301 had its final flight on Sept. 9, 2015, from Honolulu to Atlanta, after logging a distance equivalent to 250 trips from the Earth to the moon. On April 30, 2016, the first “Queen of the Skies” was hauled to her permanent plaza here, and within a mile of the world’s busiest airport, where she continues to watch, from her throne on the ground, other aviation wonders take flight.

(REUTERS/Stringer)    Here’s A 360 Degree View Of What It’s Like To Ride A Rocket Into Orbit Andrew Follett Energy and Science Reporter 10:53 AM 04/08/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5580008 A video United Launch Alliance (ULA) released Thursday shows what it’s like to ride a rocket into orbit. The video depicts a simulated space flight in a Boeing Starliner docking with the International Space Station (ISS). ULA, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, created the video, and Boeing’s Youtube channel published it. WATCH: Boeing released images in October showing the assembly of a nearly complete CST-100 Starliner prototype. The Starliner uses Russian-made RD-180 rocket engines, which are currently part of the workhouse rocket for the U.S. military’s space program. The U.S. Air Force is considering shifting satellites slated to be launched on RD-180 powered rockets onto more expensive but American-made rocket engines. ULA had a near-monopoly of parts in the rocket launching business for decades but is now facing increasingly stiff competition. ULA lost its competitive edge on space launches when SpaceX won U.S. Air Force certification for national missions. Boeing was deeply involved in the Apollo program that sent astronauts to the moon. The company is currently developing NASA’s Space Launch System, which will eventually send astronauts to Mars. The aerospace giant is also working to build commercial space operations, betting on a future where spaceflight is more routine.

Credit: Space Foundation/Tom Kimmel Photography. COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — From the National Space Council's return to women in space, the 33rd annual Space Symposium brought some fascinating space topics to light. The event took place this week (April 3-6), bringing together thousands of people representing all aspects of the space industry. Here is a roundup of interesting items from the gathering. Gwynne Shotwell on reusability and women in spaceflight Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of Elon Musk's private spaceflight company, SpaceX, spoke briefly about the company's progress on reusable rockets. She also addressed the continued underrepresentation of women in the space industry workforce. Showtwell presented a quote from Bella Abzug, a human rights activist who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977. (The quote uses the word "schlemiel," which is a Yiddish word meaning an awkward or unlucky person prone to failure.) "Our struggle today is not to have a female Einstein get appointed as an assistant professor. It is for a woman schlemiel to get as quickly promoted as a male schlemiel," Abzug is quoted as saying. Shotwell said the quote highlighted that while the number of women leaders in the industry is increasing, "that's not the end game." Instead, she said the goal was to have equality on every level in the industry. She then provided another quote, this one from a female cab driver Shotwell spoke with that week. "[She was] an African-American woman, raising six kids as a single mom, and she said, 'The only way women make it in this world is if they're 200 times better than the men,'" Shotwell said to the audience. "So, I just want you to think about that." SpaceX made history last week when it successfully launched and landed a first-stage Falcon 9 rocket booster that had already flown a mission last year. The company has been pursuing the goal of reusable rocket boosters for its entire 15-year history, Shotwell said, and the second flight of the booster represents a significant step for the company. However, Shotwell also noted that the booster was re-flown months after its first flight, and said the company is pursuing a much faster turnaround schedule for its reusable boosters. "We think it doesn't really count unless you can turn it around basically as quickly as you can turn around an aircraft," Shotwell said. Steering a spaceship Two spacecraft simulators on display at the Space Symposium exhibit hall allowed visitors to try their hands at flying NASA's Orion human spacecraft and the Boeing CST-100 Starliner human spacecraft. The CST-100 Starliner is scheduled to ferry humans to the space station as early as 2018. The Starliner simulator included a mock-up of the CST-100 crew cabin, complete with three passenger seats, a very realistic-looking console covered in switches and buttons, and a window providing a view of the space station. A simulator of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner lets users attempt to dock the craft with the International Space Station. Credit: Calla Cofield/Space.com Users are challenged to pilot the spacecraft and dock it with the space station using a joystick to steer or accelerate, with guidance from digital diagrams that show the craft's position in relation to the station. One of the screens shows a face-on view of the station, and users try to align the spacecraft's docking portal with the station's docking hatch (indicated by a white cross and a purple triangle). A Boeing representative said about 3 percent to 4 percent of people who try the simulator fail to complete the docking. The simulator is not the same as those used by actual astronauts in training, the representative said, but it "brings the best" of the real simulator to the public. The simulator will be traveling the country and appearing at various events where members of the public can give the experience a spin. Its next stop is Houston for the FIRST Robotics Championship in April, and eventually to Florida, the company representative said. Announcements about the simulator's next location typically appear on the Boeing Defense Twitter account. Meanwhile, across the symposium's showroom floor, Lockheed Martin, the primary contractor for NASA's Orion space capsule, displayed a mock Orion console with a simulation program. Participants attempted to dock Orion with the Mars Base Camp, a space station proposed by the company that would orbit the Red Planet ahead of sending humans to the surface. A failed docking caused the program to release a startlingly loud screeching/crashing sound. A simulator of NASA's Orion spacecraft lets users attempt to dock the craft with a space station orbiting Mars. Credit: Calla Cofield/Space.com The Orion simulator is the same one used by Lockheed to test how the spacecraft's main computer displays information for astronauts. Because the simulator has a professional role to play, it will make fewer public appearances than the Boeing Starliner simulator, a Lockheed Martin representative told Space.com. Upcoming satellite constellation could have found lost Malaysian airlines flight At a panel on using satellites to assist with maritime monitoring, a group of experts agreed that a new satellite constellation called Iridium NEXT could have located the ill-fated Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, which went missing over the Pacific Ocean in March 2014. The Iridium NEXT constellation is an upgrade to Iridium's current satellite constellation. The first 10 satellites in the planned 70-satellite constellation were launched into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in January. Some of the instruments on board the Iridium NEXT satellites make up the AppSTAR platform created by the Harris Corporation. The technology in these instruments isn't revolutionary; they simply receive GPS signals from transmitters that are placed on boats and airplanes, and send that information back to users on the ground, a Harris representative told Space.com. But the Iridium NEXT constellation will ultimately allow those instruments to receive signals from a vehicle anywhere on Earth, 24 hours a day, according to the company. The people using the system can receive signals once per minute, with a delay of less than 1 second, as opposed to the current lag time of anywhere from 6 minutes to 30 minutes, said David Mottarella, senior manager of maritime geospatial solutions, space and intelligence systems at Harris. In the case of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, had the AppSTAR instruments all been operating in orbit, and had the plane contained the right transmitter on board, "we would have been able to track that flight to its entry into the ocean," Mottarella said. "This is not a technology issue," said the panel moderator, Thad Allen, who recently retired from his position as executive vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton. The applications for the AppSTAR platform are wide-ranging. Mottarella spoke primarily about the need to monitor cargo on the ocean. "Ninety percent of the world's trade happens on the open oceans," Mottarella said. That includes the movement of crude oil, dry goods and fish. "Clearly, the safety and security and knowing where those elements are out on the ocean is a big problem." Mottarella said AppSTAR could also help tackle problems like illegal fishing, because the system could be used to track the location of fishing vessels and monitor activity in areas where fishing is prohibited. (The tracking devices that the AppSTAR system uses are required on all ocean vessels above a certain size, a Harris representative told Space.com.) "The World Wildlife Federation estimates that $25 billion is lost each year in illegal fishing," Mottarella said. "About one-third of the fish coming into us comes from illegal or unreported fishing." NASA center leaders comment on National Space Council The directors of three different NASA centers spoke briefly about the Trump administration's reinstatement of a National Space Council (NSC) and how the move would affect NASA. The directors spoke during a panel discussion that featured a total of six leaders from different NASA centers. A panel at the 33rd annual Space Symposium featured six leaders from six different NASA centers. Shown here (l to r), Ellen Ochoa, director of Johnson Space Center in Houston; Janet Kavandi director of Glenn Research Center in Cleveland; Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; and panel moderator David Livingston, founder and host of The Space Show. Credit: Space Foundation/Tom Kimmel Photography In the past, the NSC has served to advise presidents on space matters, but the last council was dissolved in 1993. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who will chair the NSC, has said that the council's other members may include representatives from NASA and the commercial spaceflight industry. "NASA has operated effectively with a space council, and it's operated, I think, effectively without a space council," said Ellen Ochoa, a former astronaut and director of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. "We're going to work together as an overall agency with the leadership at [NASA] headquarters to understand how we can be most effective in working with a space council."   Todd May, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, mentioned a report by the Aerospace Corporation that analyzed the effectiveness of previous iterations of the NSC. Addressing the question of whether the NSC's revival would be a good thing or a bad thing for NASA, May added, "As an engineer I'd say it probably depends on how you set it up. But as a center director, to some extent, we're shielded from a lot of that." May was referring to the fact that these center directors typically don't deal directly with orders coming down from Washington; that work is typically handled by the top NASA leadership at the agency's headquarters in Washington D.C.. "We have missions to do. We have hardware to build. [The NSC] may affect us, but it affects us through orders we get from our bosses," May said. Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said that a space council operating in 2017 will deal with a much larger space industry than one operating in 1993 did. A national space council could help "make us more efficient as a nation with how we invest in space," he said. "I think it can be a good thing," Watkins said. "But I think, as Todd [May] said, it depends on how you do it. And setting it up in an efficient way is critical."

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) President Donald Trump addressed thousands of supporters during a campaign rally Saturday in Melbourne, Florida.  >>Read Trump speaks to thousands of supporters at Florida rally, brings one onstage Here is a full transcript of Trump's remarks according to C-Span and Vox: Thank you, everybody, thank you. I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you. It's so great to be here in Florida. My second home with you. This is a state I truly love. This is a state where we all had great victory together. Thank you. It's now been a month since my inauguration. And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again. I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me. I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people. This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else. This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you. I promise you that. I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future. I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news. The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years. They don't get it. By they're starting to get it. I can tell you that. They've become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that. They don't get away with it. They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, “nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.” “Truth itself,” he said, “becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,” that was June 14, my birthday, 1807. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win. We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices. We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver. I promise that. And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time. The White House is running so smoothly. So smoothly. And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess. That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in. We will have strong borders again, and I mean that. You've seen it in television. You've seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job. You're seeing it. The gang members, bad, bad people. I said day one, and they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from. The fact is, you want great schools for your children. You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families. You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare. It will be repealed and replaced. For those people. The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast. Okay? Nothing to complain about. Obamacare remember, it is a disaster. You want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal. We're going to put the miners back to work. The miners go back to work. You want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders. You want fair trade deals and a level playing field. We don't have a level playing field. Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the [inaudible] of our politicians. It's not going to happen any longer. You want lower taxes. Less regulation. Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, “Made in the USA.” You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America. And harder for companies to leave. We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired. We're moving to another country. We're going to make the product. Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful. Not going happen anymore. We're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave. They will never, ever leave. And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office. They're not leaving. And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers. You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest. You want a government that keeps its promises. A great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it. it's sweeping all across the country. Look at what's happening to the stock market. Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. It's sweeping across the country. And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs. They're going to start highs. It's going to be a new day in America. You're going to be proud again. Jobs are already starting to pour back in. They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time. Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country. In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs. I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it. We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one. None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand. Get mired in and we can't do anything about it. By the way, NAFTA and so many others. My administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers. We're going to end it. Within a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs. And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe? Who makes the pipe? Something this audience understands very well, right? Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said not anymore. I put a little clause in the bottom. The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line. We believe in two simple rules. I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger. For the big planes. And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd. Not one. Not one. They won't show the crowd. You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much. And just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One. Can you believe this? I said no way. I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse. So I got Boeing and it is actually — a lot of people don't know. The Air Force One project is actually two planes. Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. I told Boeing it's not good enough. We're still not going to do it. The price is still too high. On the fighter jet. We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. Seven years late, great plane. A great plane. So think of it. They're seven years late. Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget. Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well. And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way. I also got Boeing in. I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer. And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them. They would have signed contracts. So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump. That I can tell you. You might as well know about it. Nobody talks. By the way, that's for fighter jets. One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation. The order for the F-35. You've been reading about it because it was a disaster. Under the last administration. A disaster. And now we have it running beautifully. In fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great. Great guy. When he came over, he said, thank you. I said for what. You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet. Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation. So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good. Okay. That's good. I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right? But we believe in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. We believe it. We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. And by the way, a new director was just approved. Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time. Incredible people. Scott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency. He'll do so good. He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected. They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly. For the most part, they're going to be accepted. They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary. He will be amazing. We're very happy. That took place yesterday. That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations. It was impossible to navigate for companies. And what did it really mean? Forget about the companies? What did it mean. It meant no jobs. It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here. So we're going to have a whole big situation. We are going to unfreeze all of those companies. They are going to be — they're going have freedom. Be able to build what they want to build. It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before. That's going to happen. That was a big thing. We're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement. We're standing up. And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up. I don't say for me. I'm the messenger folks. I'm the messenger. They stood up for us in this last election. We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military. Basically people they wear uniforms like us. Isn't that nice. I saw this man on TV just now, you. I just saw him on television. He said I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do. That's my guy right there. Come here. Come here. No, I just. I'm coming in. That's okay. Let him up. I'm not worried about him. I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss. I'm not worried about anything else. This guy is so great. He was one of many people. They're interviewing people in the line. And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man. Come on up here. Come on up. Guy was great. Hop over the fence. Come on. He can do it. He's in good shape. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on. This guy is great. Don't worry about him. No, no. Come here. They're going to — come on up. Come here. This guy. So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning. Greg Huber I did sir. Trump Say a couple of words to this crowd. Huber Mr. President, thank you sir. We the people, our movement is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today. When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us. Thank you so much, sir. Trump A star is born. Huber A star is born. That's fine. Trump I wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. Great guy. And so many others. I see some others. Being interviewed. I see them over here. They started. They came at 4 in the morning. The media will give them no credit. The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd. All the way outside of this — this is a big a hanger as you get. All the way outside. Way back to the fences. Amazing. I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody. I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them. We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now. It's very unfair what's happening. So we want to cherish our law enforcement. We will always protect those who protect us. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities. We're going to make our inner cities safe again. Look at what's going on. Look at what's happening in Chicago. Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places. Safety is a civil right. And we will fight to make America totally safe again. I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth. We're stopping it. We're stopping it. We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly. And I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing. And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a — yes, it's very sad. The reason is for protection and safety. So the statute is so plain and so clear. I said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its. If you have a high school education, you can understand it. If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it. I was told. I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court. Three judges. And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television. Everything we do gets a lot of people watching. So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good. When they wrote their decision, as I understand it. Maybe I'm wrong. They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right. “If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama. “He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right? So and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up. We had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens. Here's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe. And we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones. We do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that. I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment. And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans. We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly. No wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it. My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen. Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy. It's a tragedy. You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%. Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it. Obamacare doesn't work. It's become totally unaffordable. Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable. It doesn't work. And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything. Sit back for two years, let it explode. The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people. We have to fix it. And we will. We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation. You're all part of this incredible movement. This movement that we talk about so much. That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world. It's a movement that is just sweeping. It's sweeping across our country. It's sweeping frankly across the globe. Look at Brexit. Look at Brexit. Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at. People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family. The nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth. And now we have spirit like we've never had before. It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens. Erasing national borders does not make people safer. It undermines democracy and trade prosperity. We're giving it away. The so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages. Really they are shrinking. 18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs. Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. We don't fight to win. We fight politically correct wars. We don't win anymore. We don't win at trade. We don't win in any capacity. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again. Believe me. And we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages. This will be change for the ages. Change like never before. To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity. We want to secure our borders and protect our workers. To rebuild our military and our infrastructure. To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities. To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce. To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation. And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation. The tired echoes of yesterday's fights. We're fighting battles that no longer help us. We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight. I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries. They're not paying their bills. They're not paying their bills. They have to help us. No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past. No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure. New circumstances demand new solutions. Americans have fought and won wars together. Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives. Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next. Stretching back to the first day of our American independence. This is our legacy. It belongs to all of you. And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation. Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts. Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country. We are all brothers and all sisters. We share one home. One destiny and one glorious American flag. We are united together by history and by providence. We will make America strong again. I promise. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Greater than ever before. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Las Vegas Sun April 9, 2017 Currently: 59° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events 0 A Pentagon test for Boeing’s Mr. Fix-it Al Drago / The New York Times President Donald Trump speaks during a rally to unveil Boeing’s Dreamliner 787-10 in North Charleston, S.C., Feb.17, 2017. Trump is asking Patrick Shanahan, who has been promoted to senior vice president at Boeing, to take on another job that others have found too big too handle. He plans to nominate him to be deputy defense secretary, the Pentagon’s second-ranking official. By Christopher Drew, New York Times News Service Saturday, April 8, 2017 | 2 a.m. In 2007, Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., put out an SOS call to the head of the company’s military business. Boeing had bet its future on a revolutionary passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner, and the project was imperiled by delays and cost overruns. McNerney had singled out one man who could fix the problems: Patrick M. Shanahan, a 45-year-old executive with two master’s degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who ran Boeing’s missile-defense business. “Jim said he needed a guy with Pat’s skills on the 787,” said James F. Albaugh, Shanahan’s boss at the time. “I was disappointed to lose Pat, but I knew Jim was right.” Now President Donald Trump is asking Shanahan, who has been promoted to senior vice president at Boeing, to take on another job that others have found too big to handle. Trump plans to nominate him to be deputy defense secretary, the Pentagon’s second-ranking official and a point man for executing Trump’s plans to build up the military. His selection comes at a moment when Trump has proposed the biggest increase in the Pentagon budget in years. He would like to add tens of thousands of soldiers and Marines, increase the size of the Navy and modernize the nuclear arsenal. Most analysts say Congress is unlikely to go along fully with his proposal to strip $54 billion from domestic programs and give it to the Pentagon. But the military services have responded to the proposed increase by beefing up their shopping lists. If the wishes exceed the allocations, it would be Shanahan’s job to tamp down the expectations and settle disputes over the priorities. While the defense secretary typically focuses on war-fighting policies and relations with Congress, the deputy secretary manages the Pentagon’s vast bureaucracy, rides herd on weapons contractors and tries to root out wasteful spending, tasks that have been legendarily difficult since President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned about the rise of the military-industrial complex. And the job could become even more complicated under Trump, who has been personally negotiating deals with contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin in ways that his predecessors have rarely, if ever, done. “I don’t envy Shanahan being in that position, with the president looking over his shoulder like that,” said Gordon Adams, who oversaw military budgets in the Clinton White House. Under federal ethics rules, Shanahan would have to recuse himself for two years from dealing with Boeing, the No. 2 military contractor after Lockheed. Even before he took office, Trump fired off a post on Twitter questioning cost estimates for new Air Force One jets to be built by Boeing. Shanahan will have to leave oversight of that project, as well as big Boeing contracts for other planes and satellites, to others. The Pentagon’s ethics lawyers will also have to decide how far he can go in helping rein in costs on Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet, the Pentagon’s largest program, since the president is considering buying Boeing’s Super Hornets instead of some of the F-35s. But such recusals are fairly common, given that other deputy secretaries and Pentagon officials have come from industry. President Barack Obama had to waive some ethics rules when he named a Raytheon lobbyist, William J. Lynn III, to the job in 2009. And while every deputy secretary has sought to tame the military bureaucracy, analysts say, few have had significant success since David Packard, a founder of Hewlett-Packard, who agreed to take the job when the military’s finances were strained during the Vietnam War. Trump would like to increase the base military budget to $603 billion — $54 billion more than the current level but only $18 billion higher than Obama had suggested in his last budget.The Pentagon receives an additional $60 billion in supplemental war-fighting money. It has hundreds of thousands of contractors and almost as many support people as uniformed personnel. And as the Pentagon shifts more of its focus from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the need to stay ahead of more sophisticated rivals like China and Russia, it has undertaken technologically challenging programs to build new long-range bombers and ballistic-missile submarines, and update nuclear weapons. Shanahan and top Pentagon officials declined to discuss his selection, saying he is still undergoing background checks and must be confirmed by the Senate. His supporters say his work on high-tech projects at Boeing, where he oversees the company’s manufacturing operations and thousands of suppliers, will help him assess which technologies are worth the cost and keep projects from spinning out of control. In that sense, his experience with the contracting side provides a good complement to the strategic expertise of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general who oversaw the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan as head of the U.S. Central Command. “To me, it’s a great Mr. Inside with Pat and Mr. Outside with Jim,” Albaugh said. “And I know that when Secretary Mattis asks Pat to do something, that is the last time Mattis will have to think about it.” Still, his appointment does not come without concerns. Adams, the former Clinton administration budget official, said Shanahan might “find it darn difficult to turn the screws and wrestle more efficiency out of the military services at the same time as the president is doling out a budget with more money.” And friends say Shanahan, a divorced father of three with a dry sense of humor and a taste for golf, has never shown much interest in politics. He was selected only after Mattis’ first choice for the job, Michèle Flournoy, an undersecretary of defense under Obama, withdrew from consideration, telling Politico that Mattis needed a deputy who “wouldn’t be struggling every other day” about some of the changes that Trump wants to make in national security policies. Shanahan’s focus instead has been on building teams with “a roll-up-his-sleeves approach,” Albaugh said. “He says, ‘We’re in this together, so tell us what we can do as a team.’ We’ve gone through a lot, and I’ve never seen him get down about anything.” Shanahan grew up in Washington state and earned a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Washington, where he is the chairman of the Board of Regents. He joined Boeing as an engineer in 1986 and earned master’s degrees in mechanical engineering and business from MIT while rising at the company. He headed the 767 and 757 jet programs for Boeing’s commercial side before moving to its military business, where he ran its rotorcraft division in Philadelphia and then its ballistic-missile defense program. The rotorcraft division supplied Apache and Chinook helicopters and helped build the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor plane, and it suffered from low profit margins, said Albaugh, who was in charge of Boeing’s military business then. He said Shanahan increased profits through simple “blocking and tackling,” like managing subcontractors and work schedules more closely. Shanahan took over Boeing’s missile-defense business in 2004 and worked on the kind of cutting-edge technology that often bedevils the military. He helped develop an airborne anti-missile laser that was later canceled by the Pentagon and a ground-based missile-defense system whose effectiveness remains under question. Still, his ability to keep such complex programs moving forward caught the attention of top Boeing executives as they grew desperate in 2007 to save the 787 Dreamliner, the first commercial jet made substantially of lightweight plastic composites. Orders were pouring in from airlines interested in a potential 20 percent cut in fuel costs, but the project was running late and veering well over budget as suppliers around the world struggled to make the parts. That is what prompted McNerney’s call to Albaugh about Shanahan. Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia, said the project had also been hampered by “a disastrous command structure where information could not flow upward.” Engineers were having trouble making executives with marketing backgrounds understand what was causing the delays, he said. Shanahan brought another manager from Boeing’s military business, Scott Fancher, to help him, and “they had to rip up the lines of communication and the work packages and start again," Aboulafia said. Shanahan also assigned teams of engineers to bring troubled suppliers up to speed. More delays ensued, and the overruns created a huge hole in Boeing’s finances. “But universally, Shanahan and Fancher are credited with saving the 787,” Aboulafia said. Shanahan was later put in charge of all commercial airplane programs, where he was credited with smoothly ramping up production. He was elevated last year to Boeing’s top leadership council, overseeing suppliers and production facilities for the whole company. But while he was managing the commercial jets, analysts said, Shanahan fell behind a friendly rival, Dennis A. Muilenburg, who became head of the military business and is now chief executive. So by the time Trump’s aides and Mattis began to consider him for the deputy secretary job, it was clear that he had gone “as far as he was going at Boeing,” Aboulafia said. Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research group funded by Boeing and other military contractors, said that “getting a person like this in the Pentagon’s No. 2 job has a real advantage. You’ll not be able to fool him if your project is not going well.” Adams, the former Clinton administration budget official, said Shanahan must quickly get on top of the project to build the new bomber, the B-21, being developed by Northrop Grumman. “Bomber programs have always misbehaved,” Adams said, noting that costs rose so high on Northrop’s B-2 bomber that Congress had to cut the order to 21 planes from 132. And if Congress does not approve as large an increase in the budget as Trump wants, Shanahan would need to tell the services no on other pet projects if he wants to enforce any budget discipline, Adams said. “If history is any guide,” he added, “that will be an uphill battle.” 0 Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

Cork to Stewart International Airport in New York State had been scheduled to begin in 2018 following the launch of Cork to TF Green Airport in Providence, Rhode Island this summer but that is currently looking unlikely, according to Bjørn Kjos. Speaking in Dublin, Mr Kjos said the airline’s calculations regarding the runway length and the carrying of fuel and passengers meant Cork to New York was not possible at present. However he added that the airline had not given up hope, as it was working with Boeing on aircraft that could make the journey possible and that if their calculations finally added up, it would mean Cork flights to New York. Cork Airport’s short runway by international standards has historically been the reason why most aircraft cannot fly transatlantic routes. Norwegian has calculated that a Boeing 737MAX can takeoff and land in Providence with the amount of fuel and passengers onboard but falls short of making it to Stewart, around 250km further inland. He said: “The problem in Cork is the runway. If it was longer it is highly likely we could have done Stewart. Normally Boeing end up producing a better aircraft than the prototype but it remains to be seen if it is possible to fly to Stewart. If possible, we will do it. As it looks with the figures we have so far, it’s a little bit too far.” It all depends on testing the new aircraft this summer whether Cork to New York can be included in the 2018 summer schedule, according to the airline. Mr Kjos rejected claims that Cork was used as a political pawn for Norwegian to receive permission to fly from Ireland to the US, saying it was the first city he had looked at as they were exploring the possibility. Critics said Cork stakeholders did all the running but that Dublin, Shannon and Belfast received the most benefit with far more flights. “Cork was one of the first cities I ever looked at because a lot of people in the New York region originate from this area. There are a lot of Irish-Americans who have very close ties with that part of Ireland. It was no coincidence. We could have flown everything out of Dublin. I would reject that criticism because we are looking at catchment areas close to the Atlantic. Cork met that criteria and so did Shannon, and Dublin is a large catchment area. Passengers will always decide the number of flights,” he said. Norwegian is currently exploring linking up with Ryanair to provide European-wide low fares to the US, he confirmed. Streamlining their booking systems was taking time and once they had the correct interface within both platforms, it could happen, he said. “We want that possibility with Ryanair so that passengers can fly as an example into Cork and then with Ryanair go to Sicily or wherever they fly. Michael O’Leary is thinking the same as me — what is good for the passenger is always good for the airlines. If we can find a system where passengers can fly all the way with low fares, then super,” he said. Mr Kjos was in Dublin to receive the Outstanding Contribution to Aviation award by the Irish Aviation Authority. Previous winners include IAG boss Willie Walsh and Qantas CEO Alan Joyce.

(NYSE: BA) delivered 169 commercial jets in the first quarter of 2017, setting the company up to exceed its projected total for this year. Boeing delivered 748 commercial jets in 2016 and in January forecast deliveries of 760 to 765 for 2017, roughly equal to the 762 planes it delivered in 2015. This is, as the saying goes, old news because the company had already reported March deliveries and anyone with a calculator (or a pencil and paper) could have done the basic arithmetic. Still, it is a good showing for Boeing and is contributing to a modest move higher for the stock price. In another, more interesting, story, Moody’s Investors Service released a report today on the Boeing’s prospects to win the $16.3 billion contract to design and build a new training jet for the U.S. Air Force. The contract for the new trainer, dubbed the T-X, is expected to be awarded before the end of this year. According to a report at Washington Business Journal, Moody’s said: We believe Boeing’s need to bolster its position as a prime contractor on a significant [Department of Defense] program following missing out on the next generation fighter and, most recently, on the next generation bomber, could have caused it to aggressively bid for the T-X contract. The consensus opinion is that the contract is going to go to the low bidder, period. Other certain competitors are teams led by Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and DRS Technologies, the U.S.-based division of Italy’s Leonardo. Boeing is teamed with Saab and is the only team offering a clean-sheet design for the T-X. With demand for passenger planes softening, building up the company’s military business is a top priority. Boeing recently received an order to fit 17 P-8A maritime patrol planes that are based on the 737 airframe. Including options for 32 additional planes, the contract could potentially reach $6.8 billion for Boeing. Here’s the rundown on Boeing’s first-quarter deliveries of commercial jets: 737 family: 113 747 family: 1 (an operating lease) 767 family: 2 777 family: 21 787 family: 32 Boeing also delivered 3 F-15 and 6 F/A-18 fighter jets in the quarter, along with three new Apache helicopters and 13 remanufactured Apaches, as well as with a total of 12 new and remanufactured Chinook helicopters and 3 P-8 patrol planes. Boeing’s shares traded up about 0.6% in the noon hour Thursday, at $178.16 in a 52-week range of $119.39 to $185.71. The consensus price target is $176.50.

By Amy B. Wang Washington Post  April 08, 2017 Imagine taking your next trip of a couple hundred miles. Boston to New York City, for example. Or Houston to Dallas. Tampa to Miami. The obvious choice now might be to drive. But what if you could show up at an airport at one of those cities, bypass security, board a small hybrid-electric plane with luggage in hand, and be on the ground at your destination in about an hour — all for $25 each way? Advertisement A company called Zunum Aero hopes to make that a reality, so that future travelers who normally take a car, bus, or train for regional trips won’t think twice about flying. The Washington-state-based start-up says that since 2013, it has been developing a fleet of hybrid-electric planes that would make those kinds of inexpensive, short-haul flights possible. The company has some heavyweight investor partners, including Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures, subsidiaries of their respective companies. It also faces a number of competitors and obstacles, particularly battery limitations. But if successful, it could significantly change regional air travel, where options have shriveled and costs have crept up in recent decades.

Sign up for more newsletters here ‘‘Think of it as Tesla of the air,’’ said Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures. ‘‘[Or] think of it as an electric bus in the air.’’ Zunum Aero emerged from ‘‘stealth mode’’ on Wednesday to announce its ambitious goals: to be flying routes of up to 700 miles (think Atlanta to Washington, D.C.) by the mid-2020s and then routes of up to 1,000 miles (Los Angeles to Seattle) by 2030. The start-up also laid out an array of promises: Door-to-door travel times cut in half. Lower operating costs. Airfares that would be 40 to 80 percent lower. All on quiet hybrid aircraft that would produce 80 percent less emissions. Advertisement Indeed, part of the company name was inspired by ‘‘tzunuum,’’ the Mayan word for the hummingbird, for the bird’s speed and efficiency. ‘‘To be perfectly honest, we’ve been wanting to tell the story for four years,’’ Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar told The Washington Post. ‘‘What we’ve been building towards is really exciting and we believe fundamentally is going to change the shape of regional aviation.’’ Kumar thinks operating costs for the company’s hybrid-electric planes could be 40 to 80 percent lower than for conventional aircraft. A small range-extending generator would be integrated into early planes, kicking in on longer flights where battery power isn’t enough. The eventual goal would be for battery technology to become advanced enough to have planes relying entirely on electricity, eliminating fuel costs altogether, Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar said. There are several reasons that people rarely choose to fly for short regional trips. Flying often means allotting extra time for getting to the airport, going through security and then boarding. Also, the airline industry’s shift to larger planes and big-city hubs created what Kumar calls a ‘‘regional transport gap.’’ Flights from midsize cities are now often routed through hubs, meaning door-to-door times for those trips are no better than they were 50 years ago, Kumar said. And air options for smaller communities have been dwindling or disappearing, he added. Today, 97 percent of US air traffic comes from 2 percent of the more than 5,000 airports in the country, according to the 2014-2034 FAA Aerospace Forecast. About 95 percent of trips under 500 miles are taken by car, according to the US Department of Transportation’s National Household Travel Survey. For trips between 500 and 750 miles, about 61 percent of travelers drive and 34 percent fly. For trips between 750 and 1,000 miles, a little more than half of travelers fly and 42 percent drive. Kumar and his team think this is where electric-hybrid planes can step in. Whereas a Boeing 737 today seats anywhere from 85 to more than 200 passengers, a Zunum plane would have from 10 to 50 seats. Because the Transportation Security Administration imposes fewer regulations on smaller aircraft, those passengers would likely be able to skip long security lines. Removing luggage check-in options also would save on time on the ground, he said. The resulting trip would feel more like a cross between private corporate air travel and hopping on a bus. The company is not without its competitors. This year, a Massachusetts-based start-up called Wright Electric announced similar plans to roll out ‘‘zero-emissions electric airliners designed to save money and our planet’’ within a decade. The Y Combinator-backed company, however, told BBC News that it was relying on continued advances in battery technology. ‘‘The battery technology is not there yet,’’ Graham Warwick, technology editor of Aviation Weekly, told the BBC. ‘‘It’s projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon.’’ It remains too early to tell what the commercial aviation industry will look like by the mid-2020s and whether one-way fares in the $25 range would be feasible then. Even now, it is not unheard of for low-cost carriers such as Frontier or Spirit to offer double-digit airfares on domestic routes. That hasn’t stopped others from diving into hybrid-electric aerospace projects. Airbus has also been developing its ‘‘E-Fan’’ hybrid electric aircraft since 2014, and in 2015 it became the first all-electric twin-engine plane to cross the English Channel. Though the ‘‘E-Fan’’ has only two seats, Airbus is hoping the technology will lead to a regional airliner or helicopter. Plans for helicopter-esque electric ‘‘VTOL’’ (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft have also been emerging from Silicon Valley lately. The Verge’s Andrew J. Hawkins reported that Uber, Airbus, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and Google co-founder Larry Page are all working on developing their own VTOLs. ‘‘Because nothing says ‘I’m very rich and I hate traffic’ like a flying car project,’’ Hawkins wrote for the technology site. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX said it was confident in investing in Zunum Aero ‘‘because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space.’’ Simi compared the push for hybrid-electric planes to the airline industry’s advancement from strictly propeller planes to jet aircraft. ‘‘It’s that type of transformation,’’ Simi said. ‘‘We’re very excited about where this is going. It’s still very early, of course. We now have a seat at the table at what we believe is going to be an amazing change.’’ Loading comments...

In Lexington County, the Miller Valentine Group has announced plans to build a speculative industrial building at the Lexington County Industrial Park near I-77 and I-26. It’s the first such effort by a private developer since 2009, according to Colliers, which is the leasing agent for the property. Here are highlights from the Colliers report, which was released in March: Greater demand for industrial buildings Construction projects by Volvo in Berkeley County, Boeing in Charleston County, BMW in Spartanburg County and Daimler in North Charleston, along with the presence of five major tire manufacturing companies, is increasing the demand for industrial buildings by suppliers and distributors. The Daimler plant is expected to create at least 1,300 jobs. Boeing’s expansion is expected to add at least 2,000 jobs by 2020, and Volvo will hire 2,000 for its initial production phase. E-commerce The expansion of e-commerce has created a demand for products to be delivered faster. “Distributors are searching for larger distribution centers along the East Coast to fill consumer orders within two-three days,” the report said. South Carolina’s location makes the state a prime target for distribution centers and warehouses. “South Carolina has access to 78 percent of the nation’s population within a 16-hour truck drive of Columbia,” the report said. South Carolina facilities allow companies to fill customer orders quicker. Charleston port The location of Charleston’s port makes it popular for companies involved in e-commerce and manufacturing suppliers. The port is 500 miles from Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, Richmond, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. The port has started – or is scheduled to begin – several major capital improvements. They include deepening the port to accommodate the bigger ships that can now pass through the Panama Canal following its expansion, which opened in June 2016. “The project will allow larger ships to access the port at any time.” Midlands potential Statewide, the vacancy rate for industrial space was 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. In Charleston, the rate was 4.2 percent, while the Midlands’ rate was 7.4 percent. The availability of large buildings – at least 200,000 square feet – is important to companies who want to move into the area and quickly begin operations. While such buildings are scarce /in/ Charleston and Greenville, the Midlands has six, including the former Mack Truck plant near Winnsboro and the former Bose plant in Blythewood. The Midlands also is the only South Carolina industrial market with so-called “mega sites” available for development. The report defined a mega site as having 1,000 contiguous acres of developable land with access to utilities, transportation, and a workforce to support a major employer. The Midlands region has sites available in Clarendon, Newberry and Kershaw counties.

New York City to Boston, for example. Or Houston to Dallas. Tampa to Miami. The obvious choice now might be to drive. But what if you could show up at an airport at one of those cities, bypass security checkpoints, board a small hybrid-electric plane with luggage in hand, and be on the ground at your destination in about an hour — all for $25 each way? A company called Zunum Aero hopes to make that a reality, so that future travelers who normally take a car, bus or train for regional trips won’t think twice about flying. The Washington state-based start-up says that since 2013, it has been developing a fleet of hybrid-electric planes that would make those kinds of inexpensive, short-haul flights possible. The company has some heavyweight investor partners, including Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures, subsidiaries of their respective companies. It also faces a number of competitors and obstacles, particularly battery limitations. But if successful, it could significantly change regional air travel, where options have shriveled and costs have crept up in recent decades. “Think of it as Tesla of the air,” said Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures. “[Or] think of it as an electric bus in the air.” Zunum Aero emerged from “stealth mode” on Wednesday to announce its ambitious goals: to be flying routes of up to 700 miles (think Atlanta to Washington, D.C.) by the mid-2020s and then routes of up to 1,000 miles (think Los Angeles to Seattle) by 2030. The start-up also laid out an array of promises: Door-to-door travel times cut in half. Lower operating costs. Airfares that would be 40 to 80 percent lower. All on quiet hybrid aircraft that would produce 80 percent less emissions. Indeed, part of the company name was inspired by “tzunuum,” the Mayan word for the hummingbird, for the bird’s speed and efficiency. “To be perfectly honest, we’ve been wanting to tell the story for four years,” Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar told The Washington Post. “What we’ve been building towards is really exciting and we believe fundamentally is going to change the shape of regional aviation.” Kumar thinks operating costs for the company’s hybrid-electric planes could be 40 to 80 percent lower than for conventional aircraft. A small range-extending generator would be integrated into early planes, kicking in on longer flights where battery power isn’t enough. The eventual goal would be for battery technology to become advanced enough to have planes relying entirely on electricity, eliminating fuel costs altogether, Kumar said. There are several reasons that people rarely choose to fly for short regional trips. Flying often means allotting extra time for getting to the airport, going through security and then boarding. Also, the airline industry’s shift to larger planes and big-city hubs created what Kumar calls a “regional transport gap.” Flights from midsize cities are now often routed through hubs, meaning door-to-door times for those trips are no better than they were 50 years ago, Kumar said. And air options for smaller communities have been dwindling or disappearing, he added. Today, 97 percent of U.S. air traffic comes from 2 percent of the more than 5,000 airports in the country, according to the 2014-2034 FAA Aerospace Forecast. © Courtesy Zunum Aero Zunum Aero’s target regional markets. About 95 percent of trips under 500 miles are taken by car, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Household Travel Survey. For trips between 500 and 750 miles, about 61 percent of travelers drive and 34 percent fly. For trips between 750 and 1,000 miles, a little more than half of travelers fly and 42 percent drive. Kumar and his team think this is where electric-hybrid planes can step in. Whereas a Boeing 737 today seats anywhere from 85 to more than 200 passengers, a Zunum plane would have from 10 to 50 seats. Because the Transportation Security Administration imposes fewer regulations on smaller aircraft, those passengers would likely be able to skip long security lines.Removing luggage check-in options also would save on time on the ground, he said. The resulting trip would feel more like a cross between private corporate air travel and hopping on a bus. Still, the company is not without its competitors and detractors. This year, a Massachusetts-based start-up called Wright Electric announced similar plans to roll out “zero-emissions electric airliners designed to save money and our planet” within a decade. The Y Combinator-backed company, however, told BBC News that it was relying on continued advances in battery technology. “The battery technology is not there yet,” Graham Warwick, technology editor of Aviation Weekly, told the BBC. “It’s projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon.” It remains too early to tell what the commercial aviation industry will look like by the mid-2020s and whether one-way fares in the $25 range would be feasible then. Even now, it is not unheard of for low-cost carriers such as Frontier or Spirit to offer double-digit airfares on domestic routes. That hasn’t stopped others from diving into hybrid-electric aerospace projects. Airbus has also been developing its “E-Fan” hybrid electric aircraft since 2014, and in 2015 it became the first all-electric twin-engine plane to cross the English Channel. Though the “E-Fan” has only two seats, Airbus is hoping the technology will lead to a regional airliner or helicopter. Plans for helicopter-esque electric “VTOL” (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft have also been emerging from Silicon Valley lately. The Verge’s Andrew J. Hawkins reported that Uber, Airbus, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and Google co-founder Larry Page are all working on developing their own VTOLs. “Because nothing says ‘I’m very rich and I hate traffic’ like a flying car project,” Hawkins wrote for the technology site. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX said it was confident in investing in Zunum Aero “because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space.” Simi compared the push for hybrid-electric planes to the airline industry’s advancement from strictly propeller planes to jet aircraft. “It’s that type of transformation,” Simi said. “We’re very excited about where this is going. It’s still very early, of course. We now have a seat at the table at what we believe is going to be an amazing change.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Matthew hit Hilton Head as a Category 2 storm in the early morning hours of Oct. 8, 2016.

Jay Karr jkarr@islandpacket.com 1 of 3 i By Jeff Shain jshain@islandpacket.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The countdown was on, as it is at any PGA Tour stop in the final days before the players arrive. Digital scoreboards were being moved into place at Harbour Town Golf Links. Final landscaping touchups were in progress, not to mention a general collecting of twigs that had fallen during overnight storms. Near the clubhouse, workers began constructing a welcome arch. Tree limbs danced in the breeze as PGA Tour agronomist Bland Cooper surveyed the swath of green in front of him. “If this was your first time coming to Harbour Town, you really would never know anything happened last fall,” Cooper said. “The way they restored the areas that were impacted, it’s almost seamless.” Seamless is good. Listen closely, though, and one also can make out the slow thump-thump-thump of a pile driver out in the marina. Six months after Hurricane Matthew, the RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing returns to the national sporting stage next week. It’s a time to showcase the iconic Harbour Town lighthouse and Calibogue Sound, a picturesque place where ocean meets fairway. This one takes added importance, though, because it’s the most direct platform for Hilton Head Island to show things are OK again. “In that regard, I’d say yes,” said Cary Corbitt, vice president of sports and operations for Sea Pines Resort. “If there was any doubt out there, then I think that will take it out of everybody’s minds — we’re fully recovered and back in business.” Not perfect, mind you. There may not be as many yachts when CBS cameras turn toward the marina. And anyone driving the William Hilton Parkway can’t avoid the sight of hurricane debris piles still awaiting removal. Spectator parking, in fact, had to be relocated because Honey Horn remains a debris staging area. Steve Wilmot, now in his fourth decade as tournament director, suggested this year brings a little different anticipation. “I think the community’s ready,” Wilmot said. “They’re ready to have a great week and have fun.” If there was any doubt out there, then I think that will take it out of everybody’s minds — we’re fully recovered and back in business. Cary Corbitt, Sea Pines Resort VP of sports and operations Arnold Palmer’s victory in the inaugural Heritage Classic is credited with getting Hilton Head Island into the public consciousness. The 2011 edition, bridging an anxious gap between title sponsors, also stands high in importance. Next week’s 49th edition also might be considered on that level. “I’d say without question, it is,” Wilmot said. “It (has been) something of a rallying cry — come April 1st, we want to make sure we’re up so when the cameras go on and the world’s watching, Hilton Head’s better than ever.” The ability of sports — be it teams or events — to unite a community in the aftermath of disaster or tragedy is well documented. The Miami Hurricanes’ football dominance in the 1980s gets credit with helping ease racial tensions in a city torn by riots in 1980. U.S. Olympic hockey’s “Miracle on Ice” in 1980 provided a nationwide lift from economic woes and the Iran hostage crisis. “Boston Strong” became the city’s cry after two pipe bombs ripped through the Boston Marathon’s finish area in 2013. The Red Sox fully embraced the mantra, bringing a World Series title to the city six months later. In golf, the 2006 Zurich Classic was the first major sporting event in the New Orleans area after Hurricane Katrina blitzed through. The tournament needed a new/old locale that year, briefly returning to English Turn Golf & Country Club when the TPC Louisiana wasn’t ready. Several of the PGA Tour’s top names, who typically didn’t play the event, put it on their calendar as a way to lend their support. “For New Orleans, it gave folks the enthusiasm to get back to normal,” said former Zurich tournament chief John Subers. “Like every PGA Tour event that comes to town, it’s a happening. It’s the volunteers, the economic boom around it. The community rallies around it.” Hurricane Matthew’s damage doesn’t compare, of course. But Wilmot does recall a similar rally of spirit when the Heritage faced a different sort of crisis six years ago. Unable to find a sponsor to replace the departed Verizon, the 2011 edition was financed out of the Heritage Classic Foundation’s emergency reserves. That’s essentially a one-time option, signifying dire straits. “Rickie Fowler played that year; Camilo Villegas played that year,” Wilmot said. “They changed their schedules to be here and show their support. “That was worse than this past year,” Wilmot said. “When that last putt sunk, I really didn’t know (if we’d be back). But we had such a great broadcast, and the media put such a positive spin on the idea that this can’t be the last tournament.” Two months later, Royal Bank of Canada and Boeing joined forces to save the Heritage. Ironically, perhaps, both RBC and Boeing inked long-term extensions just months before Matthew hit the Eastern seaboard. The tournament now has sponsorship peace through 2023, the longest stretch in its history. We get them here, but there’s a lot more that happens that the community truly benefits from. RBC Heritage tournament director Steve Wilmot With Matthew, it’s been about restoring an island that relies on tourism and loves its golf. The RBC Heritage is the state’s largest annual sporting event, with a 2014 study showing the event added more than $96 million to the local economy. “All the dine-arounds, the golf courses, all the other stuff,” Wilmot said. “They might spend X amount of dollars with us, but they’re spending A-B-C-D with others —accommodations, food and beverage, catering, other things. “We get them here, but there’s a lot more that happens that the community truly benefits from.” All that was temporarily in doubt after Matthew roared through Oct. 8. Initial reports and photos from Sea Pines raised concerns about how long Harbour Town would need to recover. “There were rumors that we weren’t going to play this year; the damage was that bad,” recalled Luke Donald, four times a runner-up at Harbour Town. “It’s a tough thing to go through, I’m sure. But I hear they’ve done a great job in cleaning it up.” Wilmot emphasized that not playing “was never an option.” As the cleanup project began to unfold, early discouragement gave way to pragmatism. All three Sea Pines courses were open again within four weeks, with a final count of 268 trees fallen at Harbour Town. Later, Sea Pines imported nearly two dozen trees to replace key losses deemed strategic to the way Harbour Town plays. Other parts of the island needed more time, but slowly the rhythms of life have returned close to normal. “The fortunate thing is that it happened when it did,” Wilmot said. “If we were a January event, who knows? There’s never a good time for (a disaster), but it gave us a good, solid six months to get after it.” Ticket sales, he said, have been ahead of the curve since the tournament’s initial pre-holiday sale. At least one hospitality area has sold out. And now it’s time to pull back the curtain. For all the marketing that Sea Pines, Hilton Head Island and the region have done, there’s nothing like a television audience looking in live. “Yes, something happened, and it needs to be told,” Wilmot said. “People do need to know that a hurricane happened here. But we’ve wanted to make a point here at the foundation not to dwell on it. We’re moving onward. “Maybe this is the exclamation point that we’re back — not that we ever went anywhere.” Jeff Shain: 843-706-8123, @jeffshain Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story State Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:18 How do you spot card skimmers on ATMs?

At a special ceremony, the aircraft that served the Indian Navy for over 29 years and has flown over 30,000 hours, was given a ceremonial salute by two water cannons and was received on the tarmac by Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu, Commander-in-Chief of Eastern Naval Command Vice-Admiral H.C.S. Bisht and Union Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju among other dignitaries. Submarine hunter Comparing the aircraft to the famed Second World War Boeing B-17, which was then nicknamed the ‘Flying Fortress,’ Vice-Admiral Bisht said, “This was the most dreaded aircraft by the NATO during the Cold War period. It has the capability to detect and destroy enemy submarines moving deep and stealthily in the ocean. It was the submarine hunter, including the nuclear propelled ones.” “It was not only the fastest turbo-prop aircraft with a maximum flying speed crossing 800 kmph, it was the only military plane with contra turbo-prop, could cruise smoothly at a height of 10 km and was one among the heaviest aircraft, fully loaded. Only the INS Rajali airstrip was designed to handle this aircraft with full payload,” said Commander Yogendra Mair, who flew the aircraft on its last journey. The aircraft will be given to the Andhra Pradesh government to be converted into a museum and kept on the Beach Road close to the Submarine Kursura in Visakhaptnam. “The museum should be ready by June. The location has been identified and we have asked Andhra University to part with some land as the wing span might encroach upon their land on the Beach Road, and it has been agreed upon,” said Mr. Naidu. “The fixed wing aircraft will be dismantled into 55 pieces and will be carried to the Beach Road and reassembled,” said N. Srikanth, Principal Secretary of Tourism, Andhra Pradesh.

In a feat of military history, the last of the Indian Navy's cold war-era submarine-hunting planes, a Tupolev-142M long range maritime patrol aircraft, is slated to be towed through the city to rest near an a cold war-era Foxtrot-class submarine. The submarine, that used to be the INS Kursura, is a museum. The plane will also be converted into one. The Tupolev landed at the Indian Naval Air Station (INAS) Dega in Visakhapatnam on Saturday morning. It was received by, among others, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh state, Chandrababu Naidu. It was flown by the six-man crew capable of flying it from INAS Rajali, Arakonnam, Tamil Nadu. The rest of the crew have converted to or are in training to fly the modern US (Boeing)-origin P8I surveillance aircraft. In a sense the change-over of the squadron from the Tupolevs to the Boeings signify more than a technology-shift. The shift may be marking strategic and diplomatic moves. The TU-142M that landed in INAS (Indian Naval Air Station) Dega, Visakhapatnam. Photo procured by Sujan Dutta Andhra chief minister Naidu has a history of offering to host military platforms that have been rendered out of service. It is a chequered history, one that is still riling the Indian Navy. He had offered to anchor the de-commissioned aircraft carrier, Viraat, off Vizag. He proposed to use it as a museum/tourist resort. But the one-time payment of Rs 1,000 crore that would be the cost of towing and refurbishing the flat-top has put off possible suitors. Even the UK, from whom India had bought the ship, has looked the other way. The Viraat used to be the HMS Hermes in the service of the Royal Navy. She was the flagship in the 1982 Falklands war in her majesty's service. It was sold to India in 1986 and at the time of its de-commissioning last month, it was the oldest aircraft carrier in the world. The Tupolevs, also decommissioned last month, have met with a kinder fate in a season when exhibiting military hardware is gelling with exhibitionist nationalism. The cost of maintaining the Tupolev would be the price of its air-conditioning. The plane that landed at the INAS Dega on Saturday will have its wings, with contra-rotating propellers, cut. The wingspan is 50 metres. If the wings are not cut it would mow down half of Visakhapatnam. The Kursura that is a submarine museum on Beach Road, Visakhapathnam. Photo procured by Sujan Dutta Then the 53-metre long fuselage will be towed through the city to the Ramakrishna beach. The wings would be welded back. And the hunter and the hunted would in all likelihood face each other, should the Centre approve the Andhra government's proposal. On the west coast, however, the 28,000-tonne Viraat continues to rust and rot and occupy a precious berth in the Bombay naval dockyards. A carrier before it, the Vikrant, was also proposed to be turned into a museum by the Maharashtra government. The government could not afford the idea. Then the carrier was taken to Alang, the ship-breaking town on the coast of Gujarat, and cut-up. Its steel was bought by an automobile company that launched a two-wheeler with the name of the warship. It would be patriotic to ride the bike, the company claimed. The Indian Navy does not want the same fate for the Viraat. But it may be left with no choice. Funnily, what sails does not have wings. What has wings sails through. #Andhra pradesh#Newstracker#United kingdom#Viraat#Visakhapatnam Published Date: Apr 08, 2017 07:16 pm | Updated Date: Apr 08, 2017 08:08 pm Also See Tirumala Tirupati temple board says no to VIP recommendation letters during summer weekends BJP likely to go solo in 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Telangana Hyderabadi Biryani declared India's national dish: Foodies, rejoice!

Lightsabers — the favoured weapon of the Jedi in Star Wars films — will remain in the fictional realm for now, but after decades of development, laser weapons are now here and are being deployed on military vehicles and planes. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon — all the big defence players — are developing prototypes for the Pentagon. The Navy has since 2014 been testing a 30-kilowatt laser on one of its warships, the USS Ponce. Lockheed Martin has just announced a 60-kilowatt laser weapon that soon will be installed on an army truck for operational testing against mortars and small drones. US Navy deploys new laser weapon in Persian Gulf: Official The weapon can take out a drone from a distance of about 500 yards by keeping its beam locked onto the target for a few seconds, Jim Murdoch, an international business development director at Lockheed apprised reporters. But unlike in the movies, the laser beam is invisible to the naked eye. By focusing the beam onto a target, the technology rapidly heats the inside of an incoming mortar round, causing it to explode mid-air. An impressive feat considering the round is moving at hundreds of miles per hour. The laser weapon can also pierce the outer skin of a drone, taking out key circuits and making it crash. For the moment, the lasers being tested are of about this same power. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, sees that relatively small output increasing rapidly. Within just a few years, he expects far more powerful prototypes of more than 150 kilowatts. Such a laser could knock out a missile sideways on, where it is most vulnerable. He said special operations forces want to test such a system by 2020 on an AC-130 gunship that specialises in ground support for troops. And within six to eight years, US forces could begin using laser systems of more than 300 kilowatts, he added. That degree of power could knock out an incoming missile head-on. Eventually, reality will increasingly catch up with fiction. The US military is also weighing the possibility of mounting lasers on drones flying at very high altitudes, making them capable of shooting down ballistic missiles shortly after launch. Another bonus for the military from lasers is the promise of seemingly unending and cheap firepower. Unlike conventional canons that need shells, laser canons are limited only by the amount of electricity that can be generated. Gunzinger deems lasers as especially promising on warplanes, which could potentially get an unlimited reservoir of firepower to defend against adversaries’ missiles. “An aircraft doesn’t have to return to the base to upload more weapons. It could refuel and continue to operate with its nearly unlimited magazine,” he said. But before laser technology can be integrated into combat planes, it must first be shrunk in size. Currently engineers are running into physical limitations on how much portable power can be produced and ways of cooling the technology. Lockheed wants to increase the power of its truck-mounted laser. “For a vehicle like this, there will be some engineering limits,” said Murdoch. “We will run out of space… that’s the kind of challenge we are working.” Read more: Laser weapons , Latest , US military Read full story Recommended Stories Weapon cache seized in Shahdara A large cache of illegal weapons, including shotguns and assault rifles, was seized in a raid in Shahdara Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Congress is cautious. Lawmakers recall a lengthy program that cost more than $5 billion in which a Boeing 747 was retrofitted to carry a laser gun supposedly capable of shooting down enemy missiles. The program was scrapped in 2012 over concerns it could never be operationally viable.

Lightsabers -- the favored weapon of the Jedi in "Star Wars" films -- will remain in the fictional realm for now, but after decades of development, laser weapons are now here and are being deployed on military vehicles and planes. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon -- all the big defense players -- are developing prototypes for the Pentagon. The Navy has since 2014 been testing a 30-kilowatt laser on one of its warships, the USS Ponce. Lockheed Martin has just announced a 60-kilowatt laser weapon that soon will be installed on an Army truck for operational testing against mortars and small drones. The weapon can take out a drone from a distance of about 500 yards (meters) by keeping its beam locked onto the target for a few seconds, Jim Murdoch, an international business development director at Lockheed, told reporters this week. But unlike in the movies, the laser beam is invisible to the naked eye. By focusing the beam onto a target, the technology rapidly heats the inside of an incoming mortar round, causing it to explode mid-air. An impressive feat considering the round is moving at hundreds of miles per hour. The laser weapon can also pierce the outer skin of a drone, taking out key circuits and making it crash. For the moment, the lasers being tested are all of about this same power. - Defeating a missile - Unlike conventional canons that need shells, laser canons are limited only by the amount of electricity that can be generated Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, sees that relatively small output increasing rapidly. Within just a few years, he expects far more powerful prototypes of more than 150 kilowatts. Such a laser could knock out a missile sideways on, where it is most vulnerable. He said special operations forces want to test such a system by 2020 on an AC-130 gunship that specializes in ground support for troops. And within six to eight years, US forces could begin using laser systems of more than 300 kilowatts, he added. That degree of power could knock out an incoming missile head-on. Eventually, reality will increasingly catch up with fiction. The US military is also weighing the possibility of mounting lasers on drones flying at very high altitudes, making them capable of shooting down ballistic missiles shortly after launch. Another bonus for the military from lasers is the promise of seemingly unending and cheap firepower. Unlike conventional canons that need shells, laser canons are limited only by the amount of electricity that can be generated. Gunzinger deems lasers as especially promising on warplanes, which could potentially get an unlimited reservoir of firepower to defend against adversaries' missiles. "An aircraft doesn't have to return to base to upload more weapons. It could refuel and continue to operate with its nearly unlimited magazine," he said. - Physical constraints - But before laser technology can be integrated into combat planes, it must first be shrunk in size. Currently engineers are running into physical limitations on how much portable power can be produced and ways of cooling the technology. Lockheed wants to increase the power of its truck-mounted laser. "For a vehicle like this, there will be some engineering limits," said Murdoch. "We will run out of space ... that's the kind of challenge we are working." But industry reps and military officials say there's only one thing stopping lasers from garnering widespread operational use: government funding. Congress is cautious. Lawmakers recall a lengthy program that cost more than $5 billion in which a Boeing 747 was retrofitted to carry a laser gun supposedly capable of shooting down enemy missiles. The program was scrapped in 2012 over concerns it could never be operationally viable. The laser beam used in that technology was generated by chemicals so was not strong enough to take out a missile.

Just like they have been telling me all along. Shock, dismay, outrage and that awful stench of betrayal started beating an unholy tattoo inside my head when I heard the news. How could he do it, launch such a massive unprovoked attack on Syria's Shayrat airbase? Anyone with half a brain can tell the latest Syrian chemical weapons story is yet another flag. What about the motive? Cui bono? Where is the proof? Where is the investigation? The UN Security Council drama? Is Trump really batshit crazy after all? Here is the guy, the president of the US no less, who just last week said getting rid of Assad is not the priority. Prominent members of his cabinet and his UN ambassador (who seems certifiably batshit crazy; where does America find an endless supply of such women?!) said the same. And now big, tough, blustering alfa male Trump is sobbing at pictures of dead Syrian babies? Asking the almighty for wisdom like Bush having his communion with god? Letting loose with his own shock and awe on a country that is already reeling from a five-year war? What about his campaign promises on non-intervention, making lovey-dovey with Russia? This Putin puppet just fired the first shot of WW III? - Advertisement - What a crying shame. I feel such a fool. I should have learnt from Obama's great betrayal. I should have listened to my friends and critics who have been saying all along Trump is the worst thing to have happened to humanity. These thoughts rattled around inside my head all of yesterday. Before I fell off to sleep, the little monkey on my shoulder started chattering. Something about the story being too pat, off-kilter. I was too groggy to deal with it at 2 am in the morning. I clamped my hand over the monkey's mouth and drifted off. When I woke up, the monkey was jumping up and down at the foot of my bed, jabbering like nobody's business. After chucking the pillow at it, I got myself a mug of coffee, fired up my computer and went a-Googling. After an hour, I sat back and shook my head. Could it be so? Is Trump capable of such subterfuge? Not batshit crazy but crazy like a fox as some people have been claiming? I honestly don't know. It's all speculation. But the 'evidence', such as it is, points at something more than the story that has everyone in a tizzy. Before I set it out here, a few qualifications are in order. No, I am not a Trump supporter or apologist. That's a terrible cross to bear these days. I am a Trump hoping against hope hoper, praying he meant it when he said he won't get the US into unnecessary wars, especially a nuclear war with Russia. I confess that hope hangs on a slender thread. Heck, I am not even an American. I have no skin in the game, as some folks have been telling me off politely. Well, no skin in the game doesn't mean no head on the block. I have this awful crick in my neck scanning skyward for months, wondering when I may get turned into air pollution for poking my nose where it doesn't belong. Anyhow, here's my second take on the Syria missile attack: - Advertisement - The US fired 59 Tomahawk missiles. Only 23 of them landed on the Syrian airbase, an awful hit rate of just 40% for a supposedly super-sophisticated tried and tested guided weapon that has been around since the 1970s. Photographs of the damage inflicted by these missiles are underwhelming. Each missile weighs 1,300-1,600 kg and carries a 450 kg explosives payload. Yet, the 23 that struck the airbase destroyed a handful of stationary aircraft, some hangars and structures, and a canteen! They didn't put the runways out of operation, which should have been their main objective. In fact, Syrian and Russian planes are supposedly back in operation already from the 'destroyed' airbase. Tomahawks were the wrong choice to put an airbase out of commission. That needs bunker bursting ordnance like the JDAM which can turn runways into blobjelly. Those monster bombs can't be fired from ships, they have to be dropped by planes flying overhead. Obviously, the US didn't want to chance sending its warplanes against Russian S-300 and S-400 missile shields. The US war planners are not stupid. They knew this cruise missile strike was for effect. For all we know, they might have even been tamped down. Not exactly fizzles but perhaps with smaller than normal payloads intended to limit the blast radius. A ready reason has been stated already. They didn't want to hit the sarin gas stored at the air base. This has the twin advantage of reinforcing the sarin story and explaining away the low key damage. In spite of the surprise blitzkrieg claim, a two-hour warning was given to Russia (and to most everyone including Uncle Bob). The Russians would have immediately passed it on to the Syrians. There was plenty of time for all the airbase personnel to get out of the way before the missiles arrived. The handful of casualties -- six dead, about a dozen wounded -- were either faked or, fittingly, captured ISIS prisoners. Just think about that, 23 cruise missiles hitting the target with only six dead, unremarkable damage to a few non-operational planes, some peripheral hits to the infrastructure. The critical parts are still standing and the airbase is back in action within 24 hours. Bush's shock and awe team must be cringing. Now here's the thing. What happened to the remaining 36 missiles that didn't reach the target? That's a very large number of missiles to go AWOL. Even if they lacked pinpoint accuracy, one would imagine they landed somewhere in the vicinity of the airbase, say within a 2 km radius. Even that's a stretch considering the Tomahawk is touted as a precision weapon. So where did they all vanish? Fall into the sea, so many of them? Exploded in mid air? The most plausible explanations are: (a) they were never fired, (b) they were dummies that dived into the sea without an explosion and (c) they were taken out by the Russian S-300/S-400 systems. Let's look at the political impact of this drama. Above all, it gets Trump off the hook, at least temporarily, with the neocon dogs of war. It silences Hillary and her warmongering 'liberals'. It lines up the Republican rebels behind Trump -- even Darth McCain is cheering. It gets the MSM do a 180 and start shouting hallelujahs. It reassures UK, Europe and other lapdogs the US still got cojones and not become suddenly gender-challenged. It gets Trump's popularity rating ticking upward for a change, or at least halts the plunge. It sends oil prices up, benefiting all oil producers, including Russia. It sends the stocks of military contractors like Boeing and Raytheon shooting up. What is there to complain about? At $1.5 million apiece, the total cost of the Tomahawks fired comes to $88.5 million. Triple that to cover other mission costs, we are looking at a mealy $250 million, peanuts in these days of trillion dollar bailouts to crony banks. For this trifling price, Trump's teetering presidency is suddenly on firmer foot. Russia does its indignant act and makes some token gestures like suspending flight information sharing, thumping the table at the UN and issuing some grim warnings. The 'free world' heaves a sigh of relief its captain is back at the helm. A not too subtle message is passed on to China about North Korea. China, already clued in by Russia, goes through its own little protest dance and sits tight. Possible? With Russian Maskirovka and the Deep State faction supporting Trump working together, anything is possible. So did Trump and Putin plan this? Was all the news about civil war within the White House a fake? We may never know. But if it turns out true, this could be the first ever fake false flag the US pulled. As I said, it's all speculation. And I am not the only one with a twitching nose.

Usually to frame someone for a crime they did not commit and use it as an excuse to get aggressive with them. But is there such a thing as a false flag for a good purpose? Have we just witnessed one? This is a speculative scenario on the motives behind Trump's missile attack and its surprisingly low key impact on the target.

This is likely meant to cajole him into accepting the establishment goal of taking over as much of Syria as possible for the usual reasons. I see it more likely that other forces (the usual suspects) were behind it and then Trump and his people were told that it would be really good for his popularity problems if he responded right away with some muscle. If they didn't coordinate with the Russians than they feared the Russians would have used their vaunted missile defense systems which they feared would have embarrassed the US military mightily. What happened to the rest of the missiles? The numbers may have been inflated place or purposely or otherwise misfired. That isn't important anyways. Some people in the media are speculating that this whole thing from the gas to the bombing was a plot between the Russians, Assad, and Trump to create a distraction. That seems foolish. The Russians have said this was all about trying to distract from the US killing of so many civilians in Mosul and elsewhere, and also for political purposes. So that makes me think the Russians were not involved except for being told right before the attack. Reporters have pointed out that due to the lack of protective gear and other problematic issues by those supposedly treating the victims, makes the whole thing looks staged.

First, the chemical weapons attack. As you rightly observe, the lack of protective gear by the rescuers suggests the whole thing was staged, including pictures of dead children. Not the first time for the Oscar laureate White Helmets. Second, the missile attack. Again, very low (possibly no) casualties and insignificant damage to the airbase. Assuming these are two parts of the same story, we might be looking at an elaborate charade. It couldn't be pulled off without Russian collaboration. If there was such a collaboration, anything Russia says, including references to Mosul, would be for effect, wouldn't it? Makes their reaction more credible. As to whether Trump can trust those clued in to not rat on him later, we just have to wait and see. After all, the US establishment is not just good, but very good, at keeping secrets.

The chances of everything coming out are 100%, regardless of the JFK conspiracy since I imagine most everyone involved in that were eliminated quickly to keep such a thing from happening. This operation would require many moving parts located in various countries from various ethnicities some of whom who would no doubt be looking for a payday in selling information, or a chance to take down Trump, or Putin, or anybody else involved - the reality of being in fear of that for the rest of their lives by those involved at all levels - seems to be a deal breaker for most if not all people. You would have to be supremely reckless or dumb. Something Russia is not. Russian participation is not something that is needed anyways. Trump's people in some government agency or whomever and wherever plotted this, do not need Russian or Syrian cooperation, all they need is the deed to be done and then start blaming Assad. By calling up Russia a few hours before and telling them what they will do, then of course Russia looking at this strategically would not try and stop them, or if they did by messing with the guidance systems of those missing Toms which they have the capability to do, then that would be enough for them. They then can play wait and see if this whole thing was only for public relations and not a change of policy on Syria.

Trump would jump at any opportunity to make missiles fly. He didn't need a somehow secret conspiracy with Putin to see a real opportunity the next time it would arise. And as you can see if you look, the media and elite are right behind him, against the Russians. You finally need to accept that if you're going to allow yourself to see the obvious. Trump is extremely dangerous. He's always been extremely dangerous. He doesn't need the Russians to be extremely dangerous. Syria had nothing to gain in the gas attack. Russia could hardly prevail on Syria to do such a thing just to boost Trump's approval rating -- it would be ridiculous for them to even suggest it. What: "You either launch a gas attack and likely bring the US fully into the war so we can help Trump's numbers, or we'll stop supporting you!" The rebels had everything to gain. They're going to lose the war, and soon, unless they can get the US to jump in. Look at the politicians and the media refusing to even consider the obvious. They don't need no stinkin evidence. They don't want no stinkin evidence. This is an opportunity to turn the war around, and get rid of a government that is resisting the empire. It's simple, it's obvious, for anyone who is willing to see the simple and obvious.

For comparison, it's relatively easy, and much more lucrative, to nail down God's plan for Hannity - well, er... you know. (Mistakes are the only steaks I can afford anymore.) In my view, virtually all the players see the necessity of continuing the war. Mr. Rothschild, somewhere in the Dark Room, may be calling the shots. Only 23 of 59 Tomahawk Missiles got through to target, but all will have to be replaced. General Dynamics (now Boeing Defense) originally produced the Tomahawk Missile that is currently being produced by Raytheon/McDonnell Douglas. They represent several of the Stars on our Flag.

In the twilight it was hard to tell but it appears it has orange head hair as I caught a glimpse of an organ grinder named Rothschild. More on this in a moment..... For those paying attention I have tried to direct them to several sites where the consensus was a battle between Oligarchs and their organizations. There was a theme running through this with out actually naming names of the two opposing groups. This battle is/was between the group in power and a separation from them of the other group. It is believed that the one group would sacrifice America for Empire and the other would sacrifice the Empire for "Making America Great" again. The events of the last week has given us a window into this raging battle and the latter group has won despite the confusion. What does this all mean? I am going to do an article on this but it is my desire to break it here in your article. You have shown a keen insight above most in this confusion of missed signals and smoke screens from the (leaked) fall out (false front squabble) between Bannon and the son-in-law Jared Kushner.

I am sure that there are games within games here. I am also reasonably certain that Assad did not gas people. Many rational and informed commentators (clearly seldom from the main stream media) have strongly made this case. For the record, I don't think that Trump is any more evil than his predecessors. They all merit a stretch in purgatory. Moreover, Trump is only one actor in a malevolent play, and not necessarily the most powerful. I was hoping that he might prove to be less evil than his opponent, but results so far are not encouraging.

Just Brilliant, and I hope you are right. I was just toying with something like this as a joke. Putin and his boyfriend Trump cooked it up. But you know, you just might be right. Putin told Trump: "You know this Assad is an a.h. To get a peace deal we need him to go. He won't listen to me, so how about dropping a few Tomahawks down his chimney. Then you an I can carve up Syria. We get to keep our naval base and you get your pipeline. Next we go for Saudi Arabia." Maybe there really is a Putin connection. Maybe Putin did hack the DNC. Maybe Trump does have a man-crush on Putin. If so, then the joke is on the media. They bought it hook, line and sinker. P.S. Love your picture.

See my latest article, waiting to be published: The Death of Truth: the Betrayal........ Your article is on target until the end when you fail to understand that the fake civil war within the government is mirrored by the fake peace overtures to Putin. Putin is now having deep buyer's remorse. He worked with the Deep State (CIA/FBI) to help Trump gain power, and now, as the Deep State celebrates how it cuckolded Putin, it rejoices in yet another new war to fulfill their mission of perpetual an universal war. And Trump has not crossed over to the dark side; he gained power by invoking the dark side, the Big Lie about immigrant criminality and the dangers of refugees, the lies about wanting peace and justice for the working guy. In fact, he was elected by the rich to serve the rich. His promise to be independent because he was self-funding led to him getting 90% of his funding from outside, including billionaires like Adelseon. The average income of the Trump voter was $96,000....for Clinton, $61,000. And so he IS the dark side and could not have crossed over to where he started from. He serves himself an his craving for power by serving his masters, whose craving is to world domination. He is a figurehead who will take credit for success (there have been none) but be blamed and sacrificed when things go wrong (and they have so far gone all wrong.). Those who believed him now must question their own sanity, even as they abandon him and blame the Deep State or Putin or anyone but themselves. They voted for a pathological liar with a deep strain of hostility...and now are shocked! shocked that he is lying and provoking WWIII. The Russians are on the way with their warship; the Pentagon is investigating possible Russian collusion in the absurd claim that Syria dropped chemical weapons the people it has been fighting to liberate. I f*cking told you so....and you called me an idiot, a CIA plot, a Kremlin toll, a Group Entity Troll. But I was f*cking right....so now IS the time for your tears.

I suggest that you look a little closer at the correlation between Trump's appointees and this latest development that has shaken your faith/hope. This latest development is consistent with the choice of Mad Dog Mattis, for example. I think you and all humanity have skin in this game. Things do not look good.

EngAGE is a nonprofit providing life-enhancing arts, wellness, learning, community building and intergenerational programs and events to thousands of seniors and their families in Southern California. Additionally, Carpenter serves on the board of the National Center for Creative Aging and presented a TED Talk titled, “Thriving as We Age,” at a Southern California affiliate event. His breadth of knowledge and unique perspective on aging will offer dynamism to the day’s scheduled panel discussions and presentations. The full day of educational and engaging sessions will begin with welcome remarks from Monica Lounsbery, dean of the College of Health & Human Services at Long Beach State University and SCAN CEO Chris Wing. Both Lounsbery and Wing will describe for attendees their respective organizations’ commitment to supporting community and senior health. They will also set the stage for closer collaboration on various community initiatives, which will be discussed in more depth in the subsequent panel sessions. A video message from Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia will convey the City’s vision to establish Long Beach as a laboratory for best practices supporting senior health and independence. Anne Tumlinson, CEO of Tumlinson Innovations, LLC and founder of Daughterhood, and Dr. Romilla Batra, chief medical officer of SCAN Group, will present “Seniors Today & Communities Reimagined.” In this session, they will review recent research to identify key trends and dynamics that are shaping the future of senior health and independence. Dr. Batra will also discuss how SCAN has spearheaded several innovative programs to align with these trends and better support seniors and their caregivers. Kelly Colopy, director of City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services; Marie Knight, director of City of Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine; and Tara Gruenewald, associate professor of gerontology and interim director of the Center for Successful Aging at Long Beach State University, will present a session titled, “Long Beach: A Laboratory for Senior Best Practices.” In addition to her teaching and research career in the field of aging, Gruenewald is the president of the California Council on Gerontology and Geriatrics and is a fellow of the Gerontological Society of America. Leveraging her distinguished experience and expertise, she will address needed changes in the age structure of today’s society, as well as innovations needed in social, physical, medical and technological environments in Long Beach and beyond. Colopy and Knight combined have more than three decades of experience in public service, and will present the City of Long Beach’s initiatives to create a stronger support system for local seniors. Initiatives discussed will include the delivery of evidence-based classes for seniors, the establishment of a senior coordinator for the public library system, research into the needs of the older adult population and progress on the Older Adult Strategic Plan and the current and evolving programs and resources offered at the City’s six senior centers. Delivering the keynote presentation is John Keisler, director of Economic and Property Development with the City of Long Beach. In this role, Keisler seeks to increase economic opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors in Long Beach. His keynote will discuss how innovation and economic development impacts seniors; the innovation incubators that already exist in Long Beach and new networks that may be established in the future; and how the City of Long Beach plans to better serve seniors through economic development. Participating in a panel discussion titled, “Technology: The Future of Aging,” are Long Beach State University representatives Brian Budzinski, cofounder of the College of Business Administration Incubator, and Dr. Linna Li, assistant professor in the Department of Geography. Budzinski is a structural engineering manager at The Boeing Company, and founded the business incubator along with three colleagues while earning his MBA at Long Beach State University. The incubator serves to foster innovation, as well as inspire and support ideas that provide a positive environmental or social impact on the community. Budzinski will share with attendees details of several incubator initiatives that are staged to help seniors live healthier and more independent lives. Dr. Li’s research includes geographic information science theories and applications in public health and urban development, and she will present implications from her work that can be leveraged to eliminate social isolation and its debilitating impact on seniors. To close out the day, Carpenter and Knight will lead an interactive session to encourage all speakers as well as attendees to share insights and ideas for supporting seniors in today’s society, and in the future. Event hosts SCAN, Long Beach State University and City of Long Beach hope to take away concrete suggestions for strengthening the network of programs and resources available to seniors to help all lead more enriching and empowered lives. “Aging Reimagined will be an expansive and valuable event focused exclusively on the needs of today’s seniors and their caregivers,” said Wing. “Together with our partners at the City of Long Beach and Long Beach State University, we look forward to bringing this constructive information to the community and identifying opportunities to collaborate to improve the lives of our oldest residents.” Attendance at the colloquium is by invitation only. Additional information and key takeaways will be made available to the public following the event. To learn more, please visit rebrand.ly/AgingReimagined.

The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on Friday issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics. The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode. “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of Global Programs at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.” The Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smouldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the safety foundation’s release. On March 21, the US notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the US from 10 Middle Eastern airports — including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo — to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.” The UK followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Security Subcommittee, said in a speech March 29 that the threat was real and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. DHS Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Congress the action may be extended to other airports. However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety, the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires. The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires. While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires. Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said. “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said. Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said. Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said.

By Alan Levin. Added by Agency Staff on 8 April 2017. Saved under World Tweet The US order prohibiting passengers from carrying laptop computers and other electronics into the cabins of some overseas flights is raising concerns about a risk unrelated to terror: the potential for those devices’ lithium-based batteries to catch fire in the baggage hold. The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on Friday issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics. The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode. “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of global programmes at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.” The US Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smouldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. “We coordinated closely with the FAA and provided an information bulletin to the air carriers regarding the appropriate handling of electronics, including lithium batteries,” department of homeland security spokeswoman Jenny Burke said in an e-mailed response to the safety group’s warning. On 21 March, the US notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the US from 10 Middle Eastern airports — including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo — to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items”. The UK followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the house transportation security subcommittee, said on 29 March that the threat was real, and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. Homeland security secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told congress the action may be extended to other airports. However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety: the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires. The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organisation last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing and Airbus advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires. While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires. Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, before gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such close proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said. “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said. Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said. Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 26Now Fitch downgrades SA to junk 13SA is now junk – thanks to Jacob Zuma 8Beware ‘radical economic transformation’: Nyati 5Zuma has ‘done SA great harm’ 5The war on Kodi Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The Education Department and the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that an online financial aid service known as the Data Retrieval Tool will stay offline for the rest of this application season. (John Dunn / Associated Press) By Heidi Mitchell For The Spokesman-Review Twitter Facebook Reddit As the 2017 legislative session unfolds, parents like me are growing increasingly concerned about the future of education in Washington. I am a proud Gonzaga alumna and the mother of a student in public school in Spokane. The fact that we are not adequately or equitably funding education worries me deeply. You might assume that parents in Spokane have widely different concerns from those in Western Washington, but the reality is there are few districts for which the current education funding structure works. Reports on Washington graduation rates have shown us that the current funding structure isn’t working for many rural, urban and lower-income school districts. There are clear winners and losers in how funding is allocated. And it shows. One in 5 Washington students do not graduate from high school. For students of color or from rural or high-poverty communities, that number nearly doubles. Washington is ranked 41st in graduation rates even though we’re ranked in the middle of the pack for funding. The McCleary ruling exposed the need for increased funding for our schools; however, these numbers tell a more complicated story. It isn’t just money that matters. We must also consider what we fund and how we spend our education dollars. To address our alarming graduation rates, we need to go a step further than simply pushing dollars into a system that is clearly letting too many kids fall behind. Rather, we need resources to support programs that meaningfully help our kids advance and grow. It seems clear to me that how we allocate funding is just as important as how much we fund public education. In Spokane, we’ve seen some progress that can serve as an early blueprint. We’ve witnessed effective district and high school leaders channel our dollars toward programs that work. Rogers High School, for example, has raised the bar by expanding course offerings to include many AP classes that prepare students for college. With roughly 78 percent of Rogers students receiving free or reduced-price lunch (indicating they live in low-income households), the school graduated 82 percent of its students in 2016, up from 60 percent in 2010. And in Shadle Park, a Boeing partnership has enabled students to get training for aerospace jobs. Programs like Rogers’ and Shadle Park’s work, but they are too few and far between. Our state doesn’t prioritize investment in proven programs or the students who need them the most. Instead, we have a funding model that ends up rewarding schools in wealthier districts with more highly paid, experienced staff. In reality, all students in our state deserve highly talented leaders and teachers in their public schools. Our current funding structure leaves many schools unable to pay for the basics, forced to pass levies to pay for teacher salaries. And if you can’t afford to hire enough good teachers to fill the classrooms, you’re also not likely to invest time and money in career and technical or dropout prevention programs. The Legislature should listen to Campaign for Student Success, a coalition made up of parents like me and more than 30 organizations. We are calling for the Legislature to address the McCleary decision with two guiding principles. First, we must change our allocation model to ensure that all communities are funded fairly, and second, we must direct more money into the grossly unfunded interventions designed to help students in greatest need. This means expanding support for the Learning Assistance Program, which currently helps fewer than half the kids it is designed to serve; funding interventions to help kids on the verge of dropping out; expanding access to career and technical training for all students; and channeling important resources to rural and high-poverty students. The model that Campaign for Student Success is championing would effectively allocate resources to the Washington students with the greatest needs and ensure that dollars are spent appropriately. So far, we’ve seen some good ideas on both sides of the aisle when it comes to rethinking how we invest in our children. Both the Senate and House put forth admirable budgets that put significant and much-needed funding into the K-12 system – but we can’t stop there. A real solution requires legislators to go one step further to create policies that drive those dollars toward real outcomes for our students. As Democrats and Republicans try to meet in the middle, they cannot lose sight of this important part. But what needs to be clear is this: our legislators can’t leave Olympia until they solve the problem of how to close our achievement gaps, increase graduation rates and help all kids thrive in and beyond their K-12 schooling years. This isn’t simply about money, it’s about our collective future as Washingtonians – a future that depends on every child and every community having the best chance to succeed.

The US Air Force is open to buying rides on previously flown SpaceX rockets to put military satellites into orbit, a move expected to cut launch costs for the Pentagon, the head of the Air Force Space Command said on Thursday. The idea of flying on recycled rockets became a reality a week ago when privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, launched a communications satellite on a Falcon 9 booster that previously put a cargo ship into orbit for NASA. That Falcon main stage had been recovered from a successful return landing on an ocean platform shortly after its maiden flight last April, then was relaunched and salvaged again last Thursday, marking a spaceflight first. “I would be comfortable if we were to fly on a reused booster,” General John "Jay" Raymond told reporters at the US Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. “They’ve proven they can do it. ... It’s going to get us to lower cost.” SpaceX has so far won three launch contracts to fly military and national security satellites - business previously awarded exclusively to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. All those flights will take place on new Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions worth more than $10 billion. After last week's landmark launch, Musk said the company planned to fly about 20 more rockets this year, including the debut blastoff of its new heavy-lift vehicle. Up to six of those missions, including the Falcon Heavy, will use previously flown boosters, he said. Speaking at the symposium on Wednesday, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the cost of refurbishing and reflying the Falcon 9 first stage was "substantially less than half" the cost of manufacturing a new booster - the most expensive part of the rocket. SpaceX’s website lists the cost of a basic Falcon 9 launch at $62 million. SpaceX expects to reduce costs even further. The company’s next goal is to launch and return a rocket and relaunch it within 24 hours. "That’s when we’ll really feel like we’ve got reusability right," Shotwell said. Raymond said the Air Force would need to certify that a used booster could safely deliver its satellites into orbit. "I'm pretty comfortable we'll get comfortable with doing it," Raymond said.

Apr 8, 2017- The decade-old plan of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) to acquire wide-body aircraft to expand its network beyond Asia came closer to fruition on Friday with the signing of the final purchase agreement for two Airbus A330-200 long-range jets from US-based AAR Corp. The $209.6-million contract for two A330-200 marks the largest-ever jet purchase deal in Nepal’s aviation history. The agreement was signed between NAC Managing Director Sugat Ratna Kansakar and Deepak Sharma, president of the International Supply Chain at AAR Corp. Friday’s sales and purchases agreement turned the national flag carrier’s two-decade-old dream of adding wide-body jets to its fleet into a reality. NAC has been attempting to fly the A330 since 1997. The two jets are expected to arrive in Nepal by the second quarter of 2018. “It’s a historic deal,” said Kansakar after signing the agreement. He said both the parties have agreed that the final delivery price of the aircraft would not exceed $109 million each after adjusting inflation. According to Kansakar, Nepal has been known as an expensive destination due to high airfares. “We expect the airfare to come down to some extent once NAC adds wide body jets to its fleet.” The A330 jets ordered by NAC can accommodate up to 280 passengers in a two-class layout. As per the agreement, NAC will release 35 percent of the total aircraft cost as pre-delivery order fee within 28 days of signing the contract. The remaining amount should be paid after delivery of every aircraft. However, the aircraft delivery date has been pushed back slightly due to delay in sending the commitment fee and signing the sales and purchase agreement, officials said. As per the agreement, AAR Corp would supply aircraft by second quarter of 2018, instead of first quarter deadline stipulated earlier. Initially, the supplier had pledged to provide the first aircraft by September 2017.  The national flag carrier has already transferred $1 million as ‘commitment fee’ to AAR Corp. The two aircraft that NAC is planning to buy are owned by HI Fly, an airline based in Lisbon, Portugal. Friday’s agreement has established NAC’s right over the property. The state-owned airline plans to phase out its ageing Boeing 757s and plans to operate all-Airbus aircraft fleet in the near future. The national flag carrier plans to connect Kathmandu with Seoul in South Korea, Tokyo in Japan, Dammam in Saudi Arabia and Sydney in Australia once it adds wide-body aircraft. It has also announced plans to increase flight frequencies to key destinations like Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Doha. A notice inviting proposals from aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft leasing companies and bankers for two Airbus A330-200 aircraft was issued on September 26, 2016. The supplier is required to include the cost of a minimum set of flight and maintenance crews for the duration of at least one year. It also has to include the cost of consumable spares and tools required for day-to-day line maintenance up to the ‘A’ check level for a year.

After all, while some planes can go through gallons of fuel per second, they’re also many times more efficient. As a result, it’s often far worse to drive than it is to fly — plus you spend less time getting there. Despite that, there’s still a lot of gains to make. Just a few years ago we learned that winglets, small pieces of airplane’s wing that stick up vertically, can dramatically cut down on fuel use, for example. But one start-up, Zunum Aero, wants to start bringing hybrid and even fully electric jets into the equation. The Washington-based firm will focus on small regional jets that serve high-traffic, short-haul routes like LA to San Francisco. By cutting out some of the major operating costs and focusing on small aircraft, Zunum will be able to avoid the TSA and FAA regulations that drive up the costs of flights on larger craft. The company is already hard at work on their first plane. By the early 2020s, the company should have a fleet of 10-passenger hybrid-electric jets. And, according to the Verge, but the 2030s Zunum could have all-electric 50-passenger jets. “We’re entering the golden era where we’ll have high-speed links to every community on the backs of quiet, sustainable hybrid-electric technology,” CEO Ashish Kumar told Verge. “And that’s going to happen really fast.” With Kumar’s experience at tech giants like Google and Microsoft, as well as backing from aviation giants like Boeing, Zunum’s future may be a bright one. The hope is that the general business model will help offset the costs of the technology and help bring massive reductions in flight costs for Zunum-supplied routes. Kumar hopes that this will lead to a revolution in high-speed, short-range, cheap and environmentally conscious air travel.

European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti grappled the capsule with the space station's robotic arm at 6:55 am (1055 GMT) as the space station flew over the northern Pacific to the east of Japan, NASA said. "Houston, capture is complete," said NASA astronaut Terry Virts, after high-fiving Cristoforetti in the space station's cupola. "Samantha did a perfect job grappling Dragon." The cargo ship will move closer to the space station and complete its latch-on later Friday. Its contents include an espresso machine, ready-made food packets, and a host of science experiments to study changes in vision, muscle and bones that astronauts experience while in zero gravity. SpaceX launched the cargo ship on Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on its sixth official mission under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for a dozen trips to supply the orbiting space station. The Dragon made history in 2012, when it became the first commercial cargo ship to reach the space station. Previously, only government-built spaceships from Europe, Japan and Russia were able to make that journey. The US-made space shuttles were also big enough to carry cargo along with astronauts, before the program was retired in 2011. The Dragon was designed, however, to carry astronauts, and the California-based company headed by Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk is working on upgrades that will allow the first crew flight to take place in the next few years. Boeing is also working on a spaceship to ferry astronauts to space, called the CST-100, which is scheduled for its first manned flight in 2017. Until then, the world's astronauts must rely on Russia's Soyuz capsules for transport to the research outpost.
