The airline expects the Boeing Max aircraft to help save about 20% in fuel costs. New Delhi: Budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd on Friday said it had placed an order to purchase 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, valued at $11 billion, from Boeing Co., in a deal that would help the airline expand operations and result in fuel-cost savings. “This order is a great step for creating a strong foundation for SpiceJet,” airline chairman Ajay Singh said on Friday. Besides the 100 aircraft, SpiceJet has an option to buy 50 more 737 Max planes that it can convert into a firm order later. Taken with a previous order for 55 aircraft, SpiceJet’s total order could rise to 205 planes. Of these, 155 will be delivered to the airline between 2018 and 2024. More aeroplanes would be leased this year to expand SpiceJet’s presence in the country, Singh said, adding that the November-December quarter had been profitable for the airline in spite of the demonetization shock. The airline expects the fuel-efficient Max aircraft to help it save about 20% in fuel costs. SpiceJet has included a clause in the deal that allows it to convert the Max order into wide-bodied planes that can fly to Europe and beyond in future. SpiceJet is also opening a pilot training facility in Delhi on which work has already started, Singh said. “The deal was signed on New Year’s eve,” said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president (sales), Asia-Pacific and India, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We couldn’t have asked for more to end the year.” Singh took over SpiceJet in December 2014, when the airline was facing the possibility of a shutdown due to a massive cash crunch. The airline, Singh said, has made a profit of Rs1 crore on average in the last 680 days, compared with a loss of Rs3 crore a day during the 365 days before that. Helped by a supportive government which did not want to see another airline grounded after Kingfisher Airlines Ltd and a record crash in fuel prices--which account for over 40% of the costs of an airline--Singh managed to steer SpiceJet from a market share of around 7% to 13% currently. To be sure, almost all airlines, including Air India Ltd, posted profits during 2015-16. SpiceJet shares rose 2.5% on the BSE on Friday to end at Rs65.50 apiece on a day when the benchmark 30-share Sensex dropped 0.03% to end at 27,238.06 points. Shares of rival Jet Airways dropped 0.12% to end at Rs390.65, while those of IndiGo fell 0.16% to end at Rs874.90 apiece.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) has begun offering airlines a stretched version of its new 737 MAX narrow-body aircraft, according to a report by CNN Money on Thursday. Boeing has said it is talking with customers about adding the bigger plane to its 737 MAX family, which boasts greater fuel efficiency than current-generation 737s. The first 737 MAX is due to enter service this year. The new plane, known as the 737 MAX 10X, would help Boeing head off the runaway sales of Airbus' A321neo, which can carry more passengers and fly farther than the 737 MAX 9. Plane makers typically line up orders from airlines before deciding whether to formally undertake building a new aircraft. Boeing declined to confirm the CNN Money report, which cited three unnamed sources as saying Boeing's board had approved the decision to sell the plane late last year. "We are continuing to work through the business case and talk to customers about a potential 737 MAX 10X," the Chicago-based plane maker said in a statement on Thursday. "Once this process is successfully completed, we will be in a position to share more details."

The comments from one of the industry's toughest buyers reflect the stakes involved in meeting manufacturing targets for large aerospace industry orders after a series of costly delays. Qatar Airways remains in talks with CFM International about supplying engines for an upgraded order for Airbus Group's A321neo medium-haul jets, which it expects to finalise "soon", Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told Reuters. The carrier has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by delayed engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, and plans to swap the overall aircraft order, which originally covered 50 jets, to the larger A321neo. CFM, owned by General Electric and France's Safran , competes with Pratt & Whitney to power Airbus' medium-haul jets. Al Baker acknowledged Qatar had received competitive launch prices when it originally ordered Pratt & Whitney engines, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees. "It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance," he said in an interview. Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, in which it aims to buy 49 percent. Qatar is also one of the launch customers for the newest Boeing long-haul jet, the 777-9, formerly code-named 777-9X. Boeing plans to deliver the 406-seat jet from 2020, but aviation news site FlightGlobal reported last year it could advance deliveries to late 2019 due to spare cushion in the development schedule. "We have already told Boeing that as they are bringing ahead the (777-)9X deliveries, we would be interested. The 777-9X programme is ahead of schedule and we have no problem if they want to bring our deliveries ahead," Al Baker said. A Boeing spokesman said: "Development of the 777X programme is progressing to plan and we will deliver to the schedule we committed to our airline customers." FUEL SURCHARGES Al Baker was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, the airline's third such facility abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai. It is also building lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and negotiating space in seven other airports. The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity. Qatar Airways plans to unveil a new premium cabin in March and is investing an unspecified amount to attract passengers "with the right yield," Al Baker said. But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda. "(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up," he said. "Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly." Oil prices have risen 20 percent in three months. Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. The carrier plans to serve Nice five times per week from July and expects to announce a similar service to Lyon soon. It also continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added.

 Airbus rallies late to take sales crown from Boeing Benjamin Zhang Jan. 12, 2017, 4:32 PM 1,408 facebook linkedin twitter email print Airbus A350-1000 test flight.Airbus Airbus' and Boeing's fight for supremacy of the skies continue into 2016. The two titans of the aviation industry have been going head-to-head with one another every year for the past two decades. Both airplane makers posted solid numbers during the year, but Airbus rallied late to take the sales crown from Boeing with 731 net orders to Boeing's 668. The Toulouse, France-based company booked an incredible 321 net orders in the month of December to take the lead. "We delivered on our objectives in a challenging environment, proving our ramp-up readiness for the future," Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Brégier. "I salute all our teams on this outstanding achievement." As a result, Airbus boasts a backlog of 6,874 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion. However, all was not lost for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The Seattle-based airplane maker delivered 748 planes to its customers during 2016 — 60 more than Airbus. In addition, Boeing still boasts a healthy backlog of 5,715 planes. Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.Boeing As expected the bulk of Airbus and Boeing's orders were for their respective workhorse A320-family and 737-Series narrow body jets. Twin-engine wide-body jets such as the Airbus A330, A350 along with the Boeing 777 and 787 remain popular. However, both manufacturers continue to struggle finding new buyers for its large jumbo jets. Even with low fuel prices, Airbus ended 2016 with zero net orders for the A380 superjumbo. On the other hand, Boeing's venerable 747 jumbo jet had a banner year with 17 net orders — the most in a decade for the program. Sadly, the 747's new orders are driven by demand for the plane's ability to carry cargo rather than passengers. Unfortunately, even with the 747's stellar year, its order backlog is down to just 28 planes.  SEE ALSO: You can now fly from the US to Europe for $70 — but one day it might be free NOW WATCH: Watch Air France's first Boeing 787 get assembled and painted in this amazing time-lapse Loading video...

Northwest Military Archives    Search Newsletter Advertise with Us Home News Military Life Vets Restaurants Music & Culture Travel Guides PROMO Outdoors Travel Attractions Back to Attractions Wheels up Museum of Flight a great visit By J.M. Simpson on January 12, 2017 The SR-71 Blackbird is a favorite attraction at the Boeing Museum of Flight. Photo credit: J.M. Simpson Write to Editor Leave A Comment Read Comments Tweet AM "Tex" Johnston would like the Boeing's Museum of Flight. He was the pilot, who on a Sunday in August 1955, took the Boeing Company's new jetliner prototype, the Model 367-80, and executed two perfect barrel rolls over Lake Washington. The maneuver stunned everyone, including then Boeing president William Allen.   Moments later, fellow aircraft executive Larry Bell turned to Allen and said, "You don't know Tex very well.  He just sold your airplane." The Boeing Company continued to grow as a global industry, and in the process it created a world-class museum. It is a barrel roll of a place to enjoy aviation history while looking at the planes that made it. The museum first taxied out onto the runway of public awareness in 1965 when it opened a 10,000 square-foot space at the Seattle Center. Today, the TA Wilson Great Gallery is a three million cubic foot, six-story, glass and steel edifice housing over 50 full-size historic aircraft. A nine-ton Douglas DC-3 hangs from the space frame ceiling in flight attitude.  Other aircraft join it in flight. Surrounding the Great Galley are the J. Elroy McCaw Personal Courage Wing, the William M. Allen Theater, the Charles Simonyi Space Gallery, the Aviation Pavilion and the Red Barn. From a replica of Orville and Wilbur Wright's aircraft that flew at Kitty Hawk to walking through the cargo bay of a space shuttle, the museum is a flight through aviation history. Knowledgeable and friendly docents interact with visitors, conduct aviation and space-related talks, answer questions, and tell stories. The museum, a nonprofit, attracts over 500,000 visitors annually. One of the most popular attractions is the M-21 Blackbird, a long-range, Mach 3 plus strategic reconnaissance aircraft that played a key role during the Cold War and beyond. Visitors flocked around the aircraft as a docent talked about its history.  Nearby, children could climb into the cockpit of a Blackbird. Not far away were exhibits of helicopters, early bi-planes and a car, the 1968 Taylor Aerocar III, which could fly. For those interested in some of the Boeing Company's history, the Red Barn offers a look back. The birthplace of the Boeing Airplane Company, the two-story Red Barn offers historic exhibits that reflect the early days of aviation as reflected in the post-and-beam architecture and polished wood floors. "That was really neat," one little boy said as he exited the cockpit of a SR-71. Not to be outdone, his sister promptly climbed in and "flew" the plane for the next couple of minutes, including something reminiscent of a barrel roll. Somewhere, Johnston smiled. Plan on wearing comfortable shoes and spending a few hours. There is a gift store and a café.  The museum is ADA accessible. Active-duty and retired servicemembers and their spouses receive a reduced rate on ticket prices. The museum is located at the southern end of Boeing Field at 9404 East Marginal Way South in Seattle.

(NYSE: BA) booked an order for 100 of its 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. According to reports, those planes are destined for India's low-cost carrier SpiceJet and the order has list-price value of $10 billion. Boeing's arch-rival Airbus was not so fortunate in December. The aircraft maker announced a delay in delivery of 12 of its superjumbo A380s to Emirates airline, the company's biggest customer for its biggest jet. The delay likely is the proximate cause for Airbus's decision to cut production of the A380 to just one new plane per month. The SpiceJet order is expected to be announced at a press conference scheduled for Friday in New Delhi, according to unnamed sources cited at Reuters. The order includes at least 42 737s, that SpiceJet agreed to buy in 2014. Airbus has bested Boeing in orders from India's leading low-cost carrier, IndiGo, and another rival, GoAir. The former has placed an order for 410 Airbus A320neos and has already received 100 A320ceos and 14 of the newer aircraft out of a total order of 530. GoAir has ordered 159 A320s, 155 of the A320neo and the rest A320ceos. Because India is the world's fastest growing market for airplanes, an order for up to 100 planes is a significant boost to Boeing's eventual success in the region. Airbus reportedly competed hard for this order, and it is likely that Boeing had to offer a significant discount to the list price in order to win the deal. Depending on the size of the order and the customer's history, discounts typically range from 40% to 60%. For Airbus, the order delay from Emirates may signal a serious problem. The Dubai-based carrier still has 50 A380s on order, but the airline's chief executive, Sir Tim Clark, has said that 2016 was not a good year and 2017 is likely to be no better and could be slightly worse. A significant overhang for Emirates and the other carriers grouped as the "Middle East Three," or ME3 (Etihad and Qatar Airways) is a dispute over the Open Skies agreement that has led to intense pressure from U.S. carriers, particularly Delta Air Lines, that claim the ME3 are the beneficiary of unfair subsidies and their access to U.S. airports should be curtailed. That argument may resonate with President-elect Donald Trump, who may make the claim that the ME3 are threatening U.S. jobs as a result of the subsidies. While Emirates is not Airbus's biggest customer, it is one of the aircraft maker's most important, if for no other reason than without Emirates it may never turn a profit on the A380 program. While Emirates may have to hit the pause button on its long-haul flights carrying 550 passengers or more, the airline is probably in no danger of folding and giving Airbus an even bigger headache. Shares of Boeing traded down about 1.1% early Thursday morning, at $157.60 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.07. The 12-month consensus price target on the stock is $160.11.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Monday January, 16, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Airbus jets past American rival Boeing on new orders, closes gap on deliveries By Sonia Wolf, AFP January 13, 2017, 12:01 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet TOULOUSE, France -- Airbus on Wednesday said it had outstripped its own delivery expectations in 2016, closing the gap with Boeing, and beat its U.S. archrival on orders. The European aerospace company said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, beating its own target which was hiked in November from 650 to 670. The figures were lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. It also booked a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing but showing a significant drop of nearly a third on the previous year when it logged demand for 1,036 aircraft. Last week, Boeing confirmed orders of 668 planes throughout the year, down 13 percent on 2015 when net orders reached 768. "2016 was a year in which we managed to not only achieve our objectives but to surpass them," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. It was the 14th consecutive year in which the firm chalked up record deliveries. Although it remains behind Boeing, which saw deliveries fell modestly to 748 in 2016, the European group is closing the gap. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. Supply Chain Issues "2016, particularly the first six months, was particularly difficult ... we had more (production) difficulties than expected," Bregier said, referring to supply chain bottlenecks with its A350 long-haul jets. But the company almost reached its delivery target for the aircraft, handing over 49 of the 50 planned deliveries, and two more submitted for flight testing. It also delivered 545 of its single-aisle A320 jetliners, 66 A330s and 28 of its A380 double-decker superjumbos, the production of which is due to be halved next year. In July, Airbus said it would cut the production rate of its A380 to one a month from 2018 to reflect reduced demand. In 2015, the manufacturer handed over 27 planes but next year aims to deliver just 12. The group has seen a slowdown in demand for long-distance carriers due in part to falling fuel prices which have impacted on the renewal of ageing fleets, but also as a result of weakening demand from Gulf carriers which peaked in recent years. Airbus ended the year with a backlog of 6,874 planes with a list price of US$1 billion. Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger jets from budget Indian airline GoAir, in a deal worth US$7.8 billion, the aircraft maker said.

Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. (MIke Mozart/Flickr/CC) The stock market has been on quite a roll in recent weeks, but signs of trouble continue to plague the real economy.  Earlier this week, I talked about the "retail apocalypse" now sweeping America. Major retail chains such as Sears and Macy's are closing stores and laying off workers, but I didn't think Wal-Mart would be feeling the pain as well. Unfortunately, that's precisely what is happening. USA Today is reporting that approximately 1,000 jobs will be cut at Wal-Mart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas by the end of this month: Wal-Mart's plan to lay off of hundreds of employees is the latest ripple in a wave of job cuts and store closures that are roiling the retail industry. The world's largest retailer is cutting roughly 1,000 jobs at its corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, later this month, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak about it. The company is saying these cuts are necessary because Wal-Mart is always "looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively." But something doesn't smell right here. You don't get rid of 1,000 employees at your corporate headquarters if everything is just fine. I have driven past Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville a number of times, and it is in a beautiful part of the country. Bentonville and the surrounding areas had been booming, but it looks like times may be changing. Meanwhile, there are signs of trouble out on the west coast as well. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that there is going to be a new round of engineering job cuts at Boeing. Boeing Co. has internally announced a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide, including in Southern California, and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to aim for further cuts in 2017. And according to Boeing spokesperson Doug Alder, similar job cut announcements are coming for other classes of workers as well. So why is Boeing getting rid of so many employees? Well, the truth is that Boeing's business is way down. The following comes from Wolf Richter: Business has been tough. In 2016, deliveries fell by 14 jets from a year ago, to 748. Net orders dropped 13 percent from an already-rotten level in 2015, to just 668, down 53 percent from 2014. And the lowest level since 2010! When the economy is doing well, air traffic tends to rise, and when the economy is doing poorly, it tends to go down. Needless to say, the fact that Boeing is doing so poorly does not bode well for the future. In addition to Wal-Mart, another major retailer that is letting people go is Petco. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=235269331" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=235269331" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Petco is cutting 180 positions with about 50 at its San Diego headquarters, the pet supply retailer confirmed Wednesday. The company made the cuts across its workforce and include both existing and open positions. Petco has about 650 workers at its headquarters in Rancho Bernardo. It employs 27,000 in the U.S. My wife and I have three cats, and even though Petco tends to be a bit overpriced, we have always appreciated the work they do. Unfortunately, when the economy gets tough, spending on pets tends to be one of the first things to get cut back, and this current trouble at Petco could be a sign that rough sledding is ahead for the entire economy. Of course, your personal perspective on these things is likely to be very heavily influenced by your immediate surroundings. Those who live in wealthy enclaves of major cities such as San Francisco, New York City or Washington, D.C. may be wondering how anyone could possibly be talking about economic trouble right now. But if you live in economically depressed areas of Appalachia or the upper Midwest, it may seem as though the last economic recession never even ended. There have been pockets of economic prosperity in recent years, and this has resulted in some people becoming exceedingly wealthy. Meanwhile, things have just continued to become even tougher for millions of other families as the cost of living always seems to grow faster than their paychecks do. If you are in the top one percent of all income earners, maybe to you it seems as though things have never been better. But most of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and is just struggling to survive from month to month. The following comes from CNN: The rich are money-making machines. Today, the top mega-wealthy—the top 1%—earn an average of $1.3 million a year. It's more than three times as much as the 1980s, when the rich "only" made $428,000, on average, according to economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of the American population earned an average of $16,000 in pre-tax income in 1980. That hasn't changed in over three decades. The workers being laid off at the companies discussed above are real people with real hopes and real dreams. Perhaps many of them will be able to land other employment fairly soon, but the truth is that the job market is really tough in many areas of the country right now. Finding a good job that will allow you to pay the bills and support your family is not easy. You may find that out the hard way if you end up losing your current job during the economic troubles that will come in 2017. Earlier today, I came across an excellent article by Gail Tverberg that detailed a bunch of reasons a significant economic downturn appears to be imminent in 2017. If you would like to read it, you can find it here. She points to many of the same things to which I have been pointing for a very long time. Even though economic conditions were fairly stable throughout 2016, our long-term problems continued to get even worse. So the truth is that we are more primed for a major crisis today than we have been at any point since the last recession. My hope is that things will not be nearly as bad in 2017 as Gail Tverberg and others are projecting that they could be, but the warning signs are definitely there, and it isn't going to take much to push the U.S. economy off the rails.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Fri, Jan 13, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Airbus deliveries increased last year, but new orders fell AP, PARIS A photo provided by Airbus Group shows an A321 with the Iran Air logo landing at Blagnac airport near Toulouse, France, on Wednesday. Photo: Airbus via AP Airbus Group SE delivered a record number of planes last year, despite engine and cabin production problems, even as new orders slumped for both the European manufacturer and its US rival Boeing Co. An unlikely customer provided a big boost to the industry last year — Iran, which on Wednesday took delivery of its first Airbus plane in years as part of a multibillion-dollar deal made possible by a hard-fought nuclear agreement. Airbus executives defended the superjumbo A380, which has not won as many orders as many had hoped, and played down concerns that the industry is facing a downturn after a long-running buying spree by Mideast and Asian carriers. However, they refused to issue forecasts for this year amid signs that China’s slowdown and volatile fuel prices threaten to weigh on aircraft orders. Airbus on Wednesday said it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015 and above the company’s own expectations. Airbus increased deliveries of its long-delayed A350 wide-body to 49 overall. The A320 range — notably the fuel-efficient A321neo — dominated Airbus sales last year, when it won 731 net orders overall, compared with 1,036 the year before. Last week, Boeing said it delivered 748 planes last year and took in 668 net orders, down from 768 in 2015. “I’m confident that we’ll have a new record in deliveries” this year, Airbus commercial planes sales chief John Leahy said on Wednesday in Toulouse, France. However, he added: “That doesn’t mean that orders are going to be strong.” Racing with Boeing for business in post-sanctions Iran, Airbus made the symbolic move of delivering an A321 jet to Iran Air on Wednesday, the first of 100 planes planned in an Airbus deal worth more than US$18 billion at list prices. Iran’s flag carrier signed a similar deal with Boeing, for 80 jetliners that will not start arriving until 2018. Airbus commercial planes president Fabrice Bregier said that the company would continue work on the Iran planes despite concerns that US president-elect Donald Trump could threaten the international nuclear agreement that paved the way for the aircraft contracts. Airbus also shrugged off concerns of protectionist measures threatened by Trump, saying it is manufacturing in the US too — and delivered its first US-assembled plane last year, an A321 made in Mobile, Alabama. While Airbus insists that the world will need bigger planes like the A380 as population and travel grow, many airlines are turning away from major hubs and using smaller, cheaper planes instead. Airbus has scaled back production of the plane to one per month as orders have lagged. Mark Bobbi of IHS Markit forecast slower order rates in Asia and the Mideast after a period of “over-ordering.” A big question mark hanging over the industry is the rising oil price, which is putting pressure on airlines to cut costs — or to invest in newer, more fuel-efficient planes.

A half-century after MLK's death is Baltimore less segregated? Yes and no. Business Boeing plans buyouts and layoffs for engineers Boeing Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images Boeing will offer voluntary buyout packages for engineers in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. Boeing will offer voluntary buyout packages for engineers in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Dominic GatesThe Seattle Times Boeing Co. has internally announced a new round of employee buyouts for engineers companywide, and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to aim for further cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo regarding the job cuts Tuesday to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. Hamilton’s memo states that details of a buyout offer will be sent Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment April 21.

As internships beckoned, she sent in a number of applications... (Samantha Masunaga) The buyout package will be offered to employees in Washington state, Southern California and South Carolina. There are about 3,500 employees in Boeing’s Southern California commercial division. Hamilton’s message went on to say that 60-day involuntary layoff notices affecting only engineering employees in Washington will be sent out Jan. 20, with layoffs effective March 24. Those layoffs will affect employees in the skill classifications that were offered a buyout package last year, he said. This year's buyout offer is going out mostly to employees in different skill classifications. There will be further involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the buyout offer and it falls short of Boeing's cost-saving target. Hamilton said there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. The extent of the additional job cuts “will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition,” he said. “We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition,” Hamilton said. “The decision to lower the production rate on the 777 program announced in late December underscores that environment and what we need to do to help Boeing win.” Best advice for Lockheed on the F-35?

(Samantha Masunaga) Alder said the workforce reductions this year, as last year, will be achieved where possible through attrition and voluntary buyouts before involuntary layoffs. He said the company also will “aggressively reduce overall spending in 2017 in non-labor areas.” Ray Goforth, executive director of Boeing’s white-collar engineering union — the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace — said the process Boeing is following in cutting jobs was worked out in discussions with the union that led to last year’s surprise agreement to a new six-year union contract. “We knew the company was going to lay off significant numbers of people,” Goforth said. “We wanted to make it as painless as possible.” Los Angeles Times staff writer Samantha Masunaga contributed to this report.

(NYSE: BA) booked an order for 100 of its 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. According to reports, those planes are destined for India’s low-cost carrier SpiceJet and the order has list-price value of $10 billion. Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus was not so fortunate in December. The aircraft maker announced a delay in delivery of 12 of its superjumbo A380s to Emirates airline, the company’s biggest customer for its biggest jet. The delay likely is the proximate cause for Airbus’s decision to cut production of the A380 to just one new plane per month. The SpiceJet order is expected to be announced at a press conference scheduled for Friday in New Delhi, according to unnamed sources cited at Reuters. The order includes at least 42 737s, that SpiceJet agreed to buy in 2014. Airbus has bested Boeing in orders from India’s leading low-cost carrier, IndiGo, and another rival, GoAir. The former has placed an order for 410 Airbus A320neos and has already received 100 A320ceos and 14 of the newer aircraft out of a total order of 530. GoAir has ordered 159 A320s, 155 of the A320neo and the rest A320ceos. Because India is the world’s fastest growing market for airplanes, an order for up to 100 planes is a significant boost to Boeing’s eventual success in the region. Airbus reportedly competed hard for this order, and it is likely that Boeing had to offer a significant discount to the list price in order to win the deal. Depending on the size of the order and the customer’s history, discounts typically range from 40% to 60%. For Airbus, the order delay from Emirates may signal a serious problem. The Dubai-based carrier still has 50 A380s on order, but the airline’s chief executive, Sir Tim Clark, has said that 2016 was not a good year and 2017 is likely to be no better and could be slightly worse. A significant overhang for Emirates and the other carriers grouped as the “Middle East Three,” or ME3 (Etihad and Qatar Airways) is a dispute over the Open Skies agreement that has led to intense pressure from U.S. carriers, particularly Delta Air Lines, that claim the ME3 are the beneficiary of unfair subsidies and their access to U.S. airports should be curtailed. That argument may resonate with President-elect Donald Trump, who may make the claim that the ME3 are threatening U.S. jobs as a result of the subsidies. While Emirates is not Airbus’s biggest customer, it is one of the aircraft maker’s most important, if for no other reason than without Emirates it may never turn a profit on the A380 program. While Emirates may have to hit the pause button on its long-haul flights carrying 550 passengers or more, the airline is probably in no danger of folding and giving Airbus an even bigger headache. Shares of Boeing traded down about 1.1% early Thursday morning, at $157.60 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.07. The 12-month consensus price target on the stock is $160.11.

The airline, which was on the verge of going kaput two years ago, is likely to place the order with US aircraft maker Boeing. An official said the deal for around 90-100 new planes is expected to be announced by SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh on Friday. A SpiceJet spokesperson declined to comment.

The airline is expected to place order for Boeing 737 family and the 2016 list price for the starting model in this category is little over $90 million per aircraft, the official said. On this basis, the anticipated order value would be at least Rs 55,000 crore at current exchange rates. In 2014, SpiceJet — which has remained in the black for seven straight quarters — had agreed to buy around 42 B 737 MAX planes from Boeing under the previous leadership. The Marans sold their entire 58.46 per cent stake in the airline to Ajay Singh in January 2015. Last week, an airline spokesperson said it was expecting to complete negotiations and place orders for new aircraft this fiscal ending March. "Negotiations are going on for quite some time.

NEW DELHI: US aircraft maker Boeing Inc today launched a skill development programme in association with the aerospace manufacturing firm Jaivel to train front-line workers in the MSME segment in aerospace industry. The programme was announced in the presence of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani at the 8th edition of Vibrant Gujarat Summit, a release said. The programme, which is in line with the Skill India initiative of the Narendra Modi-led NDA Government at the Centre, is aimed at accelerating the growth of domestic aerospace industry by establishing a larger pipeline of skilled aerospace workers, Boeing said in the release. Jaivel Aerospace, a micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME), has undertaken work packages as a sub-tier supplier for Boeing's advanced commercial airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 737 as well as defense platforms such as the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, the release said. "This is Boeing's first skill development initiative for aerospace manufacturing in Gujarat to ensure that entrepreneurial Gujarat businesses are ready to compete at a global scale," Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said. Through the new partnership, Jaivel's role in the local and global aerospace sector will expand, as it helps train future aerospace workers, the release said. "This is an important investment by Boeing, not only for us but also for Gujarat's potential to become an aerospace manufacturing hub. This is testament to Jaivel's aerospace team and we look forward to working with Boeing to create an excellent foundation for an aerospace sector in the state,", Jaivel Aerospace founder and chief executive officer Vipul Vachhani said. Apart from forging such partnerships, Boeing has also been collaborating with leading Indian vocational training institutes, Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Indian partners, including MSMEs, to train workers in the aerospace industry, the release added.

Twice the 747’s human capacity over vast distances can be carried by twin-engine wide-body planes such as Boeing 777 and Airbus A350.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement United Airlines is speeding up the retirement of its Boeing 747 jumbo jets, moving its last flight from the end of 2018 to the last quarter of this year. President Scott Kirby dubbed it a “bittersweet milestone” as the 747s — fondly called the “Queen of the Skies” and have been part of the United fleet since its maiden flight between California and Hawaii in 1970 — once symbolized state-of-the-art travel in the air. End Of An Era “Today, there are more fuel-efficient, cost-effective and reliable widebody aircraft that provide an updated inflight experience for our customers traveling on long-haul flights,” Kirby said in a memo released Wednesday. The company promised to honor the 747 with an “unforgettable” send-off for the icon that it is, details of which will be posted in the months to come. The plan to accelerate the retirement comes on the same day the Federal Aviation Administration is projected to issue a directive that urges potentially costly fixes to older jet models, including the kind that the airline flies. The decision heralds the end of an era for U.S. airlines, which have largely relied on the 747 for mass-market air travel since its debut in the 1970. At the same time, it is a show of Boeing’s struggle as it tries to keep the -8, its latest 747 model, flying amid weakening demand for four-engine airplanes. The Chicago-based Boeing, also one of the two private space taxi providers for NASA, which sold 17 of the freighter editions in 2016, today has only 28 unfilled orders. It has expressed intention to end production if more orders do not come through. Shifting To New Jetliner United currently flies 20 of the 747-400 passenger model, which the jetmaker produced from 1988 to 2009. Almost as much as the 747’s human capacity over vast distances can be carried by twin-engine wide-body planes such as Boeing 777 and Airbus A350, and the older jumbos consume around 20 percent more fuel per seat than the latest 777s. In addition, spare parts and special maintenance prove to be a concern, as more airlines retire the jumbo fleets. Delta Air Lines is parking the jumbo jets this year, while other operators such as Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines have put their 747-400s to rest amid the ongoing shift. While it wouldn’t reveal which aircraft would take the place of the renowned jumbo planes, United has received the first of 14 777-300ERs it ordered for long flights and has requested 35 Airbus A350-1000s. Airline pilots and flight attendants assigned to the 747s will be transitioned to other planes, according to Kirby. Many other changes and developments mark the U.S. airline industry today, with JetBlue recently announcing that all its flights within the continental United States now offer free satellite Wi-Fi for its passengers. Called Fly-Fi, the service is touted to provide speedy broadband to allow passengers to remain connected to the internet on similar data speeds they experience on the ground. Other airlines offer similar in-flight internet services, yet none are both free and available on all aircraft.

RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage of Boeing shares at an underperform rating because of the prospect of declining profit margins in its commercial airplane business and the risk of President-elect Donald Trump's trade policy agenda. "We have found a strong correlation between Boeing's commercial operating margins and the average age of Boeing's platforms. ... We see signs that this is already starting to drive commercial margin pressure," analyst Matthew McConnell wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "It is unclear how President Trump will differ from 'candidate Trump,' but following through on the protectionist policies that were central to his campaign could be a headwind to the commercial aerospace sector," he added.

But a reverse effect is also true: When a company gets in Trump's Twitter crosshairs, it immediately sees the rest of the twittersphere join in the attack. Social intelligence firm Brandwatch analyzed corporate Twitter accounts and their community sentiment, both before and after Trump directly took them on. Some recent examples include Boeing, General Motors, Ford and United Technologies' Carrier. Trump's negative tweets inspired many other tweeters to get mad as well. Look at some of these charts measuring the reaction. The day before Boeing was attacked, Brandwatch's data showed 73 percent of mentions were positive. That basically flipped the next day, going to 68 percent negative. Trump posted this tweet: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072?ref_src=twsrc^tfw Boeing's mentions on the social messaging platform soared to more than 241,000 — a massive spike of nearly 5,000 percent. And almost all of it was negative (represented in red below): No different was the trend for GM. After Trump posted this tweet: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/statuses/816260343391514624 ...GM's mentions jumped 452 percent on Jan. 3, again mostly negative: In Ford's case, he tweeted about the automaker on Nov. 17, Jan. 3 and Jan. 4. The same increase in mentions happened. And here's the drop in sentiment between Jan. 2 and 3: Trump posted about Carrier on Dec. 1, including on Instagram, and the company saw another immediate decline in sentiment. Note that in Carrier's case the drop wasn't as dramatic perhaps because Trump had already been attacking the company for months during the campaign season. In all the examples, it's clear how just a few words from Trump can excite thousands of others to pile on. Trump's press conferences tend to jump from topic to topic (on Wednesday, he criticized Lockheed Martin and pharmaceutical companies), but Twitter is a much more limited platform that forces the president-elect to focus on a single subject. As a result, those 140-character messages can pack a lot of punch against an unlucky company. "There was too much subject matter in the press conference to really dwell on his Lockheed and pharma comments," said Kellan Terry, lead analyst for U.S. political data at Brandwatch. "On Twitter, he only has enough characters to call out one subject or brand."

The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which oversees Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport, says travelers should be prepared for additional crowds and congestion from Jan. 19 through Jan. 22. The airports authority says the influx of passengers may produce longer-than-usual wait times at airline ticket counters and security checkpoints as well as congestion on airport roads. The authority says it's also planning to offer all-day parking on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in its garages at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Parking for the day will cost $10. The authority says reservations will be required and are limited to the first 1,200 bookings.

The Gulf airline has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by alternative Pratt & Whitney engines and expects to swap the overall aircraft order, which was originally for 50 jets, to larger A321neo aircraft. CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran, is locked in a fierce battle with Pratt & Whitney to supply engines for new Airbus medium-haul jets. CFM exclusively supplies engines for the competing Boeing 737 aircraft, which Qatar Airways has also ordered. Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker acknowledged Qatar Airways had received attractive prices when it originally ordered the new Pratt & Whitney engine, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees. "It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance," he told Reuters in an interview. Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, where it hopes to tie up a deal to take a 49-percent stake around the end of the month. It has told Boeing it is interested in taking earlier delivery of future 777-9 aircraft, because that programme is ahead of schedule, Al Baker added. Asked if Qatar Airways could take on delivery of aircraft for airlines in which it has stakes, like BA owner IAG and Latam, he said "why not," but added he believed those airlines would take their planes as planned. He was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre business lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, the airline's third premium lounge abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai. It is building further lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and is negotiating lounge space in seven other airports, he said. The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity. Qatar Airways, which also plans to launch a new premium cabin at a trade fair in March, is investing an unspecified amount in new product to attract passengers "with the right yield" or average revenues, Al Baker said. But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda because of a recent rebound in oil prices. "(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up," he said. "Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly." Oil prices have risen 20 percent in the last three months. Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. It plans to serve Nice five times a week from July and announce a similar service to Lyon soon. It continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added.

The new model, dubbed the 737 Max 10X, would be longer than the slow selling 737 Max 9, currently the biggest version of the single-aisle airliner. The Max 10X, if launched, would be the third new or revamped 737 model in as many years and the fifth in Boeing's lineup. The first Max model delivers this year and the Max 9 follows in 2018. Boeing won approval from its board of directors in late 2016 to go out and make deals for the jet with airlines, three people said. If Boeing wins enough airline commitments, the Max 10X would be officially launched as a new Boeing airliner. Boeing wants the jet to be ready for airline use by mid-2020, the people said. The U.S. plane maker's latest design is a defensive move to keep airlines from buying Airbus and giving it more time to cultivate plans for an all-new airliner that would fly 200 to 275 passengers as far as 5,000 nautical miles, according to industry officials. The plans are the latest move in the chess game of one of the world's fiercest corporate rivalries. One industry leader called the Boeing concept "a band aid to take a few percentage points off Airbus market share." United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Airlines (ALK), as well as Air Canada (ACDVF), Indonesian low-cost carrier Lion Air and airlines in China top Boeing's customer wish list, the people said. Many operate the largest 737 model currently flying along side Airbus jets or have ordered the new 737 Max 9. The Max 9 has been losing sales to its rival Airbus's A321neo. Boeing is working with customers "to work through the business case" for the Max 10X, the company said, and "once this process is successfully completed we will be in a position to share more details." United, Delta and Alaska declined to comment. Air Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The world's new planes in 2017 Boeing and Airbus have tried to fill a void left by Boeing's discontinued 757. Neither Boeing nor Airbus have matched its seating or range until recently. By 2018, Airbus' A321neo will be able to carry up to 240 passengers (239 on the 757), or by 2019, fly around 160 to 180 across the Atlantic, according to analyst estimates. Airlines have ordered 1,400 A321neos, compared to around 425 for Boeing's competing models, according to Flightglobal Ascend. That success has given Airbus a nearly 1,500 order lead over Boeing on its newest workhorses. The plane maker wants to end a spate of defections. Korean Air and Norwegian Air Shuttle, traditionally Boeing single-aisle jet buyers, split recent deals with both Boeing and Airbus (EADSF) in favor of the A321neo. Boeing sales decline despite late buying spree To keep costs down on the Max 10X, Boeing is using the same engines from the smaller Max models and only adding five and a half feet to the fuselage length and making changes to the landing gear to improve takeoff and landing performance, the company said. Aviation Week on Wednesday first reported some technical specifications of the Max 10X. The Max 10X won't beat the A321neo on range or seating, but is designed to make Boeing's loyal customers think twice about buying Airbus against its claim of Max 10's lower operating costs. The Max 10X would seat around 190 in two classes or up to 230 in all-economy, 10 to 15 more than its smaller stablemate, said Boeing. Singapore Airlines shops for world's longest jet Boeing is aiming the jet at airlines prioritizing seating over Atlantic Ocean-crossing range. Airlines with first and economy classes could fly around 3,000 nautical miles, enough for U.S. transcontinental flying, according to one person briefed on the jet's performance. Boeing's strategy isn't new. In the late 1990s, Boeing launched a longer and higher capacity model of its twin-aisle 767. Only Delta and Continental Airlines bought, keeping both airlines in Boeing's camp. Boeing launched the all-new 787 Dreamliner, its replacement, in 2003.

File photo   | Photo Credit: Reuters PTI New Delhi January 12, 2017 17:37 IST Updated: January 12, 2017 20:57 IST more-in After long drawn discussions, SpiceJet is all set to announce an order for 90-100 new aircraft estimated to be worth at least Rs. 55,000 crore as the no-frills carrier looks to expand its fleet. The airline, which was on the verge of going kaput two years ago, is likely to place the order with U.S. aircraft maker Boeing. An official said the deal for around 90-100 new planes is expected to be announced by SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh on Friday. A SpiceJet spokesperson declined to comment. Currently, the airline has 47 aircraft in its fleet comprising 29 Boeing 737s and 18 Bombardier Q400s. The airline is expected to place order for Boeing 737 family and the 2016 list price for the starting model in this category is little over $90 million per aircraft, the official said. On this basis, the anticipated order value would be at least Rs. 55,000 crore at current exchange rates. In 2014, SpiceJet — which has remained in the black for seven straight quarters — had agreed to buy around 42 B 737 MAX planes from Boeing under the previous leadership. The Marans sold their entire 58.46 per cent stake in the airline to Ajay Singh in January 2015. Last week, an airline spokesperson said it was expecting to complete negotiations and place orders for new aircraft this fiscal ending March. “Negotiations are going on for quite some time. We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the spokesperson had said. For the 2016 July-September quarter, the airline had posted its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs. 59 crore. In the year-ago period, the same stood at Rs. 29 crore.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology United to retire its Boeing 747s in 2017: Farewell to a Jumbo plane with a Jumbo heart United Airlines is set to retire the Boeing 747 from its fleet later this year. The Jumbo was inspired by vision, kept aloft by ingenuity, and adored by dreamers Dean Williams January 12, 2017 17:16 IST Boeing rolled out its first 747 aircraft in September 1968. In Picture: The Boeing 747, being displayed to the public for the first time.Wiki Commons/ SAS Scandinavian Airlines They say all good things come to an end, beautiful things sooner than most. And the Boeing 747 'Jumbo Jet' is arguably one of the most beautiful things ever to lift off the face of the Earth. She's not beautiful in a sultry 'come hither' way, rather in a manner that defies words: slightly odd-shaped, but powerful and safe; like a nanny that's been around you for decades. Is the iconic commercial aircraft Boeing 747 being retired? United Airlines' recent announcement that they would be retiring the last of their 747s later this year signaled the end; the beginning of which arrived a long time ago. Boeing followed up by stating that should no new orders arise (an increasingly likely scenario) they will call time on production of an aircraft that made the company a household name. Having flown in 747s of various varieties (Classic, 300 Combi, and the 400) for the last few decades, and even had the pleasure of working on a few in an engineering sense, there is a brooding sense of loss. The joy, as a young boy, of watching the giants land at Heathrow through the double-glazed windows of the Skyways Hotel in the early '80s has never been matched. Even the A380 hasn't inspired the feeling of awe I got the first time I walked down the tarmac to the waiting behemoth, tugging at my mother's hand, beseeching her to walk faster so we could get closer... sooner. There she was, glinting in an early evening sun; it's one of my earliest memories, and also my most vivid. And then, of course, there was the upper deck – "stairs in a plane!" – that lofty haven for the business and first class. Above the plebs, higher in the clouds than everyone else. Towering even at 40,000 feet. The only other aircraft, apart from the 747, that have sent tingles down my spine have been the rough and ready, bums on the flame, Mig-21; and the F-14 Tomcat, the swing-wing wonder made all the more thrilling by the fact that it was flown by Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer in Top Gun. But while the Fishbed and the Tomcat had the power and growl to demand your attention, the 747 just stood there. You looked at it, then cocked your head to the side and looked again – nope still looks odd. Those four engines idly rotating on the apron seemed to speak a language all of their own. They could've said anything, but it didn't matter, it was the sound of them speaking that did. Like an airborne Sean Connery or Richard Burton. Boeing may stop manufacturing the Jumbo, but that doesn't mean it's going to disappear from the skies. The Third World will still use this work-horse, with its exceptional safety record, to ferry lives across oceans and continents.  People visiting air and space museums will still marvel at its shape and wonder how on earth they got it off the ground. It will be there whenever you care to look. Over the next few decades, its stature may decline as a generation emerges more in tune with the hi-tech hum of the Airbus family, and Boeing's new line-up. But like a beloved curio that was wrapped up and stored in a closet for years, when you see it on that rare occasion, you will know just why you were in love with it for so long and with such intensity. The Boeing 747 was inspired by vision, kept aloft by ingenuity, and adored by dreamers. For those of us she transported to loves and lives across continents; for those of us she deigned to show her beating heart underneath the cowlings and panels; for those of us who grew up with her: She's the very essence of a glittering moonbeam reflecting off the clouds as you fly above them. Farewell for now old friend, and we'll always look for your contrails as you make your endless journeys, passing over us like an angel with metallic wings. Related It can't get stranger!

Singapore/New Delhi: SpiceJet is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing, two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into the South Asian nation's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for plane makers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs. 737 jets boeing spicejet Recommended For You World RecordSubstitute Bangladesh Wicketkeeper Imrul Kayes Sets World Record Complete List62nd Jio Filmfare Awards: Aamir's Dangal, Alia Bhatt Win Top Honours in the netHow Bed-ridden Sumit Became 'Crazy Sumit' of Kiss-and-Run Videos MUFC vs LFCZlatan Ibrahimovic Rescues Manchester United in Liverpool Draw The Next GalaxySamsung Galaxy S8 Revealed: Price, Specs And Everything Else You Need to Know From Our Network NAC files show how Sonia-led elitists eroded PMO primacy and undermined the Constitution- FirstPost Trump accepts US intelligence on Russia hacking, says top aide- FirstPost Research in India Part 1: Local solutions needed to deal with unique problems- FirstPost About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Imtiaz Ali's Love In Tokyo To Have Indian Hero, Japanese Heroine Trump Hails 'Great' Brexit and Backs Speedy UK Trade Deal: Times Australian Open 2017: Injury-Hit Muguruza Battles Into Second Round Donald Trump Enters the White House Facing a Myriad of Crises N Chandrasekaran's Elevation Leaves TCS Investors Worried Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Airbus did better than it itself expected on delivering planes in 2016, closing the gap with the US's Boeing, which it outstripped in orders. It made a record 688 commercial plane deliveries, beating its own target which was raised from 650 to 670 in November, thanks to a surge in December when it delivered 111. That made 2016 the 14th consecutive year in which the firm has chalked up record deliveries. Airbus also took a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing's 668, but down nearly a third from 2015's 1,036. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger planes from Indian budget airline GoAir. Saudi airline has placed an order worth 8.6 billion dollars (8.1 billion euros), it was reported on Thursday. First delivery to Iran Airbus delivered the first of the Iranian order, which has a list price of about 20 billion dollars (19 billion euros), on Wednesday and marked the event with a ceremony at its factory in Toulouse, south-west France. "It's a new, magnificent chapter and a great day" for ties between Iran and the EU, said IranAir's chief executive Farhad Parvaresh at the ceremony, adding that the "distance between us caused by political adversities have been narrowed by hard work of the international peace keepers". Airbus boss Fabrice Bregier also hailed the renewal of ties with Iran, saying the "renaissance of Iran aviation sector is one of the most important developments for our industry for many years". IranAir has also signed a contract with Boeing, its biggest in 40 years, for the sale of 80 planes for 16.6 billion dollars (15.6 billion euros). Iran needs 400-500 planes over the next decade, according to the Iranian Civil Aviation Authority.   Tweeter Related Iran spends €19 billion on France's … Canadian air force orders 16 Airbus … Poland to invite tenders for … Sport 16/01/2017 CAN 2017 Sport Football Senegal take early control of Group B as Zimbabwe scare Algeria 15/01/2017 CAN 2017 Football Gabon Senegal set to bust the ghosts of Africa Cup of Nations past 15/01/2017 CAN 2017 Algeria Mali Leekens urges Algeria to avoid Zimbabwe trap Press reviews 15/01/2017 French weekly magazines review 15 January 2017 14/01/2017 African press review 14 January 2017 AFP Out-of-sorts Halep becomes first major Australian Open casualty Crosby the hero as Green Bay edge Dallas in NFL thriller Pacific 'wave pilot' kept ancient skills alive Mushfiqur felled in New Zealand late charge Eight men own half the world's wealth: Oxfam What changes under Turkey's new constitution plan?

The fourth mission of the program is now underway and just passed 600 days in Earth orbit. Credit: USAF/Boeing The U.S. Air Force's mysterious X-37B space plane has now spent 600 days in Earth orbit on the vessel's latest mission, and is nearing a program record for longest time spent in space. The robotic X-37B lifted off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on May 20, 2015, kicking off the program's fourth space mission (which is known as Orbital Test Vehicle-4, or OTV-4). If the uncrewed spacecraft spends 74 more days aloft, it will break the duration record set during OTV-3, which touched down in October 2014. [The X-37B's Fourth Mystery Mission in Photos] But it's unclear how long OTV-4 will last, or just what the X-37B is doing as it circles Earth; most details about the space plane's missions and payloads are classified. This SPACE.com infographic depicts the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle is an unmanned space test vehicle for the USAF. See how the unmanned space drone works here. Credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com   Milestone record keeping The first OTV mission began on April 22, 2010, and concluded on Dec. 3 of that year, following 224 days of orbit. OTV-2 lifted off on March 5, 2011, and landed on June 16, 2012, after 468 days in orbit. The record-setting OTV-3 mission chalked up nearly 675 days in orbit, circling Earth from Dec. 11, 2012, until Oct. 17, 2014. All three previous OTV missions have come down to Earth at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but that may change for OTV-4's landing, whenever it occurs. Heading for Florida? Progress has been made on consolidating X-37B space plane operations, including the use of NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida as a landing site for the robotic space plane. A former KSC space-shuttle facility known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1 (OPF-1) was converted into a structure that will enable the Air Force "to efficiently land, recover, refurbish and relaunch the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV)," according to representatives of the aerospace giant Boeing. X-37B vehicle development falls under the control of Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems in El Segundo, California, which is Boeing's center for all space and experimental systems and government and commercial satellites. The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office is leading the Department of Defense's OTV initiative, by direction of the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics and the secretary of the Air Force. Fleet size To date, only two reusable X-37B vehicles have been confirmed as constituting the space plane fleet. The current OTV-4 mission is the second flight of the second X-37B vehicle built for the Air Force by Boeing. The U.S. Air Force's X-37B space plane waits in the encapsulation cell of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle on April 5, 2010, at the Astrotech facility in Titusville, Florida. The vehicle launched on the first X-37B mission on April 22, 2010. Credit: U.S. Air Force The military space plane looks like a miniature version of NASA's retired space shuttle orbiter. The X-37B is just 29 feet (8.8 meters) long and 9.6 feet (2.9 m) tall, and has a wingspan of nearly 15 feet (4.6 m). For comparison, the space shuttles were each 122 feet (37 m) long, with wingspans of 78 feet (24 m). The X-37B has a payload bay about the size of a pickup truck bed that can be outfitted with a robotic arm. It has a launch weight of 11,000 lbs. (4,990 kilograms) and is powered in orbit by gallium arsenide solar cells with lithium-ion batteries. Payloads aboard Some payloads aboard the OTV-4 craft have been previously identified. For example, Aerojet Rocketdyne has said that its XR-5A Hall Thruster had completed initial in-orbit validation testing aboard the X-37B space plane. Also on board is a NASA advanced-materials investigation. Such test-bedding of equipment is one of the main purposes of OTV missions, along with the development of reusable-spacecraft technologies, Air Force officials have said.   "It remains a very useful way to test out things," Winston Beauchamp, deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space, told Space.com last September during an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) meeting in Long Beach, California. When asked about adding more X-37Bs to the nation's fleet, Beauchamp said that the current number of vehicles meets the Air Force's needs.

United Airlines is set to retire its last jumbo jet.

The decision marks the end of an era for US airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. It is also a reminder of the tough task Boeing faces as it tries to keep its newest 747 model, the -8, aloft amid waning demand for four-engine aircraft. The plane maker has just 28 unfilled orders, after closing 17 sales of the freighter version of the jet last year. Boeing has said it would end production if more orders don’t materialise. "It’s a bittersweet milestone – this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel," the United president Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees. Last year, the UK’s Daily Mail reported a former Pan Am 747 passenger plane was being advertised as a "head of state configured aircraft" and thought to be worth in the region of £18 million (Dh81m). It was extensively refurbished in 2004, and the aircraft’s extravagant interior features luxury en-suite bedrooms, ministerial boardrooms complete with conferencing facilities, offices, stylish dining areas and soft furnishing. The 195ft wingspan special performance model plane has been a regular feature at Bournemouth Airport, Dorset, for roughly a decade and is one of only 12 left flying after just 45 of the high end planes were built. It was leased from Worldwide Aircraft Holding in 1995 by the Qatar ruling family the Al Thanis and was painted in the colours of the country’s maroon and white flag soon after. Also last year the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden unveiled their new "tour bus" – a personalised 747 that replaced the band’s previous set of wings, a 757. Frontman Bruce Dickinson is a licensed pilot and Iron Maiden used the jet on their Book of Souls world tour. Dickinson has been flying for over 20 years and previously he was a professional pilot for the now defunct British charter line Astraeus. The eye-catching livery of the plane was applied Sharjah. While it has long been a favourite of celebrities and the mega-rich, the jumbo hit world headlines again when it carried the US Space Shuttle on its back during flight tests. Nasa flew two modified 747s, originally manufactured for commercial use, as Space Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. One is a 747-123 model, while the other was designated a 747-100SR-46 model. The two aircraft were identical in performance as Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA). The SCAs were used to ferry space shuttle orbiters from landing sites back to the launch complex at the Kennedy Space Center and also to and from other locations too distant for the orbiters to be delivered by ground transport. The jumbo carried its last shuttle in 2012. Chicago-based United flies 20 of the 747-400 passenger model, which Boeing manufactured from 1988 and 2009. Delta Air Lines, the other US operator, is also parking the jumbo jets this year. Cathay Pacific Airways, ANA, Singapore Airlines and Air France are among carriers that have retired their 747-400 jetliners this decade amid a shift from four-engine aircraft. Twin-engine wide-bodies suchas Boeing’s 777 and the Airbus A350 can haul almost as many people over vast distances as aviation’s behemoths, the 747 and Airbus’ A380 superjumbo. United’s jumbos burn about 20 per cent more fuel per seat than its newest 777s and require special handling from maintenance technicians. Sourcing spare parts is becoming a headache as more airlines retire their jumbo fleets, according to the airline. The United spokesman Luke Punzenberger would not say which wide-body aircraft would replace the planes that have served as the airline’s workhorses on trans-Pacific routes for two decades. The carrier has taken delivery of the first of 14 Boeing 777-300ERs it has ordered for long-range flying. The airline also has ordered 35 Airbus A350-1000s, but is weighing converting those twin-aisle jets to the smaller 900 variant or the mid-sized A330, the United chief financial officer Andrew Levy said in November. The airline plans to move pilot and flight attendant crews assigned to the 747 transition to other aircraft, Kirby told employees. "Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities," he said. "And of course, we’ll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration." * Agencies Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Embraer on flight path to strong fourth-quarter results Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Lockheed assures Trump it will cut F-35 fighter jet costs Air France-KLM chief sees storm clouds ahead for airline MOST VIEWED Business | All Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Oil and gas has itself to blame if millennials are not prepared to work in the industry Are tourists or visitors allowed to drive Dubai-registered cars?

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Aerospace & Defense | Thu Jan 12, 2017 | 5:35am EST India's SpiceJet to seal $10 billion deal with Boeing for 737 jets: sources A SpiceJet Boeing 737-800 aircraft taxis on the tarmac after landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji international airport in Mumbai November 26, 2012. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui By Anshuman Daga and Tommy Wilkes | SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI India's SpiceJet (SPJT.BO) is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing (BA.N), two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into the South Asian nation's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus (AIR.PA) has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's (INGL.NS) IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

Airbus versus Boeing: Iran deals the difference in plane battle PARIS Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus and Boeing have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:20 PM, January 12, 2017 SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI - India's SpiceJet <SPJT.BO> is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing <BA.N>, two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into India's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus <AIR.PA> has won record-sized orders with IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market, showing double-digit growth in annual passenger numbers thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of the 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

Education Databases: Searchable databases on demographics, test scores, financial information and te By the Editorial Board / Published: January 12, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A new generation of aircraft, including the Boeing 737Max, have helped open secondary U.S. airports to European routes. (Boeing) The Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport has experienced growth over the last two years for a fundamental reason — passengers have filled planes. Airport Executive Director Carl R. Beardsley noted recently that “load factors,” the percentage of sold seats per flight, average about 85 percent. Local travelers, it seems, have begun to consider the ancillary costs — tolls, time, fuel and lodging — that go with using other airports. The growing service at the airport helps to create more competitive fares. Meanwhile, the Lackawanna and Luzerne county governments that control the airport should examine an intriguing trend. European carriers have begun to establish service at smaller East Coast airports to reduce costs and escape the congestion at major airports. Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier, began service last fall between Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, and Shannon International Airport — a major European gateway. And Norwegian, a discount carrier, plans to begin service to Ireland this year from Stewart International Airport in Newburg, New York, 98 miles from Scranton. T.F. Green Airport, in Warwick, Rhode Island, also is in talks with Norwegian. Because of a new generation of highly fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 737Max and the Airbus 321Neo, carriers profitably can cover longer distances with fewer passengers. The 737Max and 32Neo are single-aisle, two-engine jets that carry 180 to 220 passengers. Larger, two-aisle jumbo jets such as the new Boeing 787 and Airbus 350 usually carry at least 100 more passengers. The smaller passenger loads eliminate the need to funnel hundreds of passengers from many locations through big hubs. Ground services — aircraft maintenance, crew lodging and so on — also typically are much cheaper in secondary markets. As reported by The New York Times, a record 18,000 city pairs were connected by direct air service in 2016. Many of them are major cities, but there has been substantial growth among secondary markets. As new secondary market routes become established, other carriers likely will consider joining the market. AVP should be ready to attract that service.

REUTERS/Danish SiddiquiMore By Anshuman Daga and Tommy Wilkes SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's SpiceJet is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing , two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into the South Asian nation's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders.

The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

What we know The whereabouts of the Boeing 777 has remained a mystery since March 2014 By AMANDA DEVLIN 13th January 2017, 11:35 am Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments DOOMED Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared without a trace. Analysis of the plane’s last moments have suggested that it crashed at a high speed without a pilot in control. Alamy 4 Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board (stock image) But investigators remain puzzled over the whereabouts of the missing aircraft, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew when it vanished in March 2014 – with researchers proving that they had been looking in the wrong place. Despite experts never having found the body of any of its passengers, the hunt for MH370 is now set to end after nearly three years. News that the search teams were abandoning their mission saw a series of conspiracy theories resurface – so here are the key facts about the missing plane: What happened on March 8, 2014? Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur carrying 239 people on board. They included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadn’t been home in a year. The plane had recorded 7,525 take-offs and landings as well as 53,420 flight hours when it made its last journey. The MH370 Boeing was seen for the last time on military radar at 2.14am, close to the south of Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca. Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was “Good night Malaysian three seven zero”. Half an hour later, the airline lost contact with the plane. It had been due to land at around 6.30am. The search and rescue: What happened next? Evidence from a military radar suggested the plane had suddenly changed course. Dozens of rescue planes and ships moved their search efforts to the sea west of Malaysia before the country’s Prime Minister Najib Razak claimed MH370 had been deliberately diverted by someone on board. He added that they believed it had continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with air control. In the end, the search spanned to almost three million square mile – which is 1.5 per cent of the earth’s surface. A week after disappearing satellite images of possible debris appeared to suggest that the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, south west of Australia. But the search for the black box in this area was abandoned after nothing was found. Now it seems that the search took place in the wrong location. An international investigation revealed that the search area needs to be extended to an untouched 25,000 kilometre square area in the southern Indian Ocean. Aidan Ellis 4 In total 1.5 per cent of the earth’s surface has been searched for the missing plane When was debris from the plane discovered? On July 29, 2015 – more than a year after the plane’s disappearance – debris was found by volunteers cleaning a beach in St Andre, Reunion. A week later investigators confirmed the debris did belong to MH370, but it did not help to locate the plane as it had drifted in the water. On October 7, 2017  it was announced that two wing flaps found in Mauritius came from missing flight. Some shocked relatives found it difficult to believe that this was genuinely debris from the plane. They said they think their loved ones are still alive and are being held at “an undisclosed location for unknown reasons.” AFP 4 A map showing pieces of debris scattered from the Malaysia Airlines jet that went missing in 2014 What has MH370’s debris revealed? The wing flaps showed that the plane was not in a landing position when it plunged into the ocean, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said. If the pilot was planning a controlled ditching of the plane, the wing flaps would have been configured for landing. As this was not the case, a report by the bureau concluded that the aircraft appeared to be “out of control” during its final journey. Chief search operator Peter Foley said: “You can never be 100%. We are very reluctant to express absolute certainty. “You can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone was in control.” If someone had been controlling the plane it could have glided much further than thought – meaning rescuers could have been searching the wrong area. More than 20 bits of debris suspected or confirmed to be from MH370 have washed ashore on coastlines throughout the Indian Ocean. However, a deep sea sonar search for the main underwater wreckage found nothing.

What we know The whereabouts of the Boeing 777 has remained a mystery since March 2014 By AMANDA DEVLIN 13th January 2017, 11:35 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments DOOMED Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared without a trace. Analysis of the plane’s last moments have suggested that it crashed at a high speed without a pilot in control. Alamy 4 Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board (stock image) But investigators remain puzzled over the whereabouts of the missing aircraft, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew when it vanished in March 2014 – with researchers proving that they had been looking in the wrong place. Despite experts never having found the body of any of its passengers, the hunt for MH370 is now set to end after nearly three years. News that the search teams were abandoning their mission saw a series of conspiracy theories resurface – so here are the key facts about the missing plane: What happened on March 8, 2014? Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur carrying 239 people on board. They included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadn’t been home in a year. The plane had recorded 7,525 take-offs and landings as well as 53,420 flight hours when it made its last journey.

Airbus announced Wednesday Jan. 11, 2017 that it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015. The company increased deliveries of its long-delayed A350 wide-body. (AP Photo/Francois Mori, File)   By The Associated Press Jan. 12, 2017   Today’s Business stories New sports talk station joins Eugene radio game Pay gap widest in history 5 best industries for entrepreneurs in 2017 In the age of Netflix, the nation’s social glue dissolving Business Beat More Business »   PARIS — Airbus delivered a record number of planes last year despite engine and cabin production problems, even as new orders slumped for both the European manufacturer and its U.S. rival Boeing. An unlikely customer provided a big boost to the industry in 2016: Iran, scheduled to receive its first Airbus plane in years Wednesday as part of a multibillion-dollar deal made possible by a hard-fought nuclear agreement. Airbus executives defended the superjumbo A380, which has not won as many orders as many had hoped, and played down concerns that the industry is facing a downturn after a long-running buying spree by Mideast and Asian carriers. However, they refused to issue forecasts for this year amid signs that China’s slowdown and volatile fuel prices threaten to weigh on aircraft orders. Airbus announced Wednesday that it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015 and above the company’s own expectations. Airbus increased deliveries of its long-delayed A350 wide-body to 49 overall. The A320 range — notably the fuel-efficient A321neo — dominated Airbus sales last year, when it won 731 net orders overall, compared with 1,036 the year before. Boeing says it delivered 748 planes in 2016 and took in 668 net orders, down from 768 orders in 2015. “I’m confident that we’ll have a new record in deliveries” in 2017, Airbus commercial planes sales chief John Leahy said Wednesday in Toulouse. However, he added, “That doesn’t mean that orders are going to be strong.” Fabrice Bregier, president of Airbus commercial planes, said that the first half of 2016 was “unusually difficult from a production perspective.” He said the company managed to speed up output by the end of the year after suppliers fixed problems with engines and cabin equipment. He said Airbus is now focusing on ramping up deliveries and reducing its big backlog — 6,874 planes ordered but not yet delivered. Racing with Boeing for business in post-sanctions Iran, Airbus is making the symbolic move of delivering an A321 jet to Iran Air on Wednesday, the first of 100 planes planned in an Airbus deal worth more than $18 billion dollars at list prices. Iran’s flag carrier signed a similar deal with Boeing, for 80 jetliners that won’t start arriving until 2018. Bregier said Airbus would continue work on the Iran planes despite concerns that President-elect Donald Trump could threaten the international nuclear agreement that paved the way for the aircraft contracts. Airbus also shrugged off concerns of protectionist measures threatened by Trump, noting that it’s manufacturing in the U.S. now too — and delivered its first U.S.-assembled plane last year, an A321 made in Mobile, Alabama. Mark Bobbi of IHS Markit said Airbus is likely to enjoy sustained demand for single-aisle planes this year and remain dominant over Boeing in that market, while the U.S. manufacturer will keep the lead in wide-bodies. However, he warned, demand for wide-bodies is “coming to a slump.” That’s especially bad news for the A380 superjumbo program, which he said is on “life support.” While Airbus insists that the world will need bigger planes like the A380 as population and travel grow, many airlines are turning away from major hubs and using smaller, cheaper planes instead. Airbus has scaled back production of the plane to one per month as orders have lagged. Overall, Bobbi forecast slower order rates in Asia and the Mideast after a period of “over-ordering.” A big question mark hanging over the industry is the rising oil price, which is putting pressure on airlines to cut costs — or to invest in newer, more fuel-efficient planes.

Fred Katayama reports. Video Transcript The race for new aircraft orders in 2016 has ended with Airbus beating Boeing. It posted 731 new orders - 63 more than the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer. The European plane maker also enjoyed an eight per cent rise in deliveries for the year. It beat its own forecasts, although Boeing still won that race with 748. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier: (SOUNDBITE) FABRICE BREGIER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "We have delivered 688 aircraft, which is a new Airbus record, last year was 635 if I remember well. It is another year of growth, we enjoyed 14 consecutive years of production increase." The surge in Airbus orders included a large deal with Iran, which has been on a spending spree after the lifting of sanctions. But there was one down-side - Airbus is planning to cut its A380 output from next year after demand fell. Airbus COO John Leah: (SOUNDBITE) JOHN LEAH, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, AIRBUS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "What's interesting is traffic is doubling every fifteen years and they're not going to build another Heathrow, they're not going to build another Charles-de-Gaulle or JFK. This aeroplane will start dominating the market at least at those 90 percent of long-haul passengers who fly through 55 cities today." Confident talk - but the A380 program took another blow in late December. Emirates delayed some 2017 deliveries because of pressure from the impact of low oil prices. That could put the double-decker back into a loss, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service. Multimedia AUDIO What will be the effect of the new US President on the markets?

Photo / Getty Images United Airlines plans to fly its last Boeing 747 jumbo jet late this year, retiring its largest air planes a year ahead of schedule as the iconic aircraft glides into the sunset. The decision marks the end of an era for US airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. It's also a reminder of the tough task Boeing faces as it tries to keep its newest 747 model, the -8, aloft amid waning demand for four-engine aircraft. The Chicago-based planemaker has just 28 unfilled orders, after closing 17 sales of the freighter version of the jet last year. Boeing has said it would end production if more orders don't materialise. "It's a bittersweet milestone -- this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel," United President Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees Wednesday. The Chicago-based carrier flies 20 of the 747-400 passenger model, which Boeing manufactured from 1988 and 2009. Delta Air Lines, the other US operator, is also parking the jumbo jets this year. Cathay Pacific Airways, ANA Holdings, Singapore Airlines and Air France are among carriers that have retired their 747-400 jetliners this decade amid a shift from four-engine aircraft. Twin-engine wide-bodies like Boeing's 777 and the Airbus A350 can haul almost as many people over vast distances as aviation's behemoths, the 747 and Airbus Group SE's A380 super jumbo. United's jumbos burn about 20 percent more fuel per seat than its newest 777s and require special handling from maintenance technicians. Sourcing spare parts is becoming a headache as more airlines retire their jumbo fleets, according to the airline. Continued below.

Luke Punzenberger, United spokesman United spokesman Luke Punzenberger wouldn't say which wide-body aircraft would replace the planes that have served as the airline's workhorses on trans-Pacific routes for two decades. The carrier has taken delivery of the first of 14 Boeing 777-300ERs it has ordered for long-range flying. The airline also has ordered 35 Airbus A350-1000s, but is weighing converting those twin-aisle jets to the smaller -900 variant or the mid-sized A330, United Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said in a November interview. The airline plans to move pilot and flight attendant crews assigned to the 747 transition to other aircraft, Kirby told employees. "Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities," he said. "And of course, we'll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration."

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook United Airlines is accelerating the retirement of its Boeing 747 jumbo jets, saying its last flight on the  “Queen of the Skies” will now come this year. Previously, United said its 747s would be phased out by the end of 2018. “As deeply connected as we all are to this iconic aircraft, the time has come to retire our 747 fleet from scheduled service,” United Airlines president Scott Kirby said in a Wednesday memo to workers. “It’s a bittersweet milestone — this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel.” “Today, there are more fuel-efficient, cost-effective and reliable widebody aircraft that provide an updated inflight experience for our customers traveling on long-haul flights,” Kirby added. “For these reasons, we’re saying farewell to the Queen of the Skies, which has been part of our fleet since we first flew the aircraft between California and Hawaii in 1970.” United made no mention of it in its memo, but its plans to accelerate the retirement of its 747s comes the same day the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to issue an airworthiness directive calling for potentially expensive fixes to older models of the jets – including the type flown by United. United’s last 747 flight will now come in the fourth quarter of this year, according to the memo. “We’ll be working with all of you who fly or work on the 747s to ensure a smooth transition to other fleets,” Kirby said. “Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities.” He also promised workers that the company will give the 747 an appropriate send-off. “(O)f course, we’ll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration,” Kirby wrote in the memo, adding “we’ll keep you posted with more details on her final flight in the months ahead.” IN PICTURES: Your Take: Boeing 747 photos from readers FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Your Take: Boeing 747 photos from readers  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The new 777-300ERs will seat 366. United also has a number of other new widebody planes coming into its fleet, including Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 Dreamliner models that seat 219 and 252 passengers, respectively. Many of those planes are already flying for the carrier. And, in 2018, United will begin taking delivery of new Airbus A350 widebody jets. United's acceleration of its 747 retirement also makes it seem likely that no U.S. airline will be flying the iconic jet by the year's end. Delta Air Lines is the only other U.S. carrier that currently uses 747s for passenger service. Like United, Delta also has begun to phase out its models of the jet. The carrier is on record as saying it expects to retire its last 747 by the end of this year. Delta will use several models to replace its 747s. They include new Airbus A330s that already are being delivered to the carrier as well as new Airbus A350s that Delta expects to begin receiving next year. Delta’s 747s accommodate 376 passengers.

By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News  January 12, 2017 United Airlines plans to fly its last Boeing 747 jumbo jet late this year, retiring its largest airplanes a year ahead of schedule as the iconic aircraft glides into the sunset. The decision marks the end of an era for US airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. Advertisement It’s also a reminder of the tough task the Boeing Co. faces as it tries to keep its newest 747 model, the -8, aloft amid waning demand for four-engine aircraft. The Chicago-based planemaker has just 28 unfilled orders, after closing 17 sales of the freighter version of the jet last year. Boeing has said it would end production if more orders don’t materialize. “It’s a bittersweet milestone — this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel,” United president Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees Wednesday.

Delta Air Lines Inc. is also parking its jumbo jets this year. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., ANA Holdings Inc., Singapore Airlines Ltd., and Air France are among carriers that have retired their 747-400 jetliners this decade amid a shift from four-engine aircraft to twin-engine planes, which are more fuel-efficient, cheaper to maintain, and capable of hauling nearly as many people over vast distances. United spokesman Luke Punzenberger wouldn’t say which wide-body aircraft would replace the 747-400s, which have served as the airline’s workhorses on trans-Pacific routes for two decades. The carrier has taken delivery of the first of 14 Boeing 777-300ERs it has ordered for long-range flying. The airline also has ordered 35 Airbus A350-1000s, but is weighing converting those twin-aisle jets to the smaller -900 variant or the mid-sized A330, United chief financial officer Andrew Levy said in a November interview. Advertisement The airline plans to move pilot and flight attendant crews assigned to the 747 transition to other aircraft, Kirby told employees. “Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities,” he said. “And of course, we’ll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration.” Loading comments...

REED SAXON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Boeing told staff on Tuesday of a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state. Packages will be made available to employees in Southern California. REED SAXON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By DOMINIC GATES / THE SEATTLE TIMES Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Boeing announced internally on Tuesday a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. In November, the company said it would shift some 2,400 jobs away from its Huntington Beach facilities over four years. A consolidation plan would mean the transfer of 300 Huntington Beach jobs to its Seal Beach facility and 1,600 positions to its plants in Long Beach and El Segundo. An additional 500 jobs will move to St. Louis. And 400 will move to Huntsville, Ala., from Huntington Beach and other facilities around the country. A company spokesman at the time said the company expected about 500 jobs would be eliminated company-wide by 2020 as a result of the contraction. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need for more cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo on the job cuts to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. “As we enter 2017, our plan calls for us to reduce our Engineering staff,” Hamilton told employees. “I realize some of this news is unpleasant.” Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. “We’ll be notifying employees as different areas and functions within BCA finalize their plans,” Alder said. Hamilton’s memo says details of a buyout offer will be sent Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment April 21. The buyout package will be offered to employees in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. Hamilton said there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year.

Business Home LBoard Racial politics not welcome in Johor, ruler warns Mahathir FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Airbus jets past Boeing on orders, closes gap on deliveries AFP | January 12, 2017 The figures are lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. TOULOUSE: Airbus on Wednesday said it had outstripped its own delivery expectations in 2016, closing the gap with Boeing, and beat its US archrival on orders. The European aerospace company said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, beating its own target which was hiked in November from 650 to 670. The figures were lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. It also booked a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing but showing a significant drop of nearly a third on the previous year when it logged demand for 1,036 aircraft. Last week, Boeing confirmed orders of 668 planes throughout the year, down 13% on 2015 when net orders reached 768. “2016 was a year in which we managed to not only achieve our objectives but to surpass them,” said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. It was the 14th consecutive year in which the firm chalked up record deliveries. Although it remains behind Boeing, which saw deliveries fell modestly to 748 in 2016, the European group is closing the gap. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. Supply chain issues “2016, particularly the first six months, was particularly difficult… we had more (production) difficulties than expected,” Bregier said, referring to supply chain bottlenecks with its A350 long-haul jets. But the company almost reached its delivery target for the aircraft, handing over 49 of the 50 planned deliveries, and two more submitted for flight testing. It also delivered 545 of its single-aisle A320 jetliners, 66 A330s and 28 of its A380 double-decker superjumbos, the production of which is due to be halved next year. In July, Airbus said it would cut the production rate of its A380 to one a month from 2018 to reflect reduced demand. In 2015, the manufacturer handed over 27 planes but next year aims to deliver just 12. The group has seen a slowdown in demand for long-distance carriers due in part to falling fuel prices which have impacted on the renewal of ageing fleets, but also as a result of weakening demand from Gulf carriers which peaked in recent years. Airbus ended the year with a backlog of 6,874 planes with a list price of $1 billion. IranAir gets first delivery Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger jets from budget Indian airline GoAir, in a deal worth $7.8 billion, the aircraft maker said. Also Wednesday, Airbus delivered the first of an order of 100 planes to IranAir in a deal with a list price of around $20 billion which was finalised after international sanctions on Tehran were lifted. “It’s a new, magnificent chapter and a great day” for ties between Iran and the EU, said IranAir’s chief executive Farhad Parvaresh at a ceremony in Toulouse, where Airbus is based. The “distance between us caused by political adversities have been narrowed by hard work of the international peace keepers,” he said. Bregier also hailed the renewal of ties with Iran, saying the “renaissance of Iran aviation sector is one of the most important developments for our industry for many years.” The jets will bolster Iran’s ageing passenger fleet with the addition of 46 A320 planes for medium-haul routes, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 A350s.

Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to drive for further cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo on the job cuts shortly after noon to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. “As we enter 2017, our plan calls for us to reduce our Engineering staff,” Hamilton told employees. “I realize some of this news is unpleasant. But I wanted to respect your right to know what is occurring this year.” Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. “We’ll be notifying employees as different areas and functions within BCA finalize their plans,” Alder said. Hamilton’s memo states that details of a buyout offer will be sent on Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment on April 21. The buyout package will be offered to employees in Washington state, California and South Carolina. Hamilton’s message went on to say that 60-day involuntary layoff notices affecting only engineering employees in Washington will be sent out on Jan. 20, with layoffs effective March 24. Those layoffs will affect employees in the skill classifications that were offered a buyout package last year, he said. This year’s buyout offer is going out mostly to employees in different skill classifications. There will be further involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the offer and it falls short of Boeing’s cost-saving target. Hamilton said that there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. The extent of the follow-on job cuts “will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition,” he said. “We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition,” Hamilton said. “The decision to lower the production rate on the 777 program announced in late-December underscores that environment and what we need to do to help Boeing win.” Boeing spokesman Alder said the workforce reductions in 2017, as last year, will be achieved where possible through attrition and voluntary buyouts before involuntary layoffs. He said the company will also “aggressively reduce overall spending in 2017.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

By David Wren, The Post and Courier NORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina — As Dreamliner sales face headwinds and Boeing Co. continues to chip away at $30 billion in deferred program costs, an aerospace expert says it’s looking more certain that the 787-8 model eventually will be scrapped in favor of its newer and bigger siblings. Boeing, which builds the 787 in North Charleston and Everett, hasn’t announced any plans to do away with its original Dreamliner model. “While we always expected the majority of 787 orders to be for the 787-9, both the -8 and -10 are important members of the Dreamliner family that meet specific needs and missions for our customers,” company spokeswoman Lori Gunter said. But Scott Hamilton, editor of aviation newsletter Leeham News and Comment, says it makes sense to ditch the 787-8 in favor of the more popular, more efficient — and more profitable – 787-9 and 787-10 models. Boeing needs to increase the profit margin on each aircraft sold to pay down the deferred costs, which include production and tooling charges, Hamilton said. “One way to do this is by shifting emphasis to the 787-9 and 787-10 and essentially dropping the costly 787-8,” he said. “Boeing openly discusses shifts to the 787-9/10 but denies it’s dropping the 787-8. But the fact is, there are just a handful of 787-8s scheduled for delivery from 2020.” Boeing announced 58 Dreamliner orders in 2016, down from 71 a year earlier, and low fuel prices have airlines delaying purchases of the wide-bodies that have list prices of $224 million and up. Of the 700 Dreamliners on Boeing’s order book at the beginning of this year, just 94 are for the “Dash 8.” And several of those orders are “sketchy,” according to Uresh Sheth, who tracks Dreamliner production on the “All Things 787” website. “I can see the number of 787-8 deliveries in future years dropping into the single digits,” Sheth said on his website. “Boeing will need to execute on the 787-9 and 787-10 as they will form the backbone and the cash cow of the 787 program in the years to come …” Delta Air Lines last month canceled 18 787-8 orders that it inherited from its Northwest Airlines acquisition to bring the order book for that model down to 94. Hamilton identifies another 33 iffy orders for the 787-8 from four airlines on a “watch list” due to their spotty financial histories and other concerns. Boeing has shifted nearly all 787-8 work to Everett so the North Charleston campus can focus on integrating the new 787-10 into production. Of the 27 Dash 8s scheduled for delivery this year, Sheth said, just one — to be turned over to American Airlines in February — will be built in North Charleston. “It’s a combination of Everett’s greater experience of building the 787-8, plus it gives Boeing South Carolina the chance to better integrate the 787-10 with 787-9, so as not to have to juggle all three models in 2017,” said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst for London-based Strategic Aero Research. “This is Boeing’s way of mitigating risk and is the right move to make.” Final assembly of the first 787-10 started in December, with certification and initial deliveries to take place in 2018. For now, the Dreamliner program is solid at its current production rate of 12 per month, Hamilton said in his analysis. “Production through 2019 is full,” he said. “There is emerging weakness in 2020 and a big drop in 2021. Deliveries fall off the proverbial cliff in 2022.” While there is plenty of time to get orders and fill delivery slots before that happens, Hamilton said Boeing has warned that it doesn’t expect a recovery in the wide-body market until the start of the next decade. Even if no more 787-8s are built once Boeing’s current orders are filled, Ahmad said the plane can be considered a success. “These airplanes will be in service for 30 years, even if another is never sold,” he said. “It’s a big seller in its own right. While many carriers have upgauged orders to the 787-9, the baseline 787-8 has been the start of Boeing’s technological and engineering change for all new airplanes it makes thereafter.” It’s too early in the development cycle to revamp the 787-8, but Ahmad said the plane eventually could morph into the middle-of-the-market jet Boeing has been considering. Such a plane would fill a slot between a single-aisle and wide-body, competing with the popular A321neo built by rival Airbus. “That would make the most strategic sense in the long term and give Boeing a viable 757 replacement, too,” he said. “Boeing will likely be happy to concentrate on making the 787-9 its bread-and-butter standard-bearer for the 787 family.” Most Read Everett man allegedly threatens 2 with machete EVERETT — An Everett man landed in jail after allegedly striking two… Jan 14th, 2017 by Eric Stevick Seattle Seahawks vs. Atlanta Falcons: Game Day preview Saturday’s game between the Seattle Seahawks (10-5-1) and the Atlanta Falcons (11-5)… Jan 14th, 2017 by Nick Patterson Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Jan 14th, 2017 Flu death toll rises to 8 in Snohomish County EVERETT — This year’s influenza epidemic has now killed eight people in… Jan 14th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Illegal parking lot highlights silt problems in area streams KENMORE — As Eric Adman paddled a canoe into the mouth of… Jan 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

BUSINESS Q&A Best advice for Lockheed on the F-35? 'Make Trump look big' F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II amphibious assault ship America. Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II amphibious assault ship America. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program can’t seem to escape the crosshairs of President-elect Donald Trump. In his first news conference since the election, Trump on Wednesday slammed the aircraft program, saying it is “way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.” He added, “We’re going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program.” In December, Trump tweeted that he had asked Boeing Co. to price out a “comparable” F-18 Super Hornet. That came shortly after another tweet criticizing the F-35 program’s cost as “out of control.” Built by defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp., the plane has been controversial from the start. It is a so-called fifth-generation fighter that’s a bit like a flying Swiss Army knife — designed to be stealthy, fly at supersonic speeds and use advanced sensors that can link data with ships, drones and other planes. The F-35 has three variants to serve the unique needs of the Air Force, Marines and Navy. The F-35A for the Air Force will be the most common type of the plane, with conventional takeoff and landing abilities. The F-35B for the Marines can take off from short landing strips and land vertically, while the F-35C for the Navy is built to handle the stress of takeoffs and landings on aircraft carriers.  Over the years, the program has been criticized for cost overruns and production delays. With a total estimated price tag of $379 billion to build 2,457 planes for the U.S. military, it is considered the most expensive weapons program ever, though costs have decreased since 2014. The total cost to maintain the planes over the life of the program has been estimated at more than $1 trillion. In December, the F-35 program’s executive officer, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, told reporters that the program would need $532 million more to finish system development and demonstration.  More than 3,000 planes eventually will be built for the U.S. and 11 other countries — unless Trump decides to cut back orders. The Times spoke recently with Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, an aerospace and defense market research firm, about the future of the F-35 program under the Trump administration. Here’s an edited version of the interview. How much trouble is the F-35 in, given the recent attention from Trump? It’s not much. They just have to look contrite and make Trump look big. He likes big government pronouncements that influence private sector companies. How up to date is that $400-million overrun figure Trump cites for the program? I think the latest is now a little higher than that. But of course in the broader context of this program, that’s all chump change. The real story here is the unit [per plane] prices, which are stubbornly high. Why haven’t the unit prices decreased as much as expected? It’s just fundamentally expensive and, because you’ve got three very different models, the learning curve doesn’t look like past programs. These are basically three different aircraft. They’re going at a slower pace. Trump asked Boeing to price out an F-18 that's "comparable" to an F-35. How much of the stealth and sensor features of a fifth-generation fighter can be added to the 38-year-old F-18 design? Not really very many. The Super Hornet is a Navy plane, and the Navy decided it preferred the Super Hornet years ago. That’s ancient history.  And Boeing did spec out an advanced Super Hornet, and it is a pretty interesting product. Stealth isn’t its forte but it does have interesting features. Is this a realistic possibility to replace the F-35?  The advanced Super Hornet is a pretty good plane, and I’d be surprised if the Navy did not get it. It is also a Navy plane. We’ll know [Trump’s] serious if he says, “We’re going to have Boeing and Lockheed scope out F-15s and F-16s” [for the Air Force]. The real driver behind the F-35 is the Marines. They need a vertical [landing] plane, and there’s only one of those in production — it’s called the F-35B. For them, fifth generation is less about stealth and more about creating the first supersonic short takeoff and vertical landing production aircraft. How about ordering fewer planes? Where would that leave the Navy or Marines? It would run the risk of a death spiral where costs increase because numbers decrease. The Navy would throw a party and continue to buy Super Hornets. The Marines would have a heart attack and say, “What do we do with nine very big ships [amphibious assault ships designed to accommodate F-35Bs] and our entire forward-looking strategy?” And there would be no answer. There are 11 other countries involved in the F-35 program, either as production partners or customers. What are the implications for them? Very big. Many of them have based their defense plans around this plane. So they’re taking delivery of this plane. The Royal Navy is building two large aircraft carriers on the basis of this aircraft. What's the lesson for other defense contractors under the new administration? And what should they do if they are singled out? The No. 1 lesson is to be as humble and contrite as possible. This is an effort by big government to maximize its role in the economy and in decision-making. And when you’re dealing with that kind of big-government approach, the only thing you can do is join with it and make it look as big as it wants to look.

BUSINESS Boeing plans buyouts and layoffs for engineers Boeing Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images Boeing will offer voluntary buyout packages for engineers in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. Boeing will offer voluntary buyout packages for engineers in Southern California, Washington state and South Carolina. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Dominic Gates Boeing Co. has internally announced a new round of employee buyouts for engineers companywide, including in Southern California, and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to aim for further cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo regarding the job cuts Tuesday to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. Hamilton’s memo states that details of a buyout offer will be sent Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment April 21.

As internships beckoned, she sent in a number of applications... (Samantha Masunaga) The buyout package will be offered to employees in Washington state, Southern California and South Carolina. There are about 3,500 employees in Boeing’s Southern California commercial division. Hamilton’s message went on to say that 60-day involuntary layoff notices affecting only engineering employees in Washington will be sent out Jan. 20, with layoffs effective March 24. Those layoffs will affect employees in the skill classifications that were offered a buyout package last year, he said. This year's buyout offer is going out mostly to employees in different skill classifications. There will be further involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the buyout offer and it falls short of Boeing's cost-saving target. Hamilton said there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. The extent of the additional job cuts “will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition,” he said. “We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition,” Hamilton said. “The decision to lower the production rate on the 777 program announced in late December underscores that environment and what we need to do to help Boeing win.” Best advice for Lockheed on the F-35?

He said the company also will “aggressively reduce overall spending in 2017 in non-labor areas.” Ray Goforth, executive director of Boeing’s white-collar engineering union — the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace — said the process Boeing is following in cutting jobs was worked out in discussions with the union that led to last year’s surprise agreement to a new six-year union contract. “We knew the company was going to lay off significant numbers of people,” Goforth said. “We wanted to make it as painless as possible.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree. Who should discipline police officers? Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori) Late sales surge gives Airbus lead over Boeing in 2016 Wed Jan 11th, 2017 1:48pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Benjamin Katz, Bloomberg Airbus Group booked 320 jetliner orders in December alone to rack up 731 sales for the year, extending its backlog and beating Boeing. In the last month of 2016 Airbus sold 98 new planes to Iran Air and 72 to Go Airlines India, while two other transactions saw 132 narrow-bodies purchased by buyers whose identities weren’t disclosed, according to figures released by the Toulouse, France-based company Wednesday. Airbus retained an order lead over Boeing it has held since 2012 after the U.S. business last week said 2016 sales totaled 668 aircraft, net of cancellations. Both manufacturers saw new business dwindle last year as demand ebbed after a decade-long buying spree that’s built up record backlogs. Airbus sales chief John Leahy said he’s not concerned about the slowdown. “We are essentially sold out at this point,” Leahy said in a televised briefing on the numbers. “That doesn’t mean we can’t increase our production, and we will next year and the year after. We have to build what we already have orders for, not worry about getting new orders.” Airbus’s sales tally slipped by almost 350 aircraft in 2016 and Boeing suffered a 100-jet decline, though the U.S. company’s figures didn’t include 80 planes it has also agreed to provide to Iran and which would have given it a narrow order victory. Lower oil prices are also leading airlines to carry on operating older, less efficient planes, while stuttering economies have spurred cancellations and crimped net order numbers. Among Airbus’s unidentified buyers, one is a Middle Eastern customer that’s taking 90 narrow-bodies, the sales chief said. That could refer to Saudi Arabian discount carrier Flynas, which is close to announcing an A320 deal for more than 60 planes, people familiar with the purchase plan said Monday. An Asian airline is also purchasing 42 planes, Leahy said. The leasing arm of China’s Bank of Communications has agreed to buy that number of jets, Reuters has reported. Airbus handed over 688 aircraft in the year, beating its target of 670, as it delivered 111 planes in December, a record for the month. The company shipped 49 A350s, one short of its target, versus just 12 in the first six months, after largely resolving delays at seat and interiors supplier Zodiac Aerospace, Fabrice Bregier, its chief operating officer and civil unit head, said in the briefing. “We were blocked until summer last year. But things have started to improve,” Bregier said. Issues with A320neo engines supplied by Pratt & Whitney, which led launch customer Qatar Airways to refuse to take the model, have also been addressed and deliveries should triple in 2017 from 2016’s 68, he added. Demand for the original A320-series plane remains strong, and the model could carry on securing buyers beyond this year, Bregier said. With Airbus’s order total higher than the delivery figure, it maintained a book-to-bill ratio above one and swelled its backlog to 6,874 planes. While Boeing remains the world’s No. 1 planemaker after delivering 748 jets, its backlog declined by 80 aircraft to 5,715. Leahy said that though deliveries this year will climb above 700, the book-to-bill figure is likely to be less than one, implying that orders may fall again.

Blonde Married Registered Nurses Certified Pilots Answer: Registered Nurses In 1930, Ellen Church applied for a job at Boeing as a pilot. In a single interview, she changed the course of aviation history. Church was a registered nurse and pilot, but given the social mores of the time, she was turned down for the position. The interviewing manager of the San Francisco Boeing Air Transport (BAT) office, Steve Stimpson, passed along a suggestion of hers, however, that Boeing should put registered nurses aboard planes to help calm the public’s fear of flying. Boeing Air Transport (BAT) liked the idea and reached back out to Church, hiring her as their head stewardess (making her the first female flight attendant in the process) and tasking her with hiring other nurses to serve as Boeing stewardesses. Other airlines quickly followed Boeing’s lead, also hiring their own army of registered nurses as flight attendants. The work was difficult, as they not only performed current airline stewardess duties (like attending to passengers, serving food and drink, and so forth), but also helped refuel the planes, load luggage, and helped push airplanes back into the hangar at the end of the night. Despite how hard the work was compared with, say, clerical work, women flocked to apply for the job. Not only was it seen as glamorous, but it offered excellent pay—stewardesses were paid $125 a month (equivalent to ~$1,700 adjusted for inflation), which was more than women could earn in almost any other industry at the time.

A half-century after MLK's death is Baltimore less segregated? Yes and no. Business Best advice for Lockheed on the F-35? 'Make Trump look big' F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II amphibious assault ship America. Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II amphibious assault ship America. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program can’t seem to escape the crosshairs of President-elect Donald Trump. In his first news conference since the election, Trump on Wednesday slammed the aircraft program, saying it is “way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.” He added, “We’re going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program.” In December, Trump tweeted that he had asked Boeing Co. to price out a “comparable” F-18 Super Hornet. That came shortly after another tweet criticizing the F-35 program’s cost as “out of control.” Built by defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp., the plane has been controversial from the start. It is a so-called fifth-generation fighter that’s a bit like a flying Swiss Army knife — designed to be stealthy, fly at supersonic speeds and use advanced sensors that can link data with ships, drones and other planes. The F-35 has three variants to serve the unique needs of the Air Force, Marines and Navy. The F-35A for the Air Force will be the most common type of the plane, with conventional takeoff and landing abilities. The F-35B for the Marines can take off from short landing strips and land vertically, while the F-35C for the Navy is built to handle the stress of takeoffs and landings on aircraft carriers.  Over the years, the program has been criticized for cost overruns and production delays. With a total estimated price tag of $379 billion to build 2,457 planes for the U.S. military, it is considered the most expensive weapons program ever, though costs have decreased since 2014. The total cost to maintain the planes over the life of the program has been estimated at more than $1 trillion. In December, the F-35 program’s executive officer, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, told reporters that the program would need $532 million more to finish system development and demonstration.  More than 3,000 planes eventually will be built for the U.S. and 11 other countries — unless Trump decides to cut back orders. The Times spoke recently with Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, an aerospace and defense market research firm, about the future of the F-35 program under the Trump administration. Here’s an edited version of the interview. How much trouble is the F-35 in, given the recent attention from Trump? It’s not much. They just have to look contrite and make Trump look big. He likes big government pronouncements that influence private sector companies. How up to date is that $400-million overrun figure Trump cites for the program? I think the latest is now a little higher than that. But of course in the broader context of this program, that’s all chump change. The real story here is the unit [per plane] prices, which are stubbornly high. Why haven’t the unit prices decreased as much as expected? It’s just fundamentally expensive and, because you’ve got three very different models, the learning curve doesn’t look like past programs. These are basically three different aircraft. They’re going at a slower pace. Trump asked Boeing to price out an F-18 that's "comparable" to an F-35. How much of the stealth and sensor features of a fifth-generation fighter can be added to the 38-year-old F-18 design? Not really very many. The Super Hornet is a Navy plane, and the Navy decided it preferred the Super Hornet years ago. That’s ancient history.  And Boeing did spec out an advanced Super Hornet, and it is a pretty interesting product. Stealth isn’t its forte but it does have interesting features. Is this a realistic possibility to replace the F-35?  The advanced Super Hornet is a pretty good plane, and I’d be surprised if the Navy did not get it. It is also a Navy plane. We’ll know [Trump’s] serious if he says, “We’re going to have Boeing and Lockheed scope out F-15s and F-16s” [for the Air Force]. The real driver behind the F-35 is the Marines. They need a vertical [landing] plane, and there’s only one of those in production — it’s called the F-35B. For them, fifth generation is less about stealth and more about creating the first supersonic short takeoff and vertical landing production aircraft. How about ordering fewer planes? Where would that leave the Navy or Marines? It would run the risk of a death spiral where costs increase because numbers decrease. The Navy would throw a party and continue to buy Super Hornets. The Marines would have a heart attack and say, “What do we do with nine very big ships [amphibious assault ships designed to accommodate F-35Bs] and our entire forward-looking strategy?” And there would be no answer. There are 11 other countries involved in the F-35 program, either as production partners or customers. What are the implications for them? Very big. Many of them have based their defense plans around this plane. So they’re taking delivery of this plane. The Royal Navy is building two large aircraft carriers on the basis of this aircraft. What's the lesson for other defense contractors under the new administration? And what should they do if they are singled out? The No. 1 lesson is to be as humble and contrite as possible. This is an effort by big government to maximize its role in the economy and in decision-making. And when you’re dealing with that kind of big-government approach, the only thing you can do is join with it and make it look as big as it wants to look.

But Boeing delivered significantly more airplanes, especially the higher-priced large jets. Boeing’s total production outpaced its European rival by about $15 billion. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Thanks to a large order from Iran booked in December, Airbus sold more airplanes than Boeing in 2016. But Boeing built more airplanes last year, especially the higher-value large jets. Airbus data released Wednesday reveal that the European jet maker booked a sale for 98 airplanes to Iran in December, which allowed it to outsell Boeing for the year by 63 airplanes. In production, Airbus struggled with delays especially in the first half of 2016. But in a late push, it managed to deliver a record number of airplanes in December and just beat its target for the year, with 688 jets delivered.

Still, Boeing assembly plants here and in South Carolina last year built 60 more airplanes for a total 748. And the gap between the two was even wider in the expensive large-jet category, where Boeing built 115 more widebody airplanes than Airbus. A Seattle Times analysis, based on market-pricing data from aircraft-valuation firm Avitas, shows the value of Boeing’s total production outpaced its European rival by about $15 billion, or one-third more than Airbus’ deliveries. At a news conference Wednesday in Toulouse, France, Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus’ commercial-aircraft division, said the first half of 2016 was “unusually difficult from a production perspective.” Many airplane deliveries were delayed by shortages in cabin-interior parts and the Pratt & Whitney engines for its new A320neo jets Brégier projected that with those problems behind it, Airbus will deliver more planes this year as it ramps up A320neo and A350 production. Airbus sales chief John Leahy promised “a new record in deliveries” in 2017. The 2016 delivery gap preserves Boeing’s status as the world’s No. 1 plane maker for another year. However, the planned Airbus production boost coupled with Boeing’s cuts to 777 production could see Airbus pull ahead within a few years. Airbus wins on sales Both plane makers faced a severe sales slump in 2016, though each had the typical year-end rush of orders in December. In the final sales tallies, Iran Air’s order for 98 aircraft ensured Airbus came out on top. For the year, Airbus had 731 net jet orders worth an estimated $46 billion. Boeing had total net sales of 688 jets, valued at about $44 billion. Overall, Airbus continues to dominate in sales of smaller jets. It sold 607 of its single-aisle A320 family, including 561 of the new A320neo models. Boeing sold 550 single-aisle 737s, including 534 of the new 737 MAX models. And because Boeing’s 777 jet program had few sales last year, Airbus also came out just ahead in sales of widebody jets. However, with the cyclical airline industry clearly past its peak, 2016 sales were well down from 2015 for both manufacturers. In 2016, Boeing sold 100 fewer airplanes than the year before. Airbus sold 305 fewer jets than in 2015. Leahy acknowledged in the news conference that the sales weakness will continue this year. Boeing’s Iran deal Boeing must hope it will soon be able to follow Airbus’ sale to Iran with its own large order. Boeing in December announced an agreement with Iran Air for 80 aircraft: 50 737 MAX 8s, 15 777-300ERs and 15 777-9s, valued at about $8 billion after standard discounts. That sale has not been finalized, however, and remains in some doubt because of opposition to doing business with Iran from members of Congress and the incoming Trump administration. Airbus’ jets contain many U.S.-made parts, which some industry experts had thought might prove a barrier to finalizing the Airbus order. In an apparent rush to establish the Iran sale as a done deal ahead of the inauguration of the next U.S. president, Airbus also announced the delivery of the first of its jets to Iran Air, an A321 handed over Wednesday in a ceremony in Toulouse. With Congress unlikely to want to give the European jet maker an advantage, it seems likely that Airbus’ fast-track sale and delivery may help Boeing nail down its own Iran deal.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori, File) PARIS (AP) - Airbus delivered a record number of planes last year despite engine and cabin production problems, even as new orders slumped for both the European manufacturer and its U.S. rival Boeing. An unlikely customer provided a big boost to the industry in 2016: Iran, scheduled to receive its first Airbus plane in years Wednesday as part of a multibillion-dollar deal made possible by a hard-fought nuclear agreement. Airbus executives defended the superjumbo A380, which has not won as many orders as many had hoped, and played down concerns that the industry is facing a downturn after a long-running buying spree by Mideast and Asian carriers. However, they refused to issue forecasts for this year amid signs that China’s slowdown and volatile fuel prices threaten to weigh on aircraft orders. Airbus announced Wednesday that it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015 and above the company’s own expectations. Airbus increased deliveries of its long-delayed A350 wide-body to 49 overall. The A320 range – notably the fuel-efficient A321neo – dominated Airbus sales last year, when it won 731 net orders overall, compared with 1,036 the year before. Boeing says it delivered 748 planes in 2016 and took in 668 net orders, down from 768 orders in 2015. “I’m confident that we’ll have a new record in deliveries” in 2017, Airbus commercial planes sales chief John Leahy said Wednesday in Toulouse. However, he added, “That doesn’t mean that orders are going to be strong.” Fabrice Bregier, president of Airbus commercial planes, said that the first half of 2016 was “unusually difficult from a production perspective”, but the company managed to speed up output by the end of the year after suppliers fixed problems with engines and cabin equipment. He said Airbus is now focusing on ramping up deliveries and reducing its big backlog – 6,874 planes ordered but not yet delivered. Racing with Boeing for business in post-sanctions Iran, Airbus is making the symbolic move of delivering an A321 jet to Iran Air on Wednesday, the first of 100 planes planned in an Airbus deal worth more than $18 billion dollars at list prices. Iran’s flag carrier signed a similar deal with Boeing, for 80 jetliners that won’t start arriving until 2018. Bregier said Airbus would continue work on the Iran planes despite concerns that President-elect Donald Trump could threaten the international nuclear agreement that paved the way for the aircraft contracts. Airbus also shrugged off concerns of protectionist measures threatened by Trump, noting that it’s manufacturing in the U.S. now too – and delivered its first U.S.-assembled plane last year, an A321 made in Mobile, Alabama. Mark Bobbi of IHS Markit said Airbus is likely to enjoy sustained demand for single-aisle planes this year and remain dominant over Boeing in that market, while the U.S. manufacturer will keep the lead in wide-bodies. However, he warned, demand for wide-bodies is “coming to a slump.” That’s especially bad news for the A380 superjumbo program, which he said is on “life support.” While Airbus insists that the world will need bigger planes like the A380 as population and travel grow, many airlines are turning away from major hubs and using smaller, cheaper planes instead. Airbus has scaled back production of the plane to one per month as orders have lagged. Overall, Bobbi forecast slower order rates in Asia and the Mideast after a period of “over-ordering.” A big question mark hanging over the industry is the rising oil price, which is putting pressure on airlines to cut costs – or to invest in newer, more fuel-efficient planes.

This research report also lists five other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170111005474/en/ The global military satellite payloads and subsystems market occupies a majority, accounting for about 59% of its parent market, which is the global military satellite market. It is projected to be valued at USD 5.35 billion by 2021, growing at a CAGR of over 5% through the forecast period. Geographically, the Americas occupy the largest market segment with a share of over 42%. “Owing to the changing nature of warfare, military agencies are increasingly becoming dependent on satellite-based supports to ensure mission effectiveness. Additionally, the adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and modern equipment is also swiftly increasing among military forces. Such developments are providing enormous opportunities to manufacturers of satellite payloads to offer advanced, lightweight, and next-generation systems and subsystems, which can provide cost-effective solutions to military operators,” says Moutushi Saha, one of the lead analysts at Technavio for defense research. Competitive vendor landscape The global military satellite payloads and subsystems market is highly competitive, where vendors compete on cost, the weight of satellite components, technological advancements, and reliability parameters to gain a market edge. To flourish in this competitive environment, vendors continually optimize their product development processes to provide cost-effective and high-quality products and solutions. It is also imperative that vendors cooperate and work together with prime integrators of satellites, space launch system developers, and service providers to provide quality service to consumers. The growing concerns over the hazards of space debris will lead to deorbiting systems in miniaturized satellites. Vendors who can adopt in the constantly evolving environment will see high returns on their investments in this market.

CST January 11, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Donald Trump ran a successful Presidential campaign based in part on being unconventional and shaking up the status quo. Those are not properties valued on Wall Street, where predictability and stability are preferred. While stocks overall have responded positively to Trump's stated policies, individual stocks have suffered from one of his greatest sources of unpredictability — his preference for Twitter. Trump combines Twitter with frequent off-the-cuff remarks about individual companies, often leaving investors scrambling, confused, or both. Trump's tweet on December 6 that threatened to cancel the Boeing (NYSE: BA) contract for replacing Air Force One, the specialized Presidential plane, initiated a Boeing stock decline within approximately 10 seconds of its issuance. Boeing stock dropped by 1.6% — well within weekly or even daily fluctuations for such a large corporation, but still notable because of its source. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) suffered a similar fate with a tweet regarding the cost of F-35 fighter jets, causing Lockheed stock to decline by 2.5%. Meanwhile, Toyota stock dropped 3.1% in a day when Trump tweeted on January 5: "Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax." For a more general case, consider pharmaceutical companies. A December 7 tweet from Trump pledging to bring down drug prices triggered a 4.6% drop in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (INDEXNASDAQ: NBI). The Index remains relatively flat at years end. All four cases represent Trump's general deal-making philosophy: establish a strong, even outrageous position, and begin bargaining from there. In that context, the tweets make sense — but they still cause Wall Street headaches because nobody is sure what the end game will be. There's also a sense that Trump may overestimate what he can do from the Oval Office, because Congress still controls the purse strings. Companies who intend to move jobs overseas or refuse to repatriate overseas funds back into the U.S. are likely targets of negative tweets as well. Any of those companies that derive significant revenue from government contracts could be in the Trump crosshairs. Trump may keep people guessing with his tweets, but one thing seems clear — his use of Twitter as a communications tool will continue throughout his Presidency. Are you tempted to pad your retirement funds by making money off the Donald's tweetstorms? That could turn into a 24/7 task. Trump has been known to unleash overnight tweets, and it's easy to see how a provocative tweet before the start of the trading day can send futures plummeting. Keep in mind that speed is of the essence. Even if you can predict the market responses properly, do you have the time and means to execute trades quickly enough for it to matter? Remember that you are competing against day traders and other professionals that specialize in the field and likely have greater resources than yours, including computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Here's the best way to respond to Trump's stock-altering tweets: don't. The effect of Trump's tweets, especially on large corporations, tends to be transient. Boeing stock may have taken temporary dips but is ending the year on the same overall upward trend that it has been on since September. Lockheed Martin stock remains strong and well above its pre-election mark despite multiple negative post-election Trump tweets. Even if the effects are long lasting, you should be able to handle significant hits to individual stocks or groups of stocks within your portfolio if you have maintained the proper diversity in your stocks to meet your investment goals and risk requirements. It's wise to review your retirement plan to see if it has kept up with your requirements, but do not overreact. The whole point of maintaining a balanced portfolio is to minimize the effect of unpredictable risk, and President Trump is likely to define the term "unpredictable risk" for years to come.

The European aerospace company said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, beating its own target which was hiked in November from 650 to 670. The figures were lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. It also booked a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing but showing a significant drop of nearly a third on the previous year when it logged demand for 1,036 aircraft. Last week, Boeing confirmed orders of 668 planes throughout the year, down 13 percent on 2015 when net orders reached 768. "2016 was a year in which we managed to not only achieve our objectives but to surpass them," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. It was the 14th consecutive year in which the firm chalked up record deliveries. Although it remains behind Boeing, which saw deliveries fell modestly to 748 in 2016, the European group is closing the gap. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. - Supply chain issues - "2016, particularly the first six months, was particularly difficult... we had more (production) difficulties than expected," Bregier said, referring to supply chain bottlenecks with its A350 long-haul jets. But the company almost reached its delivery target for the aircraft, handing over 49 of the 50 planned deliveries, and two more submitted for flight testing. It also delivered 545 of its single-aisle A320 jetliners, 66 A330s and 28 of its A380 double-decker superjumbos, the production of which is due to be halved next year. In July, Airbus said it would cut the production rate of its A380 to one a month from 2018 to reflect reduced demand. In 2015, the manufacturer handed over 27 planes but next year aims to deliver just 12. The group has seen a slowdown in demand for long-distance carriers due in part to falling fuel prices which have impacted on the renewal of ageing fleets, but also as a result of weakening demand from Gulf carriers which peaked in recent years. Airbus ended the year with a backlog of 6,874 planes with a list price of $1 billion. - IranAir gets first delivery - Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger jets from budget Indian airline GoAir, in a deal worth $7.8 billion, the aircraft maker said. Also Wednesday, Airbus delivered the first of an order of 100 planes to IranAir in a deal with a list price of around $20 billion which was finalised after international sanctions on Tehran were lifted. "It's a new, magnificent chapter and a great day" for ties between Iran and the EU, said IranAir's chief executive Farhad Parvaresh at a ceremony in Toulouse, where Airbus is based. The "distance between us caused by political adversities have been narrowed by hard work of the international peace keepers," he said. Bregier also hailed the renewal of ties with Iran, saying the "renaissance of Iran aviation sector is one of the most important developments for our industry for many years." The jets will bolster Iran's ageing passenger fleet with the addition of 46 A320 planes for medium-haul routes, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 A350s. sw/ef/spi/hmw/jh © 2017 AFP 0 Comments To This Article Leave a Reply Most Read Le Pen to push for 'Frexit' if EU refuse...

The European planemaker announced it delivered 688 aircraft compared with 748 by its bigger US rival. In the race for new orders Airbus posting 731 to Boeing’s 668. Airbus planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year which was due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment.

The head of IranAir took delivery on Wednesday of the first jet – an A321. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh said it was a “sunny day” for peace and friendship between Iran and Europe. The Iranians have also ordered 80 aircraft from Boeing and are expected to seal an order for 20 turboprops from Europe’s ATR. The first Airbus</a> plane (A321) that will now.

Even though deliveries of 28 of the giant planes brought it up to break-even for 2016, Emirates has delayed some 2017 deliveries and Airbus will cut output from 2018. #Airbus sales chief John Leahy reels off the traditional surge in Dec orders pic.twitter.com/5y2s3gsg2T— ReutersAerospaceNews (@ReutersAero) January 11, 2017 Euronews spoke to Airbus’ sales chief John Leahy. Anne Glemarec, Euronews: “You’ve signed a deal for about 100 aircraft with Iran, thanks to the US administration’s green light. How worried are you that with Trump in the White House, that deal could be at risk?” John Leahy: “I think that whether or not Trump would have done this deal had he been president is immaterial. The fact is the deal was done, it looks like the Iranians are honouring the deal, these aren’t military aircraft, they’re civil aircraft, it improves safety in Iran and both Boeing and Airbus will be creating more jobs, so I believe that the Iranians will honour their commitment and I would think the US will continue going through as they are issuing the licences.” Euronews: “What’s the future for the A380 superjumbo, with demand so low?” John Leahy: “Everybody in this industry from the suppliers to the airlines agree that 15 years from now, traffic will have doubled again. Is Charles de Gaulle [airport] going to double in size? Is Frankfurt? Is London Heathrow or are we going to build a new Heathrow? A new Frankfurt? A new JFK? Of course we’re not. The only way for it to double would be to have larger aircraft. Now, we happen to have the world’s largest aircraft in the A380 and fortunately it’s the aircraft that passengers go out of their way to fly. Over 60 percent of the passengers flying in the A380 tell us they would go out of their way to fly on it and they would pay more money to fly on it.

Having a factory in Mobile, Alabama, that employs more than 1,000 people making A320 single-aisle jets shows Airbus’s commitment to the U.S., one of the biggest markets for its aircraft, Fabrice Bregier, who runs the European planemaker’s jetliner arm, said in an interview Wednesday. Fabrice Bregier Photographer: Balint Porneczi/Bloomberg “We delivered on our promises and we created American jobs,” Bregier said, adding that the plant is in a “fantastic location.” The 53-acre site handed its first plane to JetBlue Airways Corp. in 2016 and produced 16 more for U.S. carriers in the year, with production set to accelerate to four aircraft a month in 2017, he said. Trump has espoused a protectionist approach in the run-up to his inauguration on Jan. 20, while condemning homegrown companies that have moved jobs overseas -- something that could work in Airbus’s favor given the $600 million Alabama investment. Ford Motor Co. last week scrapped plans for a $1.6 billion expansion in Mexico and said it would add posts in Michigan after Trump promised levies on companies outsourcing employment. Aerospace manufacturers including Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. and United Technologies Corp. have also been singled out for criticism over jobs or the cost of government contracts. Supply-Chain Boost “He is supposed to support the U.S. economy and U.S. jobs, and as a matter of fact we anticipated that, because we decided a few years ago to invest massively in the assembly of the A320,” Bregier told Bloomberg TV. Not only is Airbus now a major employer in the U.S., it’s a bigger supporter of component manufacturers there than its main rival, the executive added. “We are probably procuring more U.S. equipment than our competitor Boeing,” he said. “Our biggest supply-chain contributor is American suppliers.” Airbus, which has more than 1,400 jets operating with North American carriers and 500 orders outstanding, spends more than 40 percent of its aircraft-related procurement in the U.S., helping to support almost 250,000 jobs across 40 states at companies included Alcoa Corp., General Electric Co., Honeywell International Inc. and Rockwell Collins Inc., according to its website. Boeing has a U.S. workforce of almost 140,000 employees, Doug Alder, a spokesman for the Chicago-based company said in an e-mail. About 80 percent of Boeing’s suppliers are in the U.S. In 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, the U.S. planemaker paid about $50 billion to more than 13,600 businesses in the country, supporting 1.5 million jobs at its suppliers, Alder said. Iran Sale Bregier said he has no concerns about a deal to sell 100 planes to Iran surviving the U.S. leadership transition, despite Trump’s criticism of the easing of sanctions on trade with the Islamic republic. “We are an international player and Iran is a big market,” he said. “We abide by all the regulations: international, European and, of course, American. We got all the international agreements and licenses, and especially licenses from the U.S. administration, which was quite a long process.” Bregier spoke at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, after the company revealed that it racked up 731 sales in 2016, lifting its backlog and beating Boeing, aided by 320 jetliner orders in December alone, the Iran Air planes among them. Its U.S. rival has agreed to provide a batch of 80 jets to the Mideast carrier. Airbus delivered 688 aircraft in the year, compared with Boeing’s 748.

The move comes in the backdrop of operating losses in two consecutive quarters in FY 2017, largely blamed on increase in lease rentals. Air India suffered an operating loss of Rs 460 crore in the July-September period, after another Rs 246-crore loss in the financial year's first quarter, April-June. Air India has 27 Boeing 787s on order and has already inducted 23 aircraft. Twenty-one of them are on lease following sale-lease back transaction. The airline is planning a debt-funded acquisition for remaining aircraft (including two in service) which it will acquire till August 2017. Similarly, Air India plans to acquire 3 Boeing 777 aircraft in 2018 raising debt instead of sale-lease model. Recently the airline management made a presentation to the civil aviation and finance ministries seeking their approval to raise loans and switch to acquisition route. Air India is seeking a 25-year loan from the Life Insurance Corporation with five years moratorium of principle payment to fund the aircraft. "We feel outright purchase of aircraft is more economical option than leasing. The burden of leasing cost remains in the books for a long time," Air India chairperson Ashwani Lohani told Business Standard. While traditionally Air India has always opted for the aircraft acquisition route with government guaranteed loans it decided to carry out sale and lease back transactions for its Boeing 787 planes following recommendation of government panel which reviewed its turn around plan. The panel had suggested sale and lease back route as it would improve cash position, help in reducing losses, improve debt-equity ratio and lower interest burden. But now the national carrier doing a rethink considering the shortcomings of sale and lease back model. This is also in the context of operating losses posted by the airline. Lease rent is included in operating expense while interest cost is not recorded in it. According to the airline, the shortcomings are no rights for termination of lease contract, stringent clauses for aircraft redelivery on lease expiry and 8-12 months of security deposit. " For earlier aircraft taking into account taking into lease rentals, security deposits and cost of redelivery of aircraft the cash outflow works out higher," Air India said.

Alaska Air’s nonstop service from Portland International (PDX) to Baltimore/Washington, Milwaukee and Philadelphia will be seasonal. Flights between Portland and Albuquerque will operate year-round. "We're super excited to launch four new nonstop daily routes from Portland, further enhancing our offerings for our guests in the Rose City," John Kirby, Alaska's VP of capacity planning, says in a statement. "At 55 nonstop destinations and counting, we continue to connect our valued Portland customers to the places they want to go." "We're happy that Alaska is once again expanding its network from PDX with four new service announcements," added David Zielke, Port of Portland director of air service development. "Albuquerque, Baltimore and Philadelphia offer Portland-area travelers more convenient nonstop options. And, until now, Milwaukee was one of the top 10 markets to which Portland didn't have nonstop service.” The details of Alaska Air’s new routes are as follows: Albuquerque Daily service on Horizon Air-operated Embraer E175 aircraft begins Aug. 18 and will continue all year. Baltimore/Washington (BWI) Daily service on Boeing 737 aircraft begins June 6 and runs through Aug. 26 Milwaukee Daily service on SkyWest-operated Embraer E175 aircraft begins June 5 and runs through Aug. 26. The eastbound flight will be a red-eye, departing Portland at 11:10 p.m. and landing in Milwaukee at 5:02 a.m. (all times local). Philadelphia Daily service on Boeing 737 aircraft begins May 22 and runs through Aug. 26. The eastbound flight will be a red-eye, departing Portland at 8:39 p.m. and landing in Philadelphia at 4:50 a.m. (all times local). Alaska Airlines' new Portland service comes just a month after it official closed on its acquisition of San Francisco-based Virgin America. Those two airlines are now set to combine operations in a merger that will make the combined carrier a West Coast juggernaut. USA TODAY Alaska Air begins merger with Virgin America, promises 'more to love' Both Alaska Air and Virgin America enjoy strong customer-service reputations, though the airlines images are otherwise very different. In particular, Virgin America's hip image and mood-light cabin have won it a loyal base of customers. Alaska Airlines Brad Tilden has said the company has not yet decided whether to fold the Virgin America brand into Alaska Airlines or to find a way to keep each of the brands alive. “We appreciate that there is great interest in the future of the Virgin America brand among customers and employees alike,” Tilden said to Today in the Sky in December. “This is a big decision and one that deserves months of thoughtful and thorough analysis. We plan to make a decision about the Virgin America brand early next year.” TWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky IN PICTURES:  Alaska Airlines, Virgin America kick off merger with celebration FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Alaska Airlines, Virgin America kick off merger with celebration  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, the European planemaker said on Wednesday it delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with an official company forecast of more than 650 and a goal set by its finance director of more than 670. Supply chain issues Deliveries rebounded at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Airbus remained behind the world’s biggest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, in deliveries, but scored another win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016. Boeing delivered 748 aircraft and took 668 net orders last year. Lifting of sanctions The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two aircraft were bought back from another customer that no longer needs them and are unused, sales chief John Leahy said. IranAir was expected to take delivery of the first aircraft in France later on Wednesday. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China’s Bank of Communications. But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy. Industry orders peaked in 2015. Leahy warned of a further slowdown in orders in 2017 and said Airbus would be unable to sell as many aircraft as it delivers this year. But he dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically “overbook” to dampen the risk of airline failures. Speaking to a group of reporters after the news conference, he insisted deliveries would continue to rise “for several years” despite cyclical swings in orders as planemakers work through record waiting lists for planes.

Supervalu earned an adjusted 5 cents per share, short of the consensus forecast of 13 cents per share. Signet Jewelers — The jewelry retailer reported a 4.6 percent drop in holiday same-store sales, a performance it calls "disappointing." Signet said the drop in sales was due primarily to underperformance in its Sterling e-commerce business. Ford — The automaker said 2017 would be a less profitable year than 2016. That did, however, match a prior forecast. Ford also declared a special dividend of 5 cents per share in addition to its regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share. Boeing — Boeing will conduct involuntary layoffs of engineers this year, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. No specific numbers were mentioned, and the jet maker also mentioned voluntary layoffs in a variety of job categories. Separately, Boeing was edged out by rival Airbus in new orders for 2016, thanks to a late surge. Airbus had 688 new orders for the year, 20 more than Boeing. Volkswagen — The automaker confirmed that it was in advanced talks involving a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department involving its diesel emissions scandal, and that it would plead guilty to criminal misconduct. Tesla Motors — Tesla hired Apple software engineer Chris Lattner to oversee the development of the electric car maker's Autopilot self-driving software. United Continental — The airline raised revenue projections for the just-concluded fourth quarter and year, thanks to stronger performance in November and December. Wells Fargo — The bank put a new compensation plan in place, following the controversy involving its sales practices. The new plan puts incentives in place that center on customer service rather than sales goals. U.S. Bancorp — The stock was named a "top" pick and given a "buy" rating in a new report by UBS. Rival regional banks BB&T, PNC, and SunTrust were all given ratings of "neutral." AT&T — AT&T was downgraded to "hold" from "buy" at Deutsche Bank, which points to a more balanced risk/reward picture at current price levels as well as tougher fundamentals. Stryker — Stryker said 2016 profit would come in at the high end of its prior forecasts, with the medical device maker helped by both stronger sales and recent acquisitions. Airline stocks — The Justice Department will not bring any action against the industry following an investigation into collusion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The probe had focused on whether airlines were coordinating flight capacity to keep airfares high. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Continental, and Southwest had all received subpoenas asking for information about their practices. Netflix — Netflix was added to JPMorgan Chase's U.S. Focus List. The firm called Netflix its #2 large cap stock pick behind Facebook, saying the video stream service should benefit from stronger content, increased revenue, and putting a recent price increase behind it.

Finance Search Airbus jets past Boeing on orders, closes gap on deliveriesBy Sonia WOLF | AFP – Wed, Jan 11, 2017 5:06 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo Airbus said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, beating its own target which was hiked in November from 650 to 670 Airbus on Wednesday said it had outstripped its own delivery expectations in 2016, closing the gap with Boeing, and beat its US archrival on orders. The European aerospace company said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, beating its own target which was hiked in November from 650 to 670. The figures were lifted by a last-minute surge in December when it handed over 111 aircraft. It also booked a total of 731 net orders, beating Boeing but showing a significant drop of nearly a third on the previous year when it logged demand for 1,036 aircraft. Last week, Boeing confirmed orders of 668 planes throughout the year, down 13 percent on 2015 when net orders reached 768. "2016 was a year in which we managed to not only achieve our objectives but to surpass them," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. It was the 14th consecutive year in which the firm chalked up record deliveries. Although it remains behind Boeing, which saw deliveries fell modestly to 748 in 2016, the European group is closing the gap. Delivery figures are of interest to analysts and investors as it is at that stage when manufacturers receive the bulk of payment. - Supply chain issues - "2016, particularly the first six months, was particularly difficult... we had more (production) difficulties than expected," Bregier said, referring to supply chain bottlenecks with its A350 long-haul jets. But the company almost reached its delivery target for the aircraft, handing over 49 of the 50 planned deliveries, and two more submitted for flight testing. It also delivered 545 of its single-aisle A320 jetliners, 66 A330s and 28 of its A380 double-decker superjumbos, the production of which is due to be halved next year. In July, Airbus said it would cut the production rate of its A380 to one a month from 2018 to reflect reduced demand. In 2015, the manufacturer handed over 27 planes but next year aims to deliver just 12. The group has seen a slowdown in demand for long-distance carriers due in part to falling fuel prices which have impacted on the renewal of ageing fleets, but also as a result of weakening demand from Gulf carriers which peaked in recent years. Airbus ended the year with a backlog of 6,874 planes with a list price of $1 billion. - IranAir gets first delivery - Among the contracts signed in December was an order for 72 A320neo passenger jets from budget Indian airline GoAir, in a deal worth $7.8 billion, the aircraft maker said. Also Wednesday, Airbus delivered the first of an order of 100 planes to IranAir in a deal with a list price of around $20 billion which was finalised after international sanctions on Tehran were lifted. "It's a new, magnificent chapter and a great day" for ties between Iran and the EU, said IranAir's chief executive Farhad Parvaresh at a ceremony in Toulouse, where Airbus is based. The "distance between us caused by political adversities have been narrowed by hard work of the international peace keepers," he said. Bregier also hailed the renewal of ties with Iran, saying the "renaissance of Iran aviation sector is one of the most important developments for our industry for many years." The jets will bolster Iran's ageing passenger fleet with the addition of 46 A320 planes for medium-haul routes, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 A350s.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:50 PM, January 11, 2017 Updated: 8:20 AM, January 12, 2017 TOULOUSE, France - Airbus posted an eight percent rise in deliveries last year, beating its own forecasts by a comfortable margin to set a company record, and pulled off a last-minute surge in orders to beat arch-rival Boeing <BA.N> in the race for new orders. But the European planemaker warned of a further slowdown of industry orders in 2017 as the aerospace industry turns its attention to producing what it already has on its order books, following an extended order boom. Analysts say orders are shrinking due to concerns over weakening economies and relatively low oil prices, while a wave of demand for new fuel-saving models has mainly run its course. "What kept the orders party going much longer than usual was new product launches and there are few products to be launched," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Teal Group. "These are not hard times. This is merely the party coming to its inevitable end." Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, Airbus said it had delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with its most recent forecast of 670. Deliveries rebounded sharply at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus <AIR.PA> shares rose 0.4 percent. Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Airbus announced a fourth successive win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016, including more than 300 orders in December, confirming potential business reported earlier by Reuters. Boeing kept the title of No.1 producer with 748 deliveries but registered a lower figure of 668 net orders. The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two were bought back from another customer, sales chief John Leahy said. Boeing has sold 80 jets to Iran but did not include this in its 2016 tally, a move that would apparently have put it ahead of Airbus. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China's Bank of Communications. But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy. Leahy dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically "overbook" to dampen the risk of airline failures. Speaking to a group of reporters after the news conference, he insisted deliveries would continue to rise "for several years" despite cyclical swings in orders as planemakers work through record waiting lists for planes.

Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, the European planemaker said on Wednesday it delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with an official company forecast of more than 650 and a goal set by its finance director of more than 670. Deliveries rebounded at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Airbus remained behind the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, in deliveries, but scored another win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016. Boeing delivered 748 aircraft and took 668 net orders last year. The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two aircraft were bought back from another customer that no longer needs them and are unused, sales chief John Leahy said. IranAir was expected to take delivery of the first aircraft in France later on Wednesday. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China's Bank of Communications. But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy. Industry orders peaked in 2015. Leahy warned of a further slowdown in orders in 2017 and said Airbus would be unable to sell as many aircraft as it delivers this year. But he dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically "overbook" to dampen the risk of airline failures. Speaking to a group of reporters after the news conference, he insisted deliveries would continue to rise "for several years" despite cyclical swings in orders as planemakers work through record waiting lists for planes.

Trump’s Twitter posts and public rebuke of major companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Motors have made other companies worry they may be next, according to businesses polled by the agency. "Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG!," Trump tweeted in December. He will become the US president on January 20. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 3 января 2017 г. This and other Trump’s tweets have forced Boeing and Lockheed Martin to promise to cut costs; Ford gave up a plan to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead create 2,000 jobs in the US; United Tech's Carrier has pledged to keep half of 2,100 jobs it wanted to shift to Mexico in the US. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 6 декабря 2016 г. According to Reuters, many mergers and acquisitions in the US that involve American job cuts and moving businesses overseas have been postponed after Trump’s election for fear of being called "unpatriotic", several top Wall Street bankers said. Thus, a takeover of $3.8 billion Bermuda-based White Mountains Insurance Group was scrapped because it implied moving the American buyers’ taxes abroad. The potential buyers were afraid of being called "anti-American," and quit the deal. After China critic Peter Navarro was appointed as White House trade consultant, some businesses are considering moving their production out of China. 'Jack and I are going to do some great things': #Trump & #Alibaba CEO talk of creating 1mn #US jobs https://t.co/ZAd4l5Vj8Qpic.twitter.com/sj0DtUA9PA— RT (@RT_com) 10 января 2017 г. "Whether it’s taking higher costs into account or operationally preparing for moving manufacturing (out of China), companies are thinking about what to do," said James Park, CEO of wearable fitness device maker Fitbit, which operates in China. Others consider hiring specialists to monitor Trump’s tweets. "Back in December the board was already asking questions: 'What’s the plan in terms of what happens if he comes after us, are we ready? The board is asking us if we have a PR firm at the ready, if we have a person monitoring his Twitter," said a top executive at a large US defense contractor, as quoted by Reuters. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 22 декабря 2016 г. "Our plan is to not get into a fight, and concede immediately. The reality is that we're trying to stay below the radar,” the executive added, asking not to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter.

Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to drive for further cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo on the job cuts shortly after noon to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. “As we enter 2017, our plan calls for us to reduce our Engineering staff,” Hamilton told employees. “I realize some of this news is unpleasant. But I wanted to respect your right to know what is occurring this year.” Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. “We’ll be notifying employees as different areas and functions within BCA finalize their plans,” Alder said. Hamilton’s memo states that details of a buyout offer will be sent on Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment on April 21. The buyout package will be offered to employees in Washington state, southern California and South Carolina. Hamilton’s message went on to say that 60-day involuntary layoff notices affecting only engineering employees in Washington will be sent out on Jan. 20, with layoffs effective March 24. Those layoffs will affect employees in the skill classifications that were offered a buyout package last year, he said. This year’s buyout offer is going out mostly to employees in different skill classifications. There will be further involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the offer and it falls short of Boeing’s cost-saving target. Hamilton said that there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. The extent of the follow-on job cuts “will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition,” he said. “We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition,” Hamilton said. “The decision to lower the production rate on the 777 program announced in late-December underscores that environment and what we need to do to help Boeing win.” Boeing spokesman Alder said the workforce reductions in 2017, as last year, will be achieved where possible through attrition and voluntary buyouts before involuntary layoffs. He said the company will also “aggressively reduce overall spending in 2017 in non-labor areas.” Ray Goforth, executive director of Boeing’s white-collar engineering union — the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, or SPEEA — said the process Boeing is following in cutting jobs was worked out in discussions with the union that led to last year’s surprise agreement to a new six-year SPEEA contract. “This is all stuff we negotiated into that contract,” Goforth said. “We knew the company was going to lay off significant numbers of people. We wanted to make it as painless as possible.” He said that of the jobs cuts through the end of November, 70 percent were voluntary. Last year, a combination of leaving open positions unfilled, buyouts and forced layoffs slashed the Boeing workforce in Washington state by 7,357 jobs — a 9.3 percent reduction overall.

Those are not properties valued on Wall Street, where predictability and stability are preferred. While stocks overall have responded positively to Trump's stated policies, individual stocks have suffered from one of his greatest sources of unpredictability — his preference for Twitter. Trump combines Twitter with frequent off-the-cuff remarks about individual companies, often leaving investors scrambling, confused, or both. Trump's tweet on December 6 that threatened to cancel the Boeing (NYSE: BA) contract for replacing Air Force One, the specialized Presidential plane, initiated a Boeing stock decline within approximately 10 seconds of its issuance. Boeing stock dropped by 1.6% — well within weekly or even daily fluctuations for such a large corporation, but still notable because of its source. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) suffered a similar fate with a tweet regarding the cost of F-35 fighter jets, causing Lockheed stock to decline by 2.5%. Meanwhile, Toyota stock dropped 3.1% in a day when Trump tweeted on January 5: "Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax." For a more general case, consider pharmaceutical companies. A December 7 tweet from Trump pledging to bring down drug prices triggered a 4.6% drop in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (INDEXNASDAQ: NBI). The Index remains relatively flat at years end. All four cases represent Trump's general deal-making philosophy: establish a strong, even outrageous position, and begin bargaining from there. In that context, the tweets make sense — but they still cause Wall Street headaches because nobody is sure what the end game will be. There's also a sense that Trump may overestimate what he can do from the Oval Office, because Congress still controls the purse strings. Companies who intend to move jobs overseas or refuse to repatriate overseas funds back into the U.S. are likely targets of negative tweets as well. Any of those companies that derive significant revenue from government contracts could be in the Trump crosshairs. Trump may keep people guessing with his tweets, but one thing seems clear — his use of Twitter as a communications tool will continue throughout his Presidency. Are you tempted to pad your retirement funds by making money off the Donald's tweetstorms? That could turn into a 24/7 task. Trump has been known to unleash overnight tweets, and it's easy to see how a provocative tweet before the start of the trading day can send futures plummeting. Keep in mind that speed is of the essence. Even if you can predict the market responses properly, do you have the time and means to execute trades quickly enough for it to matter? Remember that you are competing against day traders and other professionals that specialize in the field and likely have greater resources than yours, including computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Here's the best way to respond to Trump's stock-altering tweets: don't. The effect of Trump's tweets, especially on large corporations, tends to be transient. Boeing stock may have taken temporary dips but is ending the year on the same overall upward trend that it has been on since September. Lockheed Martin stock remains strong and well above its pre-election mark despite multiple negative post-election Trump tweets. Even if the effects are long lasting, you should be able to handle significant hits to individual stocks or groups of stocks within your portfolio if you have maintained the proper diversity in your stocks to meet your investment goals and risk requirements. It's wise to review your retirement plan to see if it has kept up with your requirements, but do not overreact. The whole point of maintaining a balanced portfolio is to minimize the effect of unpredictable risk, and President Trump is likely to define the term "unpredictable risk" for years to come.

The reductions, disclosed in an internal memo seen by Reuters, also include dozens of job categories eligible for voluntary layoffs in Washington state, southern California and South Carolina. Boeing did not indicate the number of reductions the company planned. Vice Chairman Ray Conner and Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Officer Kevin McAllister said last month that Boeing would continue job cuts in 2017. The company slashed employment by 10,828 jobs last year. About two-thirds of those reductions were in Washington state. "While we have made good progress, more changes are needed to ensure our long-term future," John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, wrote in the memo. "We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition." The announcement came as Boeing teamed up with a new lobbying group on Tuesday to defend $8.7 billion of tax breaks in Washington state granted to the aerospace industry in 2013. The new group opposes efforts to tie the incentives to Boeing employment. The engineering layoffs are part of a larger reduction at the company's airplane unit. "Once plans are finalized across other functions, that information will be shared with employees," Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said in an email. "Each function will determine its own plan." The engineering reductions will take place in stages. Voluntary layoff invitations are being sent Jan. 13 and will take effect April 21. Notices for involuntary reductions will be sent Jan. 20, with layoffs planned for March 24. Boeing plans two more rounds of engineering layoffs later in the year "driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition," Hamilton said in the memo.

The two-day sale ends at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday (Jan. 11) and is good for travel from Jan. 18 through March 8. Travel from Feb. 17 through Feb. 26 is blacked out. Among the other fine print: Sale fares on most routes are not available on Fridays and Sundays. Only nonstop itineraries are included in the sale pricing. More fine print: The sale fares fall under JetBlue’s “Blue” fare type, which does not include free checked baggage as part of the purchase price. The fare-sale offer is also subject to capacity controls, meaning the special fares could sell out on individual flights. A cursory check as of early Monday afternoon showed decent availability of the advertised fares. USA TODAY WOW: $69 one-way fares to Europe now on sale It’s a common practice among airlines to roll out fare sales to help fill empty seats during low-demand periods. The period from early January into earlier March is one of the slowest, with demand for flights dropping after the big winter holidays. Demand typically remains lukewarm until before picking up again ahead of the traditional “spring break” window in March.  But while fare sales have long been employed by carriers during such windows, flash sales like JetBlue’s two-day event have become increasingly common as the industry tries to exploit online sales channels. JetBlue rolls out several such sales a year. One of its latest came just in November, when it sold seats for many of the same lower-demand winter dates. But it's perhaps Southwest that has become the best-known for the tactic. The Dallas-based carrier drops prices to as low as $49 each way in extraordinarily broad 72-hour sales that typically rolls out twice a year. One of those sales in June 2015 received so much interest that the carier was forced to extend it by a day after bargain-seekers crashed its website. JetBlue’s current two-day sale covers a variety of routes, with one-way fares listed as low as $34 each way. Bargain-hunters seeking deals on JetBlue will find most of the airline’s best deals are to or from its hubs and focus cities, which include New York JFK, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Long Beach, Calif. The cheapest fares are generally on the shortest routes, but there are exceptions. Among those is the $89 each-way fare on the 1,820-mile route between Albuquerque and New York JFK. Conversely, the short 300-mile route between New York JFK and Buffalo cost almost as much at $79 each way. Ditto for the 280-mile route between Boston and Philadelphia, which was listed at $89 each way. Many international routes also are included, such as JetBlue's $79 one-way fare on the 1,281-mile route between Orlando and Mexico City or the $124 one-way fare between Fort Lauderdale and Bogota, Colombia. The sale appears to top out at $199 each way on domestic routes (San Diego-New York JFK) and at $224 each way overall (Boston-Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Scroll down for a partial list of routes with fares of $74 or less each way in JetBlue’s sale. Or check out the full list of routes included in JetBlue’s sale on the carrier’s website.

In this Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2014, file photo, Boeing 737-800 airplanes are on the assembly line at Boeing's 737 assembly facility in Renton, Wash. (Ted S. Warren / AP) By Dominic Gates The Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS SEATTLE – Boeing announced internally on Tuesday a new round of employee buyouts for engineers company-wide and warned that layoff notices will follow later this month to engineers in Washington state, where the company has a large presence. Management did not cite a target for the number of projected job cuts. The news comes after company Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, or BCA, Kevin McAllister, warned in December of the need to drive for further cuts in 2017. John Hamilton, BCA vice president of engineering, sent a memo on the job cuts shortly after noon to all BCA engineering employees, managers and executives. “As we enter 2017, our plan calls for us to reduce our Engineering staff,” Hamilton told employees. “I realize some of this news is unpleasant. But I wanted to respect your right to know what is occurring this year.” Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said similar announcements will be coming for other work groups, such as production workers, as plans are finalized. “We’ll be notifying employees as different areas and functions within BCA finalize their plans,” Alder said. Hamilton’s memo states that details of a buyout offer will be sent on Friday to engineering employees in eligible skill classifications. Those who accept the offered buyout will end their employment on April 21. The buyout package will be offered to employees in Washington state, southern California and South Carolina. Hamilton’s message went on to say that 60-day involuntary layoff notices affecting only engineering employees in Washington will be sent out on Jan. 20, with layoffs effective March 24. Those layoffs will affect employees in the skill classifications that were offered a buyout package last year, he said. This year’s buyout offer is going out mostly to employees in different skill classifications. There will be further involuntary layoffs if not enough people accept the offer and it falls short of Boeing’s cost-saving target. Hamilton said that there will be two additional rounds of buyouts and layoffs in engineering later this year. The extent of the follow-on job cuts “will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition,” he said. “We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition,” Hamilton said. “The decision to lower the production rate on the 777 program announced in late-December underscores that environment and what we need to do to help Boeing win.” Boeing spokesman Alder said the workforce reductions in 2017, as last year, will be achieved where possible through attrition and voluntary buyouts before involuntary layoffs. He said the company will also “aggressively reduce overall spending in 2017 in non-labor areas.” Ray Goforth, executive director of Boeing’s white-collar engineering union – the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, or SPEEA – said the process Boeing is following in cutting jobs was worked out in discussions with the union that led to last year’s surprise agreement to a new six-year SPEEA contract. “This is all stuff we negotiated into that contract,” Goforth said. “We knew the company was going to lay off significant numbers of people. We wanted to make it as painless as possible.” He said that of the jobs cuts through the end of November, 70 percent were voluntary. Last year, a combination of leaving open positions unfilled, buyouts and forced layoffs slashed the Boeing workforce in Washington state by 7,357 jobs – a 9.3 percent reduction overall.

(Courtesy United Airlines) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Getting There January 12, 2017 United Airlines is sending the “queen of the skies” to an early retirement. The airline will take its last Boeing 747 out of service by the end of 2017, a year ahead of schedule. The 747, which first took off in February 1969, helped foster in an era of more affordable transcontinental and international air travel, because so many passengers could fit in the plane. The BBC called it the “plane that changed the world”: United will join US rival Delta Air Lines in phasing out the model by the end of the year, though you will likely be able to continue flying them on carriers like British Airways after 2017. The famous four-engine plane with a humped fuselage has been falling out of favor with airlines for years as they opt instead for more fuel-efficient (read: cheaper to operate) models. “It’s a bittersweet milestone—this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel,” United’s president Scott Kirby said in a statement. “Today, there are more fuel-efficient, cost-effective and reliable widebody aircraft that provide an updated inflight experience for our customers traveling on long-haul flights.” “For these reasons,” he added, “we’re saying farewell to the queen of the skies, which has been part of our fleet since we first flew the aircraft between California and Hawaii in 1970.” Many have also been pulling back from the most jumbo of jumbo jets, the Airbus A380, the world’s biggest passenger plane, in favor of more fuel-efficient, twin-engine jets. Interest has dropped off to the point that Boeing even said it was considering ending production of the 747. But there is still some demand out there for the plane, which is now mostly used to transport cargo. UPS ordered 14 of them in October. The office of the US president also remains a fan. Since 1990, Air Force One has been a 747-200 aircraft, and the Air Force in 2015 selected the 747-8 as its successor. But the next president seems less keen: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J.

Now, the last two U.S.-based carriers still flying the plane are setting the stage to retire their remaining 747s, probably by the end of this year. United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL), which had originally planned to end 747 service at the end of 2018, said in a statement on Wednesday that the airline’s last 747 flight will come in the fourth quarter of this year. United took its first delivery of a 747 in 1970 and flew the plane between California and Hawaii. Here’s part of the airline’s statement: It’s a bittersweet milestone — this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel. Today, there are more fuel-efficient, cost-effective and reliable widebody aircraft that provide an updated inflight experience for our customers traveling on long-haul flights. Delta Air Lines Co. (NYSE: DAL) has fully booked its 747 flights through November of this year, according to Bloomberg News, and the airline has not disclosed when the iconic plane will make its last flight for the airline. Assuming President-elect Donald Trump and Boeing sort out their differences over the next version of Air Force One, the two planes that are scheduled for delivery in 2024 may be the last 747s built. The first 747-100s sold at a list price of $24 million. Adjusting for inflation that same 747 would sell today for more than $149 million, less than half the actual list price of a new 747-8 passenger jet that lists for $378.5 million or the freighter version at $379.1 million. Boeing hasn’t got many buyers for its humpbacked plane, but price is not the problem. Since January of 2015, Boeing has taken orders for just 10 747s, and it has a total of 21 jumbo jets on its backlog, 10 passenger jets and 11 freighters. Beginning last September, Boeing cut production of the planes from one to just one-half per month. In late July of last year, Boeing lowered the number of 747s in its program accounting block from 1,574 planes to 1,555 and took a pretax charge of $1.2 billion against the program. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission the company added: If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. Demand for new cargo planes has stalled as well, not primarily because cargo shipments have declined but because new planes like the 787 and Airbus A350 have increased capacity to carry cargo on commercial passenger flights. This so-called belly cargo offers both the carriers and the shippers better economics. Boeing made a de facto decision several years ago to let the 747 program live its natural life and die a natural death when it chose not to compete directly with the larger A380 superjumbo jet from Airbus. Given the then-high cost of fuel, Boeing would have had to replace the four engines on the 747 with more fuel-efficient versions. The A380 jet, if it can be filled with 500 to 600 passengers, is more efficient than the 747 as a passenger plane, and Boeing did not see the market for these massive planes growing enough to justify the investment to compete. In effect, Boeing gave Airbus the very-large airplane market. Another irony of these large planes is that the A380 is, in fact, a dual-aisle version of the design that Boeing rejected in the 1960s. A delivery delay of 12 A380s destined for Emirates Airlines has once again put the superjumbo plane in the red. With only Emirates as the plane’s single major customer, the A380 may be the airplane equivalent of a dead man walking.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau 2/3 left right An Airbus A321 with the description 'IranAir' is pictured on the tarmac in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, January 11, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau 3/3 By Parisa Hafezi and Tim Hepher | ANKARA/PARIS ANKARA/PARIS An Airbus A321 airliner landed in Tehran on Thursday, the first to arrive out of the 200 Western-built aircraft ordered by IranAir following the lifting of sanctions on Iran last year. "This is a historic moment for Iran, signalling the end of the sanctions era for the country ... This is a prelude to the delivery of other aircraft and the renovation of Iran's ageing air fleet," state TV said. Analysts say IranAir flies one of the world's oldest fleets, with an average age of 23 years, and has had to rely on smuggled or improvised parts to keep them operational. Iran, which has not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, has ordered 100 airliners from Airbus and 80 from Boeing and is close to a deal to buy 20 turboprop aircraft from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica. The one exception was the sale of a plane to replace an Airbus jet shot down by the U.S. Navy in 1988. The arrival of the Airbus 321 on Thursday comes just over a week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who is opposed to the deal struck by Western powers in 2015 which lifted sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. Republicans in the U.S. Congress have also objected to the pact, which was signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. Iran's pragmatist president Hassan Rouhani's success in ending international sanctions by reaching the deal has also intensified a power struggle among the country's faction-ridden elite, who have criticised the deal for a lack of tangible economic benefits since sanctions were lifted. "This (aircraft) delivery was very crucial ... especially the timing of it. Now people can see the result of lifting sanctions," a senior Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. "It will increase Rouhani's popularity ... and his chances for re-election in May." IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh said in France on Wednesday in taking delivery of the Airbus plane that he hoped the United States would not block the agreement. Both Airbus and Boeing need U.S. export licences to deliver the jets because of the number of U.S. parts they contain. Both have received licences but some need to be extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect Boeing to point to the Airbus delivery to argue its deal should go ahead. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract,” Parvaresh told reporters on Wednesday. IranAir hopes to receive at least two more aircraft from Airbus by the end of March and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017. State TV quoted Parvaresh as saying on Thursday that Iran's Bank of Industry and Mine had financed the purchase of the first plane delivered. Airbus and Boeing are putting up financing help for early deliveries as many Western banks remain wary of doing deals with Iran due to restrictions on the use of the U.S. financial system that remain in effect despite the nuclear deal. People familiar with the matter said Airbus, initially reported to have backed the first seven deliveries, was now looking at providing finance for a larger number of deliveries and that Boeing planned to finance the first half a dozen jets. Most planes are sold in dollars but Airbus is being paid in euros. Boeing's bankers are looking for ways for the company to get paid for future deliveries without breaking core sanctions, subject to Treasury approval, a person close to the deal said.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Jan. 12, 2017 at 12:13 PM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter PATUXENT, Md., Jan. 12 (UPI) -- The U.S. Navy has accepted its 50th P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft from Boeing. The plane, which will be part of an eventual fleet of 117 Poseidon aircraft, was delivered at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla., earlier this month, U.S. Naval Air Systems Command reported. "I'd like to formally thank the team, including PMA-290, Boeing and our entire P-8A industry team, as we deliver the 50th P-8A Poseidon early and under budget," said Capt. Tony Rossi, the Navy's program manager for Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft. "This milestone demonstrates outstanding work ethic, professionalism and dedication to the fleet. "The P-8A is special. This is the first time a Navy combat aircraft was built from the ground up on a commercial production line. We've leveraged commercial expertise and experience, and a highly reliable airframe, the 737, which has reduced production time and overall production costs." The P-8A Poseidon is replacing the Navy's aging P-3 Orion. It features an electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turret and increased acoustic processing capability with 64 passive sonobuoys, 32 multi-static sonobuoys and concurrent passive and active processing.

Repealing unpopular parts of the state’s health-care law led to the collapse of the insurance market. Share story By David Gutman Seattle Times staff reporter Boeing. Microsoft. Amazon. The Washington Health Services Act of 1993. Washington has long been on the national vanguard, be it in aerospace, software, e-commerce or wide-ranging health-care laws undone by subsequent Republican electoral victories. As congressional Republicans look to repeal the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), Washington’s experience with health-care reform in the 1990s offers an illustrative example of the possible consequences of repealing only the unpopular parts of a law designed with many interlocking pieces. What began as the most ambitious health-care overhaul in the nation was hacked away to the point where it became impossible to buy individual health insurance anywhere in the state.

Here’s what happened: The Legislature passed a comprehensive health-care law in 1993, after several years of study and debate. More than 15 years in advance, it looked a lot like the ACA. It required most employers to provide health insurance to employees. It required individuals to get health insurance or pay a penalty. It required insurance companies to sell policies to anybody — whether they had pre-existing medical conditions or not. It required those policies to cover a set of basic benefits — things like prescription drugs and maternity care. It expanded Medicaid to give insurance to those who couldn’t afford it. Like the passage of the ACA, the 1993 law led to huge Republican victories in the next election. In 1994, Washington Republicans won their biggest victory in nearly 50 years, winning back the state House and coming within one seat in the state Senate. They campaigned on ditching the unpopular parts of the health-care law, most specifically the mandates. And they followed through. Major overhaul The 1993 law, unlike Obamacare, never went into full effect. The 1995 Legislature repealed most of it, including the individual mandate to carry health insurance. But they kept the ban on denying insurance for pre-existing conditions, known in insurance-speak as “guaranteed issue” — you’re guaranteed to be offered insurance, regardless of your health. “Republicans came in, and they decided to gut the bill, not dissimilar to right now,” said Dr. Bob Crittenden, an aide to Gov. Jay Inslee, who, working for then-Gov. Booth Gardner, wrote the original version of the health-care bill. “They took out the mandate and left the guaranteed issue. The market went into a tailspin one-and-a-half years later.” The defanged health-care law cratered the market for individual insurance policies (as opposed to employer-provided insurance or government-provided insurance, like Medicare and Medicaid, which was largely unaffected). By 1998, three years after the changes to the law went through, 17 of the 19 insurers selling individual policies in Washington had left the state, according to a study by an insurance-industry group. By 1999, it was impossible to buy an individual policy in Washington. Every insurer had pulled out. Premera Blue Cross said it lost more than $120 million in Washington before it stopped selling individual policies. With no requirement to buy insurance — and the guarantee that people could buy insurance if they got sick — healthy people could hold off, only signing up if they needed medical care. A sicker population of people buying insurance pushed premiums up. Which, in turn, led more healthy people to hold off. Which pushed premiums up. “They call it a death spiral,” Crittenden said. “The whole principle of insurance is you buy it before you need it,” a health adviser to then-Gov. Gary Locke said in 1999, just before the last two insurers left the state. “You can’t buy fire insurance when your house is burning down.” State Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, was in the House when the health-care legislation was passed, then later changed. He voted against the legislation (it got only two Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House) and for the partial repeals. He said lawmakers made some mistakes, like keeping the list of basic benefits that policies had to cover, which helped drive up premiums. But Wednesday, after first denying that the Washington law had an individual mandate, he praised President-elect Donald Trump for looking at doing much of what Washington did in the 1990s. “We did keep some of those very popular parts, and I think you’ve heard the president-elect talk about it,” Schoesler said. “The governor focuses on scaring people; the president-elect has said there’s some popular parts he would like to keep.” Inslee has been issuing warnings in recent weeks that repeal of the ACA would leave thousands of Washington residents without health coverage. Different goals Trump has promised both to repeal the ACA wholesale — “completely repeal Obama­care,” it says on his campaign website — and to maintain its ban on denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Republicans can repeal much of the law — including the individual mandate and subsidies that help make private insurance plans affordable — without any Democratic votes. But it would almost certainly take Democratic votes in the Senate to repeal the pre-existing conditions provision or to pass a replacement health-care plan, both of which would be subject to a filibuster. It’s unclear what will happen next. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has favored a so-called “repeal and delay” strategy, in which Congress votes immediately to repeal parts of the law, but with an effective date years in the future, to give them more time to develop a replacement. But Trump on Tuesday told The New York Times he wants an immediate repeal and a replacement within weeks. In Washington, the law has cut the number of people without health insurance in half, but also left some with escalating premiums and sky-high deductibles. U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Vancouver, said Tuesday she opposes repeal and delay. Any repeal, she wrote in a letter to Ryan, “should be accompanied by a simultaneous and immediate strategy for replacing it.” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, and a member of Ryan’s leadership team, wrote Tuesday of a “stable and smooth transition period when the law is repealed.” In a joint statement, Washington’s four Republican representatives — Herrera Beutler, McMorris Rodgers, Rep. Dave Reichert of Auburn and Rep. Dan Newhouse of Sunnyside — said their goal is a “replacement in concurrence with repeal,” but did not elaborate. None responded to questions about the effects of repealing the mandate, but leaving in place guaranteed issue, or what they’d like in a replacement bill. The uncertainty has left state Democrats and health-care officials wary of a national repeat of the 1990s in Washington. “The president-elect has said just keep protection for pre-existing conditions but we won’t require people to get in the pool,” Inslee said at a health-care conference last week. “We know what happens then. We had a total collapse in ’93 because people got insured only when they’re sick.” Tougher penalties Melanie Coon, a Premera spokeswoman, said the insurer would like to see something almost no one is proposing: a stiffer individual mandate. “The penalty just isn’t high enough,” she said. “It’s the only way you can get people to get in and stay in.” Pam MacEwan was on the commission that was to work out the specific provisions of Washington’s health reform after it passed in 1993, and now runs the state’s health-insurance exchange. Her warning about repeal, issued at the health-care conference last week, also served, perhaps unintentionally, as a warning about the future of the ACA, which passed seven years ago without a single Republican vote. “I worked on reform in the ’90s; it took two years to pass, two years to implement and 20 minutes to repeal by Republicans. They kept the parts they liked, took out the parts they didn’t, which caused collapse,” MacEwan said. “Things that endure are done in a bipartisan way.” Information in this article, originally published Jan. 12, 2017, was corrected Jan. 13, 2017. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated how many votes it would take in the U.S. Senate to repeal the Obamacare requirement that people get health insurance. That could be done with a simple majority vote. Staff reporter Bob Young contributed to this report. David Gutman: 206-464-2926 or dgutman@seattletimes.com.

Delta also said it should see profit margins begin to expand once again during the second half of this year, and that passenger revenue should be flat to up two percent this quarter. That would mark the end of a two-year decline in that metric. Apple — Apple is planning to move into original TV show and movie production in a significant way, according to The Wall Street Journal. Walt Disney — Pivotal Research downgraded Disney to "sell" from "hold," and cut its price target to $86 from $102. The firm cites an increasing cost of capital, and also notes soft TV audience trends and the erosion of ESPN's subscriber base. Twitter — Pivotal also downgraded Twitter To "hold" from "buy," citing the higher cost of capital, as well as a decreasing likelihood that the company will receive a buyout offer. Boeing — Boeing was rated "underperform" in new coverage at RBC Capital, pointing to what it calls "underappreciated headwinds" including margin pressure created by new commercial platforms. KB Home — The home builder reported quarterly profit of 40 cents per share, one cent a share above estimates. Revenue came in slightly above forecasts. KB Home also issued better-than-expected numbers for orders and deliveries, and has its highest backlog in terms of dollar value in a decade. Toyota — The automaker said company President Akio Toyoda met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Washington earlier this week, amid calls by the incoming administration to build more cars in the US. Amazon.com — Amazon's Canadian unit will pay a nearly $757,000 fine to settle a probe by that country into pricing. Canadian officials had said the Amazon website gave inaccurate data on how much consumers would save on given items. Fiat Chrysler — The automaker has a "significantly greater than 50 percent" chance of hitting its 2018 financial targets, according to Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne. He made his comments in a meeting with Wall Street analysts. Volkswagen — The company's cash flow is sufficient to fund its $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over its diesel emissions scandal, according to a Dow Jones report. QVC — QVC reported a six percent drop in U.S. sales for its third quarter, its first year-over-year drop in the U.S. in seven years. The home shopping channel is being hurt by increasing competition from online and brick-and-mortar retailers. Goldman Sachs — Goldman executive Dina Powell is set to leave the firm to join the Trump White House as an adviser, according to reports. Powell currently runs philanthropic activities for Goldman. Johnson & Johnson — J&J and Swiss biotech firm Actelion have approached Swiss officials to get their opinion about whether the structure of a proposed takeover deal would pass muster. That's according to a Swiss newspaper, which said a review by the country's takeover board is still going on. Broadcom — Broadcom completed the largest corporate bond deal of the new year, selling $13.55 billion in new debt. That was more than the $10 billion to $13 billion the chip maker had initially signaled that it planned to sell. Fitbit — The Financial Times reports that the fitness device maker was interested in acquiring rival Jawbone's assets last month, but the talks fell apart after Fitbit's offer price was deemed insufficient. The paper said Jawbone is now close to securing funds from a new investor.

(flynas) Airbus has finalized an agreement to sell more than 60 jets to Saudi Arabian budget carrier flynas, according to industry sources, a move that could help the European planemaker keep ahead of Boeing in the annual race for new orders. The order from flynas, partly owned by Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal's investment vehicle, is expected to cover over 60 A320neo narrow body jets, one of the sources with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters. An order for 60 A320neos would be worth $6.4 billion at list prices though it is common for manufacturers to grant discounts. Including purchasing options, the agreement includes 100 A320neos, sources said. The order could be announced as early as Wednesday at Airbus' annual press conference so that it can be included in the planemaker’s 2016 sales numbers, though one source said the buyer might not be identified. The sources requested anonymity as the details were still private. Airbus and flynas declined to comment. The A320neo sale would be Airbus' first in the Middle East since Qatar Airways refused deliveries in December 2015 and said it would swap its order for a larger version. Flynas, which launched as Nas Air in 2007 and first turned a profit in 2015, has been negotiating an order for at least 60 narrow body jets with Airbus and rival planemaker Boeing since as early as April 2016. Flynas Chief Executive Paul Byrne said on April 27 whichever manufacturer it chose would over time become the sole supplier. The order, which would replace and expand a fleet of leased A320s, would give flynas one of the largest Middle East low cost fleets after state-owned flydubai, which operate 57 Boeing 737-800s and has more than 100 scheduled for delivery by 2023. Flynas is facing increasing competition domestically, where it conducts the majority of its operations. Start-up SaudiGulf Airlines and Saudi-owned, Egypt-based Nesma airline were both granted domestic operating licenses in 2016, while state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines has announced plans for its own budget carrier, Flyadeal, to launch in mid-2017 with a target of 50 jets by 2020. Qatar Airways-owned Al Maha is waiting for a domestic Saudi operating license. Saudi Arabia wants to expand its aviation and tourism sectors following the success of its Gulf neighbors Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It plans to encourage non-religious tourism as part of major national reforms aimed at moving the country›s economy away from oil dependence.       Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Advertisement © Copyright 2016 The Saudi Gazette.

The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market, showing double-digit growth in annual passenger numbers thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of the 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices. Airlines typically get discounts from list prices when placing large orders. Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014. The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo. Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo By Anshuman Daga and Tommy Wilkes | SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI SpiceJet is set to seal an order for at least 90 new 737 jets from Boeing, two sources said on Thursday, as the low-cost carrier targets an expansion to tap into the South Asian nation's booming air travel market. The announcement for the 737 MAX aircraft - which includes at least 42 of the narrowbody jets SpiceJet had previously agreed to buy from Boeing in 2014 - is expected as early as Friday when SpiceJet's chairman holds a press event in New Delhi, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, said. One of the sources said the SpiceJet order could be for as many as 100 new planes. Boeing last week posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer. The sources declined to be identified ahead of Friday's press announcement. An agreement with SpiceJet, which has a current fleet of 40 planes, would be a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir. SpiceJet and Boeing did not respond to requests for comment. India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes. SpiceJet has been in talks with Boeing and Airbus since 2015, and it is expected to have secured a discount from the roughly $10 billion cost of 90 737 MAX jets based on list prices.

Now, a new generation of satellite entrepreneurs is headed back to the launch pad. Backed by billions of dollars from deep-pocketed investors, they plan to blanket the Earth in the next few years with perhaps thousands of miniature satellites beaming cheap, ubiquitous broadband service. What’s different? Launching one of these smaller satellites can cost a fraction of the price for a larger, school-­bus-­sized satellite. These new satellites will largely be mass-produced. And consumers now demand high-speed Internet connectivity pretty much everywhere: on airplanes, cruise ships and in the remotest village in Africa. Companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb and Boeing have all recently proposed networks of satellites in low-Earth orbit to provide high-speed broadband access around the globe. Even Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has aspirations to bring Internet to poorly connected areas — a plan that was derailed in September after a satellite set to beam high-speed service to areas including sub-Saharan Africa was destroyed in the explosion of a SpaceX rocket on a Florida launch pad. If this latest wave of satellite networks gets off the ground, it could pose a challenge to a $224.6 billion industry currently dominated by telecom and cable companies with their miles of fiber optic and copper wires. “That’s going to shake up how these operators are controlling different regions, and it’s going to allow the consumer a little more of an option,” said Taylor Palmer, industry analyst at market research firm IBISWorld. In mid-December, the Arlington, Va.-based OneWeb said it secured $1.2 billion of funded capital in a round led by Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group Corp., which contributed $1 billion of the total. The money will fund construction of a Florida satellite manufacturing plant, which is set to start production in 2018. SoftBank is just one addition to OneWeb’s list of big-name investors, which includes Qualcomm Inc., Airbus Group, the Coca-Cola Co. and Richard Branson’s Virgin Group. “One of the main challenges is raising financing from investors, so this proves they are able to continue doing that and they’re still attracting money from these big, established companies,” said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at market research firm Forecast International. “That’s going to be really vital.” Satellite-provided broadband service is still tiny. It generated revenues of $1.9 billion in 2015, according to a June report from the Tauri Group that was commissioned by the Satellite Industry Association trade group. That compares with $97.8 billion for satellite television. But interest in satellite broadband is growing as consumers expect high-speed service in places that aren’t always well-served by fiber or cable. Last month, Southwest Airlines said it planned to equip its entire fleet of more than 700 planes with WiFi. “There’s a competitive advantage for those that have that service available,” said Tom Stroup, president of the Satellite Industry Association. “Broadband has essentially become an expected fact of life.” Analysts say satellite constellations could have the biggest effect in remote areas. In 2014, almost half of the world’s population lived in rural regions, which are largely unconnected to the internet, according to a report from ITU, a special agency of the United Nations that handles information and communication technologies. “Internet access is fundamental for understanding of culture, cultural differences, civic understanding and participation,” said Greg Wyler, founder and executive chairman of OneWeb. “It helps make the unconnected economically relevant to the developed world. When they’re economically relevant, we pay a lot more attention to them.” The company has an ambitious timeline. It plans to launch the first 10 satellites into low-Earth orbit in early 2018 to test their capabilities. More launches will follow, with its broadband access beginning as early as 2019. By 2022, OneWeb says it will connect every unconnected school to the Onternet. Eventually, OneWeb plans a 700-­satellite constellation. OneWeb’s satellite manufacturing facility in Exploration Park, Fla., is key to these plans. The company will mass produce its micro-satellites with automated assembly capabilities similar to those used in aircraft production facilities, eventually making three a day. SpaceX, based outside Los Angeles, plans to eventually launch more than 4,000 satellites for its network. Each satellite would be about 13 feet long and 6 feet wide, with 19-foot-long solar arrays. In 2015, the company received a $1 billion infusion from Google Inc. and Fidelity Investments and opened an office in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle, to focus on developing the small satellites. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the whole constellation could cost $10 billion to $15 billion. After launching an initial 800 satellites, SpaceX said it could provide broadband coverage to the U.S., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. By its final deployment, the company said it “will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth’s surface.” Boeing’s proposed 2,900-satellite constellation is intended to provide broadband access to both commercial and government users worldwide. The aerospace giant said it planned to launch more than 1,300 satellites within six years of the license approval. The satellite swarms are made possible by advances in miniaturized parts and microprocessors. They could also help shrink the price gap between satellite and terrestrial broadband access, said Palmer of IBISWorld. In the past, satellite broadband was hampered by slower data transfer based on the long distance from Earth — a problem the companies hope to solve by putting their satellites in low-Earth orbit. They will also launch extra satellites to ensure coverage if a few break down. “If they’re really able to optimize the production . and get it out at a cost-per-unit measurement that makes sense for a household . then it really could expand satellite broadband into a major competitor for some of these terrestrial companies,” Palmer said. But first the satellite systems must get approval from the FCC to use specific airwaves. And mobile broadband providers have fought back when proposals for certain frequencies have overlapped with their own plans. The satellite ventures may be able to lean on their powerful investors. Several of OneWeb’s backers have ties to the wireless industry, including SoftBank, which has a controlling stake in Sprint Corp., and Sunil Bharti Mittal, founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises, a business group that includes leading Indian telecommunications company Bharti Airtel Ltd. Wyler insists OneWeb will be a partner with the Earth-bound networks, serving as an extension of current networks. OneWeb’s business model is to sell the broadband connectivity and capacity on its satellites to telecommunications operators. “We’re not competing at all,” Wyler said. “These are areas (where) the current broadband infrastructure are not designed to provide services.” In some cases, he said cellular operators might be able to put a tower in a rural area, but the location is too remote to lay cables or fiber to provide Internet service. That’s where OneWeb could step in and beam service to the tower, Wyler said. Ultimately, an expanding market for broadband probably can accommodate both technologies, said Ostrove of Forecast International. “I think it’s just going to be another way . for the end user to get that service,” he said.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ NEW YORK: So the year begins and with it a new presidency . Everyone has ideas how best to invest your money. Simple indexing is the least expensive way to manage capital; no, smart beta is superior; this year we are told (once again) will be when active stock-picking makes its triumphant return. Regardless of how you choose to allocate your assets, there is another way; a method that cannot fail in its brilliance and simplicity. Go with the POTUS indexes. Direct your attention to the relentless tweeting of the man who soon will be president. There is valuable information in those 140 characters that can move markets and alter perceptions of corporate fundamentals. This has real alpha-generating possibilities. Whoever is managing your favorite 401(k), hedge fund or trading account should take note. To help you make sense of this, we have created two indexes based on Donald Trump's tweet and other pre-presidential utterances. Before we get to the specific stocks, I want to offer a bit more about the underlying concept. First it goes without saying that the US president is the most powerful person on the planet. Although the US Constitution places all sorts of constraints on his direct power, his every word is important, whether you agree with him or not. Now consider the companies he has been tweeting or commenting about, both positively and negatively. You will recognize the two distinct groups that this creates, each with very different prospects. In one group are companies that have drawn expressions of approval from Trump. An even greater endorsement is recruiting the senior executives of those companies to be cabinet members or advisers. Let's call this first group the Oligarch Index, or OLGY. The Oligarch Index includes Colony Capital Inc., CoreCivic Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp., Facebook Inc., Ford Motor Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., PayPal Holdings Inc., Sprint Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and United Technologies Corp. The other group is made up of those companies that Trump has trashed. We shall call this the Drain the Swamp Index, or SWMP . This includes Amazon.Com Inc., Boeing Co., General Motors Co., Kellogg Co., Lockheed Martin Corp., Macy's Inc., New York Times Co., PepsiCo Inc., Rexnord Corp., Tesla Motors Inc., Time Warner Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Twitter Inc.and Constellation Brands Inc. On the positive, oligarchic side, these are the companies that will help to make America great again: Colony Capital: Chairman Tom Barrack spoke at the Republican National Convention, and is chairman of Trump's inauguration committee. Exxon Mobil: Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, who has extensive global experience, is Trump's nominee to be secretary of State. Goldman Sachs: Alum Steve Mnuchin is Trump's pick for secretary of the Treasury and Gary Cohn, Goldman's president, is his pick to head the National Economic Council. Besides, how could we have an oligarch portfolio without Goldman? PayPal: Co-founder Peter Thiel was one of the few techies who had the foresight to back Trump early; he is also a director of Facebook, a major venue for passing around fake news. JPMorgan: CEO Jamie Dimon was recruited to be Treasury secretary .He convinced Trump that he could do more to help make America great again by continuing to run the nation's largest bank. A good guy and a great banker. United Technology: The company owns Carrier, which kept jobs in America. Thanks! Now for some of the companies Trump disparaged, directly or otherwise: Amazon: Jeff Bezos,, CEO, founder and largest shareholder of the online retailer, owns the Washington Post -Trump's least favorite paper. Boeing: Costs for building the new Air Force One are out of control -cancel order! GM: It plans to make cars in Mexico? Make in USA. or pay big border tax! Kellogg: It said that it would no longer advertise on conservative news website Breitbart. Boycott! Lockheed Martin: F-35s are a disaster -price out comparable F18! Macy's: The retailer dropped Trump's clothing lines, and it had a disappointing holiday-sales season and plans to cut 10,000 jobs. Disloyal! New York Times: It, of course, is failing! Tesla: Global warming is a Chinese hoax. Time Warner: It owns CNN, which was so embarrassed by its total support of Hillary Clinton, and yet she lost in a landslide, that they don't know what to do. Twitter: It refused to create a “Lying Hillary“ emoji; CEO Jack Dorsey was disinvited from Trump's Tech Summit. Sad! Rather than a stock-bond mix, think of this as a paired trade -long OLGY, short SWMP . Can you imagine how much more significant and market-moving those tweets will be once Trump is sworn into office? This is theme investing at its finest. Some of you coastal liberal elites might not appreciate the wisdom of building specific portfolios from Trump's tweets; that's just because you don't understand the new era of populism, viral social media and fact-free politics. You are stuck in the old way of thinking -growth, valuations, market cap and momentum.That's old school. Catch up. This is going to make index investing great again.

(File Photo) Airbus posted an eight percent rise in deliveries last year, beating its own forecasts by a comfortable margin to set a company record, and pulled off a last-minute surge in orders to beat arch-rival Boeing in the race for new orders. But the European planemaker warned of a further slowdown of industry orders in 2017 as the aerospace industry turns its attention to producing what it already has on its order books, following an extended order boom. Analysts say orders are shrinking due to concerns over weakening economies and relatively low oil prices, while a wave of demand for new fuel-saving models has mainly run its course. “What kept the orders party going much longer than usual was new product launches and there are few products to be launched,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Teal Group. “These are not hard times. This is merely the party coming to its inevitable end.” Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, Airbus said it had delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with its most recent forecast of 670. Deliveries rebounded sharply at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus shares rose 0.4 percent. Airbus chief operating officer and plane making president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Watch what else is making news Airbus announced a fourth successive win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016, including more than 300 orders in December, confirming potential business reported earlier by Reuters. Boeing kept the title of No.1 producer with 748 deliveries but registered a lower figure of 668 net orders. The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two were bought back from another customer, sales chief John Leahy said. Boeing has sold 80 jets to Iran but did not include this in its 2016 tally, a move that would apparently have put it ahead of Airbus. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China’s Bank of Communications. But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy. Leahy dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically “overbook” to dampen the risk of airline failures. Speaking to a group of reporters after the news conference, he insisted deliveries would continue to rise “for several years” despite cyclical swings in orders as planemakers work through record waiting lists for planes.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The race for new aircraft orders in 2016 has ended with Airbus beating Boeing. It posted 731 new orders - 63 more than the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer. The European plane maker also enjoyed an eight per cent rise in deliveries for the year. It beat its own forecasts, although Boeing still won that race with 748. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier: (SOUNDBITE) FABRICE BREGIER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "We have delivered 688 aircraft, which is a new Airbus record, last year was 635 if I remember well. It is another year of growth, we enjoyed 14 consecutive years of production increase." The surge in Airbus orders included a large deal with Iran, which has been on a spending spree after the lifting of sanctions. But there was one down-side - Airbus is planning to cut its A380 output from next year after demand fell. Airbus COO John Leah: (SOUNDBITE) JOHN LEAH, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, AIRBUS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "What's interesting is traffic is doubling every fifteen years and they're not going to build another Heathrow, they're not going to build another Charles-de-Gaulle or JFK. This aeroplane will start dominating the market at least at those 90 percent of long-haul passengers who fly through 55 cities today." Confident talk - but the A380 program took another blow in late December. Emirates delayed some 2017 deliveries because of pressure from the impact of low oil prices. That could put the double-decker back into a loss, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

(AFP) PARIS: The head of IranAir took delivery in France on Wednesday of the first Western airliner under an international sanctions deal, calling it a “sunny day” for relations between Iran and Europe and a memorable one for aviation in the nation of 80 million people. Chairman Farhad Parvaresh invited Fabrice Bregier, the head of planemaking at Airbus, to fly on the new A321 to Tehran, where the airline plans to mark its arrival in its fleet with a ceremony on Thursday. The 189-seat plane, already painted in IranAir’s livery, is the first of 100 ordered from Airbus following a deal reached in 2015 between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country’s nuclear activities. The airline has also ordered 80 aircraft from Boeing and is in the final stages of negotiating an order for 20 turboprops from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo Finmeccanica. The Airbus delivery marks the first brand-new jet directly acquired from a Western manufacturer for decades, other than the replacement of an Airbus jet shot down by the US Navy in 1988. Both Airbus and Boeing need US export licenses to deliver the jets because of the number of US parts. Both have received licenses but Boeing needs to have the majority extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect it to point to the Airbus delivery in order to press the case for its sales to remain in force. “Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract,” Parvaresh told reporters. The first Airbus aircraft will enter service on Saturday starting on busy domestic routes such as Tehran to Mashhad for the next couple of months, he said. IranAir hopes to receive “at least two more from Airbus” by the start of the Iranian New Year in March, and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017, he added. It also expects to receive three larger A330 jets in 2017. IranAir could also receive one to two turboprop aircraft by the Iranian New Year, but a contract has yet to be signed. “We are very optimistic we can finalize it in January or so,” Parvaresh said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 12 January 2017 | MYT 8:03 AM Airbus deliveries up 8%, orders outpace Boeing in 2016 AirAsia is one of the biggest customers of Airbus aircraft. TOULOUSE, France: Airbus posted an eight percent rise in deliveries last year, beating its own forecasts by a comfortable margin to set a company record, and pulled off a last-minute surge in orders to beat arch-rival Boeing in the race for new orders. But the European planemaker warned of a further slowdown of industry orders in 2017 as the aerospace industry turns its attention to producing what it already has on its order books, following an extended order boom. Analysts say orders are shrinking due to concerns over weakening economies and relatively low oil prices, while a wave of demand for new fuel-saving models has mainly run its course. "What kept the orders party going much longer than usual was new product launches and there are few products to be launched," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Teal Group. "These are not hard times. This is merely the party coming to its inevitable end." Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, Airbus said it had delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with its most recent forecast of 670. Deliveries rebounded sharply at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus shares rose 0.4 percent. Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Airbus announced a fourth successive win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016, including more than 300 orders in December, confirming potential business reported earlier by Reuters. Boeing kept the title of No.1 producer with 748 deliveries but registered a lower figure of 668 net orders. The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two were bought back from another customer, sales chief John Leahy said. Boeing has sold 80 jets to Iran but did not include this in its 2016 tally, a move that would apparently have put it ahead of Airbus. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China's Bank of Communications.

But the European planemaker warned of a further slowdown of industry orders in 2017 as the aerospace industry turns its attention to producing what it already has on its order books, following an extended order boom. Analysts say orders are shrinking due to concerns over weakening economies and relatively low oil prices, while a wave of demand for new fuel-saving models has mainly run its course. “What kept the orders party going much longer than usual was new product launches and there are few products to be launched,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Teal Group. “These are not hard times. This is merely the party coming to its inevitable end.” Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, Airbus said it had delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with its most recent forecast of 670. Deliveries rebounded sharply at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus shares rose 0.4 per cent. Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Airbus announced a fourth successive win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016, including more than 300 orders in December, confirming potential business reported earlier by Reuters. Boeing kept the title of No.1 producer with 748 deliveries but registered a lower figure of 668 net orders. The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two were bought back from another customer, sales chief John Leahy said. Boeing has sold 80 jets to Iran but did not include this in its 2016 tally, a move that would apparently have put it ahead of Airbus. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China’s Bank of Communications. But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy. Leahy dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically “overbook” to dampen the risk of airline failures.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Aaron Gregg January 11 Follow @Post_AG President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a news conference at Trump Tower in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) In his first press conference since winning the presidential election in November, Donald Trump again took aim at Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. His latest comments followed a tweet last month about the F-35’s “tremendous cost and cost overruns.” The president-elect said he had asked Boeing to “price out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.” “We’re going to do some big things on the F-35 program and perhaps the F-18 program,” Trump reiterated Wednesday. “And we’re going to get those costs way down, and we’re going to get the plane to be even better, and we’re going to have some competition and it’s going to be a beautiful thing. So we’ve been very very much involved.” Trump offered few details before moving on. But the 30 seconds or so he devoted to the topic jolted stocks at Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the two companies primarily responsible for the F-35 and F-18 programs respectively, though both recovered throughout the day. On the whole, defense investors have been bullish on the prospect of a Trump presidency. Defense stocks surged on the morning after the election and have gained in the months since, as investors apparently take cues from campaign promises to grow the size of the military. The S&P’s index of defense stocks is up more than 10 percent since the election. The F-35 was under criticism for delays and cost overruns long before Trump took to Twitter over the issue. The cost of each plane currently stands at more $100 million per plane, though the company says it expects the per-plane price to drop as production ramps up. Last year, the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin failed to agree on the price of the plane, with the company publicly expressing disappointment after the Defense Department unilaterally awarded a $6.1 billion contract to continue the program. It is yet to be flown in combat missions. On Monday, the Defense Department acknowledged another schedule delay affecting production of the plane, increasing the cost of the program by an estimated $500 million. Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has broken sharply with the president-elect on issues such as torture of detainees and relations with Russia, criticized the delay in a Tuesday statement and in a letter he sent to the chief executive of Lockheed Martin. “This is yet another troubling sign for a program that has already nearly doubled in cost, taken nearly two decades to field, and has long been the poster child for acquisition malpractice,” McCain said in the statement. The Republican has been effusive about the plane’s combat capabilities but has been less happy about the programs continuing cost over-uns. The statement went on to blame onerous procurement regulations, suggesting he wants cost reductions to come from slashing regulations rather than trimming the contract itself. Those keeping tabs on the defense industry say the rare alignment of Trump and McCain suggests program changes are likely “A Trump-McCain combination would be hard to counter because these are two of the most forceful personalities on the Washington landscape,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from numerous defense firms including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. “If Trump and McCain get together on trying to reduce the cost there’s going to have to be some reduction of the price tag.” In an email to the Washington Post, Lockheed Martin Spokesperson Bill Phelps highlighted existing efforts to cut the cost of the program. “We understand President-elect Trump’s concerns about the F-35 program and we’ve given him our full commitment to drive down cost aggressively. We are focused on delivering the best capability possible at the best value for the American taxpayer,” the statement read. “We look forward to continuing to work with our government and military leaders to build on the F-35 program’s record of performance and affordability.” Boeing spokesperson Todd Blecher emailed a statement saying the company would work with the president-elect in the future. “We have been responsive to requests for information from the incoming Trump administration, just as we have with others in the past,” the statement said. “We remain committed to working with the new president and Congress to provide affordable, capable Boeing products and services to meet our national security needs.” business business true Please provide a valid email address.

According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The decision marks the end of an era for U.S. airlines, which have relied on the humpbacked 747 to bring jet travel to a mass consumer market since the plane debuted in 1970. United flew its first jumbo between California and Hawaii that year. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 158.83 +0.54 +0.34% United Continental Holdings Inc UAL ▲ 74.32 +0.32 +0.43% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 51.23 +0.34 +0.67% Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CPCAY ▼ 6.69 -0.21 -3.04% It’s also a reminder of the tough task Boeing faces as it tries to keep its newest 747 model, the -8, aloft amid waning demand for four-engine aircraft. The Chicago-based planemaker has just 28 unfilled orders, after closing 17 sales of the freighter version of the jet last year. Boeing has said it would end production if more orders don’t materialize. “It’s a bittersweet milestone -- this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel,” United President Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees Wednesday. Jetliner Shift The Chicago-based carrier is the largest U.S. operator of the passenger 747-400 variant, with 20 of the aircraft in its fleet. Delta Air Lines Inc. is also parking its jumbo jets this year. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., ANA Holdings Inc., Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Air France are among carriers that have retired their 747-400 jetliners this decade amid a shift from four-engine aircraft to twin-engine planes, which are more fuel efficient, cheaper to maintain and capable of hauling nearly as many people over vast distances. United spokesman Luke Punzenberger wouldn’t say which wide-body aircraft would replace the 747-400s, which have served as the airline’s workhorses on trans-Pacific routes for two decades. The carrier has taken delivery of the first of 14 Boeing 777-300ERs it has ordered for long-range flying. The airline also has ordered 35 Airbus A350-1000s, but is weighing converting those twin-aisle jets to the smaller -900 variant or the mid-sized A330, United Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said in a November interview. The airline plans to move pilot and flight attendant crews assigned to the 747 transition to other aircraft, Kirby told employees. “Our forward-looking fleet plan will cover 747 replacements and anticipated growth opportunities,” he said. “And of course, we’ll honor the 747 with an unforgettable retirement celebration.”© Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso United 747 Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The race for new aircraft orders in 2016 has ended with Airbus beating Boeing. It posted 731 new orders - 63 more than the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer. The European plane maker also enjoyed an eight per cent rise in deliveries for the year. It beat its own forecasts, although Boeing still won that race with 748. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier: (SOUNDBITE) FABRICE BREGIER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "We have delivered 688 aircraft, which is a new Airbus record, last year was 635 if I remember well. It is another year of growth, we enjoyed 14 consecutive years of production increase." The surge in Airbus orders included a large deal with Iran, which has been on a spending spree after the lifting of sanctions. But there was one down-side - Airbus is planning to cut its A380 output from next year after demand fell. Airbus COO John Leah: (SOUNDBITE) JOHN LEAH, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, AIRBUS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "What's interesting is traffic is doubling every fifteen years and they're not going to build another Heathrow, they're not going to build another Charles-de-Gaulle or JFK. This aeroplane will start dominating the market at least at those 90 percent of long-haul passengers who fly through 55 cities today." Confident talk - but the A380 program took another blow in late December. Emirates delayed some 2017 deliveries because of pressure from the impact of low oil prices. That could put the double-decker back into a loss, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

(Investor's Business Daily) Related MLM Jim Cramer Advises Viewers On Boeing, US Concrete And Duke Energy Pro: 4 Stocks Could Benefit From Trump's Infrastructure Plan The Trump rally has benefited certain sectors more than others. One of the strongest sectors that benefited is materials and metals stocks. CNBC's Dominic Chu explained that it's widely believed materials and metals stocks will benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's administration given his plans to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the coming years. The strong investor sentiment is most apparent in the exchange traded fund which trackers the materials sector, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) which is higher by more than 25 percent over the past year. In fact, among the 25 members of the S&P 500 materials sector, nine of the stocks have rallied to the point where it's trading at least 10 percent above its 200-day average trading price. Among the notables in Chu's list, the major gravel, stone and sand provider Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) is trading 15 percent above its 200-day moving average. In addition, steel company Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is trading around 17 percent above its 200-day moving average. However, these returns are overshadowed by Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) which is trading at the biggest premium in its group to the 200-day average at 31 percent.

REUTERS/Frank PolichMore (Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc <UAL.N> said on Wednesday it had advanced the retirement of 747s from its service to the fourth quarter of this year from end-2018. United will replace the Boeing 747 fleet, which it has been flying since 1970, with other fuel-efficient, cost-effective and widebody aircraft, Scott Kirby, president, United Airlines, wrote in a blog. http://bit.ly/2iGGpTH The No.3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic operated 22 747-400 owned and leased aircraft of its total 715 mainline fleet as of Dec. 31, 2015. Boeing Co <BA.N> said in July it would consider ending production of 747s as it faced falling orders and pricing pressure. The aircraft maker delivered a total nine 747s in 2016, half the deliveries in 2015.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori, File) Posted: Wednesday, January 11, 2017 8:01 am Airbus ups plane deliveries in 2016 but new orders drop Associated Press | 0 comments PARIS (AP) — Airbus delivered a record number of planes last year despite engine and cabin production problems, even as new orders slumped for both the European manufacturer and its U.S. rival Boeing. An unlikely customer provided a big boost to the industry in 2016: Iran, scheduled to receive its first Airbus plane in years Wednesday as part of a multibillion-dollar deal made possible by a hard-fought nuclear agreement. Airbus executives defended the superjumbo A380, which has not won as many orders as many had hoped, and played down concerns that the industry is facing a downturn after a long-running buying spree by Mideast and Asian carriers. However, they refused to issue forecasts for this year amid signs that China's slowdown and volatile fuel prices threaten to weigh on aircraft orders. Airbus announced Wednesday that it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015 and above the company's own expectations. Airbus increased deliveries of its long-delayed A350 wide-body to 49 overall. The A320 range — notably the fuel-efficient A321neo — dominated Airbus sales last year, when it won 731 net orders overall, compared with 1,036 the year before. Boeing says it delivered 748 planes in 2016 and took in 668 net orders, down from 768 orders in 2015. "I'm confident that we'll have a new record in deliveries" in 2017, Airbus commercial planes sales chief John Leahy said Wednesday in Toulouse. However, he added, "That doesn't mean that orders are going to be strong." Fabrice Bregier, president of Airbus commercial planes, said that the first half of 2016 was "unusually difficult from a production perspective" but the company managed to speed up output by the end of the year after suppliers fixed problems with engines and cabin equipment. He said Airbus is now focusing on ramping up deliveries and reducing its big backlog — 6,874 planes ordered but not yet delivered. Racing with Boeing for business in post-sanctions Iran, Airbus is making the symbolic move of delivering an A321 jet to Iran Air on Wednesday, the first of 100 planes planned in an Airbus deal worth more than $18 billion dollars at list prices. Iran's flag carrier signed a similar deal with Boeing, for 80 jetliners that won't start arriving until 2018. Bregier said Airbus would continue work on the Iran planes despite concerns that President-elect Donald Trump could threaten the international nuclear agreement that paved the way for the aircraft contracts. Airbus also shrugged off concerns of protectionist measures threatened by Trump, noting that it's manufacturing in the U.S. now too — and delivered its first U.S.-assembled plane last year, an A321 made in Mobile, Alabama. Mark Bobbi of IHS Markit said Airbus is likely to enjoy sustained demand for single-aisle planes this year and remain dominant over Boeing in that market, while the U.S. manufacturer will keep the lead in wide-bodies. However, he warned, demand for wide-bodies is "coming to a slump." That's especially bad news for the A380 superjumbo program, which he said is on "life support." While Airbus insists that the world will need bigger planes like the A380 as population and travel grow, many airlines are turning away from major hubs and using smaller, cheaper planes instead. Airbus has scaled back production of the plane to one per month as orders have lagged. Overall, Bobbi forecast slower order rates in Asia and the Mideast after a period of "over-ordering." A big question mark hanging over the industry is the rising oil price, which is putting pressure on airlines to cut costs — or to invest in newer, more fuel-efficient planes.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau 3/3 By Tim Hepher | PARIS PARIS The head of IranAir took delivery in France on Wednesday of the first Western airliner under an international sanctions deal, calling it a "sunny day" for relations between Iran and Europe and a memorable one for aviation in the nation of 80 million people. Chairman Farhad Parvaresh invited Fabrice Bregier, the head of planemaking at Airbus, to fly on the new A321 to Tehran, where the airline plans to mark its arrival in its fleet with a ceremony on Thursday. The 189-seat plane, already painted in IranAir's livery, is the first of 100 ordered from Airbus following a deal reached in 2015 between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. The airline has also ordered 80 aircraft from Boeing (BA.N) and is in the final stages of negotiating an order for 20 turboprops from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica (LDOF.MI). Highlighting Iran's emergence from years of isolation, the Airbus delivery marks the first brand-new jet directly acquired from a Western manufacturer for decades, other than the replacement of an Airbus jet shot down by the U.S. Navy in 1988. Republicans in the U.S. Congress have objected to the nuclear pact, signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. It also faces opposition from hardliners in Iran. Parvaresh said he hoped the United States would not block the agreement under president-elect Donald Trump, who at times has pledged to pull Washington out of the nuclear accord. Both Airbus and Boeing need U.S. export licenses to deliver the jets because of the number of U.S. parts. Both have received licenses but Boeing needs to have the majority extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect it to point to the Airbus delivery in order to press the case for its sales to remain in force. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract,” Parvaresh told reporters. The first Airbus aircraft will enter service on Saturday starting on busy domestic routes such as Tehran to Mashhad for the next couple of months, he said. IranAir hopes to receive "at least two more from Airbus" by the start of the Iranian new year in March, and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017, he added. It also expects to receive three larger A330 jets in 2017. IranAir could also receive one to two turboprop aircraft by the Iranian new year, but a contract has yet to be signed. "We are very optimistic we can finalize it in January or so," Parvaresh said. The arrival of new aircraft will allow IranAir "step by step" to phase out elderly planes including Fokker 100 regional aircraft serving domestic routes, Parvaresh said. Analysts say IranAir has one of the world's oldest airliner fleets, held together until now by smuggled or improvised parts.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The race for new aircraft orders in 2016 has ended with Airbus beating Boeing. It posted 731 new orders - 63 more than the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer. The European plane maker also enjoyed an eight per cent rise in deliveries for the year. It beat its own forecasts, although Boeing still won that race with 748. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier: (SOUNDBITE) FABRICE BREGIER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "We have delivered 688 aircraft, which is a new Airbus record, last year was 635 if I remember well. It is another year of growth, we enjoyed 14 consecutive years of production increase." The surge in Airbus orders included a large deal with Iran, which has been on a spending spree after the lifting of sanctions. But there was one down-side - Airbus is planning to cut its A380 output from next year after demand fell. Airbus COO John Leah: (SOUNDBITE) JOHN LEAH, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, AIRBUS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "What's interesting is traffic is doubling every fifteen years and they're not going to build another Heathrow, they're not going to build another Charles-de-Gaulle or JFK. This aeroplane will start dominating the market at least at those 90 percent of long-haul passengers who fly through 55 cities today." Confident talk - but the A380 program took another blow in late December. Emirates delayed some 2017 deliveries because of pressure from the impact of low oil prices. That could put the double-decker back into a loss, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

In the last month of 2016 Airbus sold 98 new planes to Iran Air and 72 to Go Airlines India Pvt., while two other transactions saw 132 narrow-bodies purchased by buyers whose identities weren’t disclosed, according to figures released by the Toulouse, France-based company Wednesday. Airbus retained an order lead over Boeing it has held since 2012 after the U.S. business last week said 2016 sales totaled 668 aircraft, net of cancellations. Both manufacturers saw new business dwindle last year as demand ebbed after a decade-long buying spree that’s built up record backlogs. Airbus sales chief John Leahy said he’s not concerned about the slowdown. “We are essentially sold out at this point,” Leahy said in a televised briefing on the numbers. “That doesn’t mean we can’t increase our production, and we will next year and the year after. We have to build what we already have orders for, not worry about getting new orders.” Airbus’s sales tally slipped by almost 350 aircraft in 2016 and Boeing suffered a 100-jet decline, though the U.S. company’s figures didn’t include 80 planes it has also agreed to provide to Iran and which would have given it a narrow order victory. Lower oil prices are also leading airlines to carry on operating older, less efficient planes, while stuttering economies have spurred cancellations and crimped net order numbers. Mideast, China Among Airbus’s unidentified buyers, one is a Middle Eastern customer that’s taking 90 narrow-bodies, the sales chief said. That could refer to Saudi Arabian discount carrier Flynas, which has agreed an $8.6 billion deal with the planemaker to be detailed Monday, according to a statement from investor Kingdom Holding Co. An Asian airline is also purchasing 42 planes, Leahy said in Toulouse. The leasing arm of China’s Bank of Communications has agreed to buy that number of jets, Reuters has reported. Airbus handed over 688 aircraft in the year, beating its target of 670, as it delivered 111 planes in December, a record for the month. 49 A350s The company shipped 49 A350s, one short of its target, versus just 12 in the first six months, after largely resolving delays at seat and interiors supplier Zodiac Aerospace SA, Fabrice Bregier, its chief operating officer and civil unit head, said in the briefing. “We were blocked until summer last year. But things have started to improve,” Bregier said. Issues with A320neo engines supplied by Pratt & Whitney, which led launch customer Qatar Airways to refuse to take the model, have also been addressed and deliveries should triple in 2017 from 2016’s 68, he added. Demand for the original A320-series plane remains strong, and the model could carry on securing buyers beyond this year, Bregier said. With Airbus’s order total higher than the delivery figure, it maintained a book-to-bill ratio above one and swelled its backlog to 6,874 planes. While Boeing remains the world’s No. 1 planemaker after delivering 748 jets, its backlog declined by 80 aircraft to 5,715. Leahy said that though deliveries this year will climb above 700, the book-to-bill figure is likely to be less than one, implying that orders may fall again.

(NYSE: BA) first announced its new, fuel-efficient 737 MAX family in 2011. At the introduction the plane was available in three versions: the 737-7 (MAX 7), 737-8 (MAX 8) and 737-9 (MAX 9). In the middle of last year the company said it would study the addition of a fourth variant, the 737-10 (MAX 10), which would be a stretched version of the 737-9. Aviation Week reported Tuesday that Boeing has now decided on the length of the 737-10, which the company hopes will give it a competitor to the Airbus A321neo. Boeing has finalized a design based on a 66-inch fuselage stretch, half the length it said last year that it was considering. At the proposed length, the 737-10 would seat 189 passengers in a two-class configuration, compared with 193 for the A321neo. In a single-class configuration, the plane would seat 230 passengers. We detailed the issues that Boeing faced last September when the company was reported to be discussing a 737-10 with customers. The biggest issue was — and remains — getting the new plane to market in time to meet the 2019 delivery of the A321neo. That implied modest changes that did not require wing or engine changes. According to Aviation Week, Boeing could achieve first delivery on the MAX 10 by 2020, a full year earlier than a larger version that would have required wing and engine changes. Boeing is scheduled to begin customer deliveries of the 737 MAX 8 (737-8) later this year and flight testing of the 737 MAX 9 (737-9). Boeing’s stock traded down about 0.4% Wednesday morning, at $158.42 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $160.07.

Photo - AFP   Sharelines IranAir takes delivery of first Airbus jet IranAir takes delivery of first Airbus jet Paris: The head of IranAir took delivery in France on Wednesday of the first Western airliner under an international sanctions deal, calling it a "sunny day" for relations between Iran and Europe and a memorable one for aviation in the nation of 80 million people. Chairman Farhad Parvaresh invited Fabrice Bregier, the head of planemaking at Airbus, to fly on the new A321 to Tehran, where the airline plans to mark its arrival in its fleet with a ceremony on Thursday. The 189-seat plane, already painted in IranAir's livery, is the first of 100 ordered from Airbus following a deal reached in 2015 between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. The airline has also ordered 80 aircraft from Boeing and is in the final stages of negotiating an order for 20 turboprops from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica. Highlighting Iran's emergence from years of isolation, the Airbus delivery marks the first brand-new jet directly acquired from a Western manufacturer for decades, other than the replacement of an Airbus jet shot down by the US Navy in 1988. Republicans in the US Congress have objected to the nuclear pact, signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. It also faces opposition from hardliners in Iran. Parvaresh said he hoped the United States would not block the agreement under president-elect Donald Trump, who at times has pledged to pull Washington out of the nuclear accord. Both Airbus and Boeing need US export licences to deliver the jets because of the number of US parts. Both have received licences but Boeing needs to have the majority extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect it to point to the Airbus delivery in order to press the case for its sales to remain in force. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract," Parvaresh told reporters. The first Airbus aircraft will enter service on Saturday starting on busy domestic routes such as Tehran to Mashhad for the next couple of months, he said. IranAir hopes to receive "at least two more from Airbus" by the start of the Iranian new year in March, and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017, he added. It also expects to receive three larger A330 jets in 2017. IranAir could also receive one to two turboprop aircraft by the Iranian new year, but a contract has yet to be signed. "We are very optimistic we can finalise it in January or so," Parvaresh said. The arrival of new aircraft will allow IranAir "step by step" to phase out elderly planes including Fokker 100 regional aircraft serving domestic routes, Parvaresh said. Analysts say IranAir has one of the world's oldest airliner fleets, held together until now by smuggled or improvised parts. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

("TPAC" or "Company") (otc-pink:TPAC), announces that it has recently signed a letter of intent with a well-known North American Aerospace manufacturing company ("NAACO"), through which TPAC will acquire a meaningful ownership interest in NAACO.  NAACO produces products for most major prime contractors including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.  Boeing business accounts for approximately 20% of NAACO annual revenue.  Presently, NAACO has annual revenue of $12 million, with a backlog to support $15 million annually and projections to do $20 million annually by 2018. Bill McKay, CEO of TPAC stated: "We have been in discussions with NAACO for more than one year and our efforts are paying off.  We are in the non-disclosure/due diligence phase and therefore we will not disclose the true name of NAACO.  NAACO has an excellent reputation and management team.  We are confident that by working together with NAACO and cultivating our connections in the aerospace industry, we can greatly assist NAACO in expanding its revenue through additional contracts.  We are optimistic that in the future there will be an opportunity to increase our ownership percentage in NAACO and to produce bearings at their US facility.  We believe that our combined synergies will greatly enhance future opportunities for both companies. We also foresee an opportunity to sub-contract work to our partners in China.  This as a great start to 2017 and we anticipate closing the transaction during the first half of 2017, subject to due diligence." Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains or incorporates by reference "forward-looking statements" including certain information with respect to plans and strategies of TPAC. Any statements contained herein or incorporated herein by references that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes," "suggests," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. There are a number of events or actual results of TPAC operations that could differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A PARIS: The head of IranAir took delivery in France on Wednesday of the first Western airliner under an international sanctions deal, calling it a "sunny day" for relations between Iran and Europe and a memorable one for aviation in the nation of 80 million people. Chairman Farhad Parvaresh invited Fabrice Bregier, the head of planemaking at Airbus, to fly on the new A321 to Tehran, where the airline plans to mark its arrival in its fleet with a ceremony on Thursday. The 189-seat plane, already painted in IranAir's livery, is the first of 100 ordered from Airbus following a deal reached in 2015 between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. The airline has also ordered 80 aircraft from Boeing and is in the final stages of negotiating an order for 20 turboprops from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica . Highlighting Iran's emergence from years of isolation, the Airbus delivery marks the first brand-new jet directly acquired from a Western manufacturer for decades, other than the replacement of an Airbus jet shot down by the U.S. Navy in 1988. Republicans in the U.S. Congress have objected to the nuclear pact, signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. It also faces opposition from hardliners in Iran. Parvaresh said he hoped the United States would not block the agreement under president-elect Donald Trump, who at times has pledged to pull Washington out of the nuclear accord. Both Airbus and Boeing need U.S. export licenses to deliver the jets because of the number of U.S. parts. Both have received licenses but Boeing needs to have the majority extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect it to point to the Airbus delivery in order to press the case for its sales to remain in force. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract,” Parvaresh told reporters. The first Airbus aircraft will enter service on Saturday starting on busy domestic routes such as Tehran to Mashhad for the next couple of months, he said. IranAir hopes to receive "at least two more from Airbus" by the start of the Iranian new year in March, and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017, he added. It also expects to receive three larger A330 jets in 2017. IranAir could also receive one to two turboprop aircraft by the Iranian new year, but a contract has yet to be signed. "We are very optimistic we can finalize it in January or so," Parvaresh said. The arrival of new aircraft will allow IranAir "step by step" to phase out elderly planes including Fokker 100 regional aircraft serving domestic routes, Parvaresh said. Analysts say IranAir has one of the world's oldest airliner fleets, held together until now by smuggled or improvised parts.

Published: 18:41 January 11, 2017 By Shweta Jain, Deputy Business Editor   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE DUBAI: As Emirates gives up on Airbus’ future version of the A380 aircraft, or the A380neo (new engine option) as it’s known as, Airbus chief says its biggest superjumbo customer continues to challenge it for an upgrade of the double-decker. “We have studied the possible evolution of the A380neo aircraft and we came to the conclusion that the time was not yet there to launch it. To do that we would need, of course, to inject some development cost and we would need to have a better environment from the market perspective, and also clear return on investment. “Regarding Emirates, what I can say is that I am very grateful that they are such a strong supporter of the A380 and that they are challenging us to say ‘we want to buy more, we want the new version, we will be your big customer’. So I believe that this is also a key to the future success of the A380 and future versions of this aircraft,” Fabrice Brégier, President of Airbus Commercial Aircraft and Chief Operating Officer of Airbus, told Gulf News in a webcast on Wednesday during its commercial aircraft media briefing. Having pinned hopes on it for long, Emirates has slowly come to accept that the European planemaker is quietly going to kill the A380neo project. The world’s largest operator of the superjumbo, however, was until recently appealing for Airbus to continue making the aircraft. “I can’t force Toulouse [Airbus’ home base in southern France] to do anything. My main concern is that they stop producing the plane,” Emirates President Tim Clark reportedly said in mid-last year. Emirates is the world’s largest operator of A380s, with 89 currently in its fleet and a further 53 on order. “We decided to keep what really made sense, which is to increase the seat count while keeping the big advantage of the A380, which is the quality as perceived by the passengers… the bars, the restrooms, the showers and all that. And this is what we are doing right now,” Brégier said Wednesday. Emirates last month said it is deferring delivery of six Airbus A380s from 2017 to 2018 and postponing delivery of another six A380s from 2018 to 2019. Airbus said agreements had been reached between Emirates and Rolls-Royce and between Emirates and Airbus. Airbus maintains order lead Airbus said Wednesday it posted an eight per cent jump in deliveries in 2016, having delivered 688 aircraft in the year to 82 customers, beating its previous record of 635 set in 2015, yet lagging behind Boeing which delivered 748 aircraft last year. It, however, retained its order lead over rival Boeing clocking up 731 net orders from 51 customers in 2016, of which eight are new, against Boeing’s 668 net orders in the year. At the end of 2016, Airbus’s overall backlog stood at 6,874 aircraft valued at $1,018 billion at list prices. It is expecting to deliver more than 700 aircraft in 2017, its chief executive said. “We will continue to ramp up. As of today, we will be above 700 deliveries,” Brégier said. “Next year, we will increase production again,” added John Leahy, Airbus’ Chief Operating Officer – Customers, said in the web briefing. “We are essentially sold out at this point. That doesn’t mean we can’t increase our production, and we will next year and the year after. We have to build what we already have orders for, not worry about getting new orders.” IranAir takes delivery of first Airbus jet post-sanctions PARIS: The head of IranAir took delivery on Wednesday of the first new Western jet under an international sanctions deal, calling it a “sunny day” for peace and friendship between Iran and Europe and a memorable one for aviation in the nation of 80 million people. The 189-seat plane is the first of 100 ordered from Airbus following a deal reached in 2015 between Tehran and world powers to lift nuclear-related sanctions against Iran, in return for restrictions on the country’s nuclear activities. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh invited the planemaking chief of Airbus to fly onboard the new A321, which has been painted in IranAir’s livery, to Tehran where the airline plans to mark its arrival in its fleet with a ceremony on Thursday. -Reuters More from Aviation Indian airlines soar but infrastructure lacks US won’t push antitrust case against airlines Boeing scores a $22b win with SpiceJet deal SpiceJet to buy 100 new Boeing planes Flynas in $8.6b Airbus deal, shareholder says Emirates to launch daily flight to Croatia Boeing jumbo-jet era ending in US SpiceJet in $10b deal with Boeing for 737 jets tags from this storyIran follow this tag on MGNFrance follow this tag on MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsIran follow this tag on MGN+ MGNFrance follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGN+ MGNemirates airline FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Indian airlines soar but infrastructure lacks 02US won’t push antitrust case against airlines 03‘Emirates challenging us for future A380’ 04Thousands of travellers face fog-induced delays 05Boeing scores a $22b win with SpiceJet deal 8Images World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi Jan 18, 2010 8Images Where to live in Downtown Dubai Mar 15, 2011 11Images Etihad Airways offers residence in the sky May 04, 2014 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Tour of the DWTC kitchens May 18, 2015 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Speeding driver crashes into parked car, dies Revealed: World's most powerful passports 9 ways your own home could kill you Mum reunited with abused baby in Saudi Arabia Dubai retail developers prepare for mega year Businessman donates Dh370m to charity Mohammad Bin Zayed visits UAE ambassador Revealed: Top 25 universities in the world Female Indonesian workers come to UAE Close Recommended For You Iran parliament stresses FDI in economic planPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 Al Abadi makes promises for post-Daesh IraqPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 9 ways your own home could kill youPUBLISHED ON Jan 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Airbus said it stood ready to ramp up its production in the future. Airbus announced Wednesday it delivered a record 688 commercial planes to customers around the globe in 2016. The company said the figure marked an 8-percent increase year on year and came on the back of strong operational performance and a robust market. Airbus thus booked the 14th straight year of rising delivery numbers. The Toulouse-based European plane maker added the aircraft were supplied to 82 clients worldwide.

By contrast, Boeing came out on top of the deliveries table with a total of 748 planes supplied to customers in 2016. "We delivered on our objectives in a challenging environment, proving our ramp-up readiness for the future," Airbus President Fabrice Bregier said in a statement. He also noted that Airbus was delivering an A321 to Iran Air, the first of 100 planes the company would send to Iran under a deal to modernize Iran's aging fleet. The contract had become possible after a 2015 international accord with Tehran on its nuclear program that saw many sanctions against the country lifted. Iran has also ordered planes from Boeing in a bid to diversify its base of suppliers and get the best deals from both sides. hg/jd (dpa, Reuters)   DW recommends Airbus agrees to sell 100 planes to Iran Air Airbus signed a contract to sell 100 aircraft to Iran Air nearly one year after sanctions against Iran were lifted.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Airbus posted an eight percent rise in deliveries last year, beating its own forecasts by a comfortable margin to set a company record, and pulled off a last-minute surge in orders to beat arch-rival Boeing in the race for new orders. Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, the European planemaker said on Wednesday it delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with an official company forecast of more than 650 and a goal set by its finance director of more than 670. Deliveries rebounded at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Airbus remained behind the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, in deliveries, but scored another win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016. Boeing delivered 748 aircraft and took 668 net orders last year. The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two aircraft were bought back from another customer that no longer needs them and are unused, sales chief John Leahy said. IranAir was expected to take delivery of the first aircraft in France later on Wednesday. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China's Bank of Communications. But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy. Industry orders peaked in 2015. Leahy warned of a further slowdown in orders in 2017 and said Airbus would be unable to sell as many aircraft as it delivers this year. But he dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically "overbook" to dampen the risk of airline failures. Speaking to a group of reporters after the news conference, he insisted deliveries would continue to rise "for several years" despite cyclical swings in orders as planemakers work through record waiting lists for planes.

Image: Anatoliy Lukich/Shutterstock Future US jet fighters will likely be equipped with a swarm of hundreds of micro-drones, following the release of footage of a field test conducted in October 2016. While enormous US Air Force drones such as the Predator continuously patrol the skies over places such as Afghanistan, the future of aerial warfare will more likely be with the deployment of micro-drones. According to the US Department of Defense (DOD), the first successful trial of 103 Perdix micro-drones was conducted back in October 2016, when two F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets released their payload over a test site in China Lake, California. From the footage released by the department, the drones can be seen falling out of canisters attached to the wings of the planes before quickly switching on and demonstrating “advanced swarm behaviours such as collective decision-making, adaptive formation flying and self-healing”. Each of these Perdix drones is capable of speeds up to Mach 0.6. They can withstand temperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius as well as the shock of being deployed from a significant height at very high speeds. These drones would be difficult to spot with the naked eye, with a body length of just 6in and a wingspan of 11in, and would be capable of flight for up to 20 minutes. ‘They are a collective organism’ Originally designed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) engineering students, the Perdix drone was modified for military use by the scientists and engineers of MIT Lincoln Laboratory, starting in 2013. “Due to the complex nature of combat, Perdix are not pre-programmed synchronised individuals; they are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,” said William Roper, director of the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO). “Because every Perdix communicates and collaborates with every other Perdix, the swarm has no leader and can gracefully adapt to drones entering or exiting the team.” By the end of this year, the US DOD and the SCO hope to build 1,000 micro-drones as well as developing the seventh-generation design that would include greater autonomous capabilities.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau 7/7 By Tim Hepher | TOULOUSE, France TOULOUSE, France Airbus posted an eight percent rise in deliveries last year, beating its own forecasts by a comfortable margin to set a company record, and pulled off a last-minute surge in orders to beat arch-rival Boeing (BA.N) in the race for new orders. But the European planemaker warned of a further slowdown of industry orders in 2017 as the aerospace industry turns its attention to producing what it already has on its order books, following an extended order boom. Analysts say orders are shrinking due to concerns over weakening economies and relatively low oil prices, while a wave of demand for new fuel-saving models has mainly run its course. "What kept the orders party going much longer than usual was new product launches and there are few products to be launched," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Teal Group. "These are not hard times. This is merely the party coming to its inevitable end." Confirming an estimate published by Reuters, Airbus said it had delivered 688 aircraft in 2016, compared with its most recent forecast of 670. Deliveries rebounded sharply at the year-end after problems in the supply chain. Airbus (AIR.PA) shares rose 0.4 percent. Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told a news conference he expected more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but without the last-minute frenzy seen last year due to problems in receiving engines and cabin equipment. Airbus announced a fourth successive win in the race for new business after posting 731 net orders for 2016, including more than 300 orders in December, confirming potential business reported earlier by Reuters. Boeing kept the title of No.1 producer with 748 deliveries but registered a lower figure of 668 net orders. The surge in Airbus orders included 98 out of 100 aircraft sold to Iran under a historic sanctions deal. The other two were bought back from another customer, sales chief John Leahy said. Boeing has sold 80 jets to Iran but did not include this in its 2016 tally, a move that would apparently have put it ahead of Airbus. Airbus posted over 100 orders from unidentified customers, which industry sources have linked to Saudi carrier Flynas and the leasing arm of China's Bank of Communications. But a December sales flurry by both Airbus and Boeing failed to prevent the combined book-to-bill ratio of the two giants dipping below 1 for the first time since 2009, placing a dent in record industry order backlogs amid concerns over the economy. Leahy dismissed concerns among some investors over mounting deferrals and cancellations of orders because planemakers typically "overbook" to dampen the risk of airline failures. Speaking to a group of reporters after the news conference, he insisted deliveries would continue to rise "for several years" despite cyclical swings in orders as planemakers work through record waiting lists for planes.

Share Tweet Will India become main manufacturer of Pakistan's beloved F-16 jets? Factor­s such as Trump, long produc­tion timefr­ame and other better aircra­ft option­s can act as major deterr­ents By Naveed Ahmad Published: January 11, 2017 0SHARES Share Tweet Email File photo of a F-16 jet. PHOTO: PAF India, wanting to upgrade its air force with 400 more fighter jets, has many foreign companies vying for its multi-billion dollar manufacturing contract. Boeing and Lockheed Martin from the US, SAAB Group from Sweden and Dassault Aviation from France are all competing to win the production order. Lockheed Martin, which builds Pakistan’s beloved F-16 fighter jets, has offered to completely shift the manufacturing of this aircraft from Texas to India. The arrangement is subject to India agreeing to buy first 100 F-16s (Block 70-72) – the most advanced version of the fighter jet. “We make it in India, for India and then we make it in India and export to the world. If the initial orders are not there, it might not work for the industry,’’ an official for the Lockheed Martin had stated. Turkey to modernise Pakistan’s F-16s The proposed jet – already titled F-16IN – is being offered with a new radar system, stealth detection and threat detection capability. While F-16s in general have a smaller radar cross-section, the new block won’t have stealth capability. If India chooses F-16s over other options, it could be a blow to Pakistan. Pakistan Air Force has been flying F-16s since the 1980s and though it has other multirole jets in its fleet, F-16s have been a crucial part of the country’s air defence mechanism. With India becoming the main manufacturer of the fighter jet, it could create hindrances for Pakistan to acquire the aircraft and its spare parts if not completely choke the supply. Good news for Pakistan India has not yet decided whether it seeks Saab Group’s JAS 39 Gripen or F-16 (Block 70-72) to upgrade its air defence. Given the urgency to modernise the fleet, the Indian Air Force may choose Sweden’s Gripen jets with the objective of customising to its future needs better over widely popular F-16s. The Gripen system will be alien to both Pakistan and China and it will give India a perceived edge over its regional rivals. Blow to Pakistan? India could become next F-16 hub Also, even if we assume Lockheed Martin is the victor, India may not have its first F-16IN delivered before 2022. Installation of the plant will take a few months. Then, it takes 36 months to deliver the first units. The total number of units per year depends on the number of assembly lines. Meanwhile, the cumbersome process of hiring and training the local manpower must be taken into account to ensure Modi’s envisaged Make-in-India goal. Additionally, there’s the Trump factor. Will the next US administration let Lockheed Martin and other mega corporations invest billions of dollars in India and make Americans jobless? Prima facie, US President-elect Donald J Trump has categorically stated that the country was passing through the “greatest jobs theft” in the history of the world by nations such as India, China, Mexico and Singapore. He is already upping the ante for US corporations to stem outward flow of jobs. Carrier, an air-conditioner manufacturer, was the first one to attract the president-elect’s attention against investing in Mexico. Meanwhile, the automobile industry giant received an explicit threat to big border tax on vehicle manufactured at foreign plants. Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. If Lockheed Martin relocates F-16 manufacturing to India, over 2,000 Americans will be losing jobs in Fort Worth unless the company manages to absorb them in fledging F-35 program on the same campus. Trump’s protectionism comes in direct conflict with Modi’s Make-in-India initiative. In Lockheed Martin’s case, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government’s reclusive policy promises less to the foreign investor while seeking the lion’s share: “self-reliance, indigenisation, technology upgrade and achieving economies of scale including development of capabilities for exports in the defence sector”. Given these possible dangers, anxiety is soaring high in India with its largest entrepreneurial body – Associated Chambers of Commerce of India – issuing the following statement: “India needs to watch out and must build bridges with the upcoming American administration and assuage concerns about American jobs”. Lockheed’s prospects ahead During the Obama tenure, US-India bilateral trade has grown from $19 billion in 2009-2010 to over $120 billion in 2015, say official estimates. Last year, proponents of Make-in-India were hoping to boost the bilateral trade to $500 billion. India to have ‘eye in the sky’ to spy on Pakistan, China The country enjoys impressive support on both sides of the isle in Congress as well as Senate. But with Trump in the picture now, it’s obvious that the Obama administration’s emphasis on strengthening partnership with India won’t escape uncontested. Delhi must be preparing for hard bargains and lobbying in Washington and given these hurdles, it might like to wait for a more suitable time and even more modern fighter aircraft for the Lockheed Martin to produce in India.

Pakistan was offered the chance be add planes to the last production run but apparently didn’t have the funds to purchase the planes without a subsidy from USA govt (which Congress denied).

China is the real threat to India and India is upgrading its airfare to face off threats from China. Pakistan is not of any concern to India. Equally or more important point to consider is if India goes for F-16, USA will be behind India in case of any conflict or threat from China. No other country can do this. Also, no other country in the world can or has the potential to increase trade or offer technologies as US can. Other fighter jets may or may not be superior to F-16 but F-16’s are more than a match to what China now has. Also, US standing behind India will alone deter China from taking any aggressive action or threaten India. If F-16’s are manufactured in India, it will give a big boost to India’s advancement in manufacture and technology too.

The deployment of the 10 planes to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni on Honshu Island marks a major milestone for the F-35, which has been bedeviled by technical glitches and soaring cost overruns. With a current development and acquisition price tag already at $379 billion for a total of 2,443 F-35 aircraft, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 is the most expensive plane in history, and costs are set to go higher still. The Marines’s version of the plane, known as the F-35B, is capable of conducting short takeoffs and vertical landings. Trump last month sent shockwaves through the aerospace industry when he tweeted that he wanted rival Boeing to price out a possible alternative. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump tweeted December 22. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 The F/A-18 Super Hornet does not have stealth capabilities and has been in use since the late 1990s. Once servicing, maintenance and other costs for the F-35 are factored in over the aircraft’s lifespan through 2070, overall program costs have been projected to rise to as much as $1.5 trillion. Proponents of the F-35 tout its speed, close air-support capabilities, airborne agility and a massive array of sensors giving pilots unparalleled access to information. Why Trump’s tweets on US arms industry are pure theatre “The unique combination of stealth, cutting-edge radar and sensor technology, and electronic warfare systems bring all of the access and lethality capabilities of a fifth-generation fighter, a modern bomber, and an adverse-weather, all-threat environment air-support platform,” the Marines said in a statement. In August, the US Air Force declared an initial squadron of F-35A stealth fighters ready for combat and said an overseas deployment for that version of the plane was likely early this year. The US Navy’s version of the plane, the F-35C, is built to land on aircraft carriers. The PLA Air Force chief in November said development of China’s J-20 stealth fighter jet would be sped up, in an apparent bid to quell speculation the domestic aircraft was falling behind its production schedule.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Journalist with ‘scoop of the century’ dies in Hong Kong 2 Pass that self-destruct button: why Hong Kong has fallen to such lows 3 Judge Donald Tsang by his own rules, prosecution urges 4 Jack Ma’s Alibaba can create 1m US jobs, he tells Trump 5 China in touch with Trump’s team, open to meeting at Davos Shared 1 Pass that self-destruct button: why Hong Kong has fallen to such lows 2 Journalist with ‘scoop of the century’ dies in Hong Kong 3 Jack Ma’s Alibaba can create 1m US jobs, he tells Trump 4 Hong Kong and Shenzhen police on hunt for two missing teen girls 5 Tsang ‘hopelessly compromised’ chief executive duty Commented 1 How China became a player in the world of soccer 2 How Ronda Rousey built an industry that eventually destroyed her 3 Ronaldo, Real Madrid lined up for Hong Kong handover anniversary 4 Police trace HK$8m trainer lost in horse-buying email scam 5 Major water sports centre planned for Tseung Kwan O Promotions Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Hong Kong Chief Secretary urged to come clean on museum architect 10 Jan 2017 - 12:09pm 16 Life in a more sustainable world In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China Will Nicaragua be next to break ties with Taiwan? 8 Jan 2017 - 9:10am 7 Wicked fun Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Hong Kong Joshua Wong under Taiwan police protection after assault attempt 8 Jan 2017 - 8:55am 48 Hong Kong After 71 suicides since 2013, education chief told schools are like ‘prison’ 8 Jan 2017 - 10:53am 41 Why Churchill didn’t want Hong Kong defended against Japanese 7 Jan 2017 - 6:30am 13 Politics Modi’s cashless payment dream: Meet the people paying for it 7 Jan 2017 - 12:01pm 3 China How climate change in Central Asia could spark regional conflict 6 Jan 2017 - 11:26pm 4 Hong Kong Hong Kong a sanctuary for cockatoos on brink of extinction 4 Jan 2017 - 11:33pm 3 Hong Kong Octopus looks to extend tentacles and stay competitive 4 Jan 2017 - 10:18pm 18 China Does China have a submarine signals network under Pacific? 4 Jan 2017 - 9:54am 21 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Posted 11 Jan 2017 08:30 Updated 11 Jan 2017 11:30 The Boeing logo is seen at their headquarters in Chicago, in this April 24, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Young/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: Boeing Co warned on Tuesday that it will conduct involuntary layoffs of engineers, part of a cost-cutting drive as the aerospace and defense company responds to increasing competition amid slowing aircraft sales. The reductions, disclosed in an internal memo seen by Reuters, also include dozens of job categories eligible for voluntary layoffs in Washington state, southern California and South Carolina. Boeing did not indicate the number of reductions the company planned. Vice Chairman Ray Conner and Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Officer Kevin McAllister said last month that Boeing would continue job cuts in 2017. The company slashed employment by 10,828 jobs last year. About two-thirds of those reductions were in Washington state. "While we have made good progress, more changes are needed to ensure our long-term future," John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, wrote in the memo. "We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition." The announcement came as Boeing teamed up with a new lobbying group on Tuesday to defend US$8.7 billion of tax breaks in Washington state granted to the aerospace industry in 2013. The new group opposes efforts to tie the incentives to Boeing employment. The engineering layoffs are part of a larger reduction at the company's airplane unit. "Once plans are finalized across other functions, that information will‎ be shared with employees," Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said in an email. "Each function will determine its own plan." The engineering reductions will take place in stages. Voluntary layoff invitations are being sent Jan. 13 and will take effect April 21. Notices for involuntary reductions will be sent Jan. 20, with layoffs planned for March 24. Boeing plans two more rounds of engineering layoffs later in the year "driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition," Hamilton said in the memo.

Subscribe free to our newsletters via your Email Address SPACE DAILY SPACE WAR TERRA DAILY ENERGY NEWS MARS DAILY GPS DAILY SEED DAILY WIND DAILY DISASTER NEWS SOLAR ENERGY MEDICAL NEWS NUCLEAR NEWS OIL & GAS NEWS BIO FUEL DAILY JAPAN NEWS Pentagon's Mystery Space Plane Stays in Orbit for 600 Days by Staff Writers Moscow (Sputnik) Jan 11, 2017 Only two reusable crafts have been confirmed as part of the X-37B fleet. Standing 9.6 tall and 29 feet long, the space vehicle has a wingspan of about 5 feet, and is powered by gallium arsenide solar cells with lithium-ion batteries. Air Force Officials have noted that one of OTV's main objectives is testing onboard equipment. The X-37B space plane, a mysterious unmanned craft belonging to the US Air Force, is closing in on a program record for time spent in orbit, after spending 600 days in space. The orbital test vehicle (OTV) was launched in May 2015, from Cape Canaveral in Florida, detaching from an Atlas V rocket. This marks the X-37B program's fourth mission and, if the craft spends 75 more days skyward, it will break the OTV-3 orbital record of 675 days. What the OTV-4 is doing in orbit, and how long it will stay aloft, is unclear, as well as what payloads it may be carrying, since most of that information is classified. Some have posited that the plane is on a mission to destroy spy satellites, or possibly serve as a space bomber. The craft operates in low orbit, circling the Earth between 175-800 km above the Earth's surface. Secrecy expert Steven Aftergood from the Federation of American Scientists told the Daily Mail, "The US government has a bottomless appetite for sensitive information...As powerful as our intelligence satellites may be, they also have their limitations - most notably the limitations imposed by their orbital parameters." April 2010 marked the beginning of the OTV missions, with OTV-1 spending 244 days in orbit before touching down in December of that year. OTV-2 spent 468 days in orbit, lifting off in March 2011 and landing in June 2012. Boeing representatives have said that the Orbiter Processing Facility-1 (OPF-1), a former Kennedy Space Center space shuttle facility, will be used "to efficiently land, recover, refurbish and relaunch the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV)," reported Space.com. Boeing's Space and Intelligence Systems, in El Segundo, California, is responsible for developing the X-37B, and the group houses the defense company's commercial and governmental satellite development, along with experimental payloads and supporting space systems. The OTV initiative, which falls under the purview of the US Defense Department, is being lead by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office under the direction of the Air Force Secretary and the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. Only two reusable crafts have been confirmed as part of the X-37B fleet. Standing just under 3 metres tall and nearly 9 metres long, the space vehicle has a wingspan of about 1.5 metres, and is powered by gallium arsenide solar cells charging lithium-ion batteries. Air Force Officials have noted that one of OTV's main objectives is testing onboard equipment. Last September, deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space Winston Beauchamp said, "It remains a very useful way to test out things." Former deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, Lt. Gen. David Deptula, told the Air Force Times in February 2016, "Space has become a ubiquitous element of everything that every service component, combatant commander, national intelligence organization, and leadership of the free world relies on...It's very important to be on the leading edge of capitalizing on new technologies to keep us ahead of potential adversary moves."

By Barry Ritholtz Bloomberg Views Published Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 12:07PM EST Last updated Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 3:16PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print So the year begins and with it a new presidency. Everyone has ideas how best to invest your money. Simple indexing is the least expensive way to manage capital; no, smart beta is superior; this year we are told (once again) will be when active stock-picking makes its triumphant return. Regardless of how you choose to allocate your assets, there is another way; a much better way; a method that cannot fail in its brilliance and simplicity. Go with the POTUS indexes. Direct your attention to the relentless tweeting of the man who soon will be president. There is valuable information in those 140 characters that can move markets and alter perceptions of corporate fundamentals. This has real alpha-generating possibilities. Whoever is managing your favorite 401(k), hedge fund or trading account should take note. To help you make sense of this, we have created two indexes based on Donald Trump’s tweet and other pre-presidential utterances. Before we get to the specific stocks, I want to offer a bit more about the underlying concept. First it goes without saying that the U.S. president is the most powerful person on the planet. Although the U.S. Constitution places all sorts of constraints on his direct power, his every word is important, whether you agree with him or not. Now consider the companies he has been tweeting or commenting about, both positively and negatively. You will recognize the two distinct groups that this creates, each with very different prospects. In one group are companies that have drawn expressions of approval from Trump. An even greater endorsement is recruiting the senior executives of those companies to be cabinet members or advisers. Let’s call this first group the Oligarch Index, or OLGY. The Oligarch Index includes Colony Capital Inc., CoreCivic Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp., Facebook Inc., Ford Motor Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., PayPal Holdings Inc., Sprint Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and United Technologies Corp. The other group is made up of those companies that Trump has trashed. We shall call this the Drain the Swamp Index, or SWMP. This includes Amazon.Com Inc., Boeing Co., General Motors Co., Kellogg Co., Lockheed Martin Corp., Macy’s Inc., New York Times Co., PepsiCo Inc., Rexnord Corp., Tesla Motors Inc., Time Warner Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Twitter Inc. and Constellation Brands Inc. On the positive, oligarchic side, these are the companies that will help to make America great again: • Colony Capital: Chairman Tom Barrack spoke at the Republican National Convention, and is chairman of Mr. Trump’s inauguration committee. • Exxon Mobil: Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, who has extensive global experience, is Mr. Trump’s nominee to be secretary of State. • Goldman Sachs: Alum Steve Mnuchin is Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of the Treasury and Gary Cohen, Goldman’s president, is his pick to head the National Economic Council. Besides, how could we have an oligarch portfolio without Goldman? • PayPal: Co-founder Peter Thiel was one of the few techies who had the foresight to back Mr. Trump early; he is also a director of Facebook, a major venue for passing around fake news. • JPMorgan: CEO Jamie Dimon was recruited to be Treasury secretary. He convinced Mr. Trump that he could do more to help make America great again by continuing to run the nation’s largest bank. A good guy and a great banker. • United Technology: The company owns Carrier, which kept jobs in America. Thanks! Now for some of the companies Mr. Trump disparaged, directly or otherwise: • Amazon: Jeff Bezos, CEO, founder and largest shareholder of the online retailer, owns the Washington Post -- Mr. Trump’s least favourite paper. • Boeing: Costs for building the new Air Force One are out of control -- cancel order! • GM: It plans to make cars in Mexico? Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax! • Kellogg: It said that it would no longer advertise on conservative news website Breitbart. Boycott! • Lockheed Martin: F-35s are a disaster -- price out comparable F18! • Macy’s: The retailer dropped Mr. Trump’s clothing lines, and it had a disappointing holiday-sales season and plans to cut 10,000 jobs. Disloyal! • New York Times: It, of course, is failing! • Tesla: Global warming is a Chinese hoax. • Time Warner: It owns CNN, which was so embarrassed by its total support of Hillary Clinton, and yet she lost in a landslide, that they don’t know what to do. • Twitter: It refused to create a “Lying Hillary” emoji; CEO Jack Dorsey was disinvited from Mr. Trump’s Tech Summit. Sad! Rather than a stock-bond mix, think of this as a paired trade -- long OLGY, short SWMP. Can you imagine how much more significant and market-moving those tweets will be once Trump is sworn into office? This is theme investing at its finest. And as you can see from the chart below, you would have done quite well by investing on this basis: Some of you coastal liberal elites might not appreciate the wisdom of building specific portfolios from Mr. Trump’s tweets; that’s just because you don’t understand the new era of populism, viral social media and fact-free politics. You are stuck in the old way of thinking -- growth, valuations, market cap and momentum. That’s old school. Catch up. This is going to make index investing great again. -- Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg View columnist.

REUTERS/Jim YoungMore By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE (Reuters) - A dispute over $8.7 billion in Washington state tax breaks is heating up after Boeing Co joined a new lobbying group set up to preserve the industry incentives, the biggest in U.S. history. The group, launched on Tuesday, opposes efforts to make the aerospace tax breaks, passed in 2013, dependent on Boeing maintaining minimum employment levels in the state. Such "claw-back" bills had failed the past two years, but union leaders and a lawmaker said in interviews on Tuesday they planned to try again in the legislative session that started this week. The new group, Aerospace Works for Washington, will be a "megaphone" to warn that jobs are at risk, said Maud Daudon, chief executive of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which is leading the effort. "We are in a competition to keep them here," she said. "Any state in the country would die to get these jobs." The group also may oppose European Union efforts to eliminate the incentives under World Trade Organization rules, and may try to extend them to Washington's growing space industry, Daudon said. Chicago-based Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, has its largest factories in Washington, and is the state's largest private employer, with 72,000 workers. As with previous proposals, "Boeing is opposed to any effort to alter the Washington aerospace tax incentives," the company said in a statement on Tuesday. "Changing the parameters of the incentives now would simply increase the cost of building airplanes in this state, and unnecessarily put excellent, family-wage jobs in Washington at risk." SEEKING JOB GUARANTEES Aerospace Works for Washington has more than 30 members, including elected leaders, economic development organizations and chambers of commerce from state regions where aerospace manufacturers have factories. It includes trade groups of retailers, restaurants, hotels and other industries. Alaska Airlines, owned by Alaska Air Group Inc , is also a member. No labor groups are involved. Daudon said the broad membership signals growing opposition to changing the incentives. Union leaders said their members still support the tax breaks "as long as Boeing doesn't ship jobs out of state," said Larry Brown, legislative director for the International Association of Machinists, District 751. The 2013 tax cuts were designed to "maintain and grow" aerospace employment in the state and are available to any local aerospace manufacturer. Since the law passed, Boeing has eliminated 11,414 jobs in Washington, about 15 percent of its state workforce, the company's employment data showed. In the year through November 2016, the state lost 5,500 manufacturing jobs, largely in aerospace, according to state employment security department data. Boeing said in December that job cuts and movements were necessary to respond to competition from European rival Airbus Group SE and years of constricted U.S. defense spending. Boeing said it fulfilled its commitment in the 2013 law to locate the assembly line and wing factory for its new 777X jetliner in the state.

REUTERS/Jim Young/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: Boeing Co warned on Tuesday that it will conduct involuntary layoffs of engineers, part of a cost-cutting drive as the aerospace and defense company responds to increasing competition amid slowing aircraft sales. The reductions, disclosed in an internal memo seen by Reuters, also include dozens of job categories eligible for voluntary layoffs in Washington state, southern California and South Carolina. Boeing did not indicate the number of reductions the company planned. Vice Chairman Ray Conner and Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Officer Kevin McAllister said last month that Boeing would continue job cuts in 2017. The company slashed employment by 10,828 jobs last year. About two-thirds of those reductions were in Washington state. "While we have made good progress, more changes are needed to ensure our long-term future," John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, wrote in the memo. "We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition." The announcement came as Boeing teamed up with a new lobbying group on Tuesday to defend US$8.7 billion of tax breaks in Washington state granted to the aerospace industry in 2013. The new group opposes efforts to tie the incentives to Boeing employment. The engineering layoffs are part of a larger reduction at the company's airplane unit. "Once plans are finalized across other functions, that information will‎ be shared with employees," Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said in an email. "Each function will determine its own plan." The engineering reductions will take place in stages. Voluntary layoff invitations are being sent Jan. 13 and will take effect April 21. Notices for involuntary reductions will be sent Jan. 20, with layoffs planned for March 24. Boeing plans two more rounds of engineering layoffs later in the year "driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition," Hamilton said in the memo.

Just Ask Jim Mattis Ares Trump Probably Won’t Cancel F-35. Just Ask Jim Mattis Jan 12, 2017 by Lara Seligman in Ares RSS EMAIL Tweet Comments 121 Related Media Citing F-35 Cost, Trump Asks Boeing for F-18 Quote Trump Meets With Boeing, Lockheed CEOs, DOD Brass JPO Chief Defends F-35 Program After Trump Tweet The incoming president’s recent comments about Lockheed Martin’s F-35 have sent the defense community into a frenzy, with observers racing to figure out exactly what Donald Trump has in store for the stealth fighter. Trump has slammed the F-35 for “out of control” costs, asked Boeing to price out the cost to build a “comparable” F/A-18 Super Hornet and called for “competition” in the defense market. Investors are watching the dialogue closely, and some clearly fear the worst – each time Trump slams the F-35, Lockheed’s stock temporarily slumps. Some observers have interpreted the comments as Trump hinting that he wants to compete the F-35 against the Super Hornet, or cancel the program altogether. But Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, provided a simpler, more likely, explanation. Popular Now Boeing Defines Final 737 MAX Stretch Offering UAE Calls For A380 Landing Gear Inspections Opinion: The End Of The Airbus-Boeing Supercycle “The president-elect has talked about the cost of [the F-35] but in no way shown a lack of support for the program,” Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation hearing. “He just wants the best bang for the buck.” In other words, Trump is just trying to pressure Lockheed to get costs down. Mattis, who presumably will have some input on any decision regarding the military’s next-generation fighter, offered a resounding defense of the F-35.   “The F-35 is critical for our own air superiority, because of its electronics capability inherent to the airplane, which magnifies each individual aircraft's capability,” Mattis said during the hearing. “It is equally important and more so to our allies, because this will be the total strength of their Air Force.” “Many of our allies have bet their security on the F-35,” he said.

Trump can order more F/A-18 Super Hornet; but his new Secretary of Defense will tell him that Trump better get ready to write letters to family members because there are some missions that the F/A-18 cannot complete and no way for Boeing to transform into a stealth platform. Log In or Register to post comments CharleyA on Jan 12, 2017 Stealth is perishable and expensive. There is a place for it, but to base all your forces on the technology is both wasteful and folly. It's better to have a balanced force, and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is going to be around until the 2040s because electronic warfare is both adaptable and comparatively inexpensive.

The president elect appears to be forgetting about the USAF.

Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Jan 14, 2017 There are no other options unless we want to lose future wars to the Russians and Chinese. There is only one fifth generation multi-role fighter attack aircraft with the capabilities of the F-35 in anybody's arsenal in the world. Going backwards and putting fifth generation lipstick on a fourth generation pig is BS and idiotic. The F-35 already exists (200 of them already), it is vastly superior to any existing or any possible upgrade to any existing aircraft. The costs are fully under control and coming down per program schedule, and our entire military is being re-invented to take advantage of the many capabilities that only the F-35 can provide.

Log In or Register to post comments guy.higgins@per... on Jan 13, 2017 Implying that there is no cost too high is irrational. We canʻt cancel the F-35 but we should never have started it. Starting a program with an intent that it start and remain dominant for decades is ridiculous. Starting a program with a long list of TBD requirements is ridiculous. Starting a program with a schedule that includes invention is ridiculous. All that said, we have to continue, but we ought to learn this lesson and not merely observe it. Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Jan 13, 2017 All aircraft types must be capable of retaining dominance for decades ... it takes at least a decade to develop anything that isn't primarily experimental (like the F-117, built under a black budget, no PR, no internet, no auditors, no lobbying from spurned manufacturers, no Putin paid trolling campaigns on the internet, no questioning of any kind). By the way, we've got numerous warbirds that are now into their fourth (F/A 18), fifth (F-15, F-16, A-10), sixth, even seventh decade (B-52) of dominance. The pace of change is now speeding up of course, and while material and hardware advances continue, it is software that changes the fastest by far. An airframe that is built around a computer that can be easily upgraded is a far more durable weapons system than one built around hardware that is either difficult, or impossible, to upgrade. Log In or Register to post comments A.P.Richelieu on Jan 13, 2017 Stealth is needed against advanced fighters and air defense, but not to fight ISIS and the likes, where reduced cost of operation would be better. Log In or Register to post comments knigh376@yahoo.co.in on Jan 13, 2017 guys, guys, i have a straight question for whoever supports F-35 program, apart from stealth is there any other capability that can challenge comparable opponent not primitive Iraqis, Syrians or any other weak country. is it only a night fighter or day & night all weather fighter/attack aircraft. if US has to go to war with Russia or China or even North Korea, how good it is. low RCS which we called stealth seems to be an outdated technology once enemy country develops technology how to detect these aircraft. its game over, F-35s have to find other ways to complete its mission or simply stay alive. which may be almost impossible sometimes. for any fighter aircraft speed is the key, because in the combat once enemy fighter detects it and acquires visual lock, it is almost impossible for F-35 to save itself(due to low speed) because he/she can easily approach it and go for a kill with gun. for missiles it may be difficult for enemy fighters to lock, however for a skilled pilot with dog fighting skills its just piece of cake. there are a lot questions need to be answered about F-35, 1. if it is a fighter, then how good it is in dog fighting, 2. if it is an attacker , then does it have range and payload capability like B-1 or B-2 or even B-52. Log In or Register to post comments rellim113 on Jan 13, 2017 It's all-weather, day or night. It's not "slow"; the reported "maximum" speed is with a full combat load (as opposed to clean or a pair of Sidewinders) and thanks to the massive internal fuel capacity, it can sustain it for more than a sprint up to speed then RTB. By pilot reports the dogfighting capability is comparable to an F-18 but with much better energy recovery. I don't understand your second question though. Are you saying you expect a dogfighting heavy bomber? Log In or Register to post comments knigh376@yahoo.co.in on Jan 13, 2017 my second question " attacker " means providing close air support to ground troops and taking as many ground targets as possible to get the troops to eighter move forward or retreat safely. as its payload is limited, the question is can it carry enough bombs or rockets to support ground troops. Log In or Register to post comments Spectre49 on Jan 13, 2017 I have not seen F-18 dog fights. What I do know is the C is accelerating limited as are all the versions and they had to waive the spec. Acceleration is a key feature to get up to max speed to even incoming missiles. You also have to know what configuration they were dog fighting in. A clean F-18 is almost guaranteed to be far better than a clean F-35 and it has a gun that hits as well as far more rounds. F-35 is toast. An F-18 with Sidewinder not as much but if its in sidewinder range then the F-35 is toast before the dogfight beings. An F-18 with an AM-120 better turn and burn, it can't see the F-35 (we hope) None of this is new. A P-47 could not dog fight a ME-109 or FW-190 (it could out climb them and it could out dive them) . As they found out with the P-40, operate within your strengths and do not within the Zero. Did you know they made the P-40 until 1944. Did you know the P-40 could dogfight at low altitudes with the ME-109 and FW-190? Did you know the Spitfire could not dog fight the Zero ? If and I mean if, they fix the F-35, that means all the glitch's zarks etc and get it more on board missiles, 4 is a joke, 6 is minimum. its going to be very effective as long as it can do that without getting into a dogfight. It needs the long range snap shot Sidewinder but it needs it to shoot the full range, once it is inside 20 miles its going to die. That is the hail mary and its needs to be stealthy in the bay. A Sukoi is a huge easy to hit target, Russians have nothing close to the AIM-120. War games show that if the F-35 does what it supposed to, Russians are toast. But it has to get there and giving them a free ride to send a US WWII Torpedo into the fight is not the way to get there. Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Jan 14, 2017 Spectre: You are asserting maneuverability qualities to the F-18 (presumably you mean the F or E model Super Hornets?) as compared to the F-35. Are you a certified pilot, or instructor, or "top gun" in either aircraft? If not then you are not qualified to make such assertions. Period Now, there are no published comparative reports for the two Navy jets, the Super Hornet to the F-35C, authored by or based upon primary sources (i.e., actual certified test pilot, instructors or top gun level pilot interviews). There IS a published report, written by an Air Force fighter pilot with more than 3,000 hours in USAF fighters (that's one helluva lot of fighter time!),John Venable, posted on the Heritage Foundation website as of August 2016, that specifically compares the maneuverability under very specific combat maneuvers using the primary sourcing of 31 certified USAF test pilots, instructor pilots and "top gun" equivalent pilots of the F-35A vs. the top fourth generation air superiority fighters (F-15C, F-16C, F-15-E) and also the A-10 ground attack aircraft. Each of the pilots who participated have extensive combat experience in the fighters they compared. The specific combat maneuvers compared included BVR attacks, 9K ft Perch Setup, Butterfly, Short Range, and Tree Vertical Flight. The pilots were asked their comparison or preference for each pair of aircraft on which they were certified and experienced in combat ops vs. the F-35A. With the exception of the performance of the F-15C in the 9K Perch Setup maneuver, every other maneuver for that aircraft, and every maneuver for all other aircraft evaluated, the preference was strongly in favor of the F-35A (i.e. at least 75% of the pilots preferred the performance of the F-3A over the other ... most of the results were between 90 and 100% preference level in favor of the F-35A. The other models of the F-35 would be expected to perform very similarly to, if not exactly the same as, the F-35A. And most folks who know anything about warbirds know that the F-15C is the most capable fourth gen air dominance fighter in the entire world bar none, easily better than any Super Hornet. Only the 5th gen F22 beats out the F-15C. So, while this is still a subjective rating process and outcome, it is subjective in the minds of the world's most qualified evaluators. 100% of all 31 pilots rated the F-35A superior to all other aircraft in BVR .... which happens to be where 100% of all aerial combat engagements for the last 26 years have taken place, and which is likely to remain 100% forever after. Case closed, strongly in favor of the F-35. Log In or Register to post comments Tony T on Jan 15, 2017 Unless you're talking about a very limited number of Eagles retrofitted with AESA radar the F-15C is very strictly THIRD generation and routinely had its rear waxed by other types way back in the 1980s. Sea Harriers could run rings around it. Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Jan 13, 2017 Actually, you posed quite a few questions, there, guy! There is no magic bullet for detecting reflected radar energy. If the shape of the aircraft and the properties of its surface tend to not reflect very much radar energy, making a better detector won't make any difference. If it looks like a pidgeon on the radar today, it will not look like a fighter aircraft tomorrow if the radar is tweaked .. it will still look just like a pidgeon. Speed is not really the key to performance, indeed few engagements are conducted at supersonic speeds unless one is trying to evacuate the area. The ability to go supersonic is a great asset, but most flying is done at subsonic speeds to conserve fuel, reduce sonic detection, and provide greater maneuverability. A mach 2.5 fighter is not necessarily better than a mach 2.0 or a mach 1.8 fighter. All air to air missiles fly at much faster speeds than any fighter will ever fly ... the medium range AIM-120 AMRAAM flies at mach 4, for instance. So no fighter today can outrun a AAM, or a radar sensor either. Dogfighting is not a relevant capability. With BVR attacks being the sole means of attacks performed by all US fighters for more than 26 years, its no longer a significant consideration. A F-35 certainly can dogfight (contrary to the stupid media reports a couple years ago) and be competitive with any fourth gen aircraft on the planet in that regard, it will likely never do so (I mean, after 26 years of "none", how long does it take to declare the age of dogfighting long over?). The F-35 will likely engage mostly with the AIM 120s at medium range (far beyond BVR), due to their superior sensors and onboard sensor fusion that no other aircraft on the planet enjoys). The significance of the sensor fusion capability is that the pilot doesn't need to worry about tracking multiple bogies from multiple directions - the sensor fusion computers do that for him/her, and if AAMs are fired at the F-35, the pilot does not even need to take any action at all ... the computer takes care of applying ECM and firing physical countermeasures, and will alert the pilot if evasive maneuvering is required. This allows a single F-35 pilot to focus on offensive actions against bogies. The sensor fusion also directly links other aircraft, ships, and ground forces wirelessly on a secure network to coordinate and share both sensor data and firing solutions, so that a single F-35 literally commands a wide range of firing platforms seamlessly and without pilot intervention, so as to focus fire on however many bad guys as are threats. Log In or Register to post comments knigh376@yahoo.co.in on Jan 13, 2017 Mr.DTRT, you are talking about F-35s sensor suites means computers which will do a lot of pilot`s work, what if they are overloaded like a Eurofighter Tycoon in an Airshow where pilot tried to simulate war like scenario and its computers got overloaded which resulted in crash. computers can malfuction/overloaded and humans can be overloaded however humans only can correct themselves in the battle field and can adjust to ever changing situation, computers simply follow what they are programmed. computers cannot be trusted all the time, they may be helpful but they should not be allowed to do everything like in F-35. US didn't engage any formidable enemy for the past 26yrs, you are talking about AIM-120 missiles, how many you think it can carry, if F-35s are totally out-numbered then what will be the situation, do you think small group of F-35s can carry enough missiles to take out a big wave of enemy fighters. they have to depend on other aircrafts for support. can you guarantee each & every missile fired can score a kill, its hard to say, it may be possible but not guaranteed. if enemy pilot is smart enough he/she can easily evade F-35s missile or any other missile flying at mach4.0. you mentioned its not possible to outrun a missile flying at mach4.0, yes you are right however missiles has serious maneuvering limitations, they can't turn like aircrafts because of its speed and shape. once the missile is fired all the enemy pilot need is time to decide how to evade it. A mach 2.5 pilot will have more time than mach .8 pilot. during Vietnam war when the missiles are newly introduced everybody thought dog fighting days are over, what happened later, same people who forced to remove guns from fighters insisted to be re-installed and dog fighting training should be made mandatory for all pilots. " TOP GUN " Fighter Weapons school in Miramar was formed as a result of that. consider this situation, a small group of 5 F-35s are sent to take out enemy ground targets 200 miles inside enemy territory, they approach their first target undetected and the lead F-35 opens its bomb doors to release its bombs, once the bombs doors are opened it no longer a stealth aircraft and the enemy immediately scrambles a wave of 30 Mig-21s to intercept. do you think 5 F-35s can take out 30 Mig-21s, each and every time an F-35 opens its missile doors to fire its stealth is compromised and enemy will get an opportunity to send more MIGs to intercept them. out of 30 if 5 Mig-21s escapes and approaches F-35s at Mach2.4 and acquires a visual lock then its almost game over if they don't have guns or its pilots are not trained in dog fighting, because most missiles don't acquire lock when the aircraft is too close. the only way is use your speed and dog fighting skills to get out of the situation.

Please do opine some more on the lessons we should have learned from Viet-Nam as if technology hasn't progressed an iota. Unless you're driving a last century mart without fuel injection, you're already depending on computers, & the F35 combat systems, while expensive, are just as dependable. The major point you blindly flew over is that the F35's taking the shots won't be the source of the missiles. The F35 can call & direct missiles from other platforms like a ship or another airframe, like arsenal F35 with max AIM-120s on external stores or F18/16/15s. So, while your flock of Mig 21's goes running after what they can see, these platforms unload all their missiles and either disappear (no more external stores makes an arsenal F35 stealthy again) or RTB to make your flock stern chase them, all the while getting pot-shotted by the internal stores from the OTH F35s they never saw. As for the ability for MIG 21s avoiding AIM-120s being guided in by F35s, I'd clearly prefer being in the F35s but if you'd prefer sitting in one the MIGs watching your buddies blow up from platforms you're unable to approach, please do... Log In or Register to post comments knigh376@yahoo.co.in on Jan 14, 2017 Patrick, one thing you are forgetting is your F-35 has already penetrated into enemy airspace and has already took its first target revealing its position. enemy MIG-21s are approaching based on your first target revealed position, you are deep inside enemy territory, your buddies are outside the border, if they have to support you they have to fire their missiles across the border, you didn't take out enemy air defenses which are capable of stopping most of missiles and few which escapes eighter will not be sufficient enough to save you or may not have range to help you, what will you do in that situation. as per current situation, you call modern warfare, if a battle ready warship/aircraft carrier or any other ready to go to war military assets are stationed with in 1000miles of the enemy country they will definitely consider it as any time war situation and they will do anything to stop their enemy from penetrating their borders, even if they were unable to stop stealth planes, they will definitely stop its supporting assets. you cannot simply complete your mission with a hand full of F-35s with a support of F-22s which are already way less in numbers as earlier planned. if you lose even a fraction of these so called advanced stealth aircrafts that will be a big blow to the entire program. US may not be willing to lose their pilots and you may not be willing to lose or see your wingman blow up next to you, however your enemy country may not think like you and its pilots don't mind losing their buddies or even lives to save their country. even you will do the same when it comes to protecting your country. if i am a pilot( right now i am not a pilot) in one of those MIGs, i don't mind eighter sacrificing my life or my buddies in order to stop you. so don't under estimate your enemy and simply trust your planes, technology & computers. up in the air, once in the battle its up to the human brain to rule not the machines they are flying in, no matter how advanced they are they are just supporting systems to humans not a replacement. Log In or Register to post comments Tony T on Jan 15, 2017 The companion arsenal approach (aka sacrifice an Eagle) is probably the only way the F-35 would survive a high intensity scenario for very long. But the gameplan consistently fails to acknowledge that potential adversaries may choose to engage their opponents' missiles, not the launch platforms. The analysis needs to shift, for example, at the Alamo's ability to down a Slammer. Or the newer range of ramjet missiles to engage US/Allied missiles. Log In or Register to post comments Spectre49 on Jan 13, 2017 First you assume that the age of dogfighting is over. You may be right, but we will only know if and when the whole thing gets put to a real test and not the artificial ones the USAL LOL uses to ensure their delusions are accurate. You cannot trust them. While speed is not key, acceleration is and the F-35 is poor. Read the Desert storm wars and how one Sukoi ran un-challenged through the US formations and never got shot down. Fortunately he only shone down 1 use aircraft not the 3 he could have. Also stealth is only as good as the lack of transmission. That means the F-35 has to stay that way and depends on others. Who does the pinging? Sensor fusion is fine, but someone has to light up the opponent. If it fails? AWACs is not a missile target. Really, wirelessly linked . Up to now all aircraft have wires attached to the ground. Wow, what a new concept, wireless. Next thing you know man is going to fly. How far behind him are his other forces? Out of detection range? To far back for the AIM 120 to reach the bad guy. How do you keep it form locking onto the F-35? Combat plans do not survive past the firs contact with the enemy. Real world tests are needed done by non USAF referees (setup by non USAF referees) We need a totally separate testing department . Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Jan 14, 2017 Spectre: As usual, you're being obtuse and intentionally misleading. First of all, in a large scale near-peer air war, engagements won't be one aircraft on one aircraft. And they won't normally be many aircraft against one aircraft. Have you ever heard of the concept of "tactics"? Apparently not. Hardware and software and pilot training are all great and necessary, but it's tactics that ultimately wins wars. The Japanese had by far the best performing fighter at the outbreak of the Pacific war in the A6M "Zero", which could out-turn and out-climb any of our F4F Wildcats with which we began the first year of WW Two. Yet, our pilots quickly developed tactics, including the "Thach Weave" that completely neutralized the dogfighting advantages of the Zero. By the end of WW Two, our lowly, underpowered, slow turning Wildcats produced a 7:1 kill ratio over the Zero. We did it through superior tactics, and also superior war production (it takes two Wildcats to kill a single Zero .. we could afford to outproduce the Japanese). What the ignorant F-35 trolls don't care about, and certainly don't know about, is that the F-35 is the world's first fully networked, forward based combat air information center on any attack aircraft. The F-35 does not operate solo. It operates in combat formation, using shared data and tactics that are already being developed, in concert with other F-35s, a fleet of UAVs direclty controlled by the airborne F-35s, as well as F-22s, F-16s, F-15s, F/A-18s, B-52 "arsenal aircraft", ships with AEGIS air defense systems and missile launchers, and ground based Army and Marine units armed with Patriot SAMs and other aerial defense systems. It's a multi-nodal network, such that even if one F-35 were taken out, the other nodes easily fill in. These are the systems and tactics that already exist, and are being honed as we receive more and more F-35s into the fleet and train more and more folks - not just more F-35 pilots, but the pilots of all other aircraft, ships at sea, and ground troops. The way to defeat your enemy is not to take him on, one on one, on his turf, at close range, in long-obsoleted "dogfighting". You defeat your enemy by sensing him long before he ever knows you're there and a threat, and by directing multiple weapons his way from multiple sources in the air, on the ground, and on the oceans, and by totally overwhelming him. It's extremely likely that any so-called "swarm attacks" by Russian or Chinese fourth gen or third gen aircraft will all be shot out of the sky long before they even realize the battle has started. Once that happens, our adversaries are most likely at that point to give up and try to hide whatever aviation assets they still have left, just as Saddam Hussein quickly flew the bulk of his Iraqi Air Force out of country to prevent their destruction in Desert Storm. Log In or Register to post comments MNIce on Jan 13, 2017 An attack aircraft is what is sent when the ground troops need to have an enemy tank or bunker taken out in a hurry, or somebody spots a SAM launcher on the path of a planned B-52 mission. Heavy bombers are usually reserved for large targets or a set of closely spaced targets. I assumed that because I knew that, every other armchair strategist did also. Log In or Register to post comments DynamicPressure on Jan 13, 2017 knigh, In order to maximize the WEZ (Weapon Engagement Zone) of the AMRAAM and provide optimal target/target group tasking (F-Pole), the weapons platform needs to first satisfy three conditions: 1.) High Altitude (Above 35,000 ft) 2.) High Mach (Well above the Transonic Regime (Mach ~0.8 –> Mach 1.2)) 3.) Short Acceleration Time through the Transonic Regime (Less than ~20 seconds) The missile employment envelop is Platform Speed + Boost Motor + Sustain Motor Flyout/Maneuver; All done at high altitude where the air is thin. Remember the AIM-120 is a medium ranged missile (read within ~8-10 miles) but when "Pole Boosted" by a Mach 1.5 supercruising F-22 at 40,000 ft it becomes a long ranged spear with capability of hitting targets well beyond 30 miles. Any missiles employment envelope expands when flown at high speed and high altitude. There is less “work” for the missile to do, and it preserves its fuel/battery life for the terminal phase of flight, increasing both range and Probability of Kill. Its better here to think of the "Poles" as times rather than distances. The goal of BVR combat is to expand your missile's active “Pitbull” envelope (A-Pole) and minimize your enemy's active missile envelope (E-Pole) by getting the missile through the Mach before launch. To do this you need a platform that can put the missile well above the transonic regime faster than your enemy can. This requires a rapid acceleration time which requires an aircraft with a smooth body profile and area variation to keep transonic drag rise to a minimum in order to employ the missile at the most advantageous position. See this link for more on Transonic Drag Rise: aerospaceweb(dot)org/question/aerodynamics/q0104(dot)shtml When the missile is launched, you decelerate to begin defending from the oncoming missile or task a new group of targets, turn the aircraft to maximum radar gimbal limit to keep the target illuminated and transmit the Mid-Course Update to the missile in flight. Once the missile goes active, you turn beyond gimbal limit so that you’re perpendicular to the enemy to hide in the radar notch. "Scoot, Shoot, Decelerate, Crank" Stealth decreases the enemy’s F-Pole and buys you time to do all of the above. Internal weapons stowage keeps the airframe slick and controls your area variation which reduces transonic drag rise. This is why the F-22 looks like an F-22 and kills like one. The problem is the F-35 can’t “Scoot” as the latest DOT&E report mentions: "Limitations to the carriage and employment envelope of the AIM-120 missile above 550 knots may be required due to excessive vibrations induced on the missiles and bombs due to the acoustics in the weapons bay. Analyses of flight test data and ground vibration test data are ongoing (this applies to all variants)." And "All F-35 variants display objectionable or unacceptable flying qualities at transonic speeds, where aerodynamic forces on the aircraft are rapidly changing. Particularly, under elevated “g” conditions, when wing loading causes the effects to be more pronounced, pilots have reported the flying qualities as “unacceptable.” The program adjusted control laws that govern flight control responses in an updated version of software released to flight test in March 2016." If you remember the required acceleration time from 0.8 to 1.2 Mach was increased for all variants. The F-35C took a massive 43 second increase. Looking at my standard atmosphere table in my undergrad copy of Anderson and running a few hand calcs tells me 550 knots is just below the speed of sound between Sea Level (661.5 knots) and 50,000ft (573.5 knots). While the report doesn’t make it clear if the acoustics are an issue with the doors closed or open; My many years of engineering judgment leads me to think that a door impinging into unsteady transonic flow around an ugly buff body is going to cause one hell of an acoustics issue. I question whether it’s even possible for the aircraft to safely open its bay doors at speeds above 550 knots due to the massive increase in wave and pressure drag. Even if it could get them open safely above the Mach (which I doubt at this point) it would take too long to get there to provide the BVR advantage! Software didn't put Yeager through the Mach. The F-35 is and has always suffered from unmitigated transonic wave drag as a result of bad area ruling/profile discipline. This explains the increase in acceleration time, it explains the acoustic issues, and it explains the bad flying qualities all within the transonic regime. This aircraft at present cannot punch through the Mach smoothly, safely, or quickly enough to employ the AMRAAM to expand and maximize its engagement envelope to provide a BVR advantage. It’s a wash. No stealthy WVR capability, since AIM-9X is external wing tip carry for now and the craft will lose the Boyd fight anyway. No practical BVR capability because you can’t physically put the AIM-120 where it needs to be fast enough to hit a target at BVR with advantage. A lot of people bet on the AMRAAM as a panacea for the F-35’s lack of EM ("dog-fighting"). Mitigating transonic wave drag would mean reshaping the aircraft itself. So unfortunately it seems at this point the F-35 carries a nice gun but fumbles on the draw. You can put AMRAAMs on a pig but it's still a pig. So no, I wouldn't call it a "fighter" in any sense of the word. It's a very expensive electronic warfare/strike aircraft. Log In or Register to post comments Spectre49 on Jan 13, 2017 While there are valid points, there is some wrong statements as well. An AIM-120 has a listed range of 100 miles (and longer versions are in the works) You do have to assess that for aircraft speed and altitude. I don't know how accurate that is. Max or minimum. It sure as hell is not 8-10 miles. A sidewinder flies that far and more now. Actually listed as 22 miles Sidewinder with the same caveats though range may be more accurate is it is a close in engagement missile and is JBVR (just beyond visual range. The points are valid, I don't know what the operation and effective envelopes of the AIM120 really are and how much lower airspeed affect it. The slow acceleration of the C is an issue. Russian missiles suffer the same issues. Log In or Register to post comments knigh376@yahoo.co.in on Jan 14, 2017 Spectre49, " An AIM-120 has a listed range of 100 miles (and longer versions are in the works) ", is it in a straight line, what if enemy fighter see this missile and makes evasive maneuvers, can the missile stays on its target. how agile is the missile once it approaches the target. i don't see it as a good to kill for an experienced enemy pilot, for beginners or rookies its ok. just think about Vietnam War, F-4s were able release the missiles BVR with a lock on enemy however due to its time-to-target and adequate reaction time for the Vietnamese Migs they became absolute useless and forced US to get back to old style Close-Air-Combat tactics using gun and short range missiles. Log In or Register to post comments knigh376@yahoo.co.in on Jan 14, 2017 your points are quite valid and in most cases i see them as accurate, however one question about these missiles, " can they kill ! ". if they can't then they are of no use, just waste of money. for BVR missiles kill is not always guaranteed like short range missiles. for short range missiles with less than 10miles once you release the missile and stays on enemy six as long as possible chances of kill are pretty good when compared to BVR missiles. for long range missiles, enemy pilot will have enough time to make evasive maneuvers and make the missile loose its lock. in my view instead of concentrating on long range BVR missiles, its better to concentrate on short range missile with a capability of one missile one kill attitude. by decreasing the speed of the missile and by increasing its maneuverability with advanced control surfaces it is quite possible to achieve one missile one kill attitude. these days pilots are smart enough to assume and assess where the enemy can go even if it is stealthy. as F-35 looses its stealth and relays its position once bomb doors are open, even for a few seconds that is quite enough for enemy radars & fighters to get a fix on it and assume & assess its flight path. in that kind of situation F-35's stealth will be of no use and it will like any other fighter. Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Jan 14, 2017 The certified, highly qualified pilots who actually fly the F-35 totally disagree with you. Read the Heritage Foundation report by highly experienced Air Force fighter pilot John Venable, based upon direct interviews with 31 expert pilots, all qualified in both the F-35 and the other USAF fighters at an instructor level, test pilot level, and USAF-equivalent to "top gun" levels. Every one of them strongly prefers the F-35 to all other fourth gen aircraft, including the F-15 which is known far and wide as the best fourth gen air domination fighter in the world, bar none. Log In or Register to post comments Tony T on Jan 15, 2017 I think a lot of people would oppose your contention of the F-15C being the best fourth generation fighter out there. It's a third gen fighter - the only fourths about it is that it first flew over FORTY FOUR years ago. The AESA radar makes a huge difference, but as for "best" fourth generation others would propose Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, J-10B etc as the key contenders. Log In or Register to post comments graham.jg@gmail.com on Jan 14, 2017 All low RCS aircraft can be detected - the question is, how far away? And non stealth aircraft will be detected even farther away. Game over even sooner Combat with 100 mile AA missiles is not Korean War style dogfighting - the plane that sees and shoots first wins. Only exception is intercept and escort, which could be problematic at the beginning of a war. But that will be the same problem no matter what fighter is used - the missile cueing will decide who wins there. Range and payload are issues. But when this all started, the plan was for 132 B2s, and another plane called the A-12 Avenger. Missions have been shifted to the F35 which weren't in the original RFP.

Log In or Register to post comments stephenbar2001 on Jan 13, 2017 "Dog Fighting" is not the same today as it was even twenty years ago. The likelihood of a fighter to get within visual range is very unlikely today. The F-35 is a short range platform which will eventually control other aerial assets to control it's patrol envelope. It is a weapon of the future that will redefine what air combat will be. It will combine unmanned and manned missions with more and more A.I as it becomes proven and available. Some of this technology can be adapted to simpler aircraft, but not all of it. Log In or Register to post comments David Jay 57 on Jan 13, 2017 "Outside of visual range" has been stipulated by defense planners for 50 years. The F-4 (deployment: 1962) was built without a gun based on that assumption. Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Jan 14, 2017 Yes and no. Contrary to a common misperception, the F-35 is NOT a "short range" fighter. On internal fuel only the F-35 A and C models (accounting for about 80% of total production) have a significantly longer combat radius (630 nm) than the F-16 (340 nm), A-10 (250 nm), F/A-18 Super Hornet (390 nm), the Harrier (300 nm), and the F-22 (460 nm). Only the F-15 has a longer combat radius on internal fuel (790 nm). The F-35B has a smaller fuel capacity due to the extra weight of the VTOL fan and ducting, but it is still a much longer legged bird (about 480 nm combat radius) than the VTOL AV-8B Harriers that it directly replaces. Another common misperception is that the A-10 supposedly has a longer loiter time than the F-35 ... as can be seen by the combat radius that's two and a half times that of the A-10, the F-35 actually has a significantly longer loiter time at the same combat radius. In addition to carrying a much larger fuel load (18,000 pounds vs. 11,000 pounds) and having a more fuel efficient single engine vs. two engines, the F-35 can also throttle down to relatively low airspeeds (300-400 knots) at high altitude where fuel efficiency for turbine engines is significantly better than at the low altitudes that A-10s operate at. With the wing hard points, it's also possible to fit drop tanks to the F-35. Perhaps the AF and Navy may also elect to go with low-RCS conformal drop tanks like they use on the Silent Eagle.

GovCon Index gainers outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio and two of its 11 S&P 500 components advanced with co-listed McKesson Corp. (NYSE: MCK) the GCI’s top performer overall in a rebound from Wednesday’s plunge and dual GCI-S&P company Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) the lowest performer out of 30 companies. Lockheed’s stock has dropped 1.38 percent over two sessions after President-elect Donald Trump said in a press conference Wednesday he wanted to have a competition between the company’s F-35 fighter jet and Boeing‘s (NYSE: BA) F-18 Super Hornet combat plane. Trump has referenced the F-18 as a possible competitor to the F-35 on his Twitter feed and repeatedly criticized the latter aircraft’s costs in tweets since an initial Dec. 12 post. Shares in Lockheed have fallen 2.01 for the week so far. Fellow GCI-S&P primes Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), L3 Technologies (NYSE: LLL) and Boeing ended among the GovCon Index’s five lowest net performers Thursday. Both declines Lockheed and Northrop exceeded $2.00 as L-3, AECOM (NYSE: ACM) and Boeing all shed at least $1.00 each. AECOM weighed as the GCI’s fourth-lowest net decliner and worst percentage performer after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the engineering and construction contractor’s stock from “Buy” to “Hold” with a price target cut from $42 to $41. Deutsche Bank told investors in a research note any infrastructure spending stimulus Trump has advocated for prior to and after the election may be further out than investors previously expected.

(AP) -- Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane apparently will not become the second base to get the new air refueling KC-46A tankers. The next wing of the new Pegasus tankers built by Boeing will go to Joint Base Maguire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. That's according to Sen. Bob Mendendez of New Jersey, and Spokane business leaders on Thursday. Fairchild is Spokane's biggest single employer. Air Force officials notified congressional leaders that Maguire-Dix-Lakehurst was their top choice for the second active duty wing of the new tankers, with 24 of the new refueling jets. Travis Air Force in California will also get 24 KC-46As. A final decision will come later this year. U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who pushed for Fairchild to receive the new plane, says she is outraged by the decision. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) — Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane apparently will not become the second base to get the new air refueling KC-46A tankers. The next wing of the new Pegasus tankers built by Boeing will go to Joint Base Maguire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. That's according to Sen. Bob Mendendez of New Jersey, and Spokane business leaders on Thursday. Fairchild is Spokane's biggest single employer. Air Force officials notified congressional leaders that Maguire-Dix-Lakehurst was their top choice for the second active duty wing of the new tankers, with 24 of the new refueling jets. Travis Air Force in California will also get 24 KC-46As. A final decision will come later this year. U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who pushed for Fairchild to receive the new plane, says she is outraged by the decision.

But does it taste good? After years of falling prices, higher airfares are on the horizon, Delta says. The nation's second-largest airline said it expects a key measure of airfares to rise as much as 2% in the three months of this year compared with a year earlier. That measure has fallen consistently at the major airlines for several years now. Delta reported a 5% drop in that reading for last year. Other major airlines have also been reporting lower fares, although their full-year figures aren't in yet. Through the first nine months of 2016, industry leader American Airlines (AAL) reported fares were off 6%, United Continental (UAL) reported a 7% slide, and Southwest (LUV)reported fares down 4%. Boeing chases airlines for stretch 737 Executives at all the major airlines have been talking about wanting to end the decline in fares and raise the revenue they collect for each mile flown by passengers. Those four airlines control about 80% of U.S. air travel. Delt (DAL)reported a 37% drop in income in the quarter because of lower fares, a decline in revenue and higher labor costs. It made $622 million for the quarter and $4.4 billion for the year. It was helped by lower fuel costs, but new labor contracts raised salaries and related costs, its largest expense. Wages have been rising rapidly across the airline industry. Related: Delta testing a return to free meals Even as fares start to increase, Delta warned of tighter profit margins in the first quarter because of higher labor costs. But it said it expects improved profit in the second half of the year. Shares of Delta (DAL) declined slightly in premarket trading, while shares of American, United Continental and Southwest were unchanged.

Sure, you can do it, but it's just not the same. United Airlines announced Wednesday the iconic jumbo airliner will leave its fleet for good a year sooner than first planned. United will retire the humped 747-400 jetliner by October -- an announcement that follows Delta Air Lines' plans to send its 747 fleet to a desert retirement this year. "It's a bittersweet milestone — this jumbo jet with its unmistakable silhouette once represented the state-of-the-art in air travel," wrote United president Scott Kirby. The 'Queen of the Skies,' the 747's royal moniker, has been in United's fleet in some iteration for nearly a half century, first flying with the airline in 1970 between California and Hawaii. The 747 is no ordinary airliner. It came along at a time of the U.S.'s ascent to superpower status in the 1960s and was as much a symbol of Cold War engineering prowess as it was a democratizing force for inexpensive global air travel. When it debuted in 1989, the 747-400 was a world beater. Already on its fourth generation, the jumbo could fly up to 7,200 nautical miles and airlines flocked to it for its ability to fly non-stop to and from Asia from the U.S. and Europe even if they couldn't fill the roughly 400 seats aboard. Twenty-eight years later, its cutting edge has dulled and its fuel-guzzling ways, expensive maintenance and low marks from United's passengers sealed its fate. The venerable jumbo has been on the decline for two decades, hastened by Boeing's own moves and an airline preference for big twin-engine airliners like the 777. The 747-8, Boeing's latest version, has won few orders by comparison and production has slowed to a half dozen annually. UPS gives Boeing's 'Queen' a reprieve The Chicago-based carrier is expecting 14 new twin-engine Boeing 777-300ERs to be flying in its fleet by the end of 2017 and the first of 35 Airbus A350-1000 jets arrive in 2018. While the 747 will officially leave scheduled U.S. airline fleets this year, a few 747s will still be operated by U.S. charter airlines and will continue to be a staple of cargo carriers like UPS for decades to come. And of course the most recognizable 747 of them all, Air Force One, continues on for U.S. presidents.

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The first of 100 Airbus planes that Iran purchased following its nuclear deal with world powers arrived in Tehran on Thursday, heralding a new chapter for the country's aging and accident-prone fleet after years of sanctions. The Iran Air A321 jet touched down after a flight from Toulouse, France, where the headquarters of the European consortium are located. The 189-seat plane is the first of 100 purchased under a December deal worth $18 billion. Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi told reporters at an airport ceremony that the plane would be used for domestic flights, Iran's Press TV reported. The semi-official ISNA news agency quoted him as saying another two Airbus jetliners would be delivered in the next two months. Iran is hoping to rapidly upgrade its fleet now that sanctions have been lifted under the 2015 nuclear accord, in which Tehran pledged to curb its uranium enrichment. Most of Iran's aging fleet of 250 commercial planes was purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and as of June, only 162 were operational, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists a fleet of 43 planes, offers direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London. The company recently sealed a separate agreement to buy 80 planes from Boeing, beginning next year. The election of Donald Trump, however, has cast doubt over the future of the deal. He repeatedly criticized the nuclear agreement on the campaign trail but has not said what he plans to do about it once in office. Akhoundi said Iran hopes the U.S. "continues to remain true to its commitments" under the new administration. "We hope that America's political community has reached a level of maturity and accountability to create an atmosphere so that the world can accept and hope that peace can be reached through dialogue," he said. The Boeing deal is Iran's biggest with an American company since the 1979 revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. It calls for 50 Boeing 737s and 30 Boeing 777s to be delivered over the next decade. Iran Air is also expected to seal an order for 20 turboprops from European manufacturer ATR. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Close share panel Image copyright AP Image caption The pilot waved an Iranian flag from the window of the Airbus after landing in Tehran Iran has taken delivery of its first Western-built passenger plane in decades, following the lifting of sanctions last year. The Airbus A321 landed in Tehran to an official ceremony that included Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi. IranAir will eventually take possession of 100 planes from Airbus and 80 from Boeing. World powers agreed to lift sanctions against Iran in return for its curbing of nuclear activities. The Airbus 321 had flown from Toulouse in France and its passengers included company chief Fabrice Bregier. Correspondents say Thursday's arrival is being seen as symbolic of Iran's emergence from decades of economic isolation. State TV called it "a historic moment for Iran, signalling the end of the sanctions era for the country". "This is a prelude to the delivery of other aircraft and the renovation of Iran's ageing air fleet," it added. The IranAir fleet is among the oldest in the world, experts say, and has relied on parts being smuggled into the country to keep its planes flying.

Software company Collier Research Corporation has announced it has become a member of NASA’s Advanced Composites Consortium (ACC).  Collier, reportedly the only software company in the ACC, is among the newest members joining the original group formed in 2015 by NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), FAA William J Hughes Technical Center, The Boeing Company, General Electric Company (GE), Lockheed Martin Corporation, United Technologies Corporation, and the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) – ACC Integrator. Also new to the ACC are Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation, Orbital ATK, the University of South Carolina McNAIR Center for Aerospace Innovation and Research, and the Wichita State University National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR). Collier says that the ACC aims to bring better composite material analysis, design, and manufacturing into practice to help maintain American leadership in aviation manufacturing. The consortium was formed by NASA in support of the Advanced Composites Project, which is part of the Advanced Air Vehicles Program in the agency’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. The project’s goal is to reduce product development and certification timelines by 30% for composite aircraft.  ‘The push to take weight out of structures designed for flight is leading to a greater use of composites in the aerospace industry,’ says Craig Collier, president of Collier Research. ‘As these advanced materials are more complex to certify than metals, the use of automated, integrated analysis and design-performance optimization is critical – from the earliest stages of development all the way through manufacturing – to ensure that composites are used most effectively and certified for flight most efficiently.’ Design development Craig Collier has been appointed cooperative research team (CRT) leader of two ACC initiatives: rapid tools and design for manufacturing. ‘Rapid tools are important because the bulk of aircraft design development and structural certification analysis revolves around them,’ says Collier. ‘The design maturation process spans several years. Shortening this long portion of the schedule will have a huge impact on the aircraft production timeline. ‘Design for manufacturing includes technologies such as robotic automated fiber placement (AFP) and curing processes during the analysis and optimization design phases. Merging these technologies early and iteratively will help engineers improve quality and consistency in laminate fabrication, resulting in fewer defects and streamlined certification.’  This story is reprinted from material from Collier, with editorial changes made by Materials Today.

Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Trump not above using his notoriety to reward allies, punish critics 01/12/17 10:54 AMUpdated 01/12/17 12:07 PM By Steve Benen The New York Times had an interesting article this week about the health care industry and its anxieties surrounding the changes Donald Trump and congressional Republicans intend to impose on the system. The piece, however, was a little short on quotes, and as it turns out, there was a specific reason for that. “Some companies, anxious about changes in health policy, said they were afraid to speak out because they feared that Mr. Trump would attack them on Twitter, as he has badgered Boeing, Ford, General Motors, Lockheed Martin and Toyota,” the Times explained. President Obama spoke at MacDill Air Force Base last month, where he celebrated one of the great American freedoms: we can “criticize a president without retribution.” Evidently, that freedom is a little less secure in the Trump era. Indeed, the New York Times’ report followed a related piece on tech companies on the West coast adjusting their schedules, making sure “someone is up at 3 a.m. local time to catch the [president-elect’s] tweets out of fear that a Trump tweet could crash their stock and put their company into a frenzy.” As it turns out, the president-elect isn’t just intimidating potential critics; as he demonstrated on Twitter this morning, he also wants to use his notoriety to reward allies. “Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean.” Apparently, Linda Bean, the granddaughter of L.L. Bean’s founder and a member of the company’s board of directors, made an illegally large campaign contribution to a pro-Trump political action committee. This prompted some on the left to announce they’ll no longer buy from the national retailer. For its part, L.L. Bean’s public-relations department wants no role in an ugly political fight, and the company’s executive chairman, Shawn Gorman, said in a statement, “L.L.Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions.” And yet, here we are, watching Trump take the unnecessary step of pushing the company even deeper into a partisan dispute, encouraging his followers to support a business because of a donor’s contribution. No one really benefits from any of this. By all appearances, Trump doesn’t care. Explore: The MaddowBlog, Donald Trump and Social Media Defending Sessions, GOP congressman sees...

Boom shows off its XB-1 supersonic demonstration passenger airliner Posted Jan 12, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Report: EU unhappy with US response to Yahoo email scanning scandal If you’re old enough to remember the Concorde, then startup Boom‘s plans to bring supersonic flight back to commercial passenger air travel is huge. Now Boom is one step closer, as it reveals the XB-1 Supersonic Demonstrator, a 1/3-scale prototype of its Boom supersonic passenger aircraft, which will be doing its first supersonic test flights later this year. The scale demonstration craft is meant to be “technically representative” of what the final airliner will offer, and includes GE engines, Honeywell avionics and Tencate structural carbon fiber elements. Partner Virgin Galactic is going to be helping Boom build its first production aircraft, offering engineering and manufacturing as well as testing and operations support. Virgin also has optioned Boom’s first 10 vehicles, so it’s also the startup’s first customer. Testing of the XB-1 will begin with subsonic flights at a location east of Denver in Colorado, and then supersonic tests will run near Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California. Test flights for cutting-edge aircraft, including the F-35, are conducted regularly at the Edwards facility. Boom has ex-NASA, ex-Lockheed and ex-Boeing aircraft engineers on its team, along with funding from Lightbank, Y Combinator and Sam Altman, Paul Graham and Kyle Voght of Cruise. Their aim is not only to bring back commercial supersonic passenger flight, but also to make it affordable enough that it’s a viable option for regular passengers and routes. Boom supersonic plane in flight. (PRNewsFoto/Boom Technology, Inc.) The Concorde, a supersonic jet debuted in 1969, flew for 27 years from 1976 through 2003, achieving travel times that were half what’s possible with conventional jets. It was retired after a disastrous crash of one of its planes in 2000, which led to low ticket sales exacerbated by a downturn in air travel in general following 9/11. Richard Branson wanted to purchase a Concorde fleet from British Airways, and tried a number of increasing bids to do so, but was ultimately rejected. That helps explain Virgin Galactic’s enthusiastic support of Boom, both in testing and as its initial customer. As for specs, the XB-1 craft is the first supersonic jet that can claim a totally independent and private development process, and it’s also going to be the fastest civilian aircraft in operation if it meets its targets, with a 1,451 mph cruising speed that tops the Concorde’s max by 10 percent. Boom also claims a better interior experience, with just one seat per side of the aisle and a smoother ride due to the higher, 60,000-foot cruising altitude. Boom’s XB-1 Supersonic Demonstrator will target the same max speed as the eventual full-size passenger airliner, but will only carry a pilot and an optional test engineer or other passenger, while the final vehicle will have a passenger capacity of 45 in addition to the crew and 4 flight attendants, with an optional high-density configuration that would allow an additional 10 passengers on board. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Boom Technology Founded 2014 Overview Boom was founded on the philosophy that we need to overcome the challenges to supersonic passenger flight, not surrender to them. They're making a supersonic aircraft affordable for business travel. Their ultimate goal is routine supersonic flight for everyone.

But does it taste good? After years of falling prices, higher airfares are on the horizon, Delta says. The nation's second-largest airline said it expects a key measure of airfares to rise as much as 2% in the three months of this year compared with a year earlier. That measure has fallen consistently at the major airlines for several years now. Delta reported a 5% drop in that reading for last year. Other major airlines have also been reporting lower fares, although their full-year figures aren't in yet. Through the first nine months of 2016, industry leader American Airlines (AAL) reported fares were off 6%, United Continental (UAL) reported a 7% slide, and Southwest (LUV)reported fares down 4%. Boeing chases airlines for stretch 737 Executives at all the major airlines have been talking about wanting to end the decline in fares and raise the revenue they collect for each mile flown by passengers. Those four airlines control about 80% of U.S. air travel. Delt (DAL)reported a 37% drop in income in the quarter because of lower fares, a decline in revenue and higher labor costs. It made $622 million for the quarter and $4.4 billion for the year. It was helped by lower fuel costs, but new labor contracts raised salaries and related costs, its largest expense. Wages have been rising rapidly across the airline industry. Related: Delta testing a return to free meals Even as fares start to increase, Delta warned of tighter profit margins in the first quarter because of higher labor costs. But it said it expects improved profit in the second half of the year. Shares of Delta (DAL) declined slightly in premarket trading, while shares of American, United Continental and Southwest were unchanged.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 12 January 2017 | MYT 10:13 PM Iran welcomes arrival of first Western plane ordered since sanctions lifted by parisa hafezi ANKARA (Reuters) - An Airbus A321 airliner landed in Tehran on Thursday, the first to arrive out of the 200 Western-built aircraft ordered by IranAir following the lifting of sanctions on Iran last year. "This is a historic moment for Iran, signalling the end of the sanctions era for the country ... This is a prelude to the delivery of other aircraft and the renovation of Iran's ageing air fleet," state TV said. Analysts say IranAir flies one of the world's oldest fleets and has had to rely on smuggled or improvised parts to keep them operational. Iran, which has not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, has ordered 100 airliners from Airbus, 80 from Boeing and 20 turboprop aircraft from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica. The one exception was the sale of a plane to replace an Airbus jet shot down by the U.S. Navy in 1988. The arrival of the Airbus 321 on Thursday comes just over a week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who is opposed to the deal struck by Western powers in 2015 which lifted sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. Republicans in the U.S. Congress have also objected to the pact, which was signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. Iran's pragmatist president Hassan Rouhani's success in ending international sanctions by reaching the deal has also intensified a power struggle among the country's faction-ridden elite, who have criticised the deal for a lack of tangible economic benefits since sanctions were lifted. "This (aircraft) delivery was very crucial ... especially the timing of it. Now people can see the result of lifting sanctions," a senior Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. "It will increase Rouhani's popularity ... and his chances for re-election in May." IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh said in France on Wednesday in taking delivery of the Airbus plane that he hoped the United States would not block the agreement. [nL5N1F14HW] Both Airbus and Boeing needed U.S. export licences to deliver the jets because of the number of U.S. parts they contain. Both have received licences but Boeing needs to have the majority extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect it to point to the Airbus delivery in order to press its case. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract,” Parvaresh told reporters on Wednesday.

The new A321 jet arrived at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday on a flight from the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France. The head of IranAir, Farhad Parvaresh, called the delivery a "sunny day" for relations between Iran and Europe, and a memorable one for aviation in the nation of 80 million people. Iran nuclear deal one year on: Expectations v reality The 189-seat plane, already painted in IranAir's livery, is the first of 100 ordered from Airbus following a deal reached in 2015 between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. "The average age of the IranAir fleet, that carries around six million passengers each year, is 25," Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said. "This is a big achievement for President Hassan Rouhani and his current government as well as the Iranian people who have been extremely worried about the state of the country’s airlines and passenger planes." IranAir has also ordered 80 aircraft from Boeing and is in the final stages of negotiating an order for 20 turboprops from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica. The A321 will primarily be used for domestic flights within Iran, the airline said. First since 1979 Highlighting Iran's emergence from years of isolation, the Airbus delivery marks the first new jet directly acquired from a western manufacturer since 1979, other than the replacement of an Airbus jet shot down by the US Navy in 1988. Both Airbus and Boeing need US export licences to deliver the jets because of the number of US parts. Both have received licences, but Boeing needs to have the majority extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect it to point to the Airbus delivery in order to press the case for its sales to remain in force. Parvaresh said that he hoped the US would not block the agreement under President Donald Trump, who at times has pledged to pull Washington out of the nuclear accord. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract," Parvaresh told reporters. The first Airbus aircraft will enter service on Saturday starting on busy domestic routes such as Tehran to Mashhad for the next couple of months, he said. IranAir hopes to receive "at least two more from Airbus" by the start of the Iranian new year in March, and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017, he added. It also expects to receive three larger A330 jets in 2017. Inside Story - Has the Iran nuclear deal changed anything?

"This is a historic moment for Iran, signalling the end of the sanctions era for the country ... This is a prelude to the delivery of other aircraft and the renovation of Iran's ageing air fleet," state TV said. Analysts say IranAir flies one of the world's oldest fleets, with an average age of 23 years, and has had to rely on smuggled or improvised parts to keep them operational. Iran, which has not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, has ordered 100 airliners from Airbus and 80 from Boeing and is close to a deal to buy 20 turboprop aircraft from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica. The one exception was the sale of a plane to replace an Airbus jet shot down by the U.S. Navy in 1988. The arrival of the Airbus 321 on Thursday comes just over a week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who is opposed to the deal struck by Western powers in 2015 which lifted sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. Republicans in the U.S. Congress have also objected to the pact, which was signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. Iran's pragmatist president Hassan Rouhani's success in ending international sanctions by reaching the deal has also intensified a power struggle among the country's faction-ridden elite, who have criticised the deal for a lack of tangible economic benefits since sanctions were lifted. "This (aircraft) delivery was very crucial ... especially the timing of it. Now people can see the result of lifting sanctions," a senior Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. "It will increase Rouhani's popularity ... and his chances for re-election in May." IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh said in France on Wednesday in taking delivery of the Airbus plane that he hoped the United States would not block the agreement. Both Airbus and Boeing need U.S. export licences to deliver the jets because of the number of U.S. parts they contain. Both have received licences but some need to be extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect Boeing to point to the Airbus delivery to argue its deal should go ahead. "Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract," Parvaresh told reporters on Wednesday. IranAir hopes to receive at least two more aircraft from Airbus by the end of March and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017. State TV quoted Parvaresh as saying on Thursday that Iran's Bank of Industry and Mine had financed the purchase of the first plane delivered. Airbus and Boeing are putting up financing help for early deliveries as many Western banks remain wary of doing deals with Iran due to restrictions on the use of the U.S. financial system that remain in effect despite the nuclear deal. People familiar with the matter said Airbus, initially reported to have backed the first seven deliveries, was now looking at providing finance for a larger number of deliveries and that Boeing planned to finance the first half a dozen jets. Most planes are sold in dollars but Airbus is being paid in euros. Boeing's bankers are looking for ways for the company to get paid for future deliveries without breaking core sanctions, subject to Treasury approval, a person close to the deal said.

CLARY/AFP/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence tour the Carrier air conditioning and heating company in Indianapolis. By DaniRodrik CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Project Syndicate) — President-elect Donald Trump has yet to take office, but his brand of flawed industrial policy has been on full display since his surprise win in November. Within weeks of the election, Trump had already claimed a victory. Through a mix of inducements and intimidation, he prevailed on the heating and cooling firm Carrier UTX, -0.54%  to keep some of its operations in Indiana, “saving” around 1,000 American jobs. Touring the Carrier plant subsequently, he warned other U.S. firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home. His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein. He has taken credit for Ford’s F, +0.32%  decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky, rather than move it to Mexico. He has threatened General Motors GM, -0.45%  with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the United States. Rex Tillerson Takes Questions About Russian Sanctions(3:14) In his confirmation hearing before the U. S. Senate on Wednesday, Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson was asked about his views on sanctions imposed against Russia in light of allegations that it attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also discussed whether or not Exxon, the company he has led for 10 years, lobbied against those sanctions. Photo: Getty Images Trump has also hounded defense contractors for cost overruns, berating the aerospace giants Boeing BA, +0.34%  and Lockheed Martin LMT, +0.76%  on separate occasions for producing planes that are too expensive. Trump’s policy style represents a sharp break from that of his predecessors. It is highly personalized and temperamental. It relies on threats and bullying. It is prone to boasting, exaggeration, and lies about actual successes. It is a type of public spectacle, staged on Twitter. And it is deeply corrosive of democratic norms. Economists tend to advocate an arm’s-length relationship between government and business. Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms, lest they be corrupted and engage in favoritism. This is a prized principle in the U.S. — but one that is more often breached than observed. An obvious example is the undeniable influence over U.S. government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades. Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America’s successes. The history of U.S. economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sector, rather than arm’s-length relationships and rigid rules. As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind,Stephen Cohen, and Brad DeLong have reminded us, the U.S. is heir to a Hamiltonian tradition in which the federal government provides the investment, infrastructure, finance, and other support that private enterprise needs. U.S. technological innovation owes as much to specific government programs, such as loan assistance or government purchases as it does to American entrepreneurs’ and inventors’ ingenuity. As Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner notes, some of the most dynamic technology companies in the U.S., including Apple AAPL, -0.18%  and Intel INTC, +0.22%  , received financial support from the government before going public. The electric carmaker Tesla TSLA, +3.55%   was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee program as Solyndra, the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse. As the Solyndra example illustrates, many public initiatives fail. But the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive, taking successes together with the flops. Such broad evaluations tend to be rare. But one analysis found that U.S. programs to boost energy efficiency had produced positive net benefits. Interestingly, the bulk of the benefits were attributable to three relatively modest projects. Sociologists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have provided perhaps the best analysis of the U.S. “developmental state” — a reality that they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured. Block and Keller describe how a “decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories” and an “alphabet soup” of financing initiatives, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, work with private firms and help them commercialize their products. They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests — whether in biotech, green technologies, or nanotech. Such industrial policies, based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors, have of course been the hallmark of East Asian economic policy making. It is difficult to imagine China’s transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse — and the attendant success of its export-oriented model — without the Chinese government’s helping and guiding hand. It is ironic that the same people who extol Chinese gains from globalization are often alarmed that a U.S. administration may copy the Chinese approach and explicitly endorse industrial policies. Unlike China, of course, the U.S. purports to be a democracy. And industrial policy in a democracy requires transparency, accountability, and institutionalization. The relationship between the government and private firms has to be calibrated carefully. Government agencies need to be close enough to private enterprises to elicit the requisite information about the technological and market realities on the ground. For example, what are the fundamental reasons for the loss of manufacturing jobs in, say, automobile production, and how can the government help, if at all? But they cannot get so close to private firms that they end up in companies’ pocket, or, at the other extreme, simply order them around. And that is where industrial policy à la Trump fails to pass the test. On one hand, his appointments to key economic positions indicate he has little intention of severing government ties to Wall Street and big finance. On the other hand, his policy-making-by-tweet suggests he doesn’t have much interest in building the institutionalized dialogue, with all the required safeguards, that sound industrial policy requires. This means that we can expect the Trump administration’s industrial policy to vacillate between cronyism and bullying. That may benefit some; but it will do little good for the overwhelming majority of American workers or the economy as a whole.
