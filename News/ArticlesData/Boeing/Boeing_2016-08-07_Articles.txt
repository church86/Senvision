Reuters/Robert Sorbo The aviation industry would be more competitive which is why a German bank foresees lower full-year profit for Australian flag carrier Qantas. However, the flying roo is expecting a new jet in 2017 which could open new routes for the company and make it soar above rivals. The Telegraph reports that Qantas is scheduled to receive its first Boeing 787 in 2017. It opens the possibility for the air carrier to announce new routes by late 2016, including a likely direct flights between London and Perth. If Qantas gets regulatory approval for the long-haul route, it would compete with the world’s longest commercial flight, Emirates’ Dubai-Auckland route, covering 8,819 miles and 17 hours and 15 minutes to fly. Qantas’s longest long-haul flight is the Dallas-Sydney leg which covers 8,578 miles. In preparation for the arrival of a new Dreamliner, Qantas purchased a $23-million Boeing 787-9 simulator installed at the company’s Mascot headquarters, supplementing an existing simulator at the Jetstar facility in Melbourne. By having a simulator, Qantas would have the ability to replace older and less efficient jets and deliver potential new routes, says Alan Joyce, Qantas Group CEO. The air carrier’s flight training centre runs 24/7, overseen by a team of trainers and check captains to ensure Qantas pilots are among the best in the world, Joyce says, reports Tenplay. The B787 simulator would certify a new generation of Qantas aviators to fly the next-generation plane. As Qantas moves toward the newer aircraft, it cancelled its eight orders for A380 with Airbus. Although the A380 is well-liked by air travelers, airline demand for the four-engine jet failed to meet expectations. Instead, many airlines shift to the smaller but more fuel-efficient twin-engine planes like the 787 amid changing oil prices.

Sort Notes Newest First Oldest First Show 46 Newer Notes James Fallows 5:25 PM / August 8, 2016 Challenging the Premise of the 'Trump Time Capsule' Another unprecedented president? The Battle of New Orleans, Edward Percy Moran / Library of Congress In the 70-plus installments collected here, I’ve been recording (some of) the ways Donald Trump differs from people who have previously come so close to the presidency. Here are two readers who disagree with the premise of the series, from a long-term-historical perspective and a more recent one. I’ll quote them each and then explain where I agree, and don’t. First, from an American overseas: I am a U.S. citizen currently living in Seoul. While I do not support Trump, and although I will vote Democrat come this election, I do not believe Trump is as unprecedented as some of the other readers seem to believe. In this case, I am writing to you with specific reference to the President Obama’s remarks against Trump’s temperament, and Trump’s talk of a rigged game. Both have clear analogues to the 1824 electoral cycle. Andrew Jackson, as I am sure you know, horrified the Democratic-Republican elite. He paved the way for Common Man candidates by slowly expanding suffrage and embracing the Jeffersonian ideal of a Yeoman America. Thomas Jefferson, a former president at the time, had this to say about the prospect of a Jacksonian presidency: I feel much alarm at the prospect of seeing General Jackson President. He is one of the most unfit men I know for such a place. He has had very little respect for laws and constitutions, and is, in fact, an able military chief. His passions are terrible. When I was President of the Senate, he was Senator, and he could never speak on account of the rashness of his feelings, and as often choke with rage. Truly, Jefferson was not the active president, but I think that a quibbling detail. He was the author of the constitution and the founder of the ruling party. I support our president, but Obama’s prestige now could not contend with Jefferson’s then. But notice the same critique: Like Trump, Jackson was seen as unfit for his temperament, not his ideas. His passions were so intense as to disqualify him from office. And of course, like Trump, Jackson saw power in conspiratorial terms. His Bank Veto still reads like an Industrial Workers of the World manifesto. And, as I’m sure you know, in 1824 Jackson saw his electoral loss as a conspiracy, a Corrupt Bargain where Clay and Adams stole the White House from him. Jackson, by fundamentally undermining the electoral process and the legitimacy of the new president, was tapping into the zeitgeist and leading it towards victory four years later. Trump is doing the same. Jackson is not my favorite president, and I suspect a President Trump would wreck synonymous havoc on minorities and the American economy. But America survived Jackson, who was an obvious danger to our democracy. We will survive Trump, although he may change us—or kill us all in nuclear fire. On this comparison, I’m happy to stipulate that so much is so dramatically different between the America of the 1820s and the America of 2016 as to bring any “unprecedented” judgment into question. (For instance: back then there was no electricity or real-time communication; there still was slavery; only certain white men could vote; etc.) So I’ll more frequently say “unprecedented in modern times.” But while recognizing that historians talk about the revolution of Jackson’s arrival, and that temperamentally Jackson may be closer to Trump than any other real-world president, the differences between them as plausible national leaders are still immense. By the time he was elected president in 1828, Jackson had: been elected to the House once; been elected to the Senate twice; served as military governor of Florida; and won more popular and electoral votes for the presidency than any other candidate in 1824, only to lose to John Quincy Adams when the House of Representatives decided the outcome. All this is apart from his experience as battlefield commander. If Donald Trump had had any elective-office experience whatsoever (for instance: Green Party candidate Jill Stein was elected a Town Meeting Seat in Lexington, Mass.), or had ever held any public or military office of any kind, it would be easier to suggest some likeness. After the jump, the more contemporary dissent from a reader: *** Continue Reading Judy Myers explains why she is growing uncomfortable with the Time Capsule approach: I share your fear of what is happening in our society that would allow Trump to become the elected candidate of a major party. I hope the Time Capsule accomplishes your intended goal. As you may have expected, there is a “but.” It is your tone of amazement that these things are happening, and what I see as your over-reach in describing some of them as horrifying in their uniqueness. Take your Capsule number 69. Why did Mr. Rucker conduct his interview with a television facing the interviewee? Why did you not list the Trump interview with Bob Woodward, which I think was the best Trump has done?  (It seemed to me that Woodward was trying to have a discussion with Trump, not sandbag him.) I accept that your intent is to document the Trump campaign, but it would be just as easy to do to Hillary Clinton what you are doing to Trump. Mrs. Clinton has important weaknesses, and it would be just as easy to characterize her in the way that you characterize Mr. Trump. To take just one example, she is having just as impossible a time explaining her email problem as he is having in addressing what we see as his defects. I live surrounded by Trump supporters. Many are giving up on Democratic leadership as being ineffective in supporting regular people trying to live a regular life. Some of these people see President Obama’s election as a cataclysmic event that destroyed their belief that other Americans shared their view. (Many others have written about this, so I won’t.) I suggest that it is not just Trump; that you are claiming objectivity but your bias is showing. I suggest that Bush 43 was seriously unprepared for the presidency. I suggest that his attention span and depth of knowledge and understanding of presidential issues was not that different from Trump. I suggest that Clinton is just as resistant to outside information as Trump, and in fact most people who reach such heights of power are similarly resistant. I suggest that Trump has raised important issues to the point that we are talking about them—letting business and power take so much is hurting workers. Comparing him to Clinton, his opposition to the TPP as it was constructed when it became a campaign issue, I want to oppose parts of it too. Yes, he is a self-involved blowhard. No, I don’t want his hand of the nation’s tiller. In closing, I ask you to read this, “The Media’s Foolish Moralizing About Donald Trump,” by Damon Linker. Whatever else is happening, we as a country have an opportunity for conversation now that some of our rifts are being openly discussed. Let's not blow it. To that end, I would like to see your writeup of what you heard in Texas and Kansas. I am down closer to the coast and to Mexico and the area you visited is very different from where I am. I am looking forward to your report on what you saw. I appreciate Ms. Myers’s careful attention, and her taking the time to write in. Here is where and how I see the world differently from her: It might be worth emphasizing again the journalistic idea behind starting this Time Capsule series. Donald Trump’s rise is clearly an unusual moment in our public history. No one like him has gotten this close to the presidency in modern times—by which I mean, no one with his total lack of elective or public-office experience, no one as willing to dismiss norms of what nominees “can” and “cannot” say. My purpose, as set out from the start, is to lay down a real time record of what it was like as the country decided whether to make him its leader—and in particular, the ways in which he did depart from norms.                                                                                 As I’ve explicitly said, I’m not imagining that I’m going to change a single voter’s mind. I personally think that Trump’s candidacy has been bad for our civic fiber—“the judge is a Mexican!”—and that a Trump presidency would be worse. But it’s a free country; people can choose as they want. I’m trying to document we know while making that choice.                                                                                                 On a detailed point, I haven’t asked Philip Rucker, but I’ll bet you anything it was not his choice to have Trump looking back and forth at the TV while Rucker was trying to interview him. (One reason I say so: common sense. Another reason: in the transcript, Rucker keeps trying to draw Trump away from what Trump has glimpsed on TV.) And the reason why than transcript seemed significant is that, like the great majority of other long interviews by Trump, it was notable for its lack of sentence-by-sentence sustained argument or thought. It was also significant, as I mentioned, because it displayed Trump’s hair-trigger reaction to a plane crash he had seen, with an immediate, confident explanation that was probably wrong. This would be a very dangerous trait in an actual president.                                                                                                 We move now to the realm of the subjective: I have spent a depressingly large share of my life paying close attention to the way public figures talk—when they are being interviewed, when they are extemporizing on the stump, when they’re battling opponents in debates, when they’re delivering formal speeches. There’s an enormous range among them: Bill Clinton would sound mesmerizing in a rally speech, but if you read the transcript, it would just look ordinary. Teddy Kennedy was a magnificent formal orator but could seem tongue-tied or even aphasic in some interviews. Ronald Reagan was amazingly consistent in his tone, discourse, and argumentative structure whether giving a speech or being interviewed. Bob Dole was notably different in his private wise-cracking mode and his stiffer formal presentations. They’re all individuals, and they’re all different. But in my experience, Trump is different from any of the rest of them. He knows less—about the government, about the world, about anything other than himself. Rick Perry got in trouble for a botched debate answer, but he could talk very well about his plans for Texas. Similarly for Dan Quayle, but I once interviewed him about American defense policy in the Pacific, and he was very erudite. I have never met Trump in person. But the transcripts of his interviews seem to belong in one category, and other public figures I’ve known (with their huge variation) in the other. I’m suggesting that he is different from other public figures, because in my judgment he is.                                                                                                 By extension, I also disagree with the idea that you could apply just the same treatment to George W. Bush or Hillary Clinton. I didn’t vote for Bush, and I think his administration was one of the most destructive in our history. The Iraq war; torture and Guantanamo; the conditions leading to the great crash of 2008, these will always be part of his legacy. But I never doubted that he was a serious man, who took the office (that his father had also held) extremely seriously, and who was doing his best (in ways I disagreed with), and who recognized the gravity of the choices he would make. It was Bush who went to national mosque six days after the 9/11 attacks. It is impossible to imagine him responding to the Khan family the way Donald Trump did. As for Hillary Clinton, she is not a very good campaigner, as the world knows. It was foolish of her to set up her own server to begin with, and no one can understand why she doesn’t just say: This was a huge mistake, I’m sorry, let me answer any question about it for the next six hours, and then we’re done. But the idea that she is “just as resistant to outside information as Trump, and in fact most people who reach such heights of power are similarly resistant” is, in my judgment, just categorically wrong. The problem of getting honest judgments, bad news and all, once you become powerful is indeed a profound one. Every leader has grappled with it; it’s a theme of the origins of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, of political treatises from Machiavelli onward. But I am absolutely sure that Hillary Clinton would at least theoretically recognize it as a problem. I have seen no signal that Trump is aware of this peril at all. That’s enough for now. Thanks for reading, and for writing in. James Fallows 7:43 PM / August 4, 2016 Update from Philip Rucker on Trump as Aerospace Guy Previous items today concerned Donald Trump’s reaction to an airplane crash that was noted briefly on Fox News, while he was in the middle of a major newspaper interview. Trump said he’d “never liked that plane, structurally,” but the question is which plane he considered flawed. Had he just seen news about the crash-landing of a Boeing 777 in Dubai? Or about a Navy F-18 in Nevada? Or a twin-engine Piper Seneca in Arizona? I asked Philip Rucker, who was conducting the great WaPo interview with Trump, whether he noticed or remembered what Trump had seen. His reply: I wish I had a definitive answer for you, but unfortunately I do not. Unlike Donald Trump, I was seated with my back to the TV, so I wasn't paying much attention to what was on the screen. The TV was tuned to Fox News. I recall it was a small plane crash and not the Emirates 777. It might have been the Sedona crash….  I do not believe it was a military plane, but I cannot say for certain. The crash was only briefly on the newscast. Much of the time during our interview Fox was covering Trump. So odds favor the Sedona crash of the Piper Seneca—in circumstances (night flight, mountainous terrain, older pilot flying on his own) that likely have nothing whatsoever to do with aircraft-structural concerns. *** Meaning-of-Trump point: the way his mind works. Immediately after an Egyptair flight disappeared over the Mediterranean in June, Trump declared, What just happened? A plane got blown out of the sky. And if anybody thinks it wasn’t blown out of the sky, you’re 100% wrong, folks, OK? You’re 100% wrong. No one knows for sure now, and no one had any idea then, what had happened to that Egyptair plane. Yet Trump moved instantly to “you’re 100% wrong!” mode. Again this week, in his instant reaction to whatever crash he saw, Trump responded instantly (and probably incorrectly). And he was in a position to make this misjudgment because he was so interested in seeing news that was mainly about himself. I know, there’s hardly any news value in pointing this out any more, but: the man doesn’t know very much, isn’t aware of what he doesn’t know, thinks poorly, yet is super-decisive. Ryan, McConnell, Rubio, Cotton, et al: Heck of a job! James Fallows 5:44 PM / August 4, 2016 Donald Trump, Aerospace Engineer Maybe this is the plane Donald Trump "never liked, structurally"? LCPL JOHN MCGARITY, USMC via Department of Defense In an item earlier today I quoted a Boeing engineer who was dumbfounded / amused by Donald Trump’s off-hand comment that he “never liked that plane, structurally” about the mighty Boeing 777. Several people have written in to say that maybe we’re not giving Trump full credit. Perhaps news of some other airplane crash might have been on the screen when it caught his eye and occasioned this remark. (Sample letter after the jump.) The possibilities include: A Navy F-18 that crashed on a training flight in Nevada not long before Trump’s interview. Fortunately the pilot parachuted to safety. A twin-engine Piper Seneca aircraft that crashed near Sedona, Arizona, on a nighttime flight around the same time. Unfortunately the 76-year-old pilot, the only person aboard, was killed. The Emirates 777 that crash-landed in Dubai, fortunately with relatively few casualties. This is the one the Boeing staff assumed Trump was talking about. So we’re left with these choices: - Trump was questioning the structural fitness of one of Boeing’s best-selling and (on the evidence) structurally soundest models. After the 777’s introduction in the mid-1990s, its first fatal episode was the pilot-error Asiana crash into a runway at SFO three years ago; or - Trump was saying he “never liked that plane, structurally” about the Navy’s workhorse F-18, which first flew back in the 1970s and which has had critics of its cost, complexity, and design, but not on grounds that people “never liked it, structurally”; or - He was reacting to a light-airplane crash at nighttime, in mountainous terrain, with an older pilot who was flying by himself—that is, in circumstances where “structural” problems of the airplane virtually never turn out to be relevant. Or, something else. Just adding this to round out the explanation. I have written to Philip Rucker, of the Post, to ask if he noticed what was on TV to see which crash Trump would have been talking about. Continue Reading *** Note from a reader on the which-crash-was-it mystery: The Trump interview was conducted on August 2, according to the editor's note, and the Dubai crash was early in the morning of August 3 EST. I think the crash was probably the Flagstaff one August 2 involving a Piper Seneca -- which perhaps makes his engineering criticism more defensible than if it was a 777, but frankly makes his distraction even more extraordinary. One person died in that crash, sadly, but it wasn't a huge news event like the Dubai incident. And from another reader: If he gets elected (shudder), I'm sure we'll see Divine Leader Kim Il Trump visiting Renton or Everett to "give guidance" to Boeing workers. And from another staffer at Boeing: Word is he’ll be visiting WA to raise money at the end of the month. Hopefully I’ll have a chance to ask him for advice on ways to use topology optimization to improve the design of 3D printed structures. James Fallows 1:15 PM / August 4, 2016 Cows! Squirrels! Airplanes! The Many Thoughts of Donald Trump A Boeing 777-300, flown by Emirates. Want to know what's good and bad about this airplane? Of course there is only one expert to consult. Paul Spijkers via Wikimedia Last night I mentioned the resemblance between Donald Trump’s frequently distractable discourse—I don’t like mosquitos! Back to Mike Pence!—and Danny DeVito’s famous “Cows!” scene in Throw Momma From the Train. As a public service, I offer a glimpse of Cows once more: Many readers have written in to say that the closer comparison might be Dug the Dog, with his “Squirrel!” scene from the great movie Up. You be the judge: *** During one of Trump’s Cows! / Squirrel!  interludes in his interview with the Washington Post, he offered the following observations about plane-crash news that was flickering across the screen: [Trump looks at a nearby television, which was tuned to Fox News.] Oh, did they have another one of these things go down? It’s terrible that crash. Never liked that plane, structurally. I never thought that plane could— The dash-mark at the end is when the interviewer, Philip Rucker, tries to bring Trump back to the topic at hand.   A reader in the Northwest took particular note of Trump’s comments: I’m a stress analyst at Boeing and I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been chuckling at Trump’s latest quote from his interview with Philip Rucker: “Never liked that plane, structurally...” I assume he was referring to the Emirates 777-300 that crashed in Dubai. I’m with many of my co-workers in hoping that a reporter asks a follow-up question on what, precisely, Mr. Trump dislikes about the structural design of the 777.  I’m sure his answer would delight and entertain! Or, more surprisingly, he might be well versed in shear flow theory. Who knows!? The reader’s email had the subject line “Donald Trump—Structural Engineer.” Other possibilities would include: “Donald Trump—New Frontiers in Bullshit” or “Donald Trump—It’s Even Worse Than You Think.” But on reflection, I like plain old “Donald Trump—Structural Engineer” for its understated charm. What Donald Trump doesn’t know about an airplane matches what he doesn’t know about everything else.   James Fallows 1:10 PM / August 2, 2016 'A Fundamental Decency': The Difference Between Rob Ford and Donald Trump A sign two years ago for then-mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, whose style many have likened to Donald Trump’s. Ford died of cancer early this year; a reader explains an important contrast with Trump. (Mark Blinch / Reuters) Many people have noted the campaign-style similarities between Donald Trump and Rob Ford, the late mayor of Toronto. John Spragge, who lives in Toronto, says that the Capt. Khan episode points out an important difference: I am the Canadian systems analyst who sometimes writes you from Toronto. Earlier in this campaign, I compared Donald Trump to the late Toronto mayor Rob Ford. I still believe Mr. Ford drew much of his support from people who feel alienated and left out, and I believe getting elected mayor had dire personal consequences for Mr. Ford, just as I believe attaining the presidency might have serious consequences for Mr. Trump. However, over the past week I have come to see important distinctions between Mr. Ford and Mr. Trump; I think Mr. Ford’s greater skill at retail politics speaks to a fundamental decency. As I put it in a web log post [JF emphasis added]: When I asked myself how Rob Ford would have responded to Khizr Khan’s speech, it occurred to me: Rob Ford would have called the Khans. He would have talked to them. Rob always called people who disagreed with him. He would have listened the he Khans. He would have expressed sympathy with their sacrifice. He would probably not have changed any of his positions, but he would have given the Khans the courtesy of a hearing. All Rob Ford’s most vehement opponents, which some times included me, acknowledged his ability as a retail politician. He listened to people, and whether he agreed with us or not he gave the impression he cared what we thought. I think he genuinely did; I think he had a real desire to help and connect with people, and unlike Donald Trump, he did not respond to opposition with the fury of wounded vanity. Rob Ford was diagnosed with cancer during the last election and has since died. Since the emergence of Mr. Trump, many Toronto residents have seen the parallels between the social forces that gave rise to his candidacy and Mr. Trump’s. I think we owe it to his memory to acknowledge that nothing in his record suggests he would have treated the Khans the way Trump did. *** Thanks to the very large number of people who have written in with responses to yesterday’s item, about why Republican “leaders” are standing with Donald Trump and for how long they’ll do so. An assortment of those is coming up when I can get to it, along with the next sixteen zillion Time Capsule entries. James Fallows 7:37 PM / August 1, 2016 Supporting Trump: The GOP's Equivalent of the Iraq War Vote Jonathan Erns / Reuters In the Time Capsule thread (now up to #66), I’ve been chronicling some of the ongoing words, deeds, and gestures that the Republican party has decided to swallow from its nominee. This parallel “Trump Nation” thread is mainly for reader reaction to the spectacle of 2016, and in particular what the “responsible” GOP is showing about itself. Trump himself is beyond criticism or judgment. What we see is who he is. But I think that people looking back at our time will be much harsher in their judgment of the Republican “leaders” who are trying to have it both ways. The Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader of the Senate, senators like Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, governors like Chris Christie and the now-trapped Mike Pence, figures from the past like Rudy Giuliani — every one of these people knows what is wrong with Donald Trump, and every one of them will be telling us as of November 9 that they were never really with him, they always saw what was wrong, how did this ever happen? But for now, every one one of them is saying, Vote for Trump! You can understand, sort of, their constraint. If they come out and say, Vote for Hillary Clinton, in the short run they might infuriate substantial portions of their own electoral base. And if the longer run, if she does win, then every “liberal” thing she does, starting with her Supreme Court appointments, can be thrown back at them. Oh, there’s your President Clinton with her Bolshevik on the Court. Happy now? Oh, there’s your President Clinton, with …   You can understand it. But to say it’s “understandable” is not to say that it’s right, or even smart. I think they’re making a mistake not just from some lofty historical perspective but in how they will look in the relatively near future. Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination eight years ago, and the vastly better known Hillary Clinton did not, because she had joined most senior members of her party (including Joe Biden and John Kerry) in being wrong in a hugely consequential choice, the Iraq war, and Obama had been right. A reader says you can extend that analysis to the choice of backing Trump: As I’ve watched the way that Trump has been able to overcome unforced error after unforced error that should, and used to, effectively mean the end of a viable campaign, I’m interested in the box that this puts the GOP elite.  Most seem to be trying to thread the needle in the Paul Ryan mode—I support the nominee, but I speak out not too forcefully on the most egregious statements.   What we may be seeing is the real-time development of another Bush Iraq War moment. In this scenario, it will seem obvious to anyone after an easy win by Clinton that they should have publicly called out Trump and said they were bound by conscience not to support him. This raises an interesting question.  In this scenario, who takes the role of Obama, who got used his anti-war position to jump start his road to the White House?  It was a huge risk for a little known Senator, but the payoff was huuuuuuuge! Right now you can probably rule out the Bushes or Romney or just about every elected GOP bigwig. Does it just leave Kasich? Or, with all his complications, Cruz. *** Continue Reading A reader in the Midwest makes a related point: I have followed with great interest the chronicling of the Trump campaign for the historical record. My question to you is this: Is there any integrity left in the Republican party? I have waited for months for one prominent Republican with real “skin in the game” to step up and say something and take a stand. Something along this line: “You know that I am a Republican, but I am an American first. And as an American, I cannot and will not support the nominee of our party. He is not qualified to be President of this country. If this costs me my position, so be it. Some things are more important!” Is it too much to ask for just one person to have the balls to do this? And if it is too much, what does this say about our country? *** A reader who has worked in Republican politics defends John McCain, who has condemned Trump’s statements but so far not Trump himself: My own opinion is doing anything you can to defeat Trump and hold his enablers accountable is one’s a moral imperative as an American, an acid test of one’s character.   That said you know that life is a balancing act and McCain is trying to win a GOP primary is a state with a hard-right GOP electorate. Have to give him a little latitude.  Also suspect that’s why he included this line, “...which I will have to answer at the Final Judgment...”— he knows it’s an acid test he's failing and will have to answer for, and it’s weighing on him.   This reader goes on to say that the Republicans who should be judged most harshly are those who are not up for re-election themselves this year (unlike McCain) but are still riding the Trump Train. *** From a lawyer on the West Coast: I thought your term “Vichy Republican” was quite apt. I say this because I was recently watching the Ophuls documentary about France under the Nazi Occupation The Sorrow and the Pity. It does a masterful job of drawing out people on why they decided to resist or collaborate. One thing that strikes me how many conservatives in 1940 France felt that “well, better Hitler than Blum.” Leon Blum being France’s first Jewish prime minister, who served at the head of a left-wing government in the period 1936-1938.  It just sounds a lot like the praise many conservatives of like Trump and Farange have for Putin and disdain for Obama … *** A brief note on a potential silver lining: Wouldn’t it be great if the Khans, Muslim-Americans, became the moral conscience of the nation during this election, with their dignity and eloquence and compassion? *** And, finally for now, a much longer and more downbeat assessment: It is becoming blatantly clear to me that the GOP is failing in one of its principal roles as a major political party: To filter out those elements which, at their root, would destroy those organic mechanisms which keep our democracy functioning. Given how blatant and ever-increasingly obvious is the nature of Trump, why is it so hard for the country to realize what he represents?  Why did not our national immune system immediately recognize him for who/what he is and spit him out? The answer is that Ryan and McConnell and the Vichy Republicans, are validating Trump’s legitimacy, and have reneged on their fundamental duty leading a major political party. And the GOP’s decay in performing this duty has been advancing for the last 20 years. In today’s NY Times, Lindsay Graham was quoted as saying in reference to Trump’s comments about the Khans, “This is going to a place where we’ve never gone before, to push back against the families of the fallen. There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics — that you don’t do — like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier, even if they criticize you,” Graham said. At last! A Republican willing to say “YOU JUST CAN'T SAY SUCH THINGS!!”  And here's the thing:  It might have started sooner, perhaps Nixon, perhaps Goldwater; but in my mind it started with Newt Gingrich and the ‘94 Republicans who took power and dismantled the structural protections in Congress which fostered comity and collegiality among adversaries. Since that time, establishment Republicans started saying and doing things that political norms dictated that YOU JUST DON’T DO!   Before that time, no matter how awful the opponent’s policies, the opponent was, nevertheless, a worthy adversary, chosen by worthy citizens who, despite your fervent disagreement with them, were your countrymen.  And starting in ‘94, establishment Republicans started disrespecting the elected representatives of the opposing party. And at that point, they moved from governing to open warfare. And each new incremental move into previously forbidden territory brought new standards of indecency and disrespect; to the point where the honor and patriotism of a proven, decorated war hero (John Kerry), the citizenship and faith of an elected president (Obama), the honor and patriotism of a former POW (McCain), and the fundamental integrity and worth of Congressional institutions (filibuster etc.), were all barriers which it is now acceptable to disregard. Things you just didn’t do, they did. In a quick Google session I was unable to determine who first said it, but I’ve heard it attributed to Jung, that civilization is a thin veneer. We take for granted that the glue holding this democracy together is only as strong as the willingness of the participants to honor the glue. It’s remarkable how few people it would take to disregard the white lane markings of our highways and turn traffic into a snarl. We function because of our consensus that there are just some things that YOU DO NOT SAY, and there are just some things that YOU DO NOT DO. And since 1994, at least, the GOP, with very little assistance from the Democrats, has been saying and doing non-normative things; and this has empowered a large number of people to say and do non-normative things as a result. The country depends on its political parties to scrub out the infectious elements; to make sure that, whatever candidates are put forward, at the root they will put the institutions and the norms that provide the glue for our democracy ahead of their ideological and power questing goals. I wonder how graciously GW Bush/Cheney would have responded to the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2000 had it gone the other way. And in the subsequent Congress, I wonder how graciously the Republicans would have allowed a President Gore to function had the result gone the other way. I wonder how normative the Republican response would have been had 9/11 happened on the watch of a Democratic president. Oh. Wait. BENGHAZI!!!!! The GOP no longer puts the country, its institutions and its norms, ahead of party. And McConnell and Ryan and the Vichy Republicans are glaring truth of the long road down which they've come. Thank you, and Mr. and Mrs. Khan, for directly calling them out. We need the GOP.  We need a functioning, filtering, democracy glue-enhancing GOP. We haven’t had one since it started decaying during the first Clinton administration. And what will happen when, the next time they nominate a candidate, they manage to hide the things that makes Trump so obvious? THAT’s what scares me most ... James Fallows 4:00 PM / July 27, 2016 Why Trump Really Doesn't Want to Release Those Returns A reader who is a veteran lawyer on the West Coast writes about Donald Trump’s argument that he can’t/won’t release his tax returns while they’re under audit by the IRS. (A reason that the IRS itself dismisses.) The reader suggests that in this case, at least, Trump may have thought many moves in advance: 1. I agree with what you are saying about Trump’s tax returns. Of course I also agree with the IRS (i.e., he is free to release them; the audit is irrelevant to that question). 2. But there is ONE way in which the audit is relevant to the release, and vice versa: If Trump releases returns while they are still auditable or being audited—which, of course, every other candidate has done in the past—then the nation’s tax professionals, seeing them and poring over them, are likely if not certain to make public suggestions about things the IRS should look into, or how the IRS should look into them, that might actually lead the IRS to take a look at, or do, something the IRS might not otherwise have done. 3. The nation’s tax professionals might even detect tax fraud that the IRS might miss. That’s a criminal matter—not a back taxes or penalty matter. Which of us would be surprised if they did, in Trump’s case?  (Remember the IRS caught Nixon on tax matters while he was still president; it didn’t help his situation.) 4. Not to mention that if the tax professionals make their suggestions to the IRS privately, then there is the possibility of their earning an actual reward if as a result the IRS is alerted to something that leads to the IRS collecting more tax from Trump than the IRS would otherwise have done. 5. My own suspicion is that the ranks of the nation’s tax professionals probably contain individuals, hostile to Trump or to tax cheats, who ARE aware of tricks the IRS has not yet suspected or at least fully caught up with (there are always new tricks) among taxpayers with really complex returns. 6. At a minimum, the IRS would have a greatly expanded army of volunteer auditors in Trump’s case! Of course, these are all problems that Trump should have thought of before he became a candidate. Perhaps he did, hence the unequivocal nature of his stonewalling. And if Russia really wanted to prove that they are not partial to Trump, and if his returns were filed by his team or are kept by the IRS in electronic form, then the Russians could release his returns for him.  Somehow I doubt that will happen. *** Update another reader writes: I think you and all other reporters have missed one essential point regarding Mr. Trump's tax returns. That is, even if there was some justification for withholding returns under audit, that does not explain the refusal to provide returns for older years. My understanding is that years before 2009 are not under audit, and it might be very helpful if someone would point this out or ask Mr. Trump to produce those returns. He won't, but at least it might help show than his stated reason is bogus. Possibly some journalist has done this but I have not seen it. James Fallows 4:55 PM / July 25, 2016 A Bernie Voter, From Ukraine, on the Putin Story Gleb Garanich / Reuters I think this is very interesting: a reader who knows Russia and Ukraine, on how he reads the unfolding “Putin angle” news. I’m a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant, now a naturalized citizen of the United States. I also was a Bernie Sanders voter in the primary, who will be voting for Hillary Clinton in the general election. This is probably the weirdest year of my life politically. On the right, the anti-immigrant and antisemitic fervor is really a choice cut of hate. The apparent mutual interest of Russia and the Trump campaign has meant that on both the right and left, there is legitimate critique. However, it has also meant there’s a home for a very familiar panic about Eastern Europe and, honestly, people using the critique as cover for rank bigotry who were interested in that bigotry long before Trump and Russia were even a story. Lastly, the DNC e-mails specifically regarding Sanders’ religious views and raising it as an issue with voters WITHIN the Democratic electorate, was a dispiriting reminder that despite what has been a pretty nice life, given enough opportunity bigotry can have a house anywhere, even among friends. However, I’m writing today to provide context for Russia’s actions, from my own experience. When Russia invaded Ukraine, they did it while putting their arms up and saying it wasn’t them, even as it was clear to everyone that it was. There were the anecdotes, of course, about the Russian military insignia of the people coming into Crimea and Eastern Ukraine being torn from their uniforms. Regardless of the truth of those anecdotes—of basically Russians barely modifying their own uniforms, doing the least amount of work to seem not like the Russian army—they got at what is a reality: the transparent cynicism of Russia, the tendency to do the terrible thing and tell the whole world they’re not doing it until they’re years deep into a conflict they can’t escape. I wanted to mention that because in the recent stories, there’s been this emerging picture of Russia as a legitimate threat to the United States, run by a chessmaster. Russia is not a legitimate threat, and Putin is not a chessmaster. Russia is a transparently desperate country. The sanctions and financial freezes have spread Russia thin. They’ve impacted the oligarchs that run the country. They’ve impacted its long-term capacity to use war as an economic plan and perpetually hold sovereign states as territories on a whim. They’ve reduced its capacity to control its client states. The well is running dry. And what they’re doing is the same thing they did in Ukraine. The world was getting away from them, they had something they could not control or overwhelm, so they went in to Crimea and Eastern Ukraine and tried to take it through brute force—all the while putting their hands up in the air and denying they had anything to do with it. Even now, in Putin’s speeches, it is clear he is coming not from a position of strength, but one of great weakness, asking essentially for a mercy that he does not currently deserve, seeing things like the banning on the basis of doping as signs of additional punishment. ‘Russia is not a legitimate threat, and Putin is not a chessmaster. Russia is a transparently desperate country. The sanctions and financial freezes have spread Russia thin. The well is running dry.’ So Russia may be behind the DNC hack. We may be seeing this fight because they’re desperate to elect the man they resemble the most, because it’s the only way out of it they see for themselves. It’s not prowess or intelligence though; it’s desperation and lashing out. Putin took the spirit of the Russian people and defaced it for years, replacing it with militarism and the use of the church as a prop for the state. This was sustained by capital, by investment. And it just isn’t there any more. Robbing the people of their spirit, the rulers of the country now have lost the capacity to fund the things that occupied the void. Their enterprises in Ukraine and Syria look more like past recipes in Chechnya, Georgia and elsewhere for forever war. It’s only a matter of time before the client states, the installed rulers, are once again challenged but do not find the support they once had. It is just history cycling. But to be clear, Russia is not a danger to us so much as it is a danger to itself. A smarter government would have figured out a way other than the invasion of Ukraine, other than perpetually hostile acts such as this hack. A smarter government would not be in a position where it basically has to cut all its own domestic programs to fund wars that will go on forever. A more gifted politician wouldn’t be in a position of accumulating strikes against themselves while demanding mercy. I think this is already the view President Obama holds, as documented in his statements on Russia with Jeffrey Goldberg. ‘Russia's latest transparent ploy, even as its consequences are currently being felt deeply, will eventually be seen for the desperate and unsophisticated acts they are.’ I think this election was and remains a choice between being governed by fear and being governed by perspective, between seeing monsters all over and understanding where we all really are respective to one another. Russia’s latest transparent ploy, even as its consequences are currently being felt deeply, will eventually be seen for the desperate and unsophisticated acts they are. Donald Trump’s series of transparent ploys, his perpetual financial and moral bankruptcy, will be seen the same way, the desperate, angry flicker of a flailing movement unable to navigate a changing world. And we will live this coming January in the same country as this past January—a fractured place working to rebuild itself, to be better than its past, and hopefully a little smarter. I believe this to be true of the United States. I hope one day it will be true for the Ukraine; that it will escape not just the specter of this war, but its older history of corruption as a necessary fact of life. And I hope in time it will be true for Russia itself, either through the reform of its current leaders or through their eventual displacement by those who want something more for their people than desolation and war. It was possible for Iran. These realities do change with the work of people who do not give up their hope even when it seems no one in power has much time for it. I will be casting my vote this November for perspective, up and down the ballot, rather than for a Republican Party and a nominee that can only see a wolf at every door who wants to convince you that his own barking is coming from the outside. I will be describing, at the onset of whatever panic, this same world to my friends that occupy it with me, where our understanding is the antidote to our fear, where the strength of our country is in our knowledge of it. James Fallows 9:27 AM / July 25, 2016 Selling Fear and Anger: The Why and How of Trump Last week in Cleveland. (Brian Snyder / Reuters) In response to recent items on what Donald Trump is doing, four readers offer views on why. 1) Id laid bare. In response to Time Capsule #54, “They Applauded for Me,” a reader says: Today’s Trump™ Time Capsule reminded me of another example of unaware self-revelation. Some 50 years ago I worked with a guy who volunteered at a meeting the statement, “I don’t get New Yorker cartoons.” He said it not without pride, as though it were somehow a badge of honor. There was no visible rolling of eyes and we went smoothly on with the meeting, but the remark explained much in my later encounters with him. In Vital Lies, Simple Truths: The Psychology of Self-Deception, Daniel Goleman recounts in the preface a story of a woman talking about how much her family loves her, and how funny her mother is. If she was saying something that her mother didn’t like, her mother would just pick up what was at hand and throw it at her. “And once, we were eating dinner, so what she picked up was a knife and threw that at me,” told as a humorous anecdote. Trump is id laid bare, so far as I can tell, and appeals directly to those controlled by the id. *** 2) Big versus little lies. This next reader email is very long but builds to a worthwhile point. Continue Reading Thank you for the Time Capsule series. I think a lot of the commentary from all over on Trump is missing the main question, however. The fundamental question is seldom what people do; the fundamental question is why they do it. Any “rational” analysis of Trump will fail. (“Rational” in both the “logical utility” and in the “sane” sense.) He is not presenting a logical way for attaining real benefits, nor is he presenting himself as sane. What he is selling is fear and anger. It is those two emotions, and just  the emotions, that his supporters want. They want to be deathly afraid of the world, and they want to use that fear to justify an all-consuming anger. They are not looking for justification for those emotions; they just want the emotions themselves. If you see his supporters as masses of the frustrated and disenfranchised who are seeking a voice at the table of power, then it makes no sense. Anybody like that would not want to be lied to. They have been lied to too many times by the powerful. Trump is an obvious liar, and he is never going to do what he says is is going to do. Anyone who simply feels betrayed by the political process isn’t about to set themselves up to be betrayed again. Those types will simply stay home on election day like they always do. There is no point going into who said it, but it was said that “people would rather believe a big lie than a small one.” Once you lie, and once you lie very very big, then you are in constant fear of being found out. The only possible face-saving response is to use the energy of that fear to violently insist that you are right. Once you stand up in public and say you believe that the Earth is flat, then you simply can’t back down. The fear of ridicule is so great that the only way forward is to be angry at all attackers. That anger then becomes its own validity. It is an addiction, pure and simple. It is an addiction to strong empty feelings. No one believes that the Earth is flat because of any logical argument. They believe that the Earth is flat because the panic that is caused by believing that lie sustains their desired anger. And their anger is all they have and all they want. Believing the lie is a deliberate and calculated act to drum up an overriding state of blind emotion. Trump’s big lies are the whole point of his appeal. Hillary’s fault is that she makes small lies (about the e-mails and a lot else). Small lies can be proven to be false, and the small liar shown to be a fool. You can say that you believed her about the e-mails, and then be shown that that small lie was wrong, and then say that she is a scoundrel for fooling you like that. But if you swallow a big lie, you can’t back down. Any backdown would be such a loss of face, that your identity won’t allow it. You get trapped in a world of fear of discovery and anger at your critics and you can’t get out. Most importantly, however, most people don’t want to get out. Most importantly, most people get in that position on purpose. That is why they support Trump. They live off the anger that believing a big lie produces in them. I hate to always be bringing this up, but every year 250,000 Americans die from medical mistakes. That is over 600 a day, every day, all year long. That is more than a fully loaded 747 crashing every day due to preventable errors. And the Wall Street Journal reports that immigrants have a lower crime and incarceration rate than natural-born Americans. Where were the teary-eyed speakers at the RNC talking about their loved ones killed by medical mistakes or by native-born American criminals? There are only a couple hundred thousand more of those to be found than the ones they trotted out. But that is only if you believe in the weight of evidence. There is no either sane or utilitarian reason to put the fear of immigrant criminals or Islamic terrorists anywhere within the top 100 things to worry about in life. But that is not the point. The point isn’t in believing in the truth what that does for you. The whole point is in believing the lie and what that does for you. *** Trump is giving his followers what they want and what they insist on: a big lie that will feed their anger. They want to be lied to so that they can be angry at those who call them liars. That is all they want in life, and Trump is delivering the goods. Trump isn’t doing this because he has some carefully calculated path to power on backs of his supporters. He is doing it because he is an idiot and can’t do anything else. He is just a meaningless tool of the times. The more he lies the more his supporters feed off the anger those lies cause and it goes on and on. The “Vichy Republicans” are just along for the ride, knowing full well that all they want is power and that they will get it and find a way to cover themselves no matter what happens. As you know, in politics, losing is often the best choice, because then you get all of the talk and none of the responsibility. It is all up to democracy. If most of the people want to be lied to so that they can be angry, then goodbye the good old U.S.A. If Hillary isn’t up to bringing out the vote, then that’s the end. But Trump isn’t stopped by showing him to be a liar. That just feeds the beast. You don’t convince someone that the Earth isn’t flat by telling them that they are stupid. They want you to say that, so that they can get angry at you for saying that, and that anger is all they really wanted from the beginning. If you are angry enough you don't have to deal with anything else in the world. It is the cheapest and most powerful drug in the world. And once you are addicted, it is hard to stop. Once you are addicted you simply don't know how to do anything else. And you want more and more of it. You narrow his support by giving his supporters a way out. I think the best way to stop him, as has been pointed out by others, is to simply insult him. That way he will wind it so far out that even his supporters will see the humor in it. Get him to trash talk more about the U.S. and start bringing in UFOs and it will all turn into stand-up comedy even to his supporters. A good laugh puts you in charge, and gets you out. Either that, or he starts insulting pockets of his own supporters, and then they start wondering who is next. Get some surrogates to insult him in public, and trust he handles it badly. Not call him a liar, but actually insult him. He’s afraid of the very thing he does to others. That’s why he does it. Reagan would have put on that famous smile and say “there you go again.” Trump will probably loose it. That and when the Trump U case comes up, he’ll be shown to be a small liar. *** 3) Roots of his appeal. A reader with another tip: Another magazine [apart from The Atlantic!] I’ve recently discovered that has a lot of insightful articles is The American Conservative. Below is a link to a great article discussing the appeal of Trump to the white working class. Yes, this interview with J.D. Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy, is interesting and important. It intersects with the themes Deb and I have been covering, and we’ll return to it. *** 4) On Trump, Putin, and a bias toward chaos. Last for today: I haven’t slept well since Trump’s RNC speech when it dawned me how close the alignment of Trump’s and Putin’s behavior and interests are. I plead that you dig deeper, much deeper. That you encourage your compatriots to uncover this connection. In general, I am not a conspiracy believer, but Trump certainly is.  I believe that most of us see the world through the prism of our own beliefs. Therefore, Trump believes that the world is run and “won” by using fixers, by rigging the game. This has clearly been how he has operated his businesses and been his experience within New York real estate. Trump says as much in his acceptance speech. Putin has the power and inclination to help Trump fix or tilt our election—with cyber warfare (DNC email leaks?), terrorist attacks, and promoting social unrest. Putin has been in a cold war with us for several years now and has become adept at using asymmetric warfare against democratic nations.  I expect there to be more fear-inspiring activity before and during the DNC, during the Rio Olympics and leading up to election day. Russia can facilitate terrorist groups, even fake terrorism through Chechen connections that can be passed off as ISIS. Russia could fake an Iranian or North Korean cyber attack on the US or an ally (Israel?). They can incite, even arm, the crazies in any democracy. The possibilities are many—arm some militant Black Panthers in the U.S., set off a few car bombs close to the election, send some anthrax around, release some Zika mosquitos, leak embarrassing and incendiary information.   There will be an act of terror somewhere in the world practically every day to light up cable news and remind us how scared we should be, to keep our flag at half mast. How else does the RNC and Trump’s victory speech make any sense? He’s tripled down on chaos. He wins the election only if the electorate is scared and all we want is “law and order.” Trump is not worried that his convention was a mess, that his party is not united or that he has no staff or ground campaign; this is a cable-news assault. Russia helps make the chaos and get Trump elected. In exchange Russia gets the Ukraine, the Baltics, greatly weaken democracies and a narcissistic U.S. President that is prone to their manipulation. Crazy? Yes. Is Trump crazy? Yes. I believe he is crazy enough that there could actually be a direct link between Putin and Trump. Either way, whether a real conspiracy or a confluence of toxic nationalistic waste streams the only vaccine is suspecting the truth before the fact. James Fallows 12:34 PM / July 23, 2016 A Different Kind of 'Trump Nation' Report Dodge City High School Marching Band, “the Pride of Southwest Kansas.” (Red Demon Football on Youtube.) Western Kansas, where Deb and I have spent time over the past month, is the heart of Trump Nation in one sense: Trump and the GOP will almost certainly carry this area, and the whole state, this fall. But if you compared the daily texture of economic, educational, civic, and cultural life in cities like this, with the America-in-the-ashcan end-times tone of political discourse in general, and of the past week in Cleveland in particular, you would wonder about the contrast. The tension between these two basic assessments of 21st century America, and the ways in which each might selectively be true, was the theme of my March issue cover story, and of our on-scene reports from around the country over the past few years collected here. It’s also been part of our previous reports from Kansas here, here, here, and here, with more to come. Deb Fallows has a new installment up this morning. It’s about Dodge City High School: home of two successive Kansas State teachers-of-the-year; source of civic pride; locus of ethnic diversity exceeding that of many big cities; and home, among other things, to a fishing team. You can read her report here, and I hope you will. *** Continue Reading Process note: the balancing act within our own household and inside my own mind, between the increasingly dire aspects of America’s national politics, and the fresh and encouraging developments in most other realms, is our own local reminder of the larger challenge of trying to make sense of the national condition. Maybe I should just fall back on the principle that was so handy in China: Everything you could possibly say about the country is true — somewhere. Maybe I should call it schizophrenia or cognitive dissonance, rather than a balancing act. But most of all I should probably keep the balance in favor of on-the-road reporting, which usually has the virtue of being surprising in positive rather than negative ways. James Fallows 3:10 PM / July 21, 2016 'It's a Trap': What If the Convention Chaos Is All Planned? In a series of posts, I’ve been arguing that the well-publicized chaos of the Republican National Convention provides cautionary evidence on how the Trump organization might handle the scaled-up challenge of running a national campaign. A reader on the West Coast says there is another possibility (and extends the kayfabe analysis from a previous reader ): I’ve been enjoying the past few days of convention meltdown because I love the idea that we may be watching a Donald death spiral. However, a new theory struck me this morning: This might all be a trap (if I’m wrong it’s because I’ve watched too many episodes of Game of Thrones). Here it is: Theory: Some or all of the chaos at the Republican convention is intentional / staged. Evidence: According to NPR, Cruz didn’t go off script. That is, Trump knew what he was gong to say and he let him go up there anyway. Therefore this is no surprise slap in the face as it’s being portrayed. Why: Attention: Trump has consistently shown an ability to profit from attention, and chaos drives more attention. Everyone will be paying attention to his speech tonight. It makes it all about Trump: For instance, Cruz overshadowing Pence is being portrayed as a problem, but if you’re creating a cult of personality, it’s actually a feature not a bug. Now Trump can ride in as the savior. Lowers expectations: You remember how W played this to great effect. In other words, a moderately good speech turns into the turnaround of the century. Sets a trap: Trump can use all the attention on the horserace (which is a media obsession) to paint himself as the outsider candidate: “All the media cares about is the soap opera, meanwhile I’m gonna make America great again! Let’s get rid of these jokers who have been driving this country into the ground.” For a public that hates the political class, the right speech tonight could be a big breakout moment. Bonus is that Hillary will look totally wooden when she pulls off an organized convention. Old narrative: well organized conventions are key to a successful presidential bid. New narrative: conventions are the band camp for political losers I hope I’m wrong, but worry I hear the Rains of Castamere playing in the background. For analytical completeness, it’s worth comparing this possibility with “Trump’s Razor,” as explained most recently by Josh Marshall at TPM.  (Premise of the razor: “Ascertain the stupidest possible scenario that can be reconciled with the available facts.”) My life experience inclines me to razor-style, as opposed to trap-style, interpretations of most events. But no one knows anything for sure right now. James Fallows 2:11 PM / July 21, 2016 The Trump Era Dawns Ted Cruz addresses the Republican convention. (Jorge Bueno / Wikimedia commons) Readers respond to this stage in our national pageant. Is it all just kayfabe? From a reader in the Northwest: Maybe it’s time to stop looking to political pundits to analyze Trump, because politics is the wrong lens? Trump isn’t a politician; he’s a performer. Maybe we should be asking directors and producers to explain what we are witnessing: drama, and nothing more. Why did he let Cruz speak in primetime without a guarantee of an endorsement? Political ineptitude, or dramatic genius? It was a pro wrestling moment. Betrayal, treachery, defiance! What better way to set up a scene of triumphant revenge! Are Cruz, Christie, Pence, and his own family unwitting or semi-witting extras in Trump’s improvisational “kayfabe”? Is this all just a corollary to PT Barnum’s quote about bad publicity: “There’s no such thing as bad drama?” *** It’s getting out of hand. This reader is less amused: One of the many concerns with watching a man like Trump edge closer to becoming the most powerful man in the world is the growing feeling that there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. And that we’ve seen this before. And that this is something new and unbelievable. And frightening. Mostly frightening. There are so, so many rational arguments against him and none of them matter despite many of them being of the utmost importance. Years of over-the-top mudslinging have made us all numb to criticism of his very real faults. It’s not that there are Teflon politicians. It’s just that there are people who don’t care about the charges made against them. They care about ratcheting up the attack even more so that they look good by comparison. So here we are, scraping from the bottom of the scum pond for rhetoric to hurl. It’s a certainty that the people chanting “lock her up” believe simultaneously that she deserves to be locked up, and that they are engaging in the same type of hyperbolic arguments that they think are being made against Trump. Like Mr. Goldberg’s assertion that Trump = Putin, which I can’t even tell whether it is hyperbole or not. Or Donald Trump: Sociopath? Yet I think that none of this is effective. In fact, all of it contributes to the success of the Republican call for change, which is made more effective because the change is being proposed in the form of a very, very much non-politician. Who wouldn’t want change in such a toxic election? I just hope someone can come up with an idea on the Democrat side, something that everyone can rally behind. Things are getting desperate. *** Continue Reading Not a deal but a relationship. A reader responses to Time Capsule #49, on Trump’s willingness to walk away from a deal: “You always have to be prepared to walk”: Trump really relishes deal-making and negotiations, and rightly so. The rules he plays by—regardless of whether they’re anyone else’s rules—appear to serve him well. What’s scary is that he seems to treat everything like a negotiation. As you point out, we don’t just have a deal with, say, Japan; we have a relationship. Relationships aren’t always easy, and the strongest ones require hard work to maintain. It’s hard not to compare this to his marriages. We can’t just get divorced from Japan or South Korea or Estonia every so often and go start over with younger, seemingly more exciting allies. *** The Cruz gamble: I am a Texan and I despise Ted Cruz. But he is one of the few to stand up to Trump. I have never voted for a Democrat for President, but this year will be the first. I would have hoped that Cruz would have done the right thing and clearly stated that as flawed as Hillary is, Trump is unfit for office. He did the next best thing. I think it’s brilliant politics. What are the chances that Trump self-destructs before the election, or God help us as President? Very high, I’d say. Cruz can say he was right when it happens. Also, he sets himself up to run against Trump in Republican primaries in 2020 as the “I told you so” candidate. He could also run as as 3rd party candidate and get significant support as the only conservative in the race.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads.

Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

CDT August 08, 2016 Photo provided by The Sunlight Foundation. (Photo: Courtesy - The Sunlight Foundation) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Thanks to the Texas Supreme Court, McAllen taxpayers cannot find out how much their city paid Enrique Iglesias to belt out his Latin pop lyrics at a holiday parade. And Houston cannot release, among other information, how many driver permits it has issued to ride-hailing giant Uber. A Kaufman County school district’s food service deal? Much of that is now secret, as are details of a Texas Department of Insurance contract for interpretation services. Those are a few instances among many over the past year in which Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office told local governments not to release information to the public because it is now shielded by a state Supreme Court ruling protecting the secrets of private companies doing business with government agencies. Such records were considered public before the court's ruling last year, and open government experts call the decision a broadly written accommodation of business interests that is ripe for abuse. Now, Texas lawmakers are considering ways to patch up what one calls a “monstrous loophole” in public records law. “Every single private organization can essentially shut down any information they gave a government entity in perpetuity,” said state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, who is working with open records advocates on a legislative fix. In the June 2015 ruling, the justices ordered Paxton to block the release of certain information in a lease between Boeing and the Port Authority of San Antonio because the aerospace manufacturer said making the details public could tip off its competitors. The ruling expanded the secrecy of government contracts in two key ways, experts say: by broadening an exemption in public records law used to protect the government’s competitive interests and by affirming that businesses could invoke it, too. In recent years, the state would withhold otherwise-public records only if their release significantly hindered government’s ability to get a good deal in the marketplace. Even that application was wider than what the Legislature intended when it created the exemption decades ago, said Joe Larsen, an open government attorney who also serves on the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. Originally, lawmakers sought to prevent a bidder for government work from nabbing a competitor’s bids on a contract. And once that contract was finalized, it was considered public, Larsen said. Not anymore, particularly after the Boeing v. Paxton decision. It lowered the threshold for what can be secret, while affirming that private entities — when government informs them about someone's request for their information — could invoke the protection when doing government business in Texas. The test for disclosure “is whether knowing another bidder’s overhead costs would be an advantage, not whether it would be a decisive advantage,” Justice John Devine wrote in his majority opinion. Trend toward secrecy Private and public entities have since seized on ruling, using it to persuade Paxton’s office to rule in their favor in a host of records disputes. That’s leaving taxpayers in dark about some government spending — like how much McAllen paid Iglesias for an hourlong concert that featured hit such as "Bailando” and “El Perdon,” according to local news reports. The city has withheld the records since local news media requested them, arguing that the government has “specific marketplace interests” in the information and releasing it would “place the city at a competitive disadvantage” when negotiating future contracts, according to a March 7 ruling from Paxton’s office. The letter sided with the city and referenced the Boeing decision. City officials told the Tribune that they had no additional comment. Paxton’s ruling in the McAllen case echoed many others he has issued over the past year. Some specifically mention that the requested information was considered public before the Boeing decision. This trend worries advocates of government transparency. “If there’s a place where corruption can fester, it’s here,” Larsen said. “It’s the interface between those who are seeking to work for the government and the government. That’s where the money is.” Now, some Texas lawmakers say they're ready to address the issue next legislative session. Capriglione said his bill, still in draft form, would essentially return Texas to life before the Boeing ruling, which he said undermined efforts last session to increase transparency in state contracting. “We want to go back to where the governmental entity essentially gets the power of that exemption.”  He may get bipartisan help. State Rep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, is also drafting legislation — spurred by the tussle over the Iglesias contract — that would address the Boeing ruling and specifically list entertainment contracts with the government as public documents.  Steering the bill though the Legislature could prove tricky because the issue is so far-reaching, said Curtis Smith, his chief of staff.  “Often we want to limit the effect of our bills,” he said. “But this touches everything. Everyone will have an opinion on it.”  Some exceptions to the trend Paxton hasn’t sided with everyone who has invoked Boeing to evade transparency. Last April, Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Ybarra wrote that Chesapeake Energy failed to show it would face “substantial harm to its competitive position” if the Fort Worth Independent School District released details of its $1 million settlement with the natural gas driller — a resolution of a royalty payment dispute.  More recently, Paxton sided with The Texas Tribune when chemical manufacturer BASF sought to keep secret information related to a $2.4 million Texas Enterprise Fund grant announced in 2015. Last month, the company sued, asking a Travis County district court to prevent Gov. Greg Abbott's office from releasing what it called “sensitive, proprietary, information regarding BASF’s means, methods, and costs.” Larsen said he was surprised that Paxton had sided with the Tribune, considering the persuasiveness of the Boeing argument. Bill Cobb, a former deputy in the attorney general’s office, said BASF may have failed on a technicality, since it did not submit a sworn statement detailing how the release would damage the company (Such statements aren't required, but Cobb said his former employer likes to have them). Or, perhaps, the decision was just one inconsistency from an office that has already churned out more than 1,700 letter rulings this year. It was unlikely that BASF, which cited Boeing, lost on the merits alone, Cobb said. Click here to read this story in its original home with our content partners at The Texas Tribune.

News Business Business News Airbus bribery investigation launched by Serious Fraud Office Probe adds to scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries, including Monaco-based Unaoil Julie Johnsson, Mark Deen, Andrea Rothman Monday 8 August 2016 07:32 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Airbus A350 plane pictured at the Berlin Airshow in June - the company is accused of hiring third party consultants who bribed officials Reuters Airbus said the UK Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. The Toulouse-based planemaker said in a statement Sunday that it’s cooperating with investigators probing its civil aviation business.  Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. Read more BP signed contracts with firm linked to bribery, Panama Papers reveal The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a 27 July statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 per cent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption.

He returned to the UK in December 2012 and was arrested following a two-and-a-half year criminal investigation by the SFO. Getty Images “This will have some negative impact,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues.” Airbus said in the 27 July filing that it’s undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The company said it’s also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said. © Bloomberg More about: Airbus Serious Fraud Office Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 7, 2016 at 10:13AM Look! Up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a European space monopoly. Image source: Getty Images. Will they? Won't they? They will -- and they did. In a decision that will reverberate throughout the space industry for decades, last month the European Commission gave final approval to Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) plan to acquire a controlling stake in European rocket launch company Arianespace. For the piddling sum of just $166 million, Airbus Safran Launchers (ASL -- Airbus' joint venture with Safran) will buy French government space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales' (CNES) 35% stake in Arianespace. ASL will add it to the 39% it already owns, and thus acquire 74% supermajority control over the space launch company. What it means to investors On the surface, this may sound like a run-of-the-mill corporate organization. It's not. In fact, it's hard to overestimate the significance of ASL's move to investors in Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) here in the U.S. Here's the reason in a nutshell: In the U.S., two companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, both build space launch vehicles -- Delta IV and Atlas V, respectively. These two companies provide these vehicles to their 50-50-owned joint venture, United Launch Alliance (ULA), which uses them for commercial and government (but mainly government) space missions. From start to finish, therefore, Boeing and Lockheed enjoy the synergies of being both rocket makers and rocket launchers. Similarly, in Europe, two companies -- Airbus and Safran this time -- build space launch vehicles. Up until now, their ASL joint venture did not fully control the company that launched those vehicles: Arianespace. But once ASL acquires CNES' stake in Arianespace, it will control the subsidiary. ASL's and CNES' businesses will basically be controlled by a unified management, and Airbus and Safran can begin to enjoy the same synergies that have benefited Boeing and Lockheed for a decade, since the formation of ULA in 2006.  As The Wall Street Journal pointed out in February, the formation of ASL was intended to give Airbus and Safran "cost efficiencies to compete more nimbly" against rivals, such as ULA and SpaceX (because SpaceX also both builds and launches its own rockets). But that was just the start. ASL also needed to control the launching business. As Airbus CEO Thomas Enders told the Journal back then: "I'm not satisfied with the progress we have achieved so far," and Arianespace still needed to be brought within the fold. Now it will be, and the playing field will be leveled among all three of these big space-launch companies. Sounds fair. So, what was the holdup? This development has been a long time coming. Not just since ASL announced plans to buy CNES' Arianespace stake in June of last year, or since Airbus' alliance with Safran to form ASL in 2014, but ever since Boeing and Lockheed stopped fighting each other and teamed up to form ULA 10 years ago. ASL gaining control over Arianespace is just the last step in a long process of Airbus and Safran playing catch-up, and as Enders lamented in the Journal earlier this year, Airbus has been "losing precious time against the competition" all the while. To fix that, the deal to acquire control over Arianespace, which required clearance from the European Commission, was expected to sail through by February. Instead, it was held up for nearly six months over EC concerns that an effectively merged ASL/Arianespace might exchange confidential information one with the other, to the detriment of competitors of both ASL (in rocket and satellite manufacture) and Arianespace (in rocket launch), who would not have access to such inside information on competing bids for products and services. To allay these concerns, Airbus and Arianespace have made binding commitments to set up "firewalls" to prevent such transfers of confidential information, so as to not harm competition in the fields of satellite manufacture or space launch. At the same time, the EC's review confirmed that past worries over potential "discrimination in satellite manufacturers' access to Arianespace's launch services," and worries that Arianespace would choose to buy only ASL launchers and payload adapters in the future, shutting down competing products from, for example, Russia's Progress State Research and Production Space Centre (TsSKB) or Italy's ELV, were in fact unfounded. That's good news for ASL and Arianespace going forward, as the companies were not required to make any commitments to preserve competition in these areas. It's less good for rival rocket makers, should it turn out that Arianespace will in the future begin giving more business to its de facto owner, and less to competing companies. The upshot for investors Was the European Commission right to give Airbus and Arianespace the benefit of the doubt on these latter issues? Will the firewalls the companies say they will put in place in fact protect their rivals from unfair competition? Time will tell. For now, what we know is this: With the EC on board with the deal, Airbus and its partner are free to proceed with their acquisition of a controlling stake in Arianespace. The creation of a de facto monopoly in European space launch has begun -- and SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin now face a tougher rival when competing for international launch contracts.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FL – The next generation of America’s human spaceships is rapidly taking shape and “making fantastic progress” at the Kennedy Space Center as Boeing and NASA showcased the start of assembly of the first flightworthy version of the aerospace giants Starliner crew taxi vehicle to the media last week. Starliner will ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) by early 2018. “We are making fantastic progress across the board,” John Mulholland, vice president and program manager of Boeing Commercial Programs, told Universe Today at the July 26 media event in Boeing’s new Starliner factory. “It so nice to move from design to firm configuration, which was an incredibly important milestone, to now moving into the integrated qual phase of the campaign.” Boeing is swiftly making tangible progress towards once again flying Americans astronauts to space from American soil as was quite visibly demonstrated when the firm showed off their spanking new Starliner ‘clean-floor factory’ to the media last week, including Universe Today – and it’s already humming with activity by simultaneously building two full scale Starliner crew vehicles. “We are on track to support launch by the end of 2017 [of the uncrewed orbital test flight],” Mulholland told me. “The Structural Test Article (STA) crew module is almost ready to be delivered to the test site in California. The service module is already delivered at the test site. So we are ready to move into the qualification campaign.” “We are also in the middle of component qualification and qualifying more than one component every week as we really progress into assembly, integration and test of flight design spacecrafts.” Starliner is being manufactured in what is officially known as Boeing’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida under contract with NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP). And the Boeing CST-100 Starliner assembly line aiming to send our astronauts to low Earth orbit and the space station is now operating full speed ahead at KSC. Formerly known as Orbiter Processing Facility-3, or OPF-3, the facility was previously used as a servicing hanger to prepare NASA’s space shuttle orbiters for flight. NASA, industry and news media representatives visit the modernized high bay in Boeing’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Credits: NASA/Kim Shiflett The facility has now been completely renovated and refurbished by removing about 11,000 tons of massive steel work platforms that once enshrouded the space shuttle orbiters for servicing and refurbishment for flight – and been transformed into Boeings gleaming white C3PF Starliner manufacturing facility. Components for the first Starliner that will actually fly in space – known as Spacecraft 1 – began arriving recently at the C3PF. These include the upper and lower domes, as well as the docking hatch for the spacecrafts pressure vessel. “You can see the beginning of Spacecraft 1. To build it all of the major structural elements are here,” Mulholland explained. “The lower dome will be populated and get to first power on early next year. We are really looking forward to that. Then we will mate that to the upper dome and start in on the ground qualification on Spacecraft 1.” Altogether Boeing is fabricating three Starliner flight spacecraft. “We will start building Spacecraft 2 in the Fall of this year. And then we will start Spacecraft 3 early next year.” “So we will have three Starliner spacecraft flight crew module builds as we move into the flight campaign.” The honeycombed upper dome of a Boeing Starliner spacecraft on a work stand inside the company’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com Notably Spacecraft 1 will be the first Starliner to fly in the company’s pad abort test. “Spacecraft 1 will go into the ground campaign and then the pad abort,” Mulholland stated. “The test is designed to prove the launch abort system planned for the spacecraft will be able to lift astronauts away from danger in the event of an emergency during launch operations,” says NASA. The Pad Abort test is currently slated for October 2017 in New Mexico. Boeing will fly an uncrewed orbital flight test in December 2017 and a crewed orbital flight test in February 2018. “Spacecraft 3 will be the first to fly in orbit on the uncrewed flight test by the end of 2017,” Mulholland confirmed. ‘Spacecraft 2 will go through a several month long thermal vac testing and EMI and EMC in California in the middle of next year and then go into the crewed flight test [in 2018].” The rather distinctive, olive colored aluminum domes are manufactured using a weldless spin forming process by Spincraft, based in North Billerica, Massachusetts. They take on their honeycombed look after being machined for the purposes of reducing weight and increasing strength to handle the extreme stresses of spaceflight. The lower dome is machined by Janicki Industries in Layton, Utah, and the upper dome is machined by Major Tool & Machine in Indianapolis.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com Engineers bolted together the upper and lower domes of Boeings maiden Starliner crew module in early May to form the complete hull of the pressure vessel for the Structural Test Article (STA). Altogether they are held together by 216 bolts. They have to line up perfectly. And the seals are checked to make sure there are no leaks, which could be deadly in space. Boeing expects to finish fabricating the STA by August. The completed Starliner STA will then be transported to Boeing’s facility in Huntington Beach, California for a period of critical stress testing that verifies the capabilities and worthiness of the spacecraft. “Boeing’s testing facility in Huntington Beach, California has all the facilities to do the structural testing and apply loads. They are set up to test spacecraft,” said Danom Buck, manager of Boeing’s Manufacturing and Engineering team at KSC, during an interview in the C3PF. “At Huntington Beach we will test for all of the load cases that the vehicle will fly in and land in – so all of the worst stressing cases.” “So we have predicted loads and will compare that to what we actually see in testing and see whether that matches what we predicted.” Boeing has also vastly updated the mockup Starliner to reflect the latest spacecraft advances and assist in manufacturing the three planned flight units. Bastian Technologies built many of the components for the mockup and signed as new 18-month new Mentor-Protégé Program agreement with Boeing and NASA at the media event. The mock up “is used as a hands-on way to test the design, accessibility and human factors during the early design and development phase of the program. The mock-up is currently being used for rapid fire engineering verification activities, ergonomic evaluations [including the seats and display panels], and crew ingress and egress training,” says NASA.

The goal of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) is to restore America’s capability to launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil to the ISS, as soon as possible. Boeing was awarded a $4.2 Billion contract in September 2014 by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden to complete development and manufacture of the CST-100 Starliner space taxi under the agency’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program and NASA’s Launch America initiative. Since the retirement of NASA’s space shuttle program in 2011, the US was been 100% dependent on the Russian Soyuz capsule for astronauts rides to the ISS at a cost exceeding $70 million per seat. Starliners will launch to space atop the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket from pad 41 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Boeing Starliner will launch on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket similar to the one carrying the NROL-61 surveillance satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) from Space Launch Complex-41 on July 28, 2016 at 8:37 a.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL.

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter Carbon nanotube “stitches” strengthen composites Print Email Details Written by Jennifer Chu Category: Latest News Published: 08 August 2016 Cambridge, Massachusetts - The newest Airbus and Boeing passenger jets flying today are made primarily from advanced composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic - extremely light, durable materials that reduce the overall weight of the plane by as much as 20 percent compared to aluminum-bodied planes. Such lightweight airframes translate directly to fuel savings, which is a major point in advanced composites’ favor. But composite materials are also surprisingly vulnerable: While aluminum can withstand relatively large impacts before cracking, the many layers in composites can break apart due to relatively small impacts - a drawback that is considered the material’s Achilles’ heel. Now MIT aerospace engineers have found a way to bond composite layers in such a way that the resulting material is substantially stronger and more resistant to damage than other advanced composites. Their results are published this week in the journal Composites Science and Technology. The researchers fastened the layers of composite materials together using carbon nanotubes — atom-thin rolls of carbon that, despite their microscopic stature, are incredibly strong. They embedded tiny “forests” of carbon nanotubes within a glue-like polymer matrix, then pressed the matrix between layers of carbon fiber composites. The nanotubes, resembling tiny, vertically-aligned stitches, worked themselves within the crevices of each composite layer, serving as a scaffold to hold the layers together. In experiments to test the material’s strength, the team found that, compared with existing composite materials, the stitched composites were 30 percent stronger, withstanding greater forces before breaking apart. Roberto Guzman, who led the work as an MIT postdoc in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro), says the improvement may lead to stronger, lighter airplane parts — particularly those that require nails or bolts, which can crack conventional composites. “More work needs to be done, but we are really positive that this will lead to stronger, lighter planes,” says Guzman, who is now a researcher at the IMDEA Materials Institute, in Spain. “That means a lot of fuel saved, which is great for the environment and for our pockets.” The study’s co-authors include AeroAstro professor Brian Wardle and researchers from the Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab AB. “Size matters” Today’s composite materials are composed of layers, or plies, of horizontal carbon fibers, held together by a polymer glue, which Wardle describes as “a very, very weak, problematic area.” Attempts to strengthen this glue region include Z-pinning and 3-D weaving — methods that involve pinning or weaving bundles of carbon fibers through composite layers, similar to pushing nails through plywood, or thread through fabric. “A stitch or nail is thousands of times bigger than carbon fibers,” Wardle says. “So when you drive them through the composite, you break thousands of carbon fibers and damage the composite.” Carbon nanotubes, by contrast, are about 10 nanometers in diameter — nearly a million times smaller than the carbon fibers. “Size matters, because we’re able to put these nanotubes in without disturbing the larger carbon fibers, and that’s what maintains the composite’s strength,” Wardle says. “What helps us enhance strength is that carbon nanotubes have 1,000 times more surface area than carbon fibers, which lets them bond better with the polymer matrix.” Stacking up the competition Guzman and Wardle came up with a technique to integrate a scaffold of carbon nanotubes within the polymer glue. They first grew a forest of vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes, following a procedure that Wardle’s group previously developed. They then transferred the forest onto a sticky, uncured composite layer and repeated the process to generate a stack of 16 composite plies — a typical composite laminate makeup — with carbon nanotubes glued between each layer. To test the material’s strength, the team performed a tension-bearing test — a standard test used to size aerospace parts — where the researchers put a bolt through a hole in the composite, then ripped it out. While existing composites typically break under such tension, the team found the stitched composites were stronger, able to withstand 30 percent more force before cracking. The researchers also performed an open-hole compression test, applying force to squeeze the bolt hole shut. In that case, the stitched composite withstood 14 percent more force before breaking, compared to existing composites. “The strength enhancements suggest this material will be more resistant to any type of damaging events or features,” Wardle says. “And since the majority of the newest planes are more than 50 percent composite by weight, improving these state-of-the art composites has very positive implications for aircraft structural performance.” Stephen Tsai, emeritus professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University, says advanced composites are unmatched in their ability to reduce fuel costs, and therefore, airplane emissions. “With their intrinsically light weight, there is nothing on the horizon that can compete with composite materials to reduce pollution for commercial and military aircraft,” says Tsai, who did not contribute to the study. But he says the aerospace industry has refrained from wider use of these materials, primarily because of a “lack of confidence in [the materials’] damage tolerance. The work by Professor Wardle addresses directly how damage tolerance can be improved, and thus how higher utilization of the intrinsically unmatched performance of composite materials can be realized.” This work was supported by Airbus Group, Boeing, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Saab AB, Spirit AeroSystems Inc., Textron Systems, ANSYS, Hexcel, and TohoTenax through MIT's Nano-Engineered Composite aerospace STructures (NECST) Consortium and, in part, by the U.S. Army.

The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet and the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II will be featured, both top contenders to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's aging fighter jets. The airshow will mark the first time the F-35 has been on display in Canada. Two F-35s will be in town, with one on public display. "We are always thrilled to connect people with airplanes, and certainly we are ecstatic to have the F-35A make its Canadian debut right here," said airshow president Jim Reith. The F-35A has been the topic of much political debate in Canada, with the current Liberal government not yet committing to a previous Conservative government plan to replace its fleet of CF-18s by 2025 with the expensive Lockheed Martin planes. The U.S. Air Force announced on Aug. 2 that it now considers the F-35 ready for combat. It will also be the first time F/A-18 Super Hornets will be flown by Boeing test pilots in Canada. The planes are being leased by Boeing from the U.S. Air Force. These features would not be possible without a unique partnership with AIAC Pacific, the organization that produces the annual Aerospace Defense & Security Expo, which runs this Thursday and Friday. "We're positioning ourselves to be literally the only place in Canada with a major airshow with a trade conference right on the airfield and the ability to fly and display aircraft," said Reith. "That doesn't happen anywhere else in Canada and to be honest, it really doesn't happen anywhere else in North America." The airshow and trade show partnership model has been successful abroad, according to Reith, who pointed to the Farnborough Airshow in Hampshire, England, as well as shows in Paris, Singapore and Dubai. Reith points out that there are several more fighter jets rounding out the 'Fightertown' line-up, including two McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, "which is still one of the the greatest aircraft ever built [it was] never bested in aerial combat."

Photo: EPA Airbus Group SE said the UK Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. The Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in a statement on Sunday that it is cooperating with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing Co face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 percent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 percent from leasing companies and 40 percent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption. “This will have some negative impact,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues.” Airbus said in the July 27 filing that it is undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The European planemaker said it is also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said.

He posed for a picture with the Rolling Stones in 1964 and had them sign it in 1999. Bob Harris twice beat cancer, wrote a book on rock and roll, and once flew a Stearman biplane. But he never did this. Sunday, a month after his 86th birthday, Harris of Southgate leapt from an airplane. He fell 18,000 feet and parachuted safely to a grassy runway at the Napoleon Airport. "I love all of you," he said, raising his arms and greeting a group of cheering supporters who had waited for hours to see their patriarch do what many of them, far younger and a bit spryer, dared not do. Bob Harris, 86, reacts to skydiving experience They scoured the sky and held their phones in the air as Harris' parachute came into view, growing from a tiny blue and white speck. "Hey, all of you guys need to jump out of a plane. Let me tell you. That's almost as good as having a baby," Harris shouted. Harris, who proudly declares himself the oldest Stones fan, decided to skydive in honor of Mick Jagger, an expecting father at 73. He did it too for his family. Harris has six children, 19 grandchildren, 30 great grandchildren and five great, great grandchildren. All five generations, sporting coordinating T-shirts, were represented Sunday at the dropzone. Five relatives from four generations and Harris' oldest friend, 84-year-old Robert Kruckow, accompanied Harris in his jump, featured by TV news stations in Detroit and Toledo, facts that thrilled Harris, clearly reveling in the attention. "Between you and me, I'll never get that close to heaven again," Harris said as he waited for his name to be called at the busy Skydive Tecumseh facility, relocated in 2015 to Napoleon. The owner, Franz Gerschwiler, said age 92 was oldest jumper he knew, but elderly customers are rare. He marveled Sunday at Harris' massive contingent, a collection of about 50 people, mostly from the Detroit area. "I've lived one hell of a life," said Harris, who is eager to tell tales, some believable – some not. His family is accustomed to his outlandish stories about "Charlie the Tuna" or "Mr. Bear," said his granddaughter Heather Sanders, 39, of Dearborn Heights. "Have you seen the movie 'Big Fish?' That was my grandpa." Harris was raised by a single, adoptive mother who told him she found him in a basket in New York. "I lived down the street from where (gangster John) Dillinger was killed." They moved to Chicago and then Michigan when he was about 11. Harris wasn't too keen on school and he dropped out at 14. He says he lied about his age to join the Merchant Marines and later, the Navy Reserves and the U.S. Army. He went to Japan as part of the occupational forces at the close of World War II. He tried factory work, but "couldn't stand it," and made his living creating newspapers for teenagers. He worked in the entertainment business as a manager and promoter and ran a now-demolished theater on Michigan Avenue in Detroit. "We had $1 movies on weekends and rock concerts every Tuesday night." Iggy and the Stooges played there, said Harris, who is quick to drop names of the stars he encountered. He mentioned Elvis Presley, Wayne Newton, Sonny and Cher, Kenny Rogers, The Supremes and countless others. He co-wrote a book, "Motor City Rock and Roll: The 1960s and 1970s," which has Harris and the Rolling Stones on its cover, and boasts of a collection of signed photographs he said proves his affiliations. They once covered the walls of his house. How has he done it? "He just pushes his way into things," said his 63-year-old son Tony Harris of Redford, who begrudgingly agreed to jump Sunday in honor of his father. "He's not budging until he sells you a vacuum cleaner." Bob Harris gave singer Stevie Wonder a ride before he was a star and five years later, when Harris was involved in a Motown review, Wonder recognized him and invited him to a party. Motown great Smokey Robinson, Harris says, had already invited him. This is what it is like to talk to Harris. Sit down to an afternoon conversation. "By breakfast tomorrow, I'd still be talking," he said as he sat with Kruckow, a motorcycle rider in yellow-tinted aviator glasses who worked as a test driver at Ford. Kruckow has known Harris since the 1950s; Harris introduced him to his wife. "He does crazy things all the time," Kruckow said then mentioned Harris' initial plan to skydive into Comerica Park for a Detroit Rolling Stones concert –Sunday's itinerary proved a tad more doable. Kruckow, Harris says, is his only friend of the same age range. He doesn't consider himself a senior citizen. "I don't deal with old people." Harris is agile for an octogenarian – and sharp. He fought off colon and prostate cancer and now walks the stairs to his ninth-floor apartment, where, divorced, he lives alone. For more than 30 years, he has been creating and circulating a small tabloid, the sort of newspaper that sits in the entrance of a grocery store. "I don't sit home. I don't do television. I'm gone. I'm doing something." He scoffs at retirement and plans to live long enough to "make everyone mad." Would he skydive again? "I think I will do this again and get some more of my family to jump with me," he said, razzing those who opted to stay on the ground. He then turned to a cluster of his grandchildren. "Hey kids, remember this: When you get my age don't jump out of a plane. Jump when you get 20 years old. Jump. It's fun. You'll love it, all of you, like I love you."

X UK fraud office opens criminal investigation into Airbus French-based aircraft manufacturer faces allegations relating to external consultants Mon, Aug 8, 2016, 06:27 Updated: Mon, Aug 8, 2016, 06:28 Airbus said it was co-operating with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images         Airbus Group said the UK Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. The aircraft manufacturer, based in Toulouse in France, said it was co-operating with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Internal inquiry Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal inquiry.The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27th statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing”. Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US export-import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 per cent of financing for Airbus aircraft deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves. Cross-border intermediaries The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption. “This will have some negative impact,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues.” ADVERTISEMENT Airbus said in the July 27th filing that it is undertaking a sweeping review involving”legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The European aircraft maker said it is also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Sam Unaoil Airbus Boeing Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

The Australian flag carrier will receive its first Boeing 787 – also known as the Dreamliner – in 2017, but will announce new routes for the plane later this year. Sales of the A380 have been lacklustre, forcing Airbus to cut production of the jumbo Credit: GETTY Were the London-Perth service given the go-ahead, it would rival the current longest flight in the world, the Emirates Dubai to Auckland service, which clocks in at 8,819 miles and takes 17 hours and 15 minutes. Qantas also announced that it would be deferring delivery of the remaining eight orders it has for the Airbus A380, dealing another blow for the superjumbo.   The world's longest flights The world’s largest passenger plane is a firm favourite amongst travellers, but airline demand for the jet has failed to meet expectations.   Boeing’s 787 and Airbus’s A380 have been competing for control of the skies for the best part of a decade. But many airlines are now moving towards smaller, more fuel-efficient twin-engine jets, like the 787, and away from larger four-engine models like the A380. Airbus has therefore been forced to scale back production of the superjumbo: it will make just 12 of the jets in 2018 compared with 27 in 2015.   Despite the lacklustre sales, Airbus remains bullish about the future of the plane, which has been reconfigured to squeeze 11 people on each row. Watch | Five top tips to survive a long-haul flight 02:03 “The A380 is here to stay,” Airbus’s Robert Gage told Telegraph Travel. “The aircraft is in a class of its own with no competitor’s derivative coming anywhere close. “It is a firm favourite with passengers for its unmatched comfort… and airlines benefit from the extra revenue potential on the world’s busiest routes.” Emirates is the largest operator of the A380 – with 75 of the jets in service and another 67 on order – while Lufthansa, British Airways and Air France are amongst the other airlines using the double-decker jumbo. Watch | Watch: Amazing moment A380 flies under hovering helicopter 00:59 Overall sales of the A380, however, have fallen short of what Airbus expected.  Boeing has also been affected by the trend towards smaller jets: last month it sounded the death knell for the iconic 747, which has been losing money for the American company.  “If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747," said a spokesperson.

The kidnapping took place on Wednesday in waters off the northeast of Sabah state, on the Malaysian side of Borneo island, Indonesia’s ambassador to Malaysia said. “[The vessel] was intercepted by a boat carrying four armed men,” ambassador Herman Prayitno said. The kidnappers took the Indonesian captain after failing to get the 10,000 ringgit (US$2,500) they demanded, Prayitno added. AUSTRALIA Flight diverted to Guam A Jetstar flight from Tokyo to Australia’s Gold Coast was diverted to Guam yesterday. The twin-engine JQ12 Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight from Narita international airport to the Gold Coast landed on the US island territory of Guam in the Pacific yesterday morning after an oil pressure warning light came on, Jetstar said. “After receiving the indicator message the captain elected to shut down one engine as a precaution. Boeing 787s can fly safely on one engine.” The passengers, which the Australian Broadcasting Corp said numbered about 320, are to be taken to Australia on a flight arriving today. AUSTRALIA ‘Patriot’ charged with terror A man with reported links to far-right extremist groups was yesterday charged with planning a terrorist attack after his Melbourne home was raided following police fears of a “specific threat.” The 31-year-old, named in local media as Phillip Galea, appeared in court after he was charged with planning or preparing for a terrorist act and collecting or making documents to facilitate an attack. Galea told the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court he would fight the charges, adding that they were “a conspiracy against the patriot movement.” MEXICO Six killed in landslide A landslide triggered by Tropical Storm Earl left six dead on Saturday in the country’s east as heavy rains began to ease up, but officials warned residents to remain prepared for more floods or mudslides. A couple and their toddler died in Veracruz state when their house was buried, the state’s secretary of civil protection Yolanda Gutierrez Carlin said. The couple’s eight-year-old child was rescued and hospitalized. Another young couple and their three-year-old child were killed when their home was completely swamped by mud. UNITED STATES Drugged candy hits revelers Two dozen concertgoers in northeast Ohio on Saturday suffered medical symptoms after they ate candy laced with a drug found in marijuana. No fatalities were reported at the Ohio Dreams sports camp complex in Butler, about 100km northeast of Columbus, where the weekend-long EST 2016 rap music festival was being held. Major Joe Masi of the Richland County Sheriff’s Department told the Mansfield News Journal someone began tossing out bags of the colorful candies at around 11am. The packages contained about 20 pieces each, according to photographs posted to social media. Masi said each piece had “a very, very high dose of THC,” the chemical that gives marijuana its mind-altering effects. Only one or two candies would get a user high, but some people were eating whole packages, officials said. This story has been viewed 1378 times. Comments will be moderated.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)   Sarah Halzack Washington Post     The Amazon.com logo is on e-readers, tablet computers and countless cardboard boxes on doorsteps. Now, the familiar, swooping arrow is about to show up somewhere new: plastered on the side of a Boeing 767. The e-commerce giant is showing off the aircraft it has dubbed "Amazon One," a plane that is among a fleet of 40 leased from two airfreight companies in an effort to improve a supply chain straining to keep pace with the retailer's growing sales and its swelling ranks of Prime members. "Creating an air transportation network is expanding our capacity to ensure great delivery speeds for our Prime members for years to come," Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a statement. The move to create its own fleet of planes is part of a broader blitz of investment by Amazon to shore up its delivery capabilities. It has begun experimenting with an Uber-like network of drivers that could deliver packages within local markets such as Baltimore, Miami and Milwaukee. Last year, the company unveiled an Amazon-branded fleet of 4,000 trucking trailers to shuttle its wares. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Amazon says its planes and trucking trailers are largely meant to help move goods from one warehouse to another, rather than to facilitate delivery of orders to customers. And, in that way, the company says its forays into the logistics arena are intended to complement the business it does with UPS and FedEx, not replace them. Yet some analysts wonder if the buildup of planes, trucking power and drivers should be interpreted as something of a warning shot that Amazon has more ambitious plans to take greater control of the delivery process. Amazon is a major customer of UPS and FedEx, and the shipping firms have shrugged off the idea that the e-commerce giant intends to bypass them. Even if it did, FedEx, for example, has said that no single customer accounts for more than 3 percent of its revenue. Whatever Amazon's long game is on logistics, it is clear that it is looking to make a splash with the inaugural flight of Amazon One. The company is flying the aircraft on Friday in the Boeing Seafair Air Show, an annual event near its headquarters in Seattle. The side of the plane is emblazoned with the words "Prime Air," and its underside features the Amazon logo. The curved Amazon arrow appears on the tail. The plane's tail number -- N1997A -- is a prime number, a gimmick the company says is meant as a nod to its Prime customers. Eleven of its leased planes have been in the air ferrying goods, but this plane is the first to be splashed with Amazon branding. The rest of the fleet will be getting the logo treatment soon. Even as Amazon ventures into new territory with its trucking and air fleets, it continues to make other, more familiar investments in its logistics capabilities. The retailer has famously been plowing millions of dollars into building a network of fulfillment and sorting centers that enable its promise of two-day shipping on Prime orders. In this quarter alone, the company is set to open 18 fulfillment centers, or three times the number it opened in the same quarter in 2015. The retailer hopes the efforts will make it better prepared for the coming holiday season crush. Last year, fulfillment costs soared in that quarter as demand increased at its warehouses.

The plane is one of 40 jetliners in the "Prime Air" fleet that will make up the retail giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. Called the Amazon One, it was showcased online in a special time-lapse video that shows workers "upcycling" a Boeing jet. Credit: YouTube/About Amazon via Storyful The Boeing jets have been leased from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015. The history of Amazon Play! 02:11 Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Credit: YouTube/About Amazon via Storyful Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future." Credit: YouTube/About Amazon via Storyful The company has been furiously building out distribution centres, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as developing drone delivery technology – another branch of Prime Air.  The company currently has a Prime Air development centre in the United Kingdom,  as well as the US, Austria and Israel.

It is located on a 3.5-acre site bounded by Magazine, Calliope and Camp Streets and Andrew Higgins Drive. There is a subway on the ground floor of the museum. There are also the Restoration Pavilion, the Victory Theater and the Liberation Pavilion among others, which feature screens showing short documentaries of the beginning of the war and other key issues surrounding it, the brutality of the battles in the Pacific and the casualties of the European Theatre. The oral history studios enable visitors listen to narratives of the war. There is also a fascinating creation depicting the aftermath of the crash of a CG-4A Waco glider in Normandy, in the early morning of June 6 1944. With the aid of special effects, a visitor can hear birds chirping and squirrels screeching in the background. It is said that the Boeing Company has made donations of planes involved in accidents to the museum to vividly paint the effect of crash scenes during the war. Though a global war, the WW11, which was fought from September 1939 to September 1945, was one war America wasn’t keen on fighting, until the Pearl Harbour was hit. America’s initial reluctance was based on its experience with the First World War, but when the Pearl Harbour was hit in December 1941, Americans had no choice than to join the war, though it wasn’t as if they were entirely neutral, when the war broke out. By early 1942, all the world’s major countries had got involved in the most destructive war in history. American history will not be complete without the narratives of the WW11 and so, the museum, which is said to have gulped $325million and still counting, is an epic survey of a war that was said to have been fought in over 50 countries, including Nigeria and all the great powers, which eventually formed two opposing military alliances— the Allies and the Axis and involved more than 100 million people. Described as the mightiest struggle humankind has ever experienced, the war was said to have resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres. The World War II is, indeed, the deadliest conflict in human history. It killed more people, cost more money, destroyed more property, affected more people, and caused more far-reaching changes in nearly every country than any other war recorded in history. The number of people killed, wounded, or missing between September 1939 and September 1945 can never be calculated, but it is estimated that more than 55 million people perished. The WW11 museum, which is also a theme park, displays the roll call of donors and sponsors of the project, as well as some veterans, who gave their all to the cause. On interlocks used on walkways around the museum are inscriptions of names of American veterans, who had fought gallantly and paid the supreme price. The Guardian also observed that veterans and serving military are the first group usually called to board flights at American domestic airports, though it couldn’t be ascertained whether they are made to pay for the services or not. The deep sense of preservation is also worthy of note in the WW11 museum. Aside the ubiquitous machine guns, rifles, helmets, uniforms, booth and other common war materials such as magazines, the museum has also preserved tyres used by trucks during the war and other things one would have thought are insignificant, such as packs of cigarettes, matches, socks, chewing gums, anti-seasickness pills, water purification tablets, penicillin, French language translation handbook. Interestingly, condoms used by the troops to keep sand and water out of rifle barrels were also on display. With no tour guide, a visitor is able to move easily round the museum and understand what every artefact connotes. There are enough write-ups to be read to help conjure a mental picture of events. The many 120-foot-wide screens mounted in theatres showed vivid pictures of events on the battlefield. A section of the museum also depicts heavy forest, where troops hid and shot at the enemies. Churchill led the operation tagged ‘Bodyguard,’ which eventually recorded more positive result during the war. It was discovered that troops’ plans were foiled due to leakages. So, he devised a means of wrapping lies round planned operations, which helped the troops to succeed eventually. The over-an-hour tour of the museum was a rewarding experience that will not leave anyone fatigued or bored. Theatre are strategically located around, where one could sit and watch some documentaries or listen to oral history. At no cost, the museum is said to have received over 3.5 million visitors since it opened in 2000. There are enormous interactive video databases. Information about the war’s 464 Medal of Honor winners, the more than 700 government leaders, who were the veterans, including Presidents George H. W Bush, Gerald R. Ford, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, was also available. Still a work in progress, when the edifice is completed, it will house the $35 million US Freedom Pavilion: the Boeing Centre. It will also act as a kind of interlude, a salute to the nation’s fighting forces during the war. A Boeing-17 Flying Fortress, a Corsair fighter also known as “Whistling Death” and other warplanes will be seen as the visitor stands at the atrium, while touch screens will allow for exploration of cockpits and controls. There will also be a special-effect theatre with falling “snow,” vibrating seats to depict earth shakings, as missiles flew through the air. The whole essence is to allow visitors experience the sight, sound and emotion of going to war. There are also newspaper clips on the progression of the war and when it eventually ended. In his victory message titled ‘cost of victory’ to allied troupe of Europe, General Dwight Eisenhower said: “The route you have travelled is marked by the graves of former comrades. Each of the fallen dead, as a member of the team to which you belong, bound together by a common love of liberty’’. An artwork depicting the graveyard of fallen heroes is rested on a large portion of a wall in the museum. The artistic piece showed rows of tombs with white cross on each of them. Indeed, a visit to the museum will enable those not born during the war to grasp more than 50 percent of the happenings during the war. It is hoped that the world will never again experience such monumental waste of human and natural resources.

Manufacturers call 15% corporate rate ‘definitely positive’ Lobby groups say more details needed on spending, R&D breaks Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Small-business and manufacturers’ groups praised a proposal by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to take the U.S. federal corporate tax from the highest to one of the lowest among developed nations. Trump included a call for a 15 percent corporate rate in a Detroit speech where he outlined other tax and economic reforms. Business groups have long said their members are hurt because U.S. companies pay the most federal income tax -- a 35 percent rate, though the effective rate is often lower -- among the 35 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. “The fact that he is pushing for a 15 percent corporate tax rate is definitely a positive,” said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy for the National Association of Manufacturers. “Tax reform is really one of the important goals that we have.” The Rate Coalition, which lists Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. among corporate supporters, said it won’t endorse all aspects of Trump’s plan but that the tax proposal is a “huge step in the right direction and we urge other candidates in the race to follow his lead.” Trump also called for a 10 percent levy on overseas cash that companies have been unwilling to bring home because of high U.S. taxes. The U.S. rate also impedes foreign investment in the country, Coleman said, and some American companies have used acquisitions to set up headquarters in foreign countries with lower taxes. For small businesses, the proposal was a “home run,” said Juanita Duggan, chief executive officer of the National Federation of Independent Business. It would provide the same 15 percent rate for companies no matter their size, freeing up funds to invest back into family businesses, she said. “He got that exactly right,” Duggan said. “Small business cannot pay a higher rate than Exxon Mobil.” Tax Rates The U.S. last adjusted its corporate tax in 1993 when it was pushed up by a percentage point to 35 percent, said Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. Under a 1986 tax bill, the rate was phased down to 34 percent from 46 percent, he said. Countries around the world steadily have been ratcheting down their tax rate to become more competitive, Cole said. The average corporate tax rate when including state levies and weighted by the size of economy has declined to about 29 percent from 36 percent in 2003. The U.S. corporate tax when including state levies is about 39 percent, according to the OECD. “Most countries have been moving down while the U.S. has stood still,” he said. Tel Ganesan, CEO of technology-staffing firm Kyyba Inc. who attended the Trump event in Detroit, said he likes the tax-cut proposal and thinks the billionaire businessman would be better on the economy than Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Still Ganesan, who came to the U.S. from India, is hesitant to support Trump because of his controversial stances on immigration. Watch Next: Will Trump's Tax Pledge Give him a Poll Boost? “He knows the economy better than anybody else,” Ganesan said. “He knows what it takes to get the economy going.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce didn’t issue a statement on the Trump speech and referred questions to a video that calls for lower rates and a globally competitive system. The manufacturers association still wants to see more particulars on Trump’s plan, as well as more incentive for capital spending and research and development, Coleman said: “The devil is in the details on this.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

    An illustration of the Space Launch System, with an Orion spacecraft on top, being prepared for launch. NASA says the first SLS/Orion mission is on schedule for the fall of 2018, but recent GAO reports have raised issues about the schedule for that mission, and a crewed mission NASA wants to fly in 2021. (credit: NASA) Scrutinizing NASA’s exploration efforts by Jeff Foust Monday, August 8, 2016 Neither of the two major party candidates for president, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have offered many details about what changes, if any, they would make to NASA’s major programs if elected (see “The one space policy question for the candidates”, The Space Review, August 1, 2016). It’s reasonable to assume, though, that at some point after taking office they’ll perform some kind of assessment of some major ongoing efforts, like the Space Launch System and Orion. That could be an internal study or an independent outside review, like what President Obama did in 2009 with the Augustine Committee, which ultimately led to the cancellation of Project Constellation. “All of our teams today believe we can get there,” said NASA’s Hill on plans to launch EM-1 in the fall of 2018. So what would that hypothetical review of NASA’s human space exploration efforts find? Based on recent statements, it depends on who you talk to. While NASA officials state they’re making good progress on SLS and Orion, as well as supporting ground equipment, analyses by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggest those efforts face cost and schedule problems that could pose problems for the next administration. Keeping EM-1 on track “This is an amazing period of time in human spaceflight,” said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations, in a July 25 meeting of a NASA Advisory Council committee. Gerstenmaier was showing a chart illustrating the various locations in the US where hardware, including both NASA’s human exploration systems as well as those being developed by Boeing and SpaceX for commercial crew, were being built. “I don’t think we’ve had this much flight hardware, this much manufacturing, this much development activity, ever in place since Apollo.” The emphasis of Gerstenmaier’s presentation was on SLS, Orion and Exploration Ground Systems as they move towards the first SLS flight, Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1). “We’re moving forward on all these pieces, all this hardware starts showing up down at the Cape next year,” he said. “We’re roughly about two years away from flight of EM-1.” Specifically, the EM-1 launch is planned for between September and November of 2018, a date agency leadership says is realistic. “All of our teams today believe we can get there,” said Bill Hill, deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development, of that planned date in a presentation following Gerstenmaier at the committee meeting. “We have some challenges, but we believe we can get there.” Foremost among those challenges is development of the Orion service module, which the European Space Agency is providing to NASA. The module completed its critical design review just a few weeks before the meeting, Gerstenmaier said, and manufacturing is in progress, but is running behind schedule. “We had planned on getting the service module from the Europeans in January. We will now get that service module more likely in April,” he said. “We’re preparing for it to be even a little bit later than that.” That delay ripples through the rest of the program as Orion comes together with SLS at the Kennedy Space Center in advance of the fall 2018 launch. Gerstenmaier said that the program is looking at changing testing schedules to keep the overall launch on track. That could include doing a “wet dress rehearsal” for the SLS launch without Orion being there. “We’ve got a lot of milestones under review,” Hill said. “Our ground systems folks are out ahead of it, taking a look at that. As Gerst said, we’re looking at redoing the flow on the ground systems. They’ve got some good ideas of how to get there.” “We’re in the process of building a robust schedule that can deal with the problems we may see going forward,” Gerstenmaier said. Gerstenmaier said he expected more complications as the EM-1 launch approached, requiring more adjustments to the schedule to maintain the planned launch date. “SLS will face this same kind of part challenge when they start bringing all these parts together, especially outfitting the engine section and putting all the plumbing and ducting in,” he said. “We should see some problems through that whole activity as we do that work on the SLS.” “But again, I think we’ve got reasonable margins in our schedules,” he emphasized. “We’re in the process of building a robust schedule that can deal with the problems we may see going forward.” After EM-1 comes EM-2, the first crewed SLS/Orion mission. A review nearly a year ago set the launch of that mission to be as late as April 2023, driven by completing development of Orion so it can support crews. However, NASA said then that it would work to an earlier date, in 2021, for that mission. That’s still the case today. “Right now we’re holding EM-2 to an August ’21 launch date,” Hill said. Skepticism from the GAO A few days later, though, the GAO offered a more skeptical take. In a report on the Orion program, it raised questions about the cost and schedule estimates used by the program. The program, it argued, failed to meet many best practices for developing its cost and schedule estimates. “As a result, decision makers have reduced insight into program performance and do not have a foundational baseline upon which to make decisions,” the report stated. The GAO in particular raised issue with NASA’s use of that August 2021 launch date for EM-2. That internal goal, coupled with its estimated cost of $10.8 billion, has a “joint confidence level” of 40 percent, which means that NASA has only a 40 percent chance of having Orion ready for EM-2 by that date and at that cost. The April 2023 date, the official baseline, has a joint confidence level of 70 percent. NASA does allow programs to set more aggressive internal goals, but the GAO noted that policy requires those goals to have a joint confidence level of no lower than 50 percent. “Therefore, the program’s cost and schedule is aggressive beyond agency policy, and may increase the risk that the program goes over budget and does not meet its schedule,” the GAO concluded in its report. In addition, the GAO found that NASA was setting aside very little current-year Orion funding for program reserves. “According to Orion program officials, the program has decided to employ most of its available appropriated funds to fund current work and has placed almost all of the funded schedule reserve… towards the end of the internal goal schedule,” the report stated. That could cause problems in the future. “The Orion program may find itself in a similar situation to that experienced by the Constellation [and] JWST programs, which had minimal cost reserves in early years to handle technical challenges that manifested and forced the programs to defer work,” the GAO report stated. “The [Orion] program’s cost and schedule is aggressive beyond agency policy, and may increase the risk that the program goes over budget and does not meet its schedule,” the GAO concluded. A separate report, issued by the GAO the same day, also raised concerns about SLS and Exploration Ground Systems. SLS “has made solid progress in resolving some technical issues and maturing the SLS design,” that report states, but is facing reduced cost and schedule reserves in advance of the EM-1 mission, complicated by what the GAO considers to be a lack of accurate assessments of the development of the SLS core stage. The GAO added that “unforeseen technical challenges are likely to arise once the program reaches its next phase,” when the SLS is completed and integrated with Orion and ground systems, “that will likely place further pressure on cost and schedule reserves.” Development of ground systems, often overlooked in comparison to SLS and Orion, also has its issues. The GAO noted projects to modify the Vehicle Assembly Building and Mobile Launcher to support SLS/Orion missions have used up all of their schedule margins. “As a result, any future delays would have to be accommodated by using the overall program’s schedule reserve,” the GAO stated, adding that the overall Exploration Ground Systems program has only two months of schedule reserve remaining. The GAO reports also raised the issue of costs and available funding. NASA’s exploration programs, particularly SLS and Orion, have done well in recent years, receiving more from Congress than what the administration requested. “’16 was good to us,” Hill said of the fiscal year 2016 appropriations at the July 25 committee meeting. Proposed spending bills in the House and Senate for 2017 also look good, Hill said, but acknowledged that NASA, like the rest of the federal government, will start the new fiscal year in October on a continuing resolution (CR) that funds programs at 2016 levels. That CR could last for as long as six months, he estimated. However, the GAO report stated that NASA’s funding requests for Orion in particular do not support its internal goal of a 2021 launch of EM-1. “Instead, the agency plans to request funding at the level estimated to meet the program’s commitment date of April 2023,” it stated. “As a result, NASA relies on the Congress to appropriate more funds than requested to stay on its internal Orion schedule.” That strategy, the GAO acknowledged, has worked so far. But, it warned, “it may be unrealistic for NASA to expect additional funding each year given the constrained fiscal environment.” While the NASA Advisory Council committee meeting took place before the GAO released its reports, agency officials did give them advance notice the reports were coming out, as NASA had seen, and responded to, a draft version. Hill, speaking at the meeting, sounded a little exasperated by those reviews. “We are really getting kind of overwhelmed with some of these things,” he said, referring to audits by both the GAO and NASA’s Office of Inspector General that he listed on a slide. “Although we have big programs, we have a small group of folks that interact” with auditors, he said. Those reviews, though, may pale in comparison with the examination the next administration might undertake next year of NASA’s exploration programs. And the stakes may be far higher.

Airlines (UAL) today reported July 2016 operational results. UAL's July 2016 consolidated traffic (revenue passenger miles) increased 1.2 percent and consolidated capacity (available seat miles) increased 0.7 percent versus July 2015. UAL's July 2016 consolidated load factor increased 0.5 points compared to July 2015. The company continues to expect third-quarter 2016 consolidated passenger unit revenue to decline 5.5 to 7.5 percent compared to the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year performance is primarily impacted by demand growth not keeping pace with capacity growth, declining close-in yields, lower surcharges, competitive actions and travel reductions in the energy sector. About United United Airlines and United Express operate more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents.

/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- NASA Television will bring to viewers around the world live coverage Friday, Aug. 19, as two NASA astronauts install a new gateway for American commercial crew spacecraft at the International Space Station -- a significant milestone in NASA's work to return crew launches to U.S. soil. Coverage of the spacewalk will begin at 6:30 a.m. EDT Aug. 19, on NASA TV and the agency's website, with the spacewalk scheduled to begin at 8:05 a.m. Leading up to the spacewalk, NASA TV will air a briefing from the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston at 2 p.m. Monday, Aug. 15, during which station and commercial crew experts will discuss the process and significance of installing and connecting the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs) that will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft. The briefing participants are: Kenneth Todd, International Space Station Operations Integration manager Steve Stich, deputy manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program Zeb Scoville, spacewalk flight director Glenda Brown, lead spacewalk officer Reporters may attend the briefing at Johnson or ask questions by calling the Johnson newsroom at 281-483-5111 no later than 1:45 p.m. Aug. 15. The adapter was launched on a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and arrived at the station July 20. Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins of NASA will conduct the spacewalk to install the equipment. This will be the fourth spacewalk in Williams' career, the first for Rubins, and the 194th for the space station. The two astronauts will venture outside the space station's Quest airlock to install the first IDA onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2, located on the forward end of the Harmony module. On Wednesday, Aug. 17, ground controllers will use the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon, and position it just inches away from PMA-2. There will be no live coverage of the trunk removal and IDA positioning. Commercial crew flights from Florida's Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America's human spaceflight launch capability and increase the time U.S. crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars. NASA TV's Public Channel (NTV-1) will broadcast enhanced coverage of the spacewalk including operational commentary, in-studio experts and features, and its Media Channel (NTV-3) will broadcast a clean feed of video from space station with operational commentary.

To be clear, it will still take a few more years before construction on the factory is 100% complete, but Tesla was comfortable enough with the progress it has already made to give the world a bit of a glimpse inside the massive structure. While the opening of a factory may seem uneventful if not downright boring in a general sense, Tesla’s Gigafactory is anything but ordinary. Aside from being a physically impressive structure, the Gigafactory’s existence in and of itself is plays a crucial role in Tesla’s quest to manufacture more than 500,000 cars per year by 2020. Now in order to get make that dream a reality, Tesla needs a whole lot of batteries; and because no company on earth can handle the level of battery production Tesla needed, the company up and decided to build its own battery factory, a colossal structure appropriately called the Gigafactory. DON’T MISS: Ultimate Pokemon Go cheat lets you walk anywhere in the game without moving an inch If all goes according to plan, the Gigafactory will eventually double the current level of global lithium-ion battery production. With the grand opening of the Gigafactory now behind us, we’ve put together a list highlighting some of the more interesting facts surrounding the building itself along with a summary of the resources and logistical efforts that went into its development and construction. The Gigafactory will be the biggest building in the world The Gigafactory measures in at 5.5 million square feet, easily making it the biggest building in the world in terms of its physical footprint. The closest building to the Gigafactory is Boeing’s Everett factory in Washington state with a square footage of 4.3 million. To put the size of the Gigafactory into perspective, the following chart courtesy of Visual Capitalist lays things out clearly. By the time the Gigafactory is 100% finished, it will occupy an approximate area of 13 million square feet. Now in terms of overall volume, it’s worth noting that the Boeing factory does have the Gigafactory beat as it’s much taller. The Gigafactory cost $5 billion to construct When the dust settles, it’s believed that the amount of capital invested into the Gigafactory will come out to a cool $5 billion. Construction began in earnest in mid-May of 2014. Battery production levels will be “faster than bullets from a machine gun” Once the Gigafactory is finished and operating at 100% capacity, Tesla boasts that it will churn out more lithium-ion batteries in one year “than were produced worldwide in 2013.” Speaking to this point, Elon Musk during an earnings conference call last year said: “Cells will be going through [the Gigafactory] like bullets from a machine gun. In fact, the exit rate of cells will be faster than bullets from a machine gun.” Construction workers are on the clock 24/7 Per a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, Tesla now employs 1,000 workers who are on the job “seven days a week on two shifts in an effort to start churning out lithium-ion cells by late 2016.” The Gigafactory will run on 100% renewable energy Hardly a surprise, the Gigafactory will be completely powered by renewable energy. As Tesla notes on its website, “the Gigafactory will also be powered by renewable energy sources, with the goal of achieving net zero energy.” The Gigafactory roof is white for environmental reasons Tesla, a green company if there ever was one, is planning to outfit the entire Gigafactory roof with solar panels. In turn, the roof of the structure will be painted white in order to better reflect light, keep things cool, and ensure that the solar panels are as efficient as possible. The building was designed to be earthquake proof You ever spend a few billion on building a gigantic battery factory only to have an earthquake come along and mess things up? Yeah, Tesla would like to avoid that at all costs. According to a recent report in Fast Company, the massive structure is actually comprised of “four distinct structures with four different foundations so that an earthquake can’t tear it apart.” The Gigafactory foundation itself costs millions of dollars The cost of the Gigafactory’s foundation alone set Tesla back $16 million Tesla spent millions on steel The steel structure underlying the Gigafactory itself reportedly cost $15 million. Fireproofing + Electrical wiring Fireproofing the Gigafactory cost an estimated $5 million while the electrical infrastructure reportedly set Tesla back $300,000 The Gigafactory will employ 6,500 employees by 2020 The Gigafactory won’t run itself, which is why the company anticipates that it will employ upwards of 6,500 at the Gigafactory once construction is fully finished.

Photo: AFP Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (AIDC, 漢翔航空工業) is expected to post increased earnings for last quarter due to an improving product mix, Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting Co (元大投顧) said on Saturday. “The company’s gross margins would likely rise from 13.1 percent a year ago to 15 percent, propelled by higher margin overseas defense aircraft contracts,” Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting Co (元大投顧) analyst Livia Wu (吳靚芙) said in a report. “We are also positive on the company’s ability to capture opportunities from a healthy global commercial aircraft market,” Wu said, adding that the company has a backlog of more than NT$100 billion (US$3.17 billion). Amid rising global air passenger numbers, AIDC’s commercial aircraft backlog for Boeing Co reached 5,700 units, while backlog for Airbus Group SE rose 4 percent annually to 6,700 units, Wu said. However, the company is expected to face increased operational expenditures due to rising research and development costs, Wu added. Orders from the Republic of China Air Force for the Indigenous Defense Fighter and F-16 jets is expected to sustain sales growth momentum next year, Wu said. Meanwhile, the government is likely to show a clearer direction regarding a NT$69 billion program to acquire a new fleet of air force trainer jets next month, AIDC management was quoted as saying in the report. The government has been mulling a wholly indigenous development effort or cooperation with a foreign producer. The program would provide a significant revenue stream between 2018 and 2025, Wu said. Wu said the brokerage anticipates a foreign producer, adding that the government is likely to partner with Italian aeronautics company Alenia Aermacchi, which developed the M-346 two-engine transonic trainer aircraft. AIDC reported that last month’s sales increased 6.74 percent sequentially to NT$2.24 billion, with aggregate sales in the first seven months rising 9 percent annually to NT$16.04 billion. Shares of AIDC yesterday gained 0.23 percent to NT$43.4 in Taipei trading. This story has been viewed 2109 times. Comments will be moderated.

The aerospace company told investors on Sunday that the SFO launched a formal probe last month, after discrepancies were first identified by British government officials in April. The SFO and Airbus have confirmed that the investigation concerns “irregularities” in connection with overseas agents in its civil aviation business, but have not disclosed further details.

Airbus first revealed in April that it was in discussions with the SFO over its failure to disclose third-party involvement in deals that received government support.

Such applications are used to aid exporters and often involve underwriting bank loans. In 2015, Airbus used export financing for six percent of its deliveries. A spokesperson for UK Export Finance said: “UKEF continues to work closely with Airbus and French and German export credit agencies to understand the extent of the matter and to seek assurances about its current compliance practices in relation to overseas agents.” The agency said it would “follow closely other UK government agencies’ investigations and respond accordingly.” Airbus executives have indicated they are working to restore financing – a process separate from the fraud investigation. The company has said that it expects financial backing for some exports to be restored before the end of the year.

We also look at how local and state government agencies carry out these laws to see if they are working. But we must focus on the courts, too. Troubling rulings by the Texas Supreme Court and lower courts are watering down the Texas Public Information Act, long considered one of the strongest in the nation. The momentous law, enacted in the early 1970s amid citizen frustration after the Sharpstown stock fraud scandal, is based on the public’s right to know. It presumes government records are open. If a governmental body wants to withhold information, it can attempt to do so using one of the exceptions spelled out in the law. In most cases it must ask the Texas Attorney General’s Office for permission to do it on a case-by-case basis. That said, some cases end up in court, and the Texas Supreme Court twice last year interpreted the law in ways that made it easier to keep information secret. Most Popular 1 Donald Trump called son of slain SAPD Det. Benjamin Marconi,... 2 Exclusive: Accused cop killer Otis McKane married in San... 3 35-point monster whitetail buck shot by hunter near San... The court decided the nonprofit Greater Houston Partnership did not have to open its financial books to the public because it was not a governmental body, even though it performed economic development duties for the city of Houston and was supported in part by public funds. Another disturbing decision involved the aerospace company Boeing operating in San Antonio. The court ruled that a private party doing business with the government can have its information in government documents withheld if releasing it would give advantage to a competitor. Furthermore, governments can now more easily withhold their own information on those grounds. The result? Information is getting closed off in seemingly straightforward cases of public interest, such as the city of McAllen keeping secret how much taxpayer money it paid for singer Enrique Iglesias to perform at a holiday concert. The city says it doesn’t want to be at a competitive disadvantage when negotiating with future entertainers. In the pivotal Texas Supreme Court rulings, Justice Jeffrey Boyd led the dissent, stating specific legal concerns and noting the overarching theme that the Public Information Act declares it “shall be liberally construed in favor of granting a request for information.” He also offered this point: “The necessary corollary is that we must narrowly construe the Act’s exceptions to disclosure.” That makes sense. Presume openness. Limit the withholding of information. Lawsuits affecting public access also are in play in regional state appellate courts. One of them is a pending appeal in Dallas connected to the larger controversy over development at Fair Park. The nonprofit State Fair of Texas sued an attorney who requested its records. The State Fair claimed it’s not a governmental body and not covered by the Public Information Act. A trial court dismissed the case and financially sanctioned the State Fair for filing it. But the State Fair appealed, and a decision could come soon. It raises the question of what if an everyday citizen — without the money to hire an attorney — ended up sued in court simply for asking for information from an entity that’s not covered by the Texas Public Information Act. (Governmental bodies covered by TPIA cannot sue a requester for making a request.) Several other court cases could negatively impact citizen access to information and will be discussed at the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas state conference Sept. 8 in Austin. Efforts are underway, meanwhile, to further clarify and strengthen the Public Information Act in the 2017 Legislature. It’s hoped that our current state lawmakers, like their predecessors, value open government as a foundation of our democracy. The people’s right to know is at stake. Kelley Shannon is executive director of the nonprofit Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, which advocates for open government and the First Amendment rights of free speech and press.

Europe's largest aerospace company said late on Sunday it had been notified that the UK's Serious Fraud Office had opened a formal criminal probe after being alerted by the country's export credit agency to discrepancies relating to the disclosure of the work of local agents. The probe raises a sensitive issue for the industry because the agency, UK Export Finance, has for years locked horns with aerospace firms about the need for more transparency, even though it does not object outright to the use of intermediaries. Airbus Group said the SFO was looking into possible "fraud, bribery and corruption" and that the company continued to co-operate with the investigating agency, having itself tipped off UKEF about internal findings under a recent compliance drive. "It will take years," a person familiar with the matter said of the SFO investigation, adding it was too early to predict any outcome or consequences. Airbus Group is already the subject of a four-year-old SFO investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia, while the SFO is conducting a corruption probe into engine maker Rolls-Royce which it launched in 2013. The latest case involves discrepancies over the amount of agents' fees disclosed in applications for export support, or missing names of third parties, in some cases dating back years, people familiar with the matter have said. In April, UKEF halted export funding pending a compliance review and was swiftly followed by France and Germany. Since 2006, companies applying for export support in Britain have had to identify any intermediaries involved in sales negotiations and list the sums paid. The rules followed a series of policy U-turns and a fierce debate between UKEF and aerospace companies including Airbus, which had lobbied against the tougher disclosure rules on the grounds that such data was commercially sensitive and that their own codes of conduct and due diligence methods were sufficient. Airbus Group shares fell as much as 1.8 percent on Monday, driven by concern over the probe. The longer-term impact may depend upon how widely the probe spreads and the level of managers who signed off on payments that can be worth millions of dollars, as well as the declarations to export agencies, analysts said. A spokesman declined to comment on any details of the investigation beyond Sunday's brief statement. FUNDING RACE In a separate process, Airbus is meanwhile trying to restore export funding from UKEF under a revised compliance scheme. The company said last month it had agreed a process for this and expected export credits to resume in the fourth quarter. But several people familiar with the case say it has deeply soured relations between Airbus and export agencies, notably UKEF, and that much work remains to be done to restore trust. Analysts say the operational impact of this funding gap is limited for now as there is little demand for export credit amid plentiful commercial liquidity. Just 5 percent of Airbus deliveries depended on such support last year. One person familiar with the case told Reuters the onus was on Airbus to prove it had a robust system for preventing abuse. One move being floated to win back confidence is a blanket voluntary ban within Airbus on the use of percentage commissions to third-party sales agents and more careful vetting of any other form of payment, people familiar with the matter said. The move is designed to allay concerns that payments in countries where it is common to have local representatives, which include parts of Asia and the Middle East, could be seen as a potential vehicle for bribery. But it could provide a headache for a company which has openly stated to UK authorities in the past that it relies on a long-established network of representatives to remain competitive, while some will argue that sales commissions are normal across many industries. It could also test often uneasy relations between Airbus and its parent group, whose boss Tom Enders launched the vigorous - some say abrasive - compliance drive under a new legal head. Currently, the playing field with Boeing is level as the corresponding system in the United States is also frozen due to political deadlock which has left the U.S. Export Import (EXIM) Bank without a fully functioning board. But with some U.S. officials predicting EXIM could resume funding for Boeing around the turn of the year, Airbus risks being disadvantaged in some key markets unless it achieves its target of regaining access to European credits by year-end. Although export credits technically only kick in when planes are delivered, aviation market sources say uncertainty over the future supply of credits can hinder efforts to win new orders. French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said export credits could be useful for finalising a key order from Iran, which has been held up for regulatory reasons and due to funding uncertainties. But at this stage, the agents affair is likely to have an impact on Airbus's reputation rather than business, it said. Anti-corruption group Transparency International said the probe highlighted the need for openness on the use of agents.

Pictured: The new Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Alabama.Reuters File Aerospace and defence aircraft company Airbus is under criminal investigation in the United Kingdom over "fraud, bribery and corruption" allegations. The France-based aerospace company said that the probe ordered by Serious Fraud Office (SFO) related to its civil aviation business and was in connection over use of third-party consultants. Airbus said it was cooperating with the on-going probe, which was launched last month, BBC reported. The firm, which competes with American rival Boeing, had said in April that the SFO and export credit agencies such as UK Export Finance, were informed about the irregularities detected by the aerospace company during an internal probe.  Why advertise with us?

Airbus is the world's leading aircraft manufacturer. The Airbus Group consists of three divisions: Airbus, Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus helicopters.

Europe's largest aerospace company said late on Sunday it had been notified that the UK's Serious Fraud Office had opened a formal criminal probe after being alerted by the country's export credit agency to discrepancies relating to the disclosure of the work of local agents. The probe raises a sensitive issue for the industry because the agency, UK Export Finance, has for years locked horns with aerospace firms about the need for more transparency, even though it does not object outright to the use of intermediaries. Airbus Group said the SFO was looking into possible "fraud, bribery and corruption" and that the company continued to co-operate with the investigating agency, having itself tipped off UKEF about internal findings under a recent compliance drive. "It will take years," a person familiar with the matter said of the SFO investigation, adding it was too early to predict any outcome or consequences. Airbus Group is already the subject of a four-year-old SFO investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia, while the SFO is conducting a corruption probe into engine maker Rolls-Royce which it launched in 2013. The latest case involves discrepancies over the amount of agents' fees disclosed in applications for export support, or missing names of third parties, in some cases dating back years, people familiar with the matter have said. In April, UKEF halted export funding pending a compliance review and was swiftly followed by France and Germany. Since 2006, companies applying for export support in Britain have had to identify any intermediaries involved in sales negotiations and list the sums paid. The rules followed a series of policy U-turns and a fierce debate between UKEF and aerospace companies including Airbus, which had lobbied against the tougher disclosure rules on the grounds that such data was commercially sensitive and that their own codes of conduct and due diligence methods were sufficient. Airbus Group shares fell as much as 1.8 percent on Monday, driven by concern over the probe. The longer-term impact may depend upon how widely the probe spreads and the level of managers who signed off on payments that can be worth millions of dollars, as well as the declarations to export agencies, analysts said. A spokesman declined to comment on any details of the investigation beyond Sunday's brief statement. FUNDING RACE In a separate process, Airbus is meanwhile trying to restore export funding from UKEF under a revised compliance scheme. The company said last month it had agreed a process for this and expected export credits to resume in the fourth quarter. But several people familiar with the case say it has deeply soured relations between Airbus and export agencies, notably UKEF, and that much work remains to be done to restore trust. Analysts say the operational impact of this funding gap is limited for now as there is little demand for export credit amid plentiful commercial liquidity. Just 5 percent of Airbus deliveries depended on such support last year. One person familiar with the case told Reuters the onus was on Airbus to prove it had a robust system for preventing abuse. One move being floated to win back confidence is a blanket voluntary ban within Airbus on the use of percentage commissions to third-party sales agents and more careful vetting of any other form of payment, people familiar with the matter said. The move is designed to allay concerns that payments in countries where it is common to have local representatives, which include parts of Asia and the Middle East, could be seen as a potential vehicle for bribery. But it could provide a headache for a company which has openly stated to UK authorities in the past that it relies on a long-established network of representatives to remain competitive, while some will argue that sales commissions are normal across many industries. It could also test often uneasy relations between Airbus and its parent group, whose boss Tom Enders launched the vigorous - some say abrasive - compliance drive under a new legal head. Currently, the playing field with Boeing is level as the corresponding system in the United States is also frozen due to political deadlock which has left the U.S. Export Import (EXIM) Bank without a fully functioning board. But with some U.S. officials predicting EXIM could resume funding for Boeing around the turn of the year, Airbus risks being disadvantaged in some key markets unless it achieves its target of regaining access to European credits by year-end. Although export credits technically only kick in when planes are delivered, aviation market sources say uncertainty over the future supply of credits can hinder efforts to win new orders. French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said export credits could be useful for finalizing a key order from Iran, which has been held up for regulatory reasons and due to funding uncertainties. But at this stage, the agents affair is likely to have an impact on Airbus's reputation rather than business, it said. Anti-corruption group Transparency International said the probe highlighted the need for openness on the use of agents.

Picture: Hannah McKay Chicago - Airbus Group SE said the UK Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to some of its third-party consultants. Read also: Airbus bags Asian deals The Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in a statement on Sunday that it’s co-operating with investigators probing its civil aviation business. Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing”. Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 percent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 percent from leasing companies and 40 percent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption. “This will have some negative impact,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “Third-party consultants or intermediaries have often caused worries. The business of aircraft sale is so intense and competitive that there are people trying many avenues.” Airbus said in the July 27 filing that it’s undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The European planemaker said it’s also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said.   * With assistance from Kyunghee Park BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

By Ananya Roy August 8, 2016 07:34 BST Close Embed Feed Barack Obama: Iran payment was not 'some nefarious deal' Reuters <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19778" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Iranian Airlines is planning to procure 20 Japanese aircraft, with a deal expected to be finalised in December when a delegation from Tokyo is scheduled to visit Tehran for the purpose. The jets will be acquired through a lease-purchase contract, an Iranian minister said. Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy minister for international affairs at the ministry of road and urban development, said the 100-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), manufactured by a unit of Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, will be purchased as part of the deal for Iranian domestic carrier Aseman Airlines. The minister said as the Iranian carrier operates in the domestic and provincial flight sector across the country, the MRJ remains a viable option, Iran's Mehr News Agency reported. He added that a second working group will pursue negotiations in Tehran in December. Iran has already signed a $27bn (21bn) draft agreement with Airbus for the purchase of 118 jets. These include 45 A320 single-aisle aircraft, 45 A330 wide-bodied aircraft, 16 A350 twin-aisle aircraft, and 12 A380 jets, the news agency reported. Iran is planning to buy 20 Mitsubishi Regional Jet aircraft from Japan to renew its ageing domestic airlinerReuters Kashan said the country was in talks with several aircraft manufacturers to strengthen its domestic fleets. Iran wants to buy small ATR aircraft in order to "activate and economise numerous small airports inside the country", the minister said. Reuters reported that Iran has signed draft deals with Boeing and Airbus worth around $50bn for the purchase of about 200 new aircraft. These deals have been possible because of the lifting of sanctions against Tehran following the nuclear agreement. ATR is a French-Italian aircraft manufacturer headquartered in France and is a subsidiary of the French Airbus Group. The company primarily manufactures the ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft.

The manufacturer of the A320 and A380 said the probe by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office is connected to the use of third-party consultants by its passenger aircraft business. Airbus said it discovered “misstatements and omissions” in information it provided about the consultants in applications for export financing for some of its customers. The company, which competes with Boeing around the world, announced in April it notified the Serious Fraud Office and export credit agencies about the irregularities it had found. It said Sunday it’s cooperating with the U.K. investigation. Export credit financing typically takes the form of loans and insurance provided to companies to help them cover the risks of selling products overseas. After Airbus reported the irregularities earlier this year, export credit agencies in Europe halted some of the financing to the company. The plane maker said last month it’s aiming to get the financing restored by the fourth quarter of this year. Airbus also said it’s carrying out a wide-ranging review of its relationships with third-party consultants.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 August 2016 ‘Pride of Africa’ tries to stop a long fall Kenya Airways planes are seen parked at the Jomo Kenyatta International airport near Kenyas capital Nairobi, April 28, 2016. Picture taken April 28, 2016. REUTERS Kenya Airways makes big loss but changes showing results NAIROBI: When Kenya Airways published the country’s worst-ever corporate results last month, the scale of the loss revealed the effects of several disastrous decisions that the national carrier is struggling to reverse. The airline’s “Pride of Africa” slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the 26.22-billion-shilling (US$259mil) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu.“In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss,” Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa’s tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it “hedges” its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency “and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this,” said Satchu about the airline’s latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways’ two biggest backers – Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government – the firm’s share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company’s debts exceed a billion dollars. Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up 5% and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year.“The operational result is what I’ll take from the latest results,” said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya’s Standard Investment Bank. “KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales,” he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London’s Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. “The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs,” he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. – AFP Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , kenya You May Be Interested Sime Darby closes on firm note but CIMB weighs on KLCI Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Northern Ireland, Wales face FIFA action over poppy displays M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Close share panel Image copyright Reuters Passengers who stopped to get their hand luggage put 300 lives at risk last week, after a fire broke out on an Emirates airliner in Dubai. Luckily, everyone escaped before the plane was consumed by flames - but it could have been different. What can be done to make people leave their bags behind? "Passengers are told not to waste time getting luggage, but they just don't listen," says fire safety expert Prof Ed Galea of London's Greenwich University. "This is not unusual, it happens in most cases. Often they don't appreciate the absolute urgency of their situation. They don't realise that every second can literally make the difference between life and death." Two incidents in the last year have given a clear illustration of the problem. Before the Dubai fire video came pictures of passengers leaving a burning BA aircraft in Las Vegas, many wheeling bags across the tarmac. But Galea suggested an answer to this problem more than 20 years ago - a central-locking system for overhead storage. "On approach to land, the overhead bins should be locked by the flight deck," he says. "Passengers would obviously be informed that they are locked and cannot be opened until the plane is at the gate. I think it would make a huge difference." It should not cause any inconvenience, Galea says. During the flight passengers would still have access to their bags, unless the "fasten seat-belt" light was switched on. His ideas have fallen on stony ground, however. Airlines think it would be unpopular with passengers, Galea says, and will not be "volunteering" to do it even now that the Dubai and Las Vegas incidents have underlined again the potential for loss of life. Las Vegas 9 September 2015 Media captionOne of the plane's engines caught fire during preparations for take off Dubai 3 August 2016 Media captionA video shared on WhatsApp shows the panic on board the Emirates plane While the video of the Dubai evacuation depicts a chaotic scene - some passengers screaming, a child pushing past adults to find her mother, men getting luggage from the overhead lockers and others people apparently trying to attach oxygen masks - passengers did not engage in a life-and-death struggle to reach the exits. But such struggles do take place. In one account of the fire on a British Airtours jet at Manchester airport in 1985, in which 55 people died, an air stewardess describes people who, in their competition to get out, had become wedged into a gap near one of the exits so tightly that none of them could move. In the aftermath of the disaster, Prof Helen Muir of Cranfield University attempted to simulate this panicked evacuation with volunteers. As it would have been unethical to make them fear for their lives she offered them money. All participants, many of them students, were paid £10 to take part in four evacuations over the course of a day, but there was an additional cash payment of £5 per evacuation to those in the first half of the group to leave the plane. This was sufficient to cause people to get wedged together in the over-wing exit on five occasions; on two other occasions the experiment had to be halted because a volunteer fell and could have been trampled underfoot. Aircraft exits were subsequently redesigned. In such a scenario, where passengers are panicking - possibly in the dark, and choking on smoke - a wheeled bag could become a serious hazard. Why bags are dangerous in an evacuation They "slow people down and clog the aisles and exit points", as the pilot and author Patrick Smith puts it On the evacuation slide, bags become "a deadly, high-speed projectile", he adds In a mad rush for the exit, bags could trip passengers up They could also puncture the evacuation slide and put it out of action On the Professional Pilots Rumour Network (PPRuNe) last week there was some surprise that there had been no casualties in Dubai, as well as admiration for the Emirates cabin crew that got all the passengers out safely, and indignation that some passengers had recklessly risked their lives and those of others. A handful of pilots commented that it was "time to introduce locking overhead bins". However, a roughly equal number said that if the bins were locked, passengers would waste even more time trying to force them open. An incident when a passenger tore off part of the ceiling of a Cathay Pacific Airbus in Hong Kong last month provides some support for this argument. Seated towards the rear of the plane, the man did not have an overhead locker above his seat, just a curved ceiling panel. Trying to "open" it, he pulled so hard that it came away. Image copyright Facebook/@Tofu.Diary Another expert who is sceptical about the idea of centrally locking overhead storage is Devin Liddell, principal brand strategist for Teague, a design and innovation consultancy that has designed the interiors of Boeing aircraft since 1946. His solution is quite different: "To have far fewer bags in the cabin in the first place." When Teague researchers recently studied the attitudes of passengers towards their luggage, they discovered that their main fear was finding no room for their bag in the overhead locker. That is why, Liddell notes, whenever any announcement is made about boarding - even if only to say that the first to board will be those with young children - everyone at the gate stands and starts inching forwards. However, on probing further, the researchers discovered that passengers would be happy to part with their bags if there was no fee for putting them in the hold, and if they could be sure they would not get lost in transit. Image copyright Alamy Image caption The overhead space on a Boeing 707 was often used for hats (as, perhaps, on this Qantas flight at Heathrow in 1959) For many, their ideal model, Liddell says, was one used by short-haul commuter flights in the US, where bags are placed in a cart close to the aircraft door, and picked up again near the same door on the way out. He envisages a system where bags would carry a radio frequency ID tag, and passengers would receive a text message when their bag was loaded on to the plane, They would also be able to text a number to check where their bag was if they were concerned it was not on board. Teague's studies also found that the additional time taken to board a plane and disembark when all passengers carry bags is usually greater than the amount of time spent retrieving luggage from a carousel - though Liddell also regards carousels as "dinosaurs", ripe for replacement by smarter systems. For this reason, when the company unveiled a concept airline called Poppi last year, it provided no more space for hand luggage than there was on the Boeing 707, the aircraft that ushered in the age of jet travel half a century ago. "When we looked at old photographs, the overhead space was occupied mainly by hats - hats, briefcases and jackets - so we nicknamed them 'fedora bins'," Liddell says. Image copyright Teague Image caption Poppi's "fedora bins" Image copyright Teague Image caption Poppi's aircraft would also have light coming through the fuselage roof The original thinking behind the minimalist lockers was that getting rid of heavy carry-on bags would enhance passenger comfort, though Liddell says the safety argument is also a powerful one. The response from passengers was "overwhelmingly positive", he adds. Whether airlines would ever warm to the idea, however, is uncertain. The fedora bins would be lighter and save on fuel, but airlines that charge for putting bags in the hold would lose a useful income stream if these fees were cancelled. Airline pilot and author Patrick Smith who writes the AskThePilot blog is unconvinced both about centrally locked overhead bins, and the idea of radically restricting carry-on baggage. "We are well past the point where the banning of hand luggage is a reasonable solution," he says. He does regard locked bins as "something to think about", though he notes that passengers might still grab any bags stored under the seat. His preferred solution would be to re-focus pre-flight safety briefings - which so many passengers currently ignore - and to firmly emphasise just four or five bullet points, including the importance of leaving all bags behind during an evacuation. While Devin Liddell does not see central locking of overhead bins as the best solution to the problem, he too does not rule it out. It would be a challenge getting across to passengers that there was no point trying to open the bins in an emergency, he says. On the other hand, he has a design idea that might help: "Redesign the bin so there is an LED light that glows fiery red when it's locked, and goes green when it's unlocked." Prof Ed Galea thinks regulators may one day come round to his lockable lockers idea, but does not see it happening soon: "The difficulty with international regulators is they move at a snail's pace. "Most international regulation is 'tombstone regulation' - lots of people have to be killed in an accident first." But the passengers who stop to retrieve bags in an emergency are a "disaster waiting to happen," he insists. And one that will inevitably result in fatalities, sooner or later. A debate on the Professional Pilots Rumour Network asdf1234: Time to introduce locking overhead bins. Only accessible when the the seatbelt sign has been turned off. Ranger One: Great idea - until someone's laptop lithium battery goes into runaway and the locking system fails in the "locked" mode. etrang: Locking overhead bins would only make the situation worse as pax [passengers] try and figure out why they won't open. There is a simple solution however, don't let pax take any luggage into the cabin in the first place. Fortissimo: Those with a brain leave their bags behind rather than risk their own and other people's lives while they delay the evac to collect things from the overheads, create trip hazards and hurl heavy bags down slides... Those with even larger brains keep items such as passports, phones and wallets about their person. armchairpilot94116: We need to look at reducing the ability to carry on baggage. Having smaller bins, not bigger... Many airlines are charging for checking in bags. This should be reverse. There should instead be charges for hand carry. DXBWannabe: Maybe instead of showing 4 different videos before T/O [takeoff] with info everyone already knows, the airlines should drill into people not to take their luggage with them during an evac.

(Screen grab via U.S. Navy video) Posted By: Brendan McGarry August 3, 2016 The first MV-22 Osprey with 3-D-printed parts recently took flight, the Navy announced. The aircraft made by Textron Inc.’s Bell Helicopter unit and aerospace giant Boeing Co. performed a hover during a July 29 demonstration at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland, the service said in a statement. The Osprey was equipped with a titanium link and fitting inside an engine nacelle, thus marking the “first successful flight demonstration of a flight critical aircraft component built using additive manufacturing techniques,” according to the Navy, which released video of the demonstration on YouTube. The historic test may pave the way for eventually helping to develop replacement parts in faster time and at less cost, officials have said. “That’s where the Rosetta Stone is going to be,” Rear Adm. (Sel.) Francis Morley, vice commander of Naval Air Systems Command, said earlier this year at the Navy League’s Sea Air Space conference outside Washington, D.C., according to a previous article on our Military.com sister blog DoDBuzz by my colleague, Hope Hodge Seck. “If we can start manufacturing flight-critical components, now you’re talking sustainment costs and speed and time; we have some really great opportunities to accelerate,” he added. While the Air Force and Marine Corps currently fly the Osprey, the Navy is working toward developing its own variant. The command in April awarded Bell-Boeing a $151 million contract to being working on the Navy-specific version, CMV-22B, which will be used to deliver gear and supplies to aircraft carriers. The service expects to receive its first Ospreys in 2020. –Hope Hodge Seck contributed to this report.

Spin Control: Figuring the governor’s primary, over the years Jim Camden Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Candidates and their campaigns are apt to get caught up in the excitement of election night and say things that, in the light of later days, don’t hold up well. As state primary returns were being reported Tuesday night, Republican Bill Bryant’s gubernatorial campaign came up with an interesting way to spin results that showed him 10 percentage points behind Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee. First, Inslee was under 50 percent, which the Bryant campaign declared a vote of “no confidence.” And if one combines “the two Republican Bills,” the campaign said, it was really a case of 42 percent to 48 percent. Huh? For those who have already forgotten, the long list of gubernatorial wannabes in the primary included Bill Hirt, another Republican. The retired Boeing engineer, who didn’t campaign much and apparently spent nothing but his filing fee, got just under 4 percent, which was good enough to finish third. Spin Control knows of no formula that allows one candidate to add on the votes of another with a shared party and first name. If we started doing that, where would we stop? Would we have to give Inslee the votes of the two Democrats whose names start with J? A slippery slope indeed. The suggestion that a showing under 50 percent in the primary spells trouble in the general election does not hold up under scrutiny, either. In 2008, incumbent Chris Gregoire got 48.3 percent of the vote compared to Dino Rossi’s 46.4 percent; Gregoire won the general. That’s the only top-two primary with an incumbent governor, and that’s not much of a pattern. But there are patterns in gubernatorial primaries over the last 60 years. Here’s a list with general-election winners in upper case; incumbents, when they run, marked with an asterisk; and the total number of candidates in the primary. See if any patterns pop out: 2012: INSLEE 47 percent, Rob McKenna 43 percent (9 candidates) 2008: GREGOIRE* 48.3 percent, Rossi 46.4 percent (10 candidates) 2004: GREGOIRE 38.7 percent, Rossi 34.1 percent (11 candidates) 2000: GARY LOCKE* 54.3 percent, John Carlson 34.5 percent (5 candidates) 1996: LOCKE 23.7 percent, Ellen Craswell 15.3 percent (15 candidate race) 1992: MIKE LOWRY 29.2 percent, Ken Eikenberry 22.4 percent (11 candidate race) 1988: BOOTH GARDNER* 57.6 percent, Bob Williams 20.1 percent (8 candidates) 1984: GARDNER 46.1 percent, John Spellman* 26.2 percent (8 candidates) 1980: Jim McDermott 33 percent, SPELLMAN 16.7 percent (14 candidates) 1976: DIXY LEE RAY 24.1 percent, Spellman 21.8 percent (9 candidates) 1972: Al Rosellini 30.3 percent, DAN EVANS* 24.7 percent (9 candidates) 1968: EVANS* 43.4 percent, John O’Connell 26 percent (8 candidates) 1964: EVANS 39.1 percent, Rosellini* 29.4 percent (8 candidates) 1960: Lloyd Andrews 37.4 percent, ROSELLINI* 34.7 percent (5 candidates) 1956: ROSELLINI 31.6 percent, Emmett Anderson 25.8 percent (10 candidates) The first thing you might notice is Washington rarely lacks candidates who think they should be governor. Before 2008, the state had a blanket primary, so the top Democrat and the top Republican advanced to the general election, regardless of how big their percentage. Minor-party candidates could qualify for the general election, too, if they got enough votes. The clearest pattern is that with few exceptions, the candidate with the most votes in the primary won the general election. And if the state had the top-two primary in 1980, Spellman wouldn’t have gone to the general because he actually finished third overall in the primary. Ray, the incumbent Democratic governor, finished second to McDermott, who was then a state senator. So she was out, Spellman was in, and he beat McDermott in the general. Incumbents rarely had more than 50 percent, and that wasn’t usually fatal. So the “top 50 percent in the primary” standard for an incumbent isn’t a prerequisite for eventual victory. If it were hard and fast, Bryant’s fellow Republican Chris Vance might as well fold his tent in the U.S. Senate race, where incumbent Patty Murray is at 53 percent. Donors sometimes use it when deciding whether to pour money into a race. But they also look at other things, such as how close the challenger is to the incumbent, which may be why the Bryant campaign was trying to close the gap to “striking distance” with the two Republican Bills equation.

Kenya Airways: 'Pride of Africa' tries to stop a long fall Africa Sunday 7 August 2016 - 9:54am File: Kenya's 'Pride of Africa' slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the R3.5bn loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Photo: AFP PHOTO/Tony KARUMBA NAIROBI - When Kenya Airways published the country's worst-ever corporate results last month, the scale of the loss revealed the effects of several disastrous decisions that the national carrier is struggling to reverse. The airline's "Pride of Africa" slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the $259-million (R3.5-billion) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. "In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss," Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa's tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it "hedges" its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. READ: Oil price drops as Iran declines output freeze Foreign currency "and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this," said Satchu about the airline's latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways' two biggest backers -- Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government -- the firm's share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company's debts exceed a billion dollars.  National pride at stake  Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up five percent and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year. "The operational result is what I'll take from the latest results," said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya's Standard Investment Bank. "KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales," he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London's Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. What is at stake is more than just cash. "It is a matter of national and geopolitical interest for Kenya to have a national carrier. You can't be the economic leader of the East African region if you don't have a national carrier," emphasised Satchu. "I wonder whether Kenya's shoulders are broad enough to rescue KQ again and again. Kenya is not a country like UAE or Qatar," which underwrite world-class airlines such as Qatar Airways, he added. Kenya Airways' pilots have had a particularly fraught relationship with management, which at one point suggested they could be lent on occasion to rapidly growing Ethiopian Airlines. READ : Kenya cancels flights as pilots go on strike Protests and strikes followed and the idea was abandoned, but the firm still has to deal with a bloated workforce left over from the disastrous expansion plan. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. "The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs," he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Author: John Noonan. John Noonan Security Date of Publication: 01.14.11. 01.14.11 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am In Nuclear Silos, Death Wears a Snuggie At a small United States Air Force installation in eastern Wyoming, I’m sitting at an electronic console, ready to unleash nuclear hell. In front of me is a strange amalgamation of ’60s-era flip switches and modern digital display screens. It’s the control console for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM. On an archaic display screen in the center of the console, three large letters blink in rapid succession. “EAM inbound,” says my deputy commander and the second member of the launch crew. An emergency-action message is on its way, maybe from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, maybe from the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, maybe even from the president. We both mechanically pull down our code books, thick binders swollen with pages of alpha-numeric sequences, and swiftly decipher the message. After nearly four years of pulling ICBM-alert duty, this process is instinctive. I deliberately recite the encrypted characters to ensure my deputy is on the same page, literally and figuratively, as six short characters can effectively communicate a wealth of information through the use of special decoding binders. “Charlie, Echo, Seven, Quebec, Golf, Bravo, six characters ending in Bravo.” My partner concurs, scribbling in his code book. “Crowd pleaser,” he adds without emotion, referring to a war plan that mandates immediate release of our entire flight of nuclear missiles, 10 in all. Of course, this is just a training scenario. The coded orders are a simulation. The console is a mockup of the real thing, stowed away in a larger hanger and serviced seven days a week by a small staff of Boeing contractors. If this were a real event, I’d be buried in a steel cocoon 100 feet underground. I’d have shed my standard-issue flight suit and boots. Instead, I’d be wearing sweats, fleece-lined slippers and, naturally, my indispensable, royal blue Snuggie. America and her nuclear warriors have an odd relationship. For decades, missileers (as we’re known in the military) have quietly performed their duties, custodians of a dying breed of weapon. But American citizens have no real connection with the shadowy operators who stand the old posts of the Cold War, despite the fact that they spend up to $8 billion a year to maintain our country’s nuclear deterrent. The truth is the job is an awesome responsibility, but it’s deeply weird. Back in the air-conditioned simulator, my deputy and I carefully, but quickly, walk through a precisely choreographed preparation sequence. Unlock codes provided by the president allow us to enable the missiles for launch, a function similar to the safety switch of a gun. At this moment, the safety is off. Several times during the process, we verify that the orders are authentic and formatted properly, and that they originate from the appropriate command authorities. Both of us keep a sharp eye out for a “termination message,” a quick stand-down notification that would cancel our attack orders. None comes. We finish our sequence in less than a minute, leaving 30 seconds to spare before initiating our practice launch. It feels like an eternity. My deputy stares at his keyboard, while my eyes are locked on a large red clock above our heads. The clock is set to Greenwich Mean Time (“Zulu time” in missile parlance), and is checked against the Navy’s atomic clock twice a day for accuracy down to the millisecond. At 10 seconds out, we place our hands on a series of launch switches. Contrary to popular myth, there is no red button. Four launch switches means it takes four hands to launch — it’s one of many safety mechanisms built into the system as a means of preventing unauthorized execution of missiles by a lone individual. At five seconds out, I start my countdown, commanding a final “3, 2, 1 — execute.” We turn our keys, and watch as the control screen flashes with missile-launch notifications. Some fly immediately, some with a delay to prevent nuclear fratricide when the bombs approach their targets in 20 to 30 minutes. The Ultimate Enemy: Boredom In four years on nuclear-alert duty, I ran through an infinite number of attack sequences and fought countless virtual nuclear wars. I knew how to target my missiles within minutes and launch them within seconds. The process was rigorous, thorough and fully governed by a checklist that was, to our knowledge, without defect. The room for human error was minimal. But that training was about as exciting as the job got, a blessing considering the mission. Being a missileer means that your worst enemy is boredom. No battlefield heroism, no medals to be won. The duty is seen today as a dull anachronism. Old hats, the squadron commanders who pulled nuclear alert during the sunset of the Cold War, spin tales of the good old days over sweaty mugs of beer at base officer clubs. The harsh mediocrity of missile duty is demanding enough to extract an emotional and physical toll, but cushy enough that missileers are too ashamed to acknowledge any misery. Missileers get warm sheets and hot food; Marines sleep in the mud. For the missileers of the 9/11 generation, relevancy — a dwindling commodity in a dwindling community — is a vicarious experience. During the Cold War, they had real-time intelligence briefings, screaming klaxons and a force three times larger than the current inventory. Today there’s Facebook and PowerPoint. The missile field is attached to Wyoming’s FE Warren Air Force Base, one of three such fields nationwide. It’s approximately the size of Rhode Island. When the deep silos for the ICBMs and underground alert facilities were dug in the 1960s, military planners spaced each site several miles apart as a survivability feature. The distance ensured a perverse tit-for-tat approach to nuclear game theory, born of the outdated mutually assured destruction epoch but sophisticated enough in its simplicity. An attack would require one nuke to kill one nuke. It meant a two-hour drive from base to the alert facility, a winding journey through America’s high plains. During a typical four-year tour, missileers spend more than a year separated from their families and work an average of 25 days a month on alert or in training. In the good old days, the oncoming alert force would show up at 0800 for a five-minute pre-deployment briefing. Thanks to Microsoft’s growing influence in the U.S. military, that five-minute weather and maintenance brief has ballooned into an hour-long PowerPoint extravaganza. “Alerts” are something of a misnomer, another cultural handle better suited the Cold War. Two officers seal themselves behind a 4-ton blast door, in a small capsule similar in size to an 18-wheeler’s freight rig, for a 24-hour period. Remaining alert is the real challenge. I’ve spent long, quiet hours with lights dimmed — reading, monitoring the status of the missiles, watching DVDs (Lost and Entourage were favorites), and fighting a growing sense of boredom, containment and isolation. My First Nuclear “Strike” One way to fend off those symptoms is humor. Early in my tour, I was startled out of the rack by a playful commander who had triggered the fire alarm, cut the lights and figured out how to make the capsule sway back and forth on the heavy chains that anchored it to the ceiling. My training told me that these conditions were indications of a nuclear strike. To my colleague’s eternal amusement, I sprinted around the capsule in a pair of polka-dotted boxer shorts trying to simultaneously restore command over the system and nurse the banged head that happened when I was jolted from a pleasant sleep. Though tedious, missile duty is not without perks. The uniform regulations are relaxed, though not by design. Once the blast door thuds shut and a crew is free from the prying eyes of the public or enlisted personnel topside, out come the pajamas and hooded sweatshirts. In a favorite missileer uniform patch (right), the Grim Reaper sits at an ICBM console, dressed in bunny slippers. In the real world, death wears a campus T-shirt, JCrew bottoms and the ubiquitous Snuggie. The silly blanket-robe hybrid is suited to the missile force, keeping an officer toasty while allowing him to interact with the weapons console unobstructed. Missileers learn that on alert, comfort is as important as humor. One enterprising fellow liked to string a hammock between the two command chairs and stretch out for his long shifts at the console. Videogame systems are forbidden, a rule that was mocked until it got out that wireless Nintendo Wii controllers could cause the system to detect a false electromagnetic pulse attack and shut down. I used to imagine that I’d have some sort of stiff-upper-lip moment should I receive “the order,” where I’d shed the Snuggie and slippers, zip up my flight suit, and make imperial references about “going out proper.” Though the USSR is gone, the assignment still has a kamikaze feel to it, left over from the Cold War, when a launch meant instant Soviet counter-battery fire. You resign yourself to the fact that you sit 100 feet underground while bombs that crater down to 200 feet are headed in your direction. It doesn’t make for much peace of mind. Isolation often gives way to reflection, and missile duty brings out strange conundrums. Missile training fosters an unquestioning, automation mentality. I was trained to be a cog in the machine: Orders were orders, and a lawful command from the president was not subject to debate or dissonance. Every missileer is carefully screened for mental aptitude and stability, yet they’re evaluated for their readiness to unleash hell. Though I never doubted that I would execute a launch order without question, other misgivings occasionally surfaced. We arrested a group of Catholic nuns staging a peaceful protest on one of our launch facilities a few years back. For a missileer who is a practicing Catholic, such a situation brings up questions: If women who have committed themselves to the Word of God feel so strongly about the immorality of nuclear weapons that they’re willing to be confined for their convictions, what kind of Christian am I to sit at the launch switch? How do you resolve a conflict between duty to your God and duty to your country? Who wins, faith or flag? That a capacity for great violence sustains great peace is one of the genuine paradoxes of our time, and I wrestled with that from time to time. The human factor is the system’s greatest vulnerability, something I unwittingly contributed to whenever I engaged in high-minded navel gazing. But these philosophical battles were not ours to fight — even in the quiet solitude of an archaic outpost, fighting yesterday’s war. John Noonan is a policy advisor and defense writer.

The airline’s “Pride of Africa” slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the 26.22-billion-shilling ($259-million) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. “In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss,” Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa’s tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it “hedges” its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency “and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this,” said Satchu about the airline’s latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways’ two biggest backers — Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government — the firm’s share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company’s debts exceed a billion dollars. – National pride at stake – Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up five percent and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year. “The operational result is what I’ll take from the latest results,” said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya’s Standard Investment Bank. “KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales,” he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London’s Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. What is at stake is more than just cash. “It is a matter of national and geopolitical interest for Kenya to have a national carrier. You can’t be the economic leader of the East African region if you don’t have a national carrier,” emphasised Satchu. “I wonder whether Kenya’s shoulders are broad enough to rescue KQ again and again. Kenya is not a country like UAE or Qatar,” which underwrite world-class airlines such as Qatar Airways, he added. Kenya Airways’ pilots have had a particularly fraught relationship with management, which at one point suggested they could be lent on occasion to rapidly growing Ethiopian Airlines. Protests and strikes followed and the idea was abandoned, but the firm still has to deal with a bloated workforce left over from the disastrous expansion plan. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. “The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs,” he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. -AFP dikeledi RELATED ARTICLES Africa Kenyatta and UN work for ‘people power’ Africa ‘Bye-Bye Kabila’ campaign launched in DR Congo Africa HIV-positive Malawi man jailed for two years over sex ritual NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Steve Moss (R-Cherokee) 1 of 2 i By Cassie Cope ccope@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story State Rep. Steve Moss, R-Cherokee, has come under criticism for a newly paved road that leads to his home. Cherokee County approved spending $51,714 to pave the road with money from the county’s transportation committee, according to acting county administrator Holland Belue. Moss said he went through the normal county process to get a road paved and “asked for no special favors.” “I made sure that I went by the book,” said Moss, adding he spent his own money to get the road up to standards for it to qualify for the county to take it over. The county took responsibility for the road in 2014, according to The Gaffney Ledger, an Upstate newspaper. Currently, three taxpayers own property along the road, Moss said. However, paving the road opens up the area for future development, he added. Moss said he will disclose the road paving on his state-required Statement of Economic Interest, where legislators disclose any gifts they receive and “any public improvements of more than $200.00 on or adjacent to (their) real property.” The money to pay for the road-paving project came from the Cherokee County transportation committee. Most county transportation committees are appointed by legislative delegations. But Cherokee County’s County Council also is that county’s transportation committee. Typically, county transportation committees get money from the state’s 16.75-cent-a-gallon gas tax, collecting 2.66 cents from every gallon sold. However, in the state’s 2015-16 budget, lawmakers approved sending $216 million in state money to county transportation committees to repair roads. In the 2016-17 budget that took effect July 1, those committees received an extra $50 million in state money. As a legislator, Moss votes on state spending – including sending state money to county transportation committees. But, Moss added, he is not a member of the House panel that writes the state budget. Moss is not the first legislator to be scrutinized in connection with state road spending. In 2015, the S.C. Transportation Infrastructure Bank, whose members include Senate President Pro Tempore Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, agreed to spend $340 million in state money to help pay for Florence County road projects. “We have a really chaotic system in South Carolina of jurisdiction over roads, and who’s responsible for building them and maintaining them,” said government watchdog John Crangle. It would be better if the state had one entity in charge of determining how road money is spent, Crangle said. “This has been the problem for a long time – the political determination of how road money is spent.” Dems take swipe at Mulvaney U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-Indian Land, predictably took heat from S.C. Democratic Coordinated Campaign last week. Campaign co-chair James Smith, a state representative from Richland County, criticized Mulvaney for, among other things, his votes in favor of “turning Social Security over to Wall Street” and against the Export-Import Bank, which finances and guarantees loans by foreign companies to buy U.S. goods, including made-in-North-Charleston Boeing jets. Fiscal hawks, including Mulvaney, contend the Ex-Im Bank is just another example of the government deciding economic winners and losers, adding big businesses like Boeing can afford to buy loan insurance in the private sector. “These may be Mick Mulvaney’s ‘principles,’ but to voters of the 5th District, they are nothing but a harmful extremist ideology,” Smith said, noting Boeing is a major S.C. employer. Of course, the Democratic state representative is backing Mulvaney’s Nov. 8 Democratic challenger, former Biden aide Fran Person. Buzz bites ▪  Columbia Attorney Butch Bowers is representing N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory in the legal battle over North Carolina’s controversial HB2 law, which bans transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice. It’s nothing new for Bowers, who has represented S.C. Republicans in their legal and ethics skirmishes, including Gov. Nikki Haley and Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster. ▪  The S.C. Democratic Party will hold its Jefferson-Jackson dinner Friday, Sept. 30, in Columbia. The annual fundraising dinner is named for two early leaders of the Democratic Party – former Presidents Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, and Andrew Jackson, author of the Trail of Tears. Both, as critics have noted, were slaveholders. Citing Jackson’s treatment of Native Americans, activists also have pressed Democratic parties in other states to drop his name from their annual fundraising dinners. That will be a tougher sell in South Carolina, which claims Jackson as a native son, a claim disputed by that other Carolina. ▪  Come Clinton or high water: The S.C.

A mirror inspection of the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018. Credit: NASA/David Higginbotham What's happening in our universe? In the 400 years since we first started using telescopes, we've been trying to answer this question. The past two decades alone have been dizzying: Planets found outside the solar system, a universe accelerating in its expansion, and hints of the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that make up most of the universe, to name a handful of historic discoveries. But to see further, we often need to spend big. RELATED: Covers Off! Say Hello to Our Future Mega-Space Telescope There's been much coverage of the more than $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope that will launch in 2018, to probe planetary atmospheres and to look back at the universe's beginnings. What will come next? Looking a bit ahead, the astronomy organization AURA suggests a "High Definition Space Telescope" to launch in 2035, an observatory double Webb's size. But how this would be paid for comes under scrutiny in a new report. Harvard astrophysicist Martin Elvis' new paper in Space Policy to try to solve what he calls the astronomy "funding wall." Our hunger for greater telescopes in X-ray emissions alone, he argues, has made the cost of this mission type increase 20 times in the past generation. (Yes, that's after adjusting for inflation.) Moreover, space missions often go over their budget before launch. "At some point the costs are more than a government can abide," he wrote. "Particle physics hit its funding wall in the U.S. when the Superconducting Super-Collider, already far along in construction in Texas, went over budget one too many times and was cancelled. Is astronomy next?" The Hubble Space Telescope is still operational after more than 25 years in space, but it won't last forever. The telescope was designed to be serviced by the now-defunct space shuttle program.Credit: NASA JWST may already be testing the limits, he added. Its cost growth led to repeated threats of cancellation, but the mission has been replanned to try to avoid this. Elvis said that NASA has a budget of just $5 billion per decade for large new space telescopes. "Each JWST-class mission thus takes 100% of nearly 20 years of this funding line," he said, pointing out the successor mission of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) could be similar in cost to JWST. What Can Giant Telescopes Teach Us About Our Universe? He also worries that focusing on a single, large telescope will make NASA's program lose its robustness. Right now we have three "Great Observatories" -- the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer space telescope, and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory -- operating in different wavelengths: visual, infrared and X-ray. We need to study the same object in different wavelengths to properly understand it. The youngest of these telescopes is 13 years old and will eventually fail during JWST's lifetime; JWST is most sensitive in infrared and follow-up observations in X-rays, Elvis argues, would need to wait. RELATED: Top 10 Astronomical Discoveries Of All Time But before worrying overmuch, Elvis proposes a solution: to depend more on the commercial space sector. Think about how much it has changed human spaceflight in the last decade. Now we have regular cargo runs to the International Space Station; in SpaceX's case, occasionally these missions have been able to land their rockets for future re-use. And very soon, SpaceX and Boeing will be sending astronauts aloft on their own spacecraft. What is the prospect for astronomy? NASA is trying to learn more about the universe to, in part, figure out the conditions for breeding life. At left is an artist's conception of Earth, compared with an artist's conception of the faraway Kepler-452b (a rocky planet bigger than Earth).Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle He argues that commercial spacecraft (which are more likely to see cost driven down by competition) would see quick advances in a few areas. Costs in launch, spacecraft and payloads would reduce, mainly because we are making a lot of advances today to reduce the mass hefted to orbit. In space, mass is one of the major costs. "Cutting spacecraft cost by a factor 2, along with launch costs by a factor 3, would roughly halve the cost of a flagship mission," he said. "This would radically alter flagship mission decisions, by doubling the number that could be launched each decade." RELATED: Can Future Telescopes See The Edge Of The Universe? Elvis also argues that as private tourists spend time in orbit, the demand would lower the cost for low-Earth orbit missions and provide more access for astronomers. How this would be done still needs to be worked out (the Bigelow module on the space station has no platform for telescopes, for example.) More locations could open up across the solar system with private lunar landers and asteroid prospectors, too.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Sunday it had opened a criminal probe into Airbus Group, investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. "These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the SFO said in a statement. The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. A spokesperson for the SFO said additional details of the probe would not be made public until charges were brought or the investigation is dropped. European planemaker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the U.K. Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany. The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a "severe blow to the European aircraft maker," which would be exploited by its U.S. rival Boeing. Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 percent in the first half of the year. Profits were up 1.76 billion euros, but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter program, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly 900 million. However these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros. Ahead of British voters' decision in June to leave the EU, Airbus said it would reconsider future investment in the country if the referendum took the U.K. out of Europe. "Airbus Group's success in the U.K. is predicated on a highly competitive, integrated European business model," executives said in a letter sent to employees in April.

The Huntington Beach teen just graduated from Marina High with the distinction of having attended every day of school since kindergarten. We sat down with this motivated young man to find out how he did it, and why. Q. Has it been difficult to go to school every single day since you started kindergarten? A. Yes, sometimes. Especially if I was feeling under the weather, extremely exhausted from an intense workout, or stayed up late studying and had very little sleep. I just got up early so that I wasn't rushing, drank lots of water because that makes your body function better, and ate a healthy breakfast even if I wasn't hungry. I would also bring some treats to school to keep my energy up. I was so proud when, on Honors Night, our school principal Dr. Marion started off by telling the audience about a special young man who had done something unusual and had never missed a day of school for 13 years. Many people in the audience started chanting my name and looking at me. I was told later that I received a standing ovation as I walked to the platform. Then, the principal mentioned that there was one student who had never missed a day of school during the graduation speech. I felt honored. Q. What did you say to yourself when you just didn't want to go to school? A. I motivated myself day by day. I just told myself it's another day, so time to get up. I am a self-starter, and knew that only I could motivate myself and accomplish this goal. No one very made me go to school. I've always loved school, and had many good teachers. I also like being able to see and hang out with my sports and ASB friends every day. I am a punctual person. I don't like waiting around when nothing is happening, or missing something if I had been late. My perfect attendance goal was initially the motivation I had from my two older sisters. They're both quite successful in reaching their goals. My oldest sister Stephanie had the same perfect attendance goal, and she lasted from kindergarten through 10th grade. My sister Jennifer had perfect attendance from kindergarten up to half of 11th grade. This made me want to try as well, but I wasn't quite sure I could do it. Q. What kept you busy at school and at home? A. My favorite subject was math, especially AP calculus. My least favorite subject was Spanish, though I enjoyed the teacher. I played sports at Marina, and was on varsity in basketball, volleyball, and track and field. I was also in ASB leadership as commissioner of technology, and campus clubs like the Surf Rider Foundation. I like things away from school, too, like watching the Space Channel with my dad occasionally, since he is a rocket scientist at the Boeing Corporation. I have a sweet tooth. I am always snacking, and I especially like dessert every night after dinner. It's kind of a joke in our family how mechanical I seem to be. I love to fix broken things, repair and build things at our house. I like spending time with my mom, Diane, dad, Jim, my two older sisters, our black lab, and four cats. Q. What's next for you? A. I'll be attending California State University Long Beach. I was accepted into their School of Engineering. I was accepted into quite a few other schools too, but after I researched their School of Engineering, I like that it is highly ranked, and many of the firms I would want to work for after graduation recruit from CSULB Engineering. It seemed like the best fit to stay local for a few years, and I've already been researching these company internship programs. I want to be an aerospace engineer or a civil engineer. Q. Away from school are you always on time? A. Yes, I am always on time even away from school. One of my freshman basketball coaches once told us when we made the team “if you are 15 minutes early, then you are on time, and if you arrive on time then you are late.” I found this kind of intimidating when I first heard it as a freshman, but later found it to be a good point. My grandpa used to always say “every day is a good day, and some days are even better.” I always try to live by that because he was always a happy, generous, and optimistic person. My mom told me he was the most punctual person she ever knew, and during his career he went over 25 years without missing a day of work. He lived a long life, making others feel special. I like that.

(KT File) Believe it or not, this high priced Dh25,690 ticket is not for a business or first class flight, but an economy class flight with Emirates Airline from Dubai International Airport to Rio De Janeiro in Brazil. The reason for this extraordinary fare are the 2016 Olympic Games currently underway in Rio. The 17-day sports event was declared open on August 5, 2016, and will run until August 21, 2016 in Rio De Janeiro. By comparison, an Emirates business class ticket during the August period for a flight from Dubai to New York on a Superjumbo A380, has a starting price from Dh16,830. Passengers to Rio De Janeiro will pay this high price only during the Olympic Games period, following which the price for an economy class ticket with Emirates Airline will go back to below Dh10,000 a few days after the Olympic Games ending. Emirates operates a daily flight to the second largest city of Brazil, and has assigned a Boeing 777 for the route. Globally Emirates Airline connect 154 destinations out of Dubai. The Dubai-based airline is the world's largest Boeing 777 operator, flying 156 out of over 1,400 Boeing 777s delivered. The world's largest twinjet has a typical seating capacity of 314 to 451 passengers with a range of 5,235 to 9,500 nautical miles. In addition the airline is also the largest customer of Airbus A380 superjumbo. - abdulbasit@khaleejtimes.com   Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Markets Saudis set to open market to foreigners Each foreign institutional investor will be allowed to own directly a ...

Showbiz Celebrity News Margot Robbie says Cara Delevingne ‘drunk texts’ Prince Harry Delevingne and Robbie are friends with the young royal Emma Powell Monday 8 August 2016 10:18 BST Best friends: Cara Delevingne and Margot Robbie Jonathan Leibson/Getty Margot Robbie has revealed her Suicide Squad co-star Cara Delevingne sends texts to Prince Harry when she is drunk. Robbie let slip about the messages as she opened up about her friendship with the model-turned-actress. “We just talk about regular girl stuff,” she told the Daily Star. “She is like, ‘I’ve had sex on a plane,’ and I’ll be like, ‘Yeah, but I’ve had it on a jet ski’. “And she will then blow me out of the water and tell me she ‘drunk texts’ Prince Harry. So I’m just like, ‘Okay, you win’.” Read more 8 reasons why we want to be best friends with Margot Robbie Robbie recently opened up about her own texting sessions with the young royal. The Australian actress said she receives messages from the fifth in line to the throne but often leaves him “hanging” for weeks. Robbie – who met the Prince through Delevingne – told E! News: "He's pretty quick on text actually. "Unlike me—I write back four days later, weeks later sometimes." Robbie also opened up about playing the psychotic Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad and said she was scared of being unable to fit into the hotpants and fishnet tights.

By: Reuters | Beirut | Published:August 8, 2016 12:59 pm (Source: Reuters/File)Iran has made clear it is widening its search to include other suppliers. Iran intends to purchase 20 regional jets from a unit of Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , according to Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy minister for international affairs at the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development. The Mehr News agency quoted Fakhrieh Kashan on Sunday as saying that the deal was likely to be finalised when a Japanese delegation visits Tehran in December. The aircraft will be acquired through a lease-purchase contract and will be used by Aseman Airlines on domestic routes, Fakhrieh Khashan said. The lifting of long-standing economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities has allowed it to strike provisional deals worth around $50 billion with Boeing and Airbus to buy some 200 airliners to renew its ageing fleet. However, financial and political obstacles have continued to dog the deals, and Iran has made clear it is widening its search to include other suppliers. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet, Japan’s first commercial airplane in half a century, will seat just under 100 people and is being developed by Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, which is majority owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. A spokesperson for the SFO said additional details of the probe would not be made public until charges were brought or the investigation is dropped. European planemaker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators. “Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the company said in a statement. “Airbus Group continues to cooperate with the SFO,” the statement concluded. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP. “We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities. “This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption (policy). Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in cooperation with the authorities,” spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the UK Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany. The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a “severe blow to the European aircraft maker” which would be exploited by its US rival Boeing. Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 per cent in the first half of the year. Profits were up 1.76 billion euros (USD 1.94 billion), but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter programme, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totalled nearly 900 million. However, these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros.UK—AIRBUS Britain launches fraud probe into Airbus London, Aug 8 (AFP) Britain’s Serious Fraud Office has said on it had opened a criminal probe into Airbus Group, investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. “These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the SFO said in a statement yesterday.

The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a “severe blow to the European aircraft maker” which would be exploited by its US rival Boeing. Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 per cent in the first half of the year. Profits were up 1.76 billion euros (USD 1.94 billion), but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter programme, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly 900 million. However these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros.

"We have held negotiations with Japan to purchase MRJ (Mitsubishi Regional Jet passenger) planes from Mitsubishi," Fakhriyeh Kashan said on Sunday. He explained that the MRJ planes are small aircraft with the capacity of carrying maximum 100 people which is a good choice for Iran's Aseman airlines whose flights are mostly domestic. Fakhriyeh Kashan also referred to negotiations with the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR on buying small planes, and said Iran needs more than 20 small planes. Japan's Mitsubishi passenger plane manufacturing company is preparing to start rivalry with giant aviation firms like Boeing and Airbus in Iran's aviation and air transport market. The company, the aviation arm of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - has been negotiating over jet sales with Iran’s flag carrier Iran Air and Iran Aseman Airlines, as Iran Air is weighing the Japanese offer to purchase of 80 70-seat Mitsubishi Regional Jets for domestic routes. Executives from both sides also discussed a possible deal in early June during the International Air Transport Association conference in Dublin. Late in July, Tehran and Tokyo signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to further broaden mutual cooperation in the field of transportation. The MoU was signed in a ceremony in Tokyo by Fakhriyeh Kashan and his Japanese counterpart Hiroshi Tabata. The MoU was the outcome of the first Iran-Japan joint commission on infrastructure and transport. Tabata welcomed implementation of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and underlined the important role of infrastructures for Iran-Japan cooperation in future.         Related News Iran, Japan Ink MoU on Inspectorate Cooperation  Japan's Mitsubishi Emerging as New Rival for Boeing, Airbus in Iran's Aviation Industry  LATEST STORIES (80) ISIL War: In a Time of Universal Deceit, Telling the Truth Is a Revolutionary Act Iran, Azerbaijan Discuss Defense Ties Iran, Indonesia Stress Boosting Cooperation on Human Rights Iran Calls for Collective Efforts to Fight Terrorism UNHCR Official: Iran's Supports for Refugees "Unmatched" US Gives Green Light to Airbus on Sale of over 100 Passenger Planes to Iran Rouhani Felicitates Lebanon on Independence Day Iran, UNIDO Ink Country Program Framework Syrian Commander: Popular Uprising against Terrorists Starts in Eastern Aleppo Battle for Mosul Day 37: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Completes Siege of Tal Afar Israel 'Revives' Eastern Jerusalem Settler Homes Plan Hashd Al-Shaabi Wins Back Several More Villages Near Mosul Libyan Forces Press Forward Against ISIL in Sirte Iranian Speaker: Establishment of Democracy Impossible by Supporting Terrorism in Syria Envoy: Damascus against Proposals to Create Autonomous Areas in Syria ISIL War: In a Time of Universal Deceit, Telling the Truth Is a Revolutionary Act TEHRAN (FNA)- There is no moral difference between a US Stealth bomber and an ISIL suicide bomber.

By Rachel Middleton August 8, 2016 02:56 BST Airbus has come under scrutiny by the UK Serious Fraud Office.Reuters The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a criminal investigation into Airbus Group, looking into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. The SFO said it had originally opened the investigation in July and has asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. "These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants," said the SFO said in a statement. However, a spokesperson said that additional details of the probe will not be made public until charges are brought or the investigation is dropped, AFP reports. Airbus said that it was aware of the investigations being launched and that it was working with investigators. "Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the company said in a statement. "Airbus continues to cooperate with the SFO, " the European plane manufacturer added. A company spokesman told AFP that the company was informed on Friday 5 August that the SFO had launched an investigation. "We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities." "This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption [policy]. Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in cooperation with the authorities," company spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus had revealed in April that that it was in discussions with the SFO after having admitted it had failed to notify the authorities on the use of third-party agents in deals which it was asking for UK government to cover with financing guarantees. On Sunday (7 August), The Financial Times said the UK's export credit agency and its counterparts in France and Germany had suspended financing following the disclosure by the company. At the end of July, the company said it had agreed to a deal with the UK export credit agency to resume financing by the end of the year. A spokesman for UK Export Finance said: "UKEF continues to work closely with Airbus and French and German export credit agencies to understand the extent of the matter and to seek assurances about its current compliance practices in relation to overseas agents." It added that it would closely follow other UK government agencies' investigations and "respond accordingly." The Financial Times also noted that the launch of a formal criminal investigation is a severe blow to Airbus, which it says could last several years. It is also likely to be exploited by the company's main rival, Boeing, the newspaper also claimed in its report. In addition, France and Germany and possibly other countries could also launch their own inquiries into Airbus's use of agents. Use of third-party agents The use of third-party intermediaries has been the target of anti-bribery regulators while several companies have cut back on the use of agents to clinch orders. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK's Bribery Act require high levels of risk-based due diligence when intermediaries are used to carry out business on behalf of a company, the FT said. Failure to do so will reportedly result in heavy penalties being imposed. The newspaper said that senior aerospace officials have however acknowledged that it is difficult in some countries to carry out business activities without these intermediaries.

The Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in a statement Sunday that it’s cooperating with investigators probing its civil aviation business.  Airbus had flagged to UK regulators and the European Export Credit Agencies earlier this year “misstatements and omissions” involving the outside contractors in some export financing applications, which it found through an internal probe. The credit agencies, including UK Export Finance, have suspended some of the backstop financing that Airbus uses to help sell commercial aircraft since the first revelations made four months ago. Airbus said in a July 27 statement that a process for re-establishing export credit “has been agreed and is ongoing.” Until the financing is restored, Airbus and rival Boeing Co. face the challenge of navigating an uncertain market with limited government assistance. Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to tap trade financing because a congressional impasse has left the US Export-Import bank with too few directors to approve deals. Jefferies Equity Research estimates that export-credit agencies last year provided 7 per cent of financing for Airbus plane deliveries, compared with 45 per cent from leasing companies and 40 per cent from airlines themselves. The Airbus investigation adds to the scrutiny of the role played by cross-border intermediaries. Monaco-based Unaoil SAM, which served as a go-between for companies and officials in the Middle East, Africa and former Soviet countries, was searched by authorities earlier this year amid allegations of corruption. Airbus said in the July 27 filing that it’s undertaking a sweeping review involving “legal, investigative, and forensic accounting” of consultants and other third parties used to support sales. The European planemaker said it’s also using greater due diligence to screen potential contractors. “The group cannot exclude that the comprehensive review and these enhancements of its controls and practices lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences in the future,” the filing said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

European plane-maker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators. “Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the company said in a statement. “Airbus Group continues to cooperate with the SFO,” the statement concluded. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP. “We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities. “This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption (policy). Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in cooperation with the authorities,” spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the UK Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany. The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a “severe blow to the European aircraft maker,” which would be exploited by its U.S. rival, Boeing. Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 percent in the first half of the year. Profits were up €1.76 billion ($1.94 billion), but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over €1 billion related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter program, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly €900 million. However, these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly €1.9 billion. Ahead of British voters’ decision in June to leave the EU, Airbus said it would reconsider future investment in the country if the referendum took the U.K. out of Europe. “Airbus Group’s success in the U.K. is predicated on a highly competitive, integrated European business model,” executives said in a letter sent to employees in April.

NAIROBI: When Kenya Airways published the country's worst-ever corporate results last month, the scale of the loss revealed the effects of several disastrous decisions that the national carrier is struggling to reverse. The airline's "Pride of Africa" slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the $259-million loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. "In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss, " Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa's tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it "hedges" its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency "and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this," said Satchu about the airline's latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways' two biggest backers -- Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government - the firm's share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company's debts exceed a billion dollars.

Credit Greg Kahn for The New York Times How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America’s Influence Think tanks are seen as independent, but their scholars often push donors’ agendas, amplifying a culture of corporate influence in Washington. By ERIC LIPTON and BROOKE WILLIAMSAUG. 7, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — As Lennar Corporation, one of the nation’s largest home builders, pushed ahead with an $8 billion plan to revitalize a barren swath of San Francisco, it found a trusted voice to vouch for its work: the Brookings Institution, the most prestigious think tank in the world. “This can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,” Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar’s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco’s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake, and later offered to help Lennar, a publicly traded company, “engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar’s innovative approach.” And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “He would be a trusted adviser,” an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar. Photo Kofi Bonner, then a regional vice president for Lennar Corporation, at Hunters Point in San Francisco in 2008. The Brookings Institution named him a senior fellow in 2014. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Think tanks, which position themselves as “universities without students,” have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; K.K.R., the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. Video ‘This Is Thinly Disguised Lobbying’ Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, explains how some think tanks engage in “thinly disguised lobbying” to influence lawmakers. By A.J. CHAVAR and ERIC LIPTON on Publish Date August 7, 2016. . Watch in Times Video » embed “This is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Washington has seen a proliferation of think tanks, particularly small institutions with narrow interests tied to specific industries. At the same time, the brand names of the field have experienced explosive growth. Brookings’s annual budget has doubled in the last decade, to $100 million. The American Enterprise Institute is spending at least $80 million on a new headquarters in Washington, not far from where the Center for Strategic and International Studies built a $100 million office tower. The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media. “Wouldn’t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, ‘Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,’” Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. “We do not compromise our integrity,” said Martin S. Indyk, Brookings’s executive vice president. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the “appearance of a conflict of interest.” And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions. At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like “Five Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America” or “India at the Global High Table,” have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. When think tank scholars testify before Congress or speak at other public events, the public is often not aware of the financial relationships between these scholars and for-profit companies. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting and The New York Times looked at some of these conflicts. Video by The Eye, from NECIR The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. “People think of think tanks as do-gooders, uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,” said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. “But it’s absurd to suggest that donors don’t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it.” A group of Democratic state attorneys general is investigating whether Exxon Mobil worked with certain think tanks in past decades to cover up its understanding of fossil fuels’ impact on climate change, in part by financing reports questioning the science, a suggestion the company rejects. OPEN Document Document: Brookings Institution and Its Corporate Donors Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars’ independent conclusions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We strongly believe in our model of seeking solutions to some of our country’s most difficult problems,” John J. Hamre, the chief executive at C.S.I.S., said in a written reply to questions. “We gather stakeholders, vet ideas, find areas of agreement and highlight areas of disagreement.” Yet researchers at think tanks are seeing corporate influence firsthand. Rachel Stohl, a senior associate at the Stimson Center in Washington, said she had been quizzed by potential donors as she tried to raise money for research on the military’s use of armed drones. “‘Are you going to say drones are bad?’” she recalled one potential financial backer asking. “‘We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.’” Donations and Rewards The confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer. The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings’s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions. Photo The Brookings Institution, which operates on a $100 million annual budget, twice what it was a decade ago. Credit Greg Kahn for The New York Times The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs — both critical parts of its business — and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries. In 2004, Brookings established its Metropolitan Policy Program, devised to stimulate economic growth in cities. As the country was emerging from recession, Brookings bolstered its ties to corporate donors in 2010 by naming Marek Gootman, a lobbyist from Patton Boggs, as its first director of strategic partnerships. He was assigned to work with “a national network of elected, business and civic leaders engaged in city and metropolitan area policy development and implementation.” From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings’s overall program spending that year. K.K.R., after starting special funds around 2010 to invest in real estate and other infrastructure projects, donated $450,000 to Brookings, some of it as the institution agreed to set up meetings for a top K.K.R. executive with community leaders in Philadelphia and Detroit, where the company was considering real estate projects. Brookings separately produced a report, published on K.K.R.’s website, promoting one of the company’s infrastructure projects in New Jersey, after the company executive suggested such a piece. In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: “K.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.” The tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between “unrestricted” donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in. Photo Marek Gootman, center, with Gina Luna, a JPMorgan Chase executive, in April. Formerly a lobbyist at Patton Boggs, Mr. Gootman was appointed in 2010 as Brookings’s first director of strategic partnerships. Credit Erin Hull for The New York Times Lennar joined Brookings’s Metropolitan Leadership Council, established for the program’s top donors, in July 2010. That month, the company won approval to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco, turning the area into a more than 700-acre mix of housing, education and commercial development. Brookings would later name the project one of the three most “transformative investments in the United States.” The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard. Lennar joined with Brookings as protests were escalating in 2010. One complaint, filed by area residents with the Environmental Protection Agency, said the San Francisco Health Department was “conspiring with Lennar Corporation to conceal the health threats of asbestos-laden dust.” The company was busy at the time looking for investors to help it complete the project, known as the San Francisco Shipyard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest — and said the alliance was not related to the protests. “There was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to ‘buy’ from Brookings,” Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project. “San Francisco’s Shipyard project is both physically and economically transformative for the Bay Area and globally significant,” Mr. Katz, the Brookings vice president, said in a news release issued by San Francisco’s mayor in 2011 as Lennar’s hunt for major investors intensified. “This project promises to set a new paradigm for successfully conceiving, financing and delivering transformative infrastructure projects in the United States.” Follow-up memos were more explicit: Brookings, as it sought an additional $50,000 from Lennar in 2014, said it was prepared to “use our convening power, research expertise, network connections and knowledge of innovative practices to help further drive the ultimate impact and success” of Lennar’s project and to “provide public validation of San Francisco’s efforts through national and local media coverage.” The think tank soon delivered. Photo In a July 2014 document, Brookings sought more money from Lennar while offering to help with its San Francisco project. Mr. Katz made appearances alongside Mr. Bonner, the Lennar executive, to promote the project to government officials and business leaders in California. In 2014, around the time the think tank sought an additional round of money from Lennar, Brookings invited its new nonresident senior fellow, Mr. Bonner, who has a master’s degree in architecture and is a former government planner for several California cities, to appear at an event at its headquarters. “I am working in San Francisco in a fabulous property,” Mr. Bonner said at the event, referring to Lennar’s Shipyard project. In March, at a conference of real estate developers and investors in Cannes, France, Lennar sponsored a session in which Brookings researchers helped the company highlight the Shipyard. “Kofi is what I would describe as the quintessential city builder,” Julie Wagner, a Brookings nonresident senior fellow, said as she introduced Mr. Bonner at an event where projects with no connection to donors were also featured. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At least some of the $400,000 Lennar has donated to Brookings since 2010 has come from its SunStreet Energy division, which sells rooftop solar systems, at the same time that Brookings’s metropolitan program has published research on the rooftop solar industry. Mr. Indyk said the collaboration simply reflected shared goals of revitalizing cities. Brookings scholars promoted other real estate projects, he said, involving local governments, universities or even developers that were not donors — including one in Detroit backed by Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, and one in Seattle backed by Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had “created the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.” His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed. Photo Martin S. Indyk, the Brookings Institution’s executive vice president, said the think tank’s collaboration with Lennar to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco reflected a shared goal to revitalize cities. “We do not compromise our integrity,” he said. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Hitachi has been another large donor to the metropolitan program, giving a total of $1.8 million to Brookings over the last decade, according to Brookings documents. The think tank reviewed the company’s corporate marketing and sales strategy targeting the United States, an internal memo shows. Brookings also organized public events that featured top Obama administration officials and allowed Hitachi executives to promote their products. “Metro has held nine meetings and several conference calls in the past six months with executives from Hitachi’s water, transportation and data business lines and are collaborating more fully on defining what it means to be a ‘Smart City,’” a confidential Brookings memo said. Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company’s position. “Helping a corporation’s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,” Ms. Churches, the managing director, said. Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was “inelegant,” although not improper. When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, “It could be misconstrued.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that “today, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.” ‘Growing the Economy’ When JPMorgan offered a major donation to the metropolitan program in 2011, Brookings created the Global Cities Initiative, complete with a new logo that called it a “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase.” The project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times In contract documents, Brookings emphasized that it would control the conclusions of its reports and said it would “not directly or indirectly communicate with any party” to help get JPMorgan business. Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda. “This was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,” said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. “We believe it’s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.” At the same time, hundreds of pages of memos — status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money — make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” said one Brookings document dated July 2011, as officials from the think tank met with top bank executives to discuss a planned donation that eventually totaled $15 million. The Global Cities Initiative, another document written by a Brookings senior fellow explained, “must mean a marriage between JPMC corporate interests” and “Brookings continued thought leadership.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story JPMorgan, in a document dated a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to Brookings “deepens/extends relationships with important client base among business and civic leaders both in the U.S. and abroad.” And Brookings was ready to do its part. “Our events, which in part target these audiences,” said an internal 2014 Brookings memo, referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders, “have yielded 100+ media hits, with 97% of them referencing GCI and 90% referencing JPMorgan; by the end of this year, we will have held events in 13 domestic markets and 9 international markets.” At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank. Photo One of hundreds of documents detailing confidential discussions between Brookings and JPMorgan in 2011 as the parties were negotiating a $10 million gift for the Global Cities Initiative. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank’s executives. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” It remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank’s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal. “If the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it’s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,” Mr. Scher said in a statement. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law — Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New York-based firm — said Brookings’s agreements raised questions. “Tax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,” Ms. Fleischer said. “And the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said that opinion was “totally unfounded,” noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems. “Brookings’s conclusion that all of these activities it engaged in with these donors primarily benefited the public rather than the donors is consistent with the applicable federal tax standards,” Douglas Varley, one of the lawyers for Brookings, said in a statement. Close Partnerships Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas. FedEx teamed up with the Atlantic Council — a think tank that focuses on international relations, with annual revenue that has surged to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade — to build support for a free-trade agreement the company hoped would increase business. OPEN Document Document: Atlantic Council and Corporate Donors Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool. “The impact and reach of the report would be maximized by a rollout event” including a “public report launch with member(s) of Congress from one of the relevant committees,” said a two-page summary drafted by the Atlantic Council months before the study was completed. FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to “emphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.” When the report came out in late 2014, its conclusions mirrored arguments FedEx had been aggressively pushing on Capitol Hill, including recommending a reduction in trans-Atlantic tariffs and allowing more duty-free shipments. An executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is very exciting,” Mr. Subramaniam said at the event, referring to the potential for more trade. “The upside opportunity is quite large.” Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research. Photo A 2013 Atlantic Council brochure detailed the benefits of membership in the think tank’s corporate program. “There is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,” Mr. Kempe said. ‘We Do Not Lobby’ General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition. “When the budgets are going down in the U.S., you would like to be able to export more,” Frank Pace, the president of the company’s aircraft systems group, told a Reuters reporter in late 2013 at an air show in Dubai. At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports. While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics’s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small — in the tens of thousands of dollars. C.S.I.S. set up confidential meetings at its headquarters with company representatives, inviting top officials from the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the State Department and the office of the defense secretary, according to emails and other documents obtained by The Times through open records requests. OPEN Document Document: C.S.I.S. and the Military Drone Maker “Our series will be unique in convening a much broader group of stakeholders than is typical,” Samuel J. Brannen, the think tank’s lead scholar, wrote in an email to Aaron W. Jost, one of the State Department officials in charge of regulating drone exports. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. “Political obstacles to export,” read the agenda of one closed-door “working group” meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics’s Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry’s priorities. “I came out strongly in support of export,” Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying. “C.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,” Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. “We do not lobby.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story One thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics. Photo A Predator drone manufactured by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. General Atomics helped fund a study that led the United States to ease restrictions on sales of drones to governments overseas. Credit Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times In February 2015, almost one year after the C.S.I.S. report was issued, the State Department announced a clarification of its rules, easing final approval that month for General Atomics’s long-planned sale of unarmed Predator drones to the United Arab Emirates, the first such sale to a non-NATO nation. The think tank report was just one of many voices pushing for the change. A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, “at the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.” Huntington Ingalls Industries had an equally clear objective: to create an elaborate public relations and lobbying campaign to convince Congress that the nation needed to confront an emerging threat from China by building more nuclear-powered aircraft carriers — at a cost of about $11 billion each. The clear beneficiary? Huntington, the lone builder of the ships. As part of a broader communications effort, Huntington helped finance a think tank report that enhanced the company’s argument for more funding. Bryan McGrath, a former naval officer who had commanded a guided-missile destroyer, approached Huntington Ingalls and offered to write a study on a fee-for-service basis as a private industry expert. The company turned down his offer. Later, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested. “A think tank has more prestige,” Mr. McGrath said. Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research. Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion. “The Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,” he said. “If a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story In exchange for Huntington Ingalls’s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said. OPEN Document Document: The Aircraft Carrier Industry’s Lobbying and Think Tank Plan “We have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,” Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company’s suggestions. The report was released in October at the Rayburn House Office Building. Mr. McGrath received an introduction from one of the industry’s most important boosters, Representative J. Randy Forbes, Republican of Virginia, the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees the Navy. The report did not mention that Huntington Ingalls had helped pay for it. Asked about the failure to disclose the contribution, John P. Walters, Hudson’s chief operating officer, called it a mistake. The report was subsequently revised — months after it was released and the congressional event held — to disclose the donation. A second industry-funded report, prepared by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, came out a month later with a similar urgent call for more money to build more ships and to base more ships abroad, although it did not mention that it had been funded by the Navy League of the United States, a nonprofit group whose large corporate donors include Huntington Ingalls. “This report is yet another important tool for Navy Leaguers to use in the field when educating local leaders and lawmakers,” Skip Witunski, the Navy League president, wrote to the group’s members late last year. The strategy — lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other — was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces. Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process. “I see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,” Mr. McGrath said, “and I got to scratch my head and say, ‘That guy must be on the payroll.’” Brooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

Hot Topics: U.S. Presidential Election News Local Heroes Where We Live My Classic Car The Alphabet Print   Email   Font Resize Amazon unveils cargo plane as it expands delivery network Sentinel & Enterprise Updated:   08/06/2016 11:42:22 PM EDT Associated Press SEATTLE -- Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015. By way of comparison, in the 2016 fiscal year FedEx delivered about 3 billion packages for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who received their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon revealed its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane buzzed over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels took to the skies. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc. Advertisement , which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."

Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. TEA GRAPHIC | NATION MEDIA GROUP   ALLAN OLINGO Sunday, August 7   2016 at  12:09 comment Airlines in the East African region are sprucing up their fleets with new aeroplanes. Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. Tanzania plans to have its Air Tanzania Company Ltd (ATCL) return to its regional routes. “The government is working on a strategic three-year plan that will see the airline’s fleet revamped. If the discussions come to fruition, Air Tanzania will get two more aircraft from Bombardier in the coming year,” a senior aviation official in Tanzania’s Transport Ministry said. Air Tanzania is majority-owned by the state, but has only one Bombardier Dash 8 and a leased Canadair CRJ 100s, which operates between Dar es Salaam and the Comoros islands, with local routes to Mwanza, Kigoma and Mtwara. Last week, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft announced that Tanzania had signed a $62 million purchase agreement for two Q400 turboprop airliners. Leonard Chamuriho, Permanent Secretary at Tanzania’s Ministry of Transport, Works and Communication, said the Q400 aircraft will provide affordable, convenient and comfortable air transport. “We are committed to providing good service as our business grows to include new destinations in Tanzania and Africa,” Dr Chamuriho said. The aircraft were reportedly purchased after a $20 million loan was processed through the TIB Development Bank. This publicationunderstands that ATCL has been audited to ensure the company is financially sound. The airline is said to generate $2.8 million monthly, but has been saddled with debts. Last month, Ethiopian Airlines became the first African airline to take delivery of the Airbus A350, in a $2 billion deal that included smaller aircraft. The aeroplane flies on the Addis Ababa to Lagos route, and has also served the Kigali and Entebbe routes; the route is also served by Kenya Airways and RwandAir. Tewolde Gebremariam, group chief executive officer of Ethiopian, said the aircraft had been purchased to stay competitive in the region. “We are taking an aircraft that has cutting edge technology and will be 25 per cent more fuel efficient. We will save on costs while providing comfort,” he said. Aeroplane delivery RwandAir is expecting two Airbus aeroplanes and a Boeing between September and November. The airline is expecting the delivery of its first 244-seat Airbus A330-200 in September, followed by a Boeing B737-800 in October, and a second 274-seat Airbus A330-300 in November. In May 2017, the airline will receive its fourth Boeing B737-800. RwandAir will ply the Johannesburg, Entebbe, Dar es Salaam, Lagos and Accra routes. The aeroplanes will also operate on the long haul routes to Europe and Asia. The airlines’ most lucrative routes are Kigali to Entebbe, Juba, and Nairobi.

 Chief Air Force scientist: Tomorrow's drones will be faster, stealthier, and more deadly Kris Osborn, Scout Warrior Aug. 8, 2016, 1:56 PM 1,543 facebook linkedin twitter email print Northrop Grumman/EADS Euro Hawk rollout on October 8, 2009 at Palmdale, CA, USA. Northrop Grumman The drones of tomorrow will be stealthier, faster, more computerized, equipped for electronic warfare, more lethal, more autonomous and, in some cases, able to deploy as swarming groups of mini-drones, according to the Air Force’s Chief Scientist. “The ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) side will get a lot smarter. With the next generation, you will see UAVs that are faster, more maneuverable and maybe stealthy. You will see them accompanying fighters with extra weapons, EW (electronic warfare), countermeasures and even lasers on board,” Air Force Chief Scientist Greg Zacharias told Scout Warrior in an interview. Some of these anticipated developments were forecasted in a 2014 Air Force report called RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) Vector designed to anticipate and prepare for future drone developments over the coming 25 years. However, the rapid pace of technological change has sped up and, to some extent, changed the timeline and mission scope for drones outlined in the report.  Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy The processing speeds of computers and algorithms aimed at increasing autonomous activities have continued to evolve at an alarming rate, creating a fast-moving circumstance wherein drones will increasingly take on more and more functions by themselves, Zacharias explained. Computer algorithms will enable drones to conduct a much wider range of functions without needing human intervention, such as sensing, targeting, weapons adjustments and sensor payload movements, ranges and capabilities, he added. Developments with “artificial intelligence,” (AI) will better enable unmanned platforms to organize, interpret and integrate functions independently such as ISR filtering, sensor manipulation, maneuvering, navigation and targeting adjustments.  In essence, emerging computer technology will better enable drones to make more decisions and perform more functions by themselves. The beginning of this phenomenon is evidenced in the computers and sensor technologies of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; the aircraft uses a technique known as “sensor fusion” wherein information from multiple sensors is organized, interpreted and presented to pilots on a single screen.  An MQ-1 Predator and an MQ-9 Reaper assigned to the 432nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron remain ready for their next mission at Creech Air Force Base, Nev. The two aircraft have provided intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance during Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. USAF/Staff Sgt. Vernon Young Jr. Digital mapping, ISR information from the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System and targeting data from its Electro-Optical Targeting System are not dispersed across multiple screens which pilots try to view simultaneously. Fast evolving sensor technology, which allows for an ability to more closely view targets and tactically relevant information from increasingly farther distances, will continue to enable and improve this trending phenomenon. One of the largest consequences of AI will likely lead to a scenario wherein multiple humans will no longer need to control a single drone – rather multiple drones will be controlled by a single human performing command and control functions. “People will function as air-traffic controllers rather than pilots, using smart, independent platforms. A person does command and control and drones execute functions. The resource allocation will be done by humans as higher level systems managers,” Zacharias explained. As a result, drones will increasingly be capable of working more closely with nearby manned aircraft, almost functioning like a co-pilot in the cockpit and massively expanding the mission scope of a fighter jet or other aircraft able to control targeting, sensors and weapons functions from the air nearby. “Decision aides will be in the cockpit (of a nearby fighter jet or aircraft) and platform oriented autonomous systems will function like a wing man, for instance, that might be carrying extra weapons, helping to defend or performing ISR tasks,” Zacharias said. “We will get beyond simple guidance and control and will get into tactics and execution.” Drones could lead the way into higher-risk areas in order to reduce risks for manned aircraft, test and challenged next-generation enemy air defenses and greatly increase the ISR and weapons ability of any given mission. An X-47B pilot-less drone combat aircraft is prepared for launch from the deck of the USS George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, July 10, 2013. REUTERS/Rich-Joseph Facun In addition, drones will become more capable of air-to-air maneuvers and attacks and no longer be primarily engineered for air-to-ground attacks. In fact, early conceptual renderings of 6th generation fighter jets and the Air Force’s in-development Long Range Strike-Bomber are being engineered for unmanned flight as well as piloted flight. Nevertheless, although drones and unmanned fighters will rapidly become faster and more maneuverable, algorithms may not soon progress to the point where unmanned systems can respond or react to unanticipated developments in a dynamic, fast-changing environment the way a human brain could. At the same time, advances in long-range sensor technology will continue to enable aircraft to see enemies at much longer distances, massively decreasing the need for drones or unmanned systems to be able to dogfight in mid-air.  During the last decade and a half of ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. forces experienced uncontested air superiority, drones were used almost exclusively for air-to-ground attacks against insurgent fighters on the run, compounds, weapons caches, bunkers and other strategically vital targets. As the Air Force looks to the future, it aims to be capable of using drones as a key part of successfully engaging near-peer competitors and potential adversaries with technological ability able to rival the U.S. edge. Russia and China, for example, both operate 5th generation stealth fighters (the latest and greatest technology) – and Russia is known to operate some of the most sophisticated enemy air defenses in the world.  Russian-built air defenses, such as the S-300 and S-400, are now better networked to one another, have faster processing speeds and are able to detect fighter aircraft on a wider range of frequencies, making it much more difficult for even stealthy fighters and bombers to operate. Russia is even reported to be developing a more-advanced S-500 able to hit ranges greater than 125 miles.  These potential scenarios, now being studied by Pentagon analysts, involve developing an ability to operate in what is called a “contested environment,” where enemies operate advanced air defenses, 5th generation fighter jets and long-range precision-guided weapons. “You need to increasingly be able to react more to your environment in the air, addressing unanticipated failures and threats coming after you,” Zacharias added.   Zacharias explained that many of these developments will come to fruition more fully through ongoing training, simulations and live virtual constructions designed to assess various expected scenarios. DARPA Faster computer processing power will also better enable an ability to organize and streamline the massive amount of collected ISR data. If a drone loiters over strategically important areas for hours upon hours, computer algorithms will increasingly allow the platform to identify important tactical information by itself. “Right now we are using lots of bandwidth to send our real-time video. One of the things that we have is smarter on-board processors. An RPA (drone) can orbit around a given target and have it look, for instance, for a relevant white pick-up truck, instead of having human operators do that,” he said. “This requires image processing, pattern recognition. Then you could just send a signal instead of using up all this bandwidth saying ‘hey I just saw something 30 seconds ago you might want to take a look at the video feed which I am sending right now.’” The ability for a single human to control multiple drones could bring a number of implications, such as an ability to effectively use a swarm of small drones. Air Force scientists have explained that emerging algorithms are increasingly able to allow large numbers of small, mini-drones to operate in unison without hitting one another. For instance, they could collectively work to jam or overwhelm an enemy radar system, act themselves as weapons or munitions, or cover an expansive area with ISR video feeds. More Lethal Drones A wider arsenal of weapons will also be integrated onto drone platforms, including high-tech guided weapons able to discern and destroy enemy targets by themselves to a much greater degree. This will likely include laser weapons as well, Zacharias added. These weapons will naturally include laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missiles which are the primary weapon used by today’s platforms such as the Predator, Reaper and Army Gray Eagle.  At the same time, drones or unmanned platforms are expected to fire a wider range of guided air-dropped munitions and air-to-air weapons such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-120 AMRAAM. Also, the Air Force is now developing an air-dropped guided weapon called the Small Diameter Bomb II. This weapon uses an emerging technology called a tri-mode seeker, which draws upon infrared, laser and millimeter wave radar technology to detect, track and destroy targets in any kind of weather environment. AP Photo/Matt York At the same time, Pentagon doctrine stipulates that a human needs to be in-the-loop when it comes to the possible use of lethal force, except potentially in some rare circumstance where immediate defensive weapons are needing in milliseconds due to an incoming attack, Zacharias explained.  As a result, nearly all weapons will help distinguish, track and destroy targets under the guidance and supervision of human command and control. Given the pace of technological change, future Air Force drones will also need to be modular, meaning they will be engineered such that they can readily exchange sensor payloads when mission requirements change or new technology emerges, Air Force officials said. Future drones will also be much faster than the 200 to 300 miles per hour most current drones are able to travel at. Hypersonic speeds greater than Mach 5.5 may be in the very distant future; the Air Force Research Laboratory and Boeing have worked together on an emerging hypersonic test platform called the X-51A Waverider. The test vehicle has had both failed and successful test trying to launch from an aircraft and travel at hypersonic speeds. While this super-high speed technology may hold promise for possible drone applications in the distant future, it is currently regarded as a long way off and in need of much further development.  Nevertheless, there have been some successfull flights of hypersonic technology, including on in May of 2013 wherein the X-51A Waverider flew over the Pacific Ocean reaching speeds of Mach 5.1. This May 1 test flight wound up being the longest air-breathing hypersonic flight ever, wrapping up a $300 million technology demonstration program beginning in 2004, according to an Air Force statement. U.S. airmen prepare a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone as it leaves on a mission at Kandahar Air Field Thomson Reuters “The X-51A took off from the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB, Calif., under the wing of B-52H Stratofortress. It was released at approximately 50,000 feet and accelerated to Mach 4.8 in about 26 seconds powered by a solid rocket booster. After separating from the booster, the cruiser’s supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, engine then lit and accelerated the aircraft to Mach 5.1 at 60,000 feet,” a previous Air Force Statement explaining the test stated.  Naturally, massively increased speed could give drones an ability to urgently reach and potentially deliver weapons and sensors to crucial time-sensitive combat situations exponentially faster. Stealthy Drones Future drones will also be quite stealthy, as a technique for having more success against high-tech air defenses. There are already a number of stealthy drones in various stages of development. One such example is Lockheed Martin's RQ-170 Sentinel stealth UAV which, according to a 2011 report in The Atlantic, helped track Bin Laden’s compound prior to his death. Boeing has unveiled its Phantom Ray, a fighter-sized unmanned combat air vehicle which first flew in 2011. The aircraft has a 50-foot wingspan, can climb to 40,000 feet and reach speeds of Mach .85.  Read more: Top IoT Companies to Watch & Invest In Best IoT Conferences & Expos IoT Wearable Devices & Technology How the IoT Will Affect Security & Privacy Ultimate IoT Research Bundle Read the original article on Scout Warrior.
