Kirkpatrick/Getty Images SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is aiming to start a Martian colony within the next decade, but another rival CEO says his company will actually be the one to put humans on the Red Planet first. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg recently answered questions at the "Whats Next" tech conference in Chicago, and when asked about the future of his company, he focused on breakthroughs in space travel. "I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," said Muilenburg, according to Bloomberg. "The first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket." Boeing has been in the space business for decades, as it has been one of NASA’s primary contractors since the space agency’s inception. The company built the first stage of the Saturn V rocket — which took astronauts to the Moon — and it has since contributed to the Space Shuttle program and crafted many elements of the International Space Station. Currently, Boeing is designing and developing the Space Launch System, the massive rocket that NASA wants to use to send people to Mars. So when Muilenburg says the first people will get to the planet with a Boeing rocket, he’s most likely referring to the SLS. If that’s the case, his comments seemingly cast doubt on Musk’s ambitious timeline for getting to Mars. Last week, Musk detailed his vision of sending huge passenger spaceships, filled with 100 colonists each, over to the Red Planet to start a self-sustaining colony. But Musk has no intention of waiting to get his settlement started. He’s aiming to send the first crewed spaceship to Mars by 2024. Meanwhile, NASA is targeting a human Mars mission for the mid-2030s, about a decade after SpaceX says it will start sending people over to the planet. If Muilenburg thinks Boeing will get to Mars first, that means he doesn’t have much confidence in Musk’s estimates. An artistic rendering of NASA's Space Launch System. (NASA) SpaceX has a history of missing its very optimistic deadlines. Musk boasted in 2011 that his company would send people into space within the next three years. Five years later, it’s now looking like those first human flights may not happen until 2018. And SpaceX promised to launch its Falcon Heavy for the first time in 2013 or 2014; that debut flight has been pushed back again and again. Of course, the circumstances surrounding the two company’s Mars initiatives are very different. Boeing is receiving billions in funding from NASA to develop the SLS. SpaceX is self-funding its Mars vehicles for now, though the company does receive federal funding through other unrelated NASA contracts. Currently SpaceX is only devoting 5 percent of its resources to building its Mars rockets and spaceships, though it hopes to get more help from public and private partnerships in the future. Since no one has even come close to sending people to Mars yet, it remains to be seen which company has a better chance of actually getting to the Red Planet. Hopefully we’ll find out the winner in the next decade or so.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Last month, SpaceX founder Elon Musk laid out a bold plan to colonize Mars. He believes the first humans will step on the red planet as soon as 2025. It turns out Musk could face some tough competition from Boeing, which recently claimed it would be the first company to successfully send an astronaut to Mars. Speaking at a tech summit this week, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg took an indirect shot at the rival upstart aerospace firm. “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” he said. Boeing’s plans to send humans to Mars hinge on the Space Launch System rocket, which is still in development with NASA. According to Ars Technica, it could cost another $60 billion before the SLS is ready. That means Boeing’s rocket likely won’t bring anyone to Mars until at least the late 2030s. Muilenburg seems to be implying that Musk won’t meet his ambitious timeline, which plenty of critics agree with. or that Boeing plans to significantly accelerate its schedule to beat SpaceX to the punch.

GovCon Index advancers slightly edged laggers and seven of its 11 S&P 500 companies that include Boeing closed green. KBR (NYSE: KBR) finished second for net gainers and first for percentage performers Wednesday as the stock has both extended its rebound from Monday’s sharp decline on lower 2016 earnings guidance and recouped its losses from that disclosure. The company received an upgrade Wednesday from Johnson & Rice a day after Deutsche Bank lifted its own rating on the stock as analysts at both firms believe KBR has reduced risk through its $870 million in acquisitions this year of government services contractors Wyle and the former Honeywell Technology Solutions. Johnson & Rice boosted its rating to “Accumulate” from “Hold” with an $18 price target, while Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to “Buy” from “Hold” with a price target increase to $16 from $14 and said the Monday selloff was “overdone.” KBR’s Wednesday volume ended at 5 million shares traded to outpace the three-month average nearly four-fold. Government services contractors CACI International (NYSE: CACI) and Maximus (NYSE: MMS) also helped lift the Index along with General Dynamics (NYSE: GD). Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE: BAH) ended Wednesday as the GCI’s largest decliner and recorded its largest one-day loss since late January after the New York Times reported a company employee was the subject of an FBI investigation over a potential theft of classified information. The stock has entered negative territory on a year-to-date basis at 1.75 percent versus the pre-open YTD gain of 2.1 percent and traded at a volume of 4.9 million shares to exceed the three-month average six-fold.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Pinterest The race to the Red Planet is on. Remember that “Get a Mac” ad campaign from around a decade ago? On one side of a minimalist room, you had the PC, played by a suit-and-tie John Hodgman—all business, by-the-book, and old-school polite professionalism. On the other, Justin Long, clad in untucked shirt, casually breaking rules and nonchalantly pointing out new user-friendly Mac features. Wherever you stand in the ongoing battle, it was a creative campaign—and a compelling embodiment of a technology trend at play in a number of different sectors, including, it turns out, commercial space travel. Although in this case, the John-Hodgman-esque aviation giant Boeing is up against the flashy upstart SpaceX, Elon Musk's 14-year-old venture. Nowhere is the competition more heated, it seems, than in the race to Mars—that barren red neighbor, which some see as a future home for human beings, especially as our current planet becomes less and less habitable. No, this is not a drill—nor is it the premise of a Philip K. Dick book. Just a week after a major SpaceX presentation outlining plans for colonization of Mars, Boeing made clear its own plans to get there first. First, Elon Musk, the billionaire who is also CEO of Tesla Motors, took to the stage at a space conference in Guadalajara, Mexico, to outline his vision for a self-sustaining city of a million people on Mars. The presentation, carried much of the flair that his brand is associated with, down to its title “Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species.” He showed a rendering of the company’s Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), which includes the most powerful rockets the world has ever seen, and will be able to carry up to 100 people at a time on multiple trips. Forget being strapped into cramped astronaut cabins; SpaceX’s vessel will include a movie theater and a restaurant. “It will be really fun to go,” said Musk. “You’ll have a great time.” This is not a one-way trip in the mold of Mars One, an initiative that wants to send a group of volunteers to Mars with no return ticket to start a colony. In Musk's plan, once the spacecraft leaves our atmosphere and enters orbit, a booster zips back to Earth to grab a propellant tank. Once juiced, the spacecraft than shoots to Mars, reaching speeds up to 62,700 miles per hour mid-flight. A solar-powered plant, built on the Martian surface, will use carbon dioxide and water ice to generate a methane- and oxygen-powered fuel to allow the ship to return to Earth. (Mars’s weaker gravitational pull means it’s much easier to launch off its surface than Earth’s.) Musk estimates that the first launch, to occur in the 2020s, would cost $10 billion. And how much is the fare for an interplanetary vacation? “The architecture allows for a cost per ticket of less than $200,000,” Musk said. “We think that the cost of moving to Mars ultimately could drop below $100,00.” Expensive, sure, but it is cheaper than a trip on the Four Seasons private jet—and that’s just a flight around our boring planet. Moon Express Will Go Where No Private Company Has Gone Before Boeing announced their own plans for Mars with far less pizzazz. On Tuesday, at The Atlantic's "What's Next" event in Chicago, CEO and chairman of Boeing Dennis Muilenburg answered a question about future innovation plans—and it turns out there’s more in the pipeline than just projecting clouds onto the ceilings of airplane cabins. “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” he said. There were no accompanying diagrams of giant rockets, with minuscule humans included for scale, nor was there talk of building fueling infrastructure on the Red Planet and starting a million-strong colony. Yet Boeing has a long history of federal contracts for space exploration: The company was involved in building the Saturn V, the rocket that sent men to the moon. Now, it’s the main contractor for NASA’s Space Launch System rocket, a propulsion system that according to an Ars Technica analysis will cost $60 billion in development and testing, before it’s used to land four to six humans on Mars in the late 2030s. Boeing, it appears, is among the skeptics who think Musk's plan for a successful mission in the 2020s is overambitious and unrealistic. In the meantime, though, as stepping stones to the Mars mission, Boeing and SpaceX will develop technologies that could allow us to dip our toes into the future of space tourism. At the conference, Muilenburg also outlined a future where leisure trips to the edge of space could be commonplace—(Oh, there you are, Airbus), and hypersonic planes will be able to shuttle you across the world in less time than it takes to get from Manhattan to JFK on the subway. SpaceX, too—for now at least—has been investing its resources into edge-of-space missions, which could lead to multiple uses in space tourism. It currently depends on contracts for revenue. Most of its money comes from building the Falcon 9 rockets that launch commercial satellites into orbit and fly missions to the International Space Station, but as it fine-tunes that technology, we could see more leisure-based missions out of the stratosphere. While Musk's plans are more ambitious than Boeing's, it's important to note that he, too, is looking for some level of public-private partnership as well as collaboration with other commercial players in the sector. NASA has already pledged to provide technical support to SpaceX's early missions and Musk has specified that his goal is to build the infrastructure for getting to and from space, not necessarily living in it—it will be up to other companies or government agencies to build the environments that will allow us to stay up there. Just a few decades ago, the space race was an issue of national security between the United States and Soviet Union. Now it’s becoming a sprint between private companies—old-school institutions and dream-big disruptors, alike. For the traveler, however, it's increasingly clear that it’s less a question of if we’ll one day be able to visit Mars, but when—and in whose spaceship.

Less than a week after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious plans to colonize Mars, the CEO of Boeing announced his company also had its sights set on shuttling people to the neighboring planet. The company is already building a rocket with NASA. "I am convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of Boeing, said yesterday at a conference on innovation co-sponsored by the aerospace firm and The Atlantic magazine in Chicago. Last week, Musk outlined his plan to colonize Mars at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, creating a science fiction-like image of a self-sustaining city on Mars and thousands of people going there via SpaceX rockets. SpaceX's Elon Musk Turns to Science Fiction for Mars Ship Elon Musk Unveils His Plan For Colonizing Mars Muilenburg's comments echoed Musks' sentiments on exploring outer space, as he spoke of a near future where humans could easily travel to other planets. The Boeing CEO mused about his company's vision to make major advances in "space tourism, space industry" and "deep space exploration" in the next century. "Over the last 100 years, it is remarkable to think that men and women went from walking on the earth to walking on the moon, we went from riding horses to flying on airplanes," Muilenburg said, adding that he thinks the next century of innovation will bring "even greater, even bolder" changes in technology. Muilenburg predicted that the near future holds innovations in "supersonic, hyper-sonic travel" and "the ability to connect anywhere in the world in a couple of hours."

Boeing once helped the U.S. beat the Soviet Union in the race to the moon. Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. READ MORE: • Elon Musk offers glimpse of plans to deliver humans to Mars "I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket," Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. Like Musk's SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies NASA selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. WATCH: SpaceX's plan for a mission to Mars Video Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travelers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. Continued below. Related Content Elon Musk offers glimpse of plans to deliver humans to Mars Bezos on nuclear reactors in space, the lack of bacon on Mars, humanity's destiny Reaching Mars one trial at a time "The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It's like building the Union Pacific railroad," Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as US$100,000. Boeing built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful U.S. rocket ever built, which took men to the moon. Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home "blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market." The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said. "I think it's a fascinating area for us," he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, traveling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly U.S. travelers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed's Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing's X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. "That business model isn't closed yet. At some point it will," he said. "The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability."

Less than a week after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious plans to colonize Mars, the CEO of Boeing announced his company also had its sights set on shuttling people to the neighboring planet with the rocket it’s already building with NASA. “I am convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at a conference on innovation co-sponsored by the aerospace firm and The Atlantic magazine Tuesday in Chicago. Last week, Musk outlined his plan to colonize mars at the the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, creating a science fiction-like image of a self-sustaining city on Mars and thousands of people going to Mars via SpaceX rockets. Muilenburg comments echoed Musks’ sentiments on exploring outer space, as he spoke of a near-future where humans could easily travel to other planets. The Boeing CEO mused about his company’s vision to make major advances in “space tourism, space industry,” and “deep space exploration” in the next century. “Over the last 100 years, it is remarkable to think that men and women went from walking on the earth to walking on the moon, we went from riding horses to flying on airplanes,” Muilenburg said, adding that he thinks the next century of innovation will bring “even greater, even bolder” changes in technology. Muilenburg predicted that the near future holds innovations in “supersonic, hyper-sonic travel” and “the ability to connect anywhere in the world in a couple of hours.” NASA announced last month that they have a goal of sending humans to Earth’s neighbor in the 2030’s via their Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which Boeing, a long-time government contractor, is now building at the core stage.

The aerospace giant aims to beat out Elon Musk by sending the first manned mission to the Red Planet. by Jamie Condliffe October 5, 2016 The spacesuit gloves are off. It’s not just Elon Musk that wants to take us all to Mars—Boeing has declared its ambition, too. The race to the Red Planet is on. Speaking at a technology conference in Chicago called What’s Next, Boeing’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg signalled his intention to join this century’s space race. “I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," he explained. Boeing's plans to take people to the Red Planet are nothing new. As Ars Technica points out, the company is already working on a craft that will take humans to Mars, because it’s the primary contractors on NASA's new Space Launch System rocket. That rocket will, eventually, be powerful enough to take up to six astronauts to the planet, but such a mission isn’t expected to take place until the late 2030s. An artist's impression of what the Space Launch System rocket may look like once complete. Muilenburg did, however, hint that Boeing is also interested in space tourism, suggesting that near-Earth recreational trips into orbit would be “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market.” Ambitions to take mere mortals to Mars, then, may also be on the cards. SpaceX’s Martian offering is as ambitious as you would expect for a company run by Elon Musk. At the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, last week, Musk explained that he plans for SpaceX to build as many as 1,000 giant interplanetary spaceships—each larger than NASA’s old Saturn V—to ferry people to Mars. Funding plans remain vague at best, though. Others have had their eyes on taking humankind to Mars before, but their ambitions seem less likely to be realized. The Netherlands-based nonprofit Mars One, for instance, aims to carry out a one-way manned trip to Mars as soon as 2026. But its plans and schedule have received serious criticism from engineers. The Inspiration Mars Foundation, meanwhile, claimed it would launch a manned mission by 2018 or, failing that, 2021. Its website is no longer live, though, which suggests that plans are on hold. So for now it least, it’s SpaceX and Boeing that will be competing to get there first. There are still some nagging concerns over plans to take humankind to Mars, though. As difficult as getting there would be, keeping people alive once there is going to be even harder. Elon Musk has made it quite clear that that’s not his problem. He compares the venture to the Union Pacific Railroad: SpaceX is building the transportation network, not the actual colony. Mars-goers will have to fend for themselves. Given that fact, the other major concern seems all the more pressing: do many people really want to go?

In fact, it's the first Boeing 787 Dreamliner ever to be converted into a private jet - complete with roomy bedrooms, en-suite bathrooms, a dining room, office area and even cinema. As a commercial plane, it would squish in up to 335 passengers, but the Dream Jet, as it's been named, will carry only up to 40, and they'll have plenty of room to stretch out. Scroll down for video  This is the first Boeing 787 Dreamliner ever to be converted into a private jet custom-built for corporate flyers, and boasts luxury furnishings and plenty of room for dining and entertaining According to BAVIATION, the Dream Jet - estimated to have cost upwards of $324 million (£250 million) - comprises a large cabin set over 6,500 square feet, with a separate resting space for cabin crew. Among its laundry list of luxe amenities are a sound-proofed main guest area, spacious living room and entertainment suite, a full-sized master bedroom suite, master wash room with over-sized shower, electric dining and conference tables and 16 convertible day beds.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The hanging gardens of Heathrow!

Share this article Share Co-designed by Kestrel and Parisian yacht and aircraft design specialists Pierrejean Design, it lowers in-flight noise down to a very civilised 48 decibels, and has air technology built in to reduce travel sickness and filter germs from the cabin air. Should, heaven forbid, any unexpected bumps occur, the furniture has also been streamlined to be absent of any sharp edges. Its master bedroom certainly provides the ultimate in comfort, scattered with drapes and candles, but would you really want to sleep through this flight? The bedroom has a walk-in wardrobe and roomy en-suite bathroom with oversized shower (left) and plenty of drawer space - exactly what you'd need to fold up and store away remains a mystery An abundance of fresh towels are available, as are a selection of bathroom products, making it about as far from a commerical plane loo as you can get Other design features include hardwood trimmings and doors, silk accented carpets and tablets which control everything from lamps and audio to window shades and flight-attendant alerts. Lamps, potted plants, fluffy white towels and luxurious bathroom products lend the space a homely feel - the home of a very rich individual of course. Commissioned by an anonymous Asian businessman and developed by American luxury aircraft customisers Kestrel Aviation Management, the project has been in the making for two and a half years. It was unveiled earlier this year at the European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition in Geneva. In addition, Chinese private jet company DeerJet held a launch in Hong Kong last month.   As a commercial plane, the aircraft (pictured) would squish in up to 335 passengers, but the Dream Jet will only carry up to 40 With a carpeted cabin covering 6,500 square foot, its abundantly fortunate guests will have plenty of room to stretch out Details of the in-flight butler services are yet to be released, but are sure to include champagne and fine-dining as standard Co-designed by Kestrel and Parisian yacht and aircraft design specialists Pierrejean Design, sound-proofing in various separate sections including the cinema area (pictured) lowers in-flight noise down to a very civilised 48 decibels Should, heaven forbid, any unexpected bumps occur, the furniture has been streamlined to be absent of any sharp edges - pictured left are seats reserved for guests who didn't score the master bedroom and right, a gleaming shower Zheng Peng, Chairman and President of DeerJet, said at the launch: 'We are immensely proud to launch the world’s first and only Dream Jet here in Hong Kong.

The race to put the first person on Mars is heating up. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg says his company plans to beat Musk’s SpaceX to the Red Planet. “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” he told an innovation conference in Chicago. His comments come a week after Musk set out his own plans to colonize Mars. The SpaceX CEO has said he wants to send humans to the planet in 2024, with the spacecraft touching down in 2025. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Muilenburg believes Boeing can get there sooner or just expects Musk to miss his targets. The SpaceX CEO, who also runs Tesla Motors, admits he’s sometimes overoptimistic with his deadlines. “I’m not the best at this sort of thing,” Musk said last week at a meeting of space exploration associations in Mexico. Boeing is developing a rocket for NASA known as the Space Launch System, which the space agency plans to use to go to Mars by the 2030s. Musk said last week that SpaceX had successfully tested a new rocket engine it plans to use to take people to the planet within the next 10 years. Besides Mars, Muilenburg also talked about other ambitious ideas at the Chicago conference, like hypersonic travel that would take people “anywhere in the world in a couple of hours.” “Over the last 100 years … men and women went from walking on the Earth to walking on the Moon,” he said. “But when I look ahead to the next century, I think the opportunity for innovation and big change is even greater.” Boeing and SpaceX are already competing to be the first private company to carry U.S. astronauts into space. Both already have contracts with NASA to take astronauts to the International Space Station. SpaceX appeared to have gained an edge in May when Boeing said it had pushed the date of its first manned space mission back to 2018 from 2017. But Musk’s firm suffered a setback on Sept. 1 when one of its rockets was destroyed in an explosion on the launch pad. The company is still trying to figure out what caused the fiery blast, but it’s planning to return to space as soon as November. 41.878114 -87.629798 Filed in: News Topics: Boeing, Elon Musk, Mars Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Southern Bank News 3’s Proud Community Partner!

Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. Like Musk’s SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies NASA selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Mars Transport Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travelers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It’s like building the Union Pacific railroad,” Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as $100,000.

Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market.” The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said. “I think it’s a fascinating area for us,” he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, traveling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Science Fiction Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly U.S. travelers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing’s X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. “That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will,” he said. “The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration Boeing CEO jabs SpaceX, says Mars explorers will ride his rocket Dennis Muilenburg says Boeing will remain at the forefront of aerospace. by Eric Berger - Oct 5, 2016 12:53 pm UTC Login to bookmark 126 Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg gives a keynote speech during the SAE Aerotech Congress on September 22, 2015 in Seattle, Washington. Stephen Brashear/Getty Images On Tuesday, a week after Elon Musk's big Mars reveal in Guadalajara, Mexico, Boeing Chief Executive and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg was asked what big innovations his company had planned for its second century of operations. After ticking off a list of flight and aerospace innovations, Muilenburg came to deep space exploration. "First person on Mars. I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," Muilenburg confidently said during a Boeing-sponsored tech summit in Chicago called "What's Next." It doesn't manifest itself publicly all that often, but there is an intense rivalry between Boeing, a blue-blood government contractor with a long history of aerospace firsts, and SpaceX, which has come along in the last decade and threatened the larger company's space business by offering discounted spaceflight. About the closest thing to trash talking came in 2014, when John Elbon, the head of Boeing's space division, compared the two companies by saying, "We go for substance. Not pizzazz." Boeing, of course, won't be sending anyone to Mars without collecting tens of billions of dollars in federal contracts for its Space Launch System rocket, for which it is NASA's prime contractor. An Ars analysis found that NASA will spend about $60 billion developing and flying the SLS rocket before there's even the possibility of landing four to six humans on Mars in the late 2030s, and that does not include the expense of spacecraft, deep-space habitats, and accommodations on the surface of Mars. During his remarks last week, Elon Musk laid out an, at times, ambitious and fantastical plan to colonize Mars over the next 100 years. His Interplanetary Transport System would not transport a handful of astronauts to Mars, but 100 colonists at a time. The rocket powering it would be four times more powerful than the most robust version of the SLS rocket. And Musk said it would only cost about $10 billion to launch the first colonists to Mars sometime in the 2020s. Critics have called Musk's plan unrealistic, but his vision highlights an inherent tension between "old space" companies like Boeing and "new space" companies like SpaceX. Before SpaceX came along, Boeing and other traditional space firms were accustomed to large, cost-plus contracts to help NASA carry out its exploration program. Musk is trying to change the paradigm. On Tuesday, Boeing's CEO made clear who he believes will win this 21st century space race. Expand full story Reader comments 126 You must login or create an account to comment.

By Mary-Ann Russon October 5, 2016 13:29 BST Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is coming for Elon Musk and wants hypersonic technology to get to Mars firstReuters Move aside Elon Musk – aerospace giant Boeing plans to beat SpaceX by being the first to take humans safely to Mars using hypersonic technology, which it believes will also go a long way towards developing a viable space tourism industry. Musk made the news recently by reiterating his plans to send humans to Mars using a new interplanetary transport system at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, at the end of September. He plans to build several spaceships that could take 100 passengers at a time to Mars, with each ticket costing $200,000 (£157,280), until the planet is inhabited by 1 million people. But not so fast. Boeing helped the US to reach the Moon before the Soviet Union in 1969, and it has no intention of letting SpaceX beat it this time either. "I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket," Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg told the audience at the Atlantic's What's Next? Conference in Chicago on Wednesday 4 October, according to Bloomberg. Boeing is heavily focusing on developing hypersonic jets because it envisions a thriving commercial space tourism industry whereby hypersonic aircraft are able to not only carry passengers across continents in just two hours, but also able take passengers to space hotels and space factories orbiting around the Earth very quickly as well. How does hypersonic technology work? Flights on hypersonic jets similar to the German space agency's simulation seen here could make Boeing's vision of space tourism come true soon IBTimes UK Today, hypersonic aircraft are mostly still just a concept. Hypersonic refers to planes that travel at over 3,840mph, which is five times the speed of sound (Mach 5), and at the moment, these aircraft are mostly tested by the military in the US, China and Russia, to varying degrees of success. In order to achieve such speeds – beyond twice that of the Concorde – engineers have been developing supersonic combustion ramjet engine (Scramjet) technology since the 1950s to change the way planes function. The essential concept remains the same over 60 years on – if you want planes to go faster, they have to be a lot lighter. And the best way to get them to be lighter is by using rocket engines that can take the oxygen needed to create combustion from the atmosphere around and through the vehicle as it flies, rather than having to carry a tank on board. Nasa, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, the US Air Force, the Pentagon, Australian military and Germany's space agency are the major players who are keen to realise hypersonic technology by the mid-2020s for use in super-fast fighter jets, missiles and commercial aircraft, but the technology will need to be both stable and a lot cheaper to produce, before this can happen on a big scale. "[The] business model [for hypersonic] isn't closed yet. At some point it will," he said. "The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability." Most recently, Russia announced that it is developing a hypersonic stealth bomber that can launch nuclear bombs from space (although this is still also just a concept), while British aerospace manufacturer Reaction Engines recently received £50m in funding from the UK space agency to develop the Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (Sabre). Elsewhere, both China and the Pentagon are pushing ahead to develop hypersonic missiles, which would be deadly because their speed makes them virtually impossible to detect using radar.

The Boeing 787 that's an airborne penthouse apartment Tour of the first ever BBJ 787 Play! 03:31 John O'Ceallaigh, Telegraph Luxury Travel Editor 5 October 2016 • 11:48am Ordinarily Boeing 787 Dreamliners serve as commercial aircraft that carry between 240 and 335 passengers, but in a world first one of the planes has been transformed into a 40-passenger private jet so spacious and well-equipped that it resembles an airborne penthouse apartment. Developed by Kestrel Aviation Management, an American aviation asset manager that specialises in airliner and corporate aircraft acquisition, sale, modification and financing, this one-of-a-kind Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) has been dubbed the Dreamjet. The privileged few who get to step aboard can expect an in-flight experience worlds away from that offered on a typical Boeing. The master bedroom, which comes complete with en suite and walk-in wardrobe Credit: Kestrel Aviation Management With its interiors co-developed by yacht and aircraft design specialists Pierrejean Design, the plane is intended to serve as a sanctuary - particular attention was given to how the space would stimulate each of the senses. To ensure passengers' senses of smell and taste weren't unduly challenged, the team considered air distribution and filtration and segregated zones with hard and soft barriers; for touch, innovative, tactile materials were used to create a "luxuriously organic" setting finished with flowing lines and the absence of sharp edges.  The dining area Credit: Kestrel Aviation Management Features aboard include high domed ceilings, hardwood floors, sculptured hardwood doors and hand-tufted carpets with silk accents. Tablets control lighting, video monitors, audio, window shades and flight-attendant requests. Among the segregated zones on board will be an entertainment and study lounge  that accommodates 16, dedicated dining spaces, en suite master bedroom with 42-inch television, dressing room and a vast hotel suite-quality bathroom with shower. Though the company is unable to reveal the individual who commissioned the BBJ, it was purchased by an Asian client and has been in development since 2009. Kestrel worked directly with Boeing on the project from 2011 and 2013 and the plane was unveiled at this year’s European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition in Geneva. The aircraft has a 9,800 nautical mile range and can fly for over 17 hours non-stop. The aircraft's exterior Credit: Kestrel Aviation Management While the project was entirely novel, Kestrel Aviation Management has much experience in ambitious aircraft conversions. Its customer base includes major international airlines, UHNW individuals, financial institutions, airplane manufacturers and governmental bodies and so far the company has been involved in the purchase or sale of over 300 commercial aircraft, with a combined value of over $50 billion. Details about this new endeavour come at a time of significant innovation within the premium aviation sector as a whole. The entertainment zone Credit: Kestrel Aviation Management Until now known only for its seafaring tours, Crystal Cruises has announced that it is to launch Crystal Aircruises, an elegantly styled Boeing 777-200LR that will feature a 24-person dining room where meals are prepared by a dedicated chef, a bar and a first-class seating area where fully lie-flat seats are transformed into comfortable beds with mattress toppers, plush duvets and blankets. The plane will be used by groups enjoying themed 14-, 21- or 28-day round-the-world itineraries. Life in fabulous first class Seattle-based TCS World Travel, meanwhile, officially launched in the UK last year and has expanded its portfolio of round-the-world private-jet trips to include Sea.Sky.Safari itineraries incorporating short cruises offered in partnership with Seadream Yacht Club. Last year, Four Seasons launched the hotel industry’s first fully branded private jet. Passengers on multi-week itineraries enjoy access to a range of attractions and privileged experiences, and stay at Four Seasons hotels along the way.

The aerospace firm played a vital role in the Apollo moon landings, and has also committed to building a capsule for Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) to take astronauts into space in future. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said this week that he believes Boeing will win the race to get to the red planet first.  Scroll down for video  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg (left) aims to beat Elon Musk (right) and SpaceX to reach Mars first ELON MUSK AND MARS  Last week, SpaceX chief Elon Musk unveiled his most ambitious project yet - an 'Interplanetary Transport System' to take mankind to Mars in 80 days and build a sustainable human colony of a million people there. 'What I want to achieve is make Mars seem possible, to show that we can do it in our lifetimes, and you could go,' he said at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico. However, he warned the trip was likely to be dangerous - and said candidates for the first missions 'must be prepared to die'.   The Interplanetary Transport System will use a giant rocket booster with a 39 foot (12m) diameter and 49 engines, and a special shuttle with a 56 foot (17m) diameter, making the entire rocket stack 400 feet (122m) high.  They will launch with empty fuel tanks and refuel in orbit. Once on Mars, they would make more methane fuel for the return journey.  'I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,' said Mr Muilenburg at a conference in Chicago, reports Bloomberg. The company believes that the future of commercial space travel will focus on private firms shuttling people and cargo between numerous locations beyond Earth. It was even suggested that the International Space Station could be joined by a 'space hotel' along with other microgravity research labs.   In 2014, Nasa announced that it had selected Boeing and SpaceX to develop the four-person capsules that will launch astronauts into orbit on top of the space agency's new SLS, which is scheduled for its first launch in 2018. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon will be used to ferry the space agency's commercial crew to the International Space Station (ISS). Like SpaceX, Boeing is also working on technology to transport astronauts beyond the space station, and potentially to Mars.  Last week, Elon Musk unveiled SpaceX's 'Interplanetary Transport System' which he believes will take people to Mars in 80 days and build a sustainable human colony of a million people there.

The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Boeing vows to beat Elon Musk to Mars 2016-10-05 10:55 - Julie Johnsson Post a comment 0 share: SpaceX founder Elon Musk. (Bloomberg) RELATED ARTICLES Here is Elon Musk’s plan to get to Mars Elon Musk desperate to prove ‘Wall Street naysayers’ wrong Facebook's Africa satellite destroyed in SpaceX crash New York - Boeing once helped the US beat the Soviet Union in the race to the moon. Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Officer  Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. Like Musk’s SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies NASA selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station.\ Mars Transport Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travellers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It’s like building the Union Pacific railroad,” Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as $100 000. Boeing built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful U.S. rocket ever built, which took men to the moon. Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market.” The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said. “I think it’s a fascinating area for us,” he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, traveling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Science Fiction Boeing and Lockheed Martin are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly U.S. travelers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing’s X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. “That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will,” he said. “The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.” Read more about: boeing  |  elon musk  |  space share: More In This Category Airbnb includes Cape Town in new ‘Trips’ offering R11m French tech lab launched in Cape Town Facebook says it erred measuring audience reach Cwele: Everyone should have access to internet Most Popular Read Top 5 smartphones for under R300 a month Top tips on protecting your devices from hackers Here's how to go Ninja mode on social networks R11m French tech lab launched in Cape Town Post Office's late financials a concern - AG Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. By Julie Johnsson. Added by Agency Staff on 5 October 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, Elom Musk, SpaceX Tweet Boeing once helped the US beat the Soviet Union in the race to the moon. Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference on Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travellers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by Atlantic magazine. Like Musk’s SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near Earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with Nasa to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies Nasa selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travellers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It’s like building the Union Pacific railroad,” Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as US$100 000. Boeing built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful US rocket ever built, which took men to the moon. Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market”. The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said. “I think it’s a fascinating area for us,” he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, travelling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Science fiction Boeing and Lockheed Martin are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly US travellers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 21 000km/h), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing’s X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. “That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will,” he said. “The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.”  — © 2016 NewsCentral Media Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 10Brian Molefe quits as Eskom CEO 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 9New ICT BEE code comes into force 8New protector must probe Thuli: ANC 7Social media analysis pointing to Trump upset Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The deal is part of efforts to rebuild Iran’s elderly fleet, an agreement included in a 2015 pact between Tehran and six world powers to lift most Western sanctions in exchange for limiting Iran’s stockpiles of substances that could be used to make nuclear weapons. “We won’t deliver any aircraft under that deal this year — these are deliveries that are a year, two, three downstream,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Chicago on future technologies. “But it’s significant opportunity for us and I’m pleased to see that we’re making steady progress.” Iran announced plans in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Europe’s Airbus but has complained about unexpected delays in receiving U.S. licenses, which are needed due to the large number of U.S.-supplied parts. Boeing has also agreed to provide jets to Iran as it emerges from sanctions. Frustrated with the delays, an Iranian official told Reuters last month that the Airbus deal could be reduced by six airplanes and the Boeing deal could be clipped by one jet to 108 aircraft instead of 109. Muilenburg said Boeing is “in the final stages of working through the deal structure with our customers in Iran” while also working through the U.S. government licensing process. The CEO also said that the company’s target to match airplane orders to deliveries this year “versus spreading those orders out over a couple of quarters is not a pressing business issue for us.” Credit : Voice of America (VOA) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Share on Skype (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Arts & Entertainment Museums 'Above and Beyond' at MSI will let you fly — kind of Above and Beyond exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry Jeff Buonomo, Manager of Special Exhibitions at the Museum of Science and Industry discusses the new Above and Beyond exhibit at the museum on Oct. 4, 2016. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Jeff Buonomo, Manager of Special Exhibitions at the Museum of Science and Industry discusses the new Above and Beyond exhibit at the museum on Oct. 4, 2016. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Steve JohnsonContact ReporterChicago Tribune In "Above and Beyond," the new exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry about humanity's urge to defy gravity, visitors can fly like an eagle — or maybe it's a seagull — amid seaside cliffs. They can design and pilot a fighter jet. And they can clean up space junk. Granted, these video simulations are not dissimilar to what you might be able to do at home with an Xbox and time on your hands. But at the South Side science palace, the activities are presented in a broader context, as part of an effort by big planemaker Boeing to inspire people to want to work in the aerospace industry. The exhibit, which opened Tuesday and will be up through January, is one of three such that Boeing, working with partners including NASA and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, currently has traveling the world's museums and science centers. Its not nearly as promotional in the execution as it might sound in the concept. ct-ent-1005-flight-exhibit-museum-science-industry Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune Students from from Immaculate Conception St. Joseph in Chicago fly along with birds at the "Spread Your Wings" exhibit as the Museum of Science and Industry, Students from from Immaculate Conception St. Joseph in Chicago fly along with birds at the "Spread Your Wings" exhibit as the Museum of Science and Industry, (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) The Boeing branding is there, as the show uses many images of Boeing aircraft and Boeing wind-tunnel models and the like. But other companies are present as well. And more than a flat-out recruiting poster, like the recent MSI exhibit by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the same museum galleries, this show is a snapshot of what is cutting-edge in flight, both within Earth's atmosphere and beyond it. MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR So along with the video-game components — simple enough for children, but compelling enough to engage adults — visitors will see scale models of many current or next-generation aircraft, including a powerful new rocket designed for space travel. And they'll see full-size versions of some drones, known in the trade as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle). These include Robobee, a craft displayed under a microscope that attempts to mimic the humble honeybee's complex flight mechanics, and a slightly larger hummingbird simulator, another aircraft using the flapping of wings as propulsion. There's a big, touch-screen light board that will take you, episodically, through the history of flight. In a neat, back-to-the-roots touch, the entry displays a roughly 14-foot-wide model of the B&W Seaplane, the first product by Boeing, now headquartered in Chicago. It was made, we learn, of wood, linen, and wire, none of which could have withstood the big weight that patrons later on get to drop onto a sheet of a newer plane material, carbon fiber.

Chicago is commemorating 100 years of flight and space exploration with a new exhibit titled "Above and Beyond." (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) But while you'll likely stay for the wealth of information about where flight is at right now and where it is going, you may very well come, and bring your kids, for the video game aspects. After trying the avian flight simulator, which turns your silhouette into a bird's, your arms into wings, I can report that birds must have ridiculously strong shoulder muscles. In other words — borrowed from an old joke, in fact — I went to "Above and Beyond" at the Museum of Science and Industry, and boy, are my arms tired. sajohnson@chicagotribune.com Twitter @StevenKJohnson MORE FROM STEVE JOHNSON: Penguins making a comeback at Lincoln Park Zoo Museum goodness abounds this fall.

Enlarge photo. Ford Motor Co. President and Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally is a Lawrence native. Email Print Facebook Tweet Post a comment By Sara Shepherd — Lawrence Journal-World October 4, 2016 Advertisement Former Ford Motor Co. President and CEO Alan Mulally, a University of Kansas graduate, will speak this week at KU. Mulally is scheduled to present the KU School of Business Anderson Chandler Lecture, “Creating Value,” at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Lied Center. The event is free and open to the public. He received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from KU, according to an announcement from the KU business school. He also earned a master's degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow. His professional experience spans both engineering and the automotive industry. Mulally led Ford from 2006 to 2014, when he retired. Previously he was executive vice president of Boeing Co., president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and president of Boeing Information, Space and Defense Systems. Among Mulally’s most visible recognitions: being named No. 3 on Fortune's "World's Greatest Leaders" list and one of the "World's Most Influential People" by TIME magazine.  He has received numerous other honors, including being inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in July. He also serves on numerous boards, including President Barack Obama’s Export Council, and is a past president of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a past board chairman of the Governors of the Aerospace Industries Association. Mulally grew up in Lawrence, graduated from Lawrence High School, and has made public appearances in town several times while the head of Ford. In 2010 he spoke at the Lawrence Schools Foundation Community Education Breakfast. He spoke to engineering and other students at KU in 2009. He also visited KU in 2008 to accept the Kappa Sigma fraternity's 2007 Man of the Year award. “We are proud to welcome Alan Mulally back to his alma mater to deliver the 2016 Anderson Chandler Lecture," interim KU business dean James Guthrie, said. "This accomplished Jayhawk is one of the world’s great business leaders, and we look forward to hearing his insights on ‘Creating Value.’” KU’s previous Chandler lecturers have included Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, FBI agent and KU School of Business alumnus Robert Herndon, and former Kansas Gov. Bill Graves. The business school is presenting Mulally’s talk in partnership with the KU School of Engineering’s Self Engineering Leadership Fellows Program.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, October 5, 2016 Updated: 5:55 AM, October 5, 2016 DOHA — Gulf carrier Qatar Airways and Boeing will hold a news conference on Friday (Oct 9), a spokeswoman for Qatar Airways told Reuters on Wednesday, as a big sale of Boeing widebody jetliners looked close to being clinched. Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up US approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. If the deal is finalised, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost in a year when orders for widebody planes has slumped. Last Wednesday, the United States began notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at about US$4 billion (S$5.48 billion). Last week people familiar with the situation said Qatar Airways was in the process of firming up an order for Boeing jets, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow in Britain. The deal was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up US approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. The deal postponed in July was a top-up deal for about five Boeing 777-300ER worth US$1.7 billion at list prices, people familiar with the talks said, but the order could expand as the Gulf airline continues to target significant growth despite concerns over the Gulf economy. Bloomberg last week reported the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. The airline is also in talks for about two dozen Boeing 737 MAX jetliners, aviation market sources said. Boeing and Qatar Airways declined to comment on the details of Friday's planned announcement. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. Separately, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the company is making progress on a deal to provide more than 100 commercial airplanes to Iran though none will be delivered in 2016.

Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. Like Musk’s SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies NASA selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Mars Transport Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travelers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It’s like building the Union Pacific railroad,” Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as $100,000.

Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market.” The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said. “I think it’s a fascinating area for us,” he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, traveling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Science Fiction Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly U.S. travelers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing’s X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. “That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will,” he said. “The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources told Reuters. If the deal is finalised, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost in a year when orders for widebody planes has slumped. Last Wednesday, the United States began notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at about $4 billion.

The deal is part of efforts to rebuild Iran's elderly fleet, an agreement included in a 2015 pact between Tehran and six world powers to lift most Western sanctions in exchange for limiting Iran's stockpiles of substances that could be used to make nuclear weapons. "We won't deliver any aircraft under that deal this year - these are deliveries that are a year, two, three downstream," Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Chicago on future technologies. "But it's significant opportunity for us and I'm pleased to see that we're making steady progress." Iran announced plans in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Europe's Airbus but has complained about unexpected delays in receiving U.S. licenses, which are needed due to the large number of U.S.-supplied parts. Boeing has also agreed to provide jets to Iran as it emerges from sanctions. Frustrated with the delays, an Iranian official told Reuters last month that the Airbus deal could be reduced by six airplanes and the Boeing deal could be clipped by one jet to 108 aircraft instead of 109. Muilenburg said Boeing is "in the final stages of working through the deal structure with our customers in Iran" while also working through the U.S. government licensing process. The CEO also said that the company's target to match airplane orders to deliveries this year "versus spreading those orders out over a couple of quarters is not a pressing business issue for us."

Boeing's Kenneth Swope   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Aerospace * Boeing * CIMdata By Industry: * AerospaceANN ARBOR, Mich. - Oct. 4, 2016 - PRLog -- CIMdata, Inc., the leading global PLM strategic management consulting and research firm, announces that Kenneth Swope of Boeing Commercial Airplanes will open PLM Road Map™ for the Aerospace & Defense Industry in collaboration with PDT Europe with a keynote presentation on "Model-Based Definition and Bill of Material Definition to Facilitate Information Flow Through the Product Lifecycle." PLM Road Map for the Aerospace & Defense Industry will take place on November 8 at The Renaissance Paris La Defense, Paris, France. PDT Europe will take place at the same location on November 9-10. Modern engineering design systems have enabled significant productivity improvements in the design process and have contributed to an explosion of information around the design that confounds downstream utilization of the design data. Designers spend an ever increasing percentage of their time working with supplemental information and less time doing technical work. The customization of design practices and data leads to the need for specialized training, which in turn increases the "on boarding" costs for new employees and limits the ability to share resources from other programs or from design centers. In addition, production systems and suppliers are given more information than is needed which creates confusion. Unique, poorly documented custom data representations make it difficult to integrate, maintain, and replace information systems. To address this pain-point a group of like-minded industry peers came together to jointly fund and staff a project team to identify root causes and potential remedies. In his keynote presentation, Mr. Swope will share a high level review of the objectives, requirements, and a roadmap for the definition and implementation of a "minimum digital thread." The project involved reaching agreement on the minimum content required in full 3D model-based definition and engineering bill of material definition, agreeing on a set of standards for representation of this information, communicating objectives and requirements to solution providers for their review and comment, and reaching closure on a joint plan of action. As the Business Capabilities Architecture Lead at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Mr. Swope is responsible for the integrated set of business architecture products related to Boeing's airplane business. These products include business requirements, performance measures, business data, and process management. In addition, Mr. Swope leads the organization that is integrating the future state architecture and plan for Boeing Commercial Airplanes' processes and tools. During his 22 years at Boeing, Mr. Swope has worked in manufacturing research, operations research, program management, and product change management.

 SpaceX and its biggest competitors are waging a space battle on Capitol Hill Dave Mosher and Rebecca Harrington Oct. 4, 2016, 1:46 PM 8,102 facebook linkedin twitter email print SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Flickr; iStock: Paul Sancya/AP; Skye Gould/Business Insider A space battle is being fought on Capitol Hill, and a fleet of rocket companies are using millions of lobbying dollars to wage it. The core struggle is between SpaceX, founded in 2002 by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, and United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is jointly owned by aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin. At stake is roughly $70 billion worth of Pentagon satellite launch contracts through 2030, plus what some members of Congress argue is the safety of future astronauts. While the skirmish dates back more than a decade, lawmakers began sparring over issues central to each company's interests in the past week — just days after SpaceX founder Elon Musk debuted his bold vision for colonizing Mars. On September 27, Rep. Mike Coffman (R-CO), who represents the district where ULA is headquartered, penned a four-page congressional letter with nine other House Republicans and sent it to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NASA, and the US Air Force (USAF). The oversight letter — which has no legal authority, but government organizations almost always respond to — calls on the federal agencies to take control of SpaceX's internally led investigations and specifically references the company's most recent rocket failures on September 1, 2016, and June 28, 2015. "These failures could have spelled disaster, even loss of life, had critical national security payloads or NASA crew been aboard those rockets," the letter states. "Both SpaceX failures occurred after the Air Force certified the Falcon 9 launch vehicle for US national security launches, less than fifteen months ago." But on Tuesday, October 4, a larger, bipartisan group of 24 members of Congress delivered a rebuttal. Their letter urges the FAA, NASA, and USAF to stay the course. "Accidents are unfortunate events, and accident investigations should not be politicized. We encourage you to reject calls for your organizations to abandon established, well considered, and long standing procedures," states the letter, led by Rep. Bill Flores (R-TX), whose district includes a large SpaceX facility. Beyond any convictions about how the commercial space industry should work, and what constitutes appropriate use of taxpayer dollars, lobbyist spending seems to be driving the latest feud. In 2015 alone, SpaceX dropped almost $1.8 million on its lobbying efforts — up from about $569,000 just 5 years earlier, according to data gathered by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (which tracks federal campaign contributions and lobbying efforts on its website opensecrets.org) But the company could be vastly outspent by its competitors. ULA dropped nearly $1.5 million in 2015, up from $120,000 in 2010. Meanwhile, Boeing poured nearly $21.9 million in 2015 into defense and aerospace lobbying (up from $17.9 million in 2010) and Lockheed Martin spent almost $13.8 million in 2015 (up from $12.7 million in 2010). It's unclear if and how much the joint owners of ULA spend to back its interests, since both companies develop a vast amount of US military technologies, but it stands to reason some of it could be used to support ULA. (Neither company addressed our inquiry into the matter.) In either case, a sizable cut of that money has ended up in the campaign coffers of many lawmakers who seem to be fighting on the companies' behalves. A drawn-out space battle A ULA-built Atlas V rocket launches the Juno spacecraft toward Jupiter in 2011. Bill Ingalls/NASA The rivalry between the rocket-launching companies goes back at least a decade. Boeing and Lockheed Martin used to compete against each other for military launch contracts, but in 2005 they announced their plan to lay down arms and form a joint rocket-launching business: ULA. At the time, SpaceX was just 3-year-old rocket company with few launches under its belt — and a lot to prove. It nonetheless sued Boeing and Lockheed Martin in October 2005 in an attempt to block ULA's formation under antitrust law. A judge dismissed SpaceX's lawsuit in February 2006 on the grounds that the company had no suitable alternative. The FTC later (and reluctantly) approved the joint venture in October 2006, expressing that, while it was concerned about "anticompetitive harm", the Pentagon needed "assured access to space" and ULA was the only real option. SpaceX didn't forget about ULA's military spaceflight monopoly, yet chose to focus its energies elsewhere. Over the next 8 years, Musk's aerospace company matured its Falcon 9 rocket design, figured out how to build rocket boosters that can land themselves at sea, bagged contracts with telecommunications satellite providers, and worked toward winning NASA contracts to resupply the space station (and eventually launch people into space). But in September 2013, when SpaceX says it was "just days away" from its third and final certification flight — which the USAF requires to compete with ULA for Pentagon contracts — the Air Force quietly inked a contract with ULA to fly its next 36 launches. SpaceX sued the government over the deal in April 2014, detailing its rationale in a press release: "Since the merger, not only have there been no savings but costs have skyrocketed. Vehicle costs are up from approximately $100M per vehicle to $400M per vehicle—making ULA's launch vehicles the most expensive not just in the US, but the world. In addition, the United States pays ULA nearly $1 billion dollars per year just to maintain the ability to launch—regardless of whether or not they launch a single rocket. ... "To be clear, SpaceX is not seeking to be awarded any launch contracts. We are simply seeking the opportunity to compete—and not just for SpaceX, but for any qualified company. If we compete and we lose, that's ok too." In January 2015, the US Justice Department settled with SpaceX, which dropped its lawsuit. Four months later, in May 2015, SpaceX earned its USAF certification, followed by receiving its first $83 million military satellite launch contract — a bid hundreds of millions of dollars less than ULA's typical pricing. Another flash point for SpaceX vs. Boeing-Lockheed-ULA involved a government rule limiting the use of Russian-made RD-180 engines, which are powerful devices that ULA uses to propel heavy military satellites into orbit. While Russia aggressively annexed Crimea in Ukraine, SpaceX lobbied intensely to have the engines banned after 2019 in a re-authorization of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Since SpaceX makes its own rocket engines, passage of the rule might have guaranteed its own military launch monopoly. But Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) — to whom SpaceX contributed at least $16,500 in the latest election cycle, and who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee — ultimately backed down from his position that allowing the use of RD-180s would be funding "Putin's top cronies". In a legislative compromise earlier this year, the NDAA re-authorization gave ULA permission to use 18 of the RD-180 engines on its rockets through 2022. (The much-deeper pockets of Boeing and Lockheed Martin almost certainly helped win the day.) Amid these legal actions, SpaceX suffered two launch failures (in 2012 and 2015) and a string of anomalies at launch — giving Coffman and other politicians multiple openings to wade into the fray. Rocket-powered lobbying Rep. Mike Coffman. Associated Press Raising issues about SpaceX, its launch failures and anomalies, and its relationship with the US government is not a first for Coffman. As a member of the House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee, which oversees military spacecraft, he did so in 2014, and in 2015 on multiple occasions. (His calls for change were mostly rebuffed by government agencies.) The congressman now faces a tough 2016 reelection campaign in his district — the home base of ULA. Records show that, during his political career, Coffman has accepted at least $51,800 in campaign donations from Lockheed Martin and $21,000 from Boeing, and has publicly defended ULA. In the 2016 election cycle, SpaceX contributed money to at least half of the 24 signers of the congressional letter that responded to (and contested) Coffman's. Flores himself has taken at least $2,000, and cosigner Loretta Sanchez (D-CA) accepted at least $7,000 from SpaceX. Flores also presides over district 17 in Texas, which is home to SpaceX's 4,000-acre rocket development facility in the town of McGregor. Samantha Masunaga, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, captured the friction well in a story published in May 2016 "Traditional launch providers see their market being threatened by nontraditional entrants," Loren Thompson, aerospace analyst at the Lexington Institute think tank (which is funded by Boeing and Lockheed Martin), told Masunaga. "Basically, this is competition between launch providers over market share and money that in the political process gets related to local interests." Business Insider contacted Rep. Coffman's press secretary as well as ULA about campaign funding and other issues related to this story, but we did not immediately receive a response. A representative from Boeing could not immediately provide a comment, and a Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment. Representatives from Rep. Flores' office did not immediately reply, and a SpaceX spokesperson told Business Insider that he was looking into getting us a response. Despite the apparent turf-based lobbying war, Coffman and his colleagues are not alone in their critique of how government agencies permit SpaceX to internally lead their own mishap investigations — and, by extension, other rocket companies like Orbital ATK and ULA. (Both have led their own investigations in recent years.) In fact, a June 2016 audit by NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) argues that internally led probes don't meet the bar for being independent. Semi-internal investigations The SpaceX explosion during a test on the launch pad in September 2016 (left), and the explosion mid-air delivering supplies to the International Space Station in June 2015. NASA/Business Insider The first SpaceX incident in question was an in-flight explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on June 28, 2015, which destroyed a NASA payload bound for the International Space Station. SpaceX followed a pre-approved plan to do an internal accident investigation with some federal oversight, ultimately determining that a faulty strut had caused the accident. The June 2016 NASA OIG audit concluded that investigation lacked Independence "because 11 of the 12 voting members were SpaceX employees." "While not required in the CRS-1 contract, this lack of independence does not meet Government best practice standards for NASA, NTSB, and USAF investigations and could impact the board's ability to identify the root cause and make corrective actions," the report read. NASA only partially agreed with OIG's assessment, stating that company expertise and close collaboration with federal agencies made for an efficient process to identify the root cause and get back to flying rockets.  SpaceX's most recent incident was a launchpad fireball of a Falcon 9 rocket on September 1, 2016, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The percussive blaze destroyed a $200 million satellite that Facebook planned to lease, and SpaceX again followed a federal law to perform its own investigation (since no people were harmed). That investigation isn't done, though a helium system seems to be at fault. Musk said in a press call on September 27 that the company hasn't lost any contracts because of the incident. "If something happens to SpaceX, it gets 100 times more press ... The public may think that our rockets fail, but actually lots of rockets fail," he told reporters. "This is a small thing on a long road. There will probably be other failures in the future." For its ongoing investigation, SpaceX nearly doubled its team to a core group of "around 20 people," of which "more than half are representatives from FAA, NASA, US Air Force and industry experts," a company spokesperson previously told Business Insider in an email. Leading the entire group is Hans Koenigsmann — SpaceX's vice president of mission assurance. "[W]e believe he is the best person to do so," the spokesperson said. "We are collaborating very closely with the participating agencies, sharing raw data and providing access to meetings." But the 10 signers of the first congressional letter do not seem satisfied with the internally led process. "We feel strongly that the current investigation should be led by NASA and the Air Force to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied and that the outcomes are sufficient to prevent NASA and military launch mishaps in the future," the letter states. John Taylor, a SpaceX spokesperson, declined to comment when provided a copy of the first letter. How federal agencies responded A SpaceX Falcon 9 lifts off and lands part of the rocket back on Earth. Twitter/SpaceX The first letter calls on the FAA, USAF, and NASA for their responses to the letter by October 31, 2016. Business Insider forwarded both a draft and then a signed letter to those agencies as well as to the DoD (which is named in the letter) and asked for comment. Hank Price, an FAA spokesperson, told Business Insider "it'd take some time to draft a response, and we wouldn't respond to it until we'd spoken to the Congressman first." Another FAA spokesperson later told Business Insider in an email: "The FAA received the letter late Thursday afternoon and has not had a chance to review it. Safety of all operations, including commercial space, is our top priority, and the FAA is closely overseeing the accident investigation. We will respond to the members of Congress in a timely manner." NASA representatives for the agency's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate told Business Insider in an email "we haven't officially received this, but even when we do, we wouldn't be able to comment in advance of responding." Laura Seal, a DoD spokesperson, told Business Insider by email that the "letter is not addressed to the Department of Defense. If we do receive a letter from Congress on this topic for response, we would respond directly to the author." Representatives at the USAF did not immediately reply. The congressional letters Below is the full text of the first letter, from Coffman's group on September 27: And the second letter from Flores' contingent, released October 4: Correction: A previous version of this post misstated which entity settled SpaceX's April 2014 lawsuit. The US Justice Department, which represents the USAF in legal proceedings, reached an agreement with SpaceX in January 2015 (not ULA).

During Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar's visit to the US in August, Boeing and Lockheed Martin made official proposals to manufacture F/A-18 and F-16s respectively under the "Make in India" campaign. Air Chief Marshal Raha said that companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and SAAB had offered to set up manufacturing units for combat aircraft in India. India and France have already signed an intergovernmental agreement for 36 Rafale combat aircraft. The first Rafale is expected to be inducted into Indian Air Force by 2019. "Any air force would be proud to have aircraft of the Rafale class, which is in the mid-weight category. A decision on more numbers of Rafale jets will be taken in the near future which would be based on its capability," said Raha. © YouTube: Shiv Aroor India’s Deployment of BrahMos Supersonic Stealth Missile is Making China NervousRaha said that Sweden's Gripen fighter aircraft is a good fighter as compared to others like the F-16, but their final decision will take into consideration whomever gives the best deal, the capabilities and the transfer of technology. Earlier in June this year, Raha inspected the SAAB production facility in Linkoping, Sweden.

LATEST UPDATE HERE: Airlines change-fee waivers expand north as Matthew nears (Wednesday, Oct. 6) Air travelers were keeping a wary eye on Hurricane Matthew as forecasts continued to show it tracking toward the U.S. East Coast later this week. Underscoring the ominous forecast, several big U.S. airlines have extended their Matthew-related change-fee waivers to cover U.S. airports. That all comes as Matthew churns through the Caribbean and looks increasingly likely to at least come close to Florida and other East Coast states. A U.S. landfall remained a possibility by late week, though the storm’s projected path still had a large degree of uncertainty. For now, Matthew forced airlines to cancel some flights to Caribbean islands like Jamaica, Haiti and the Turks and Caicos.  U.S. fliers headed to those regions this week should prepare for disruptions.

Other airports in the nation were halting flights Tuesday.

USA TODAY The U.S. State Department had issued travel warnings related to Matthew, advising Americans in parts of Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas to leave ahead of the storm, if possible. FLIGHT TRACKER: Is your flight on time? USA TODAY World's strangest-looking airplane? A closer look at the Airbus 'Beluga' By Tuesday afternoon, the nation's three biggest airlines -- American, Delta and United -- had all added certain U.S. destinations to their change-fee waivers. JetBlue had done the same. Previously, all the Matthew-related change-fee waivers of U.S. airlines had been limited to Caribbean destinations. Generally speaking, the change-fee waivers allow customers to make one change to their itineraries without paying additional charges or fares. The fine print varies by airline and by destination. More airlines will likely issue waivers for U.S. airports as Matthew continues to track closer to the U.S. coastline.

The sale fares also include longer routes, with the price of flights loosely tied to distance. Flights begin at $49 each way on Southwest’s shortest routes and increase to $79, $99 or $129 each way for longer flights. The sale launched Tuesday morning, covering travel from Nov. 30 through Dec. 20 and from Jan. 4 through Feb. 15. Flights on Fridays and Sundays are excluded. The sale fares apply specifically to nonstop options, though many connecting itineraries may also show lower-than-usual fares. Fares on some routes appeared to be even lower than the advertised $49 early Tuesday morning. Prices between Baltimore and Boston, for example, were showing on the carrier's website at just $41 each way -- or about $82 round-trip. Some Denver-Omaha round-trips were available for about $92. Southwest’s new international routes are also included in the sale, though those routes come with significantly more restrictions. Fares range from $99 to $239 each way, depending on the route. But those prices are only offered on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. For those who can jump through those day-of-travel hoops, Southwest’s sale covers international flights from Nov. 30 through Dec. 13 and from Jan. 10 through March 2. Either way, bargain seekers will have to act quickly to snag the fares. The sale ends on Thursday (Oct. 6) at 11:59 p.m. local time in city of the departing flight.

It has rolled out similar three-day sales each June and October for the past several years. One sale from June 2015 proved so popular that it crashed Southwest’s website, prompting the carrier to extend that particular sale by an additional 24 hours. In a bit of extra good news for customers, Southwest’s latest sale that came out Tuesday rolled back restrictions the carrier had added to the last broad sale in June. In that sale, Southwest offered its domestic sale fares only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Southwest has used the sales to generate buzz and -- perhaps more importantly -- to sell seats during what are usually some of the slowest travel periods of the year. In earlier versions of the sales, Southwest had pegged fares to mileage thresholds. Earlier this decade, for example, Southwest priced its sale fares at $49 each way for flights of 500 miles or less and prices increased from there. Flights of 501 to 1,000 miles cost $99 each way and flights of 1,001 to 1,500 miles cost $129 each way. Flights of more than 1,500 miles went for $149 each way. Southwest ended the precise mileage component of its big sales a few years ago, but its big sales have continued to closely mimic its previous distance-based promotions. The carrier's four advertised sale-fare tiers for this sale — $49, $99, $129 and $149 each way — match the fares it offered on its distance-based sales of years past. Among the sub-$100 options: Atlanta-Akron/Canton; Albuquerque-Los Angeles; Baltimore-Boston; Boise-Spokane; Chicago Midway-Minneapolis/St. Paul; Cleveland-St. Louis; Dallas Love-Houston Hobby; Denver-Salt Lake City; Kansas City-Milwaukee; Los Angeles-San Francisco; Memphis-Dallas Love; New York LaGuardia-Indianapolis; Oklahoma City-Houston Hobby; Omaha-Denver; Orlando-Atlanta; Pittsburgh-Chicago Midway; Richmond-Atlanta; San Antonio-El Paso; San Diego-Sacramento; Seattle-Oakland; Tucson-Las Vegas; Washington Reagan National-Providence; Wichita-St. Louis.

The sale fares also include longer routes, with the price of flights loosely tied to distance. Flights begin at $49 each way on Southwest’s shortest routes and increase to $79, $99 or $129 each way for longer flights. The sale launched Tuesday morning, covering travel from Nov. 30 through Dec. 20 and from Jan. 4 through Feb. 15. Flights on Fridays and Sundays are excluded. The sale fares apply specifically to nonstop options, though many connecting itineraries may also show lower-than-usual fares. Fares on some routes appeared to be even lower than the advertised $49 early Tuesday morning. Prices between Baltimore and Boston, for example, were showing on the carrier's website at just $41 each way -- or about $82 round-trip. Some Denver-Omaha round-trips were available for about $92. Southwest’s new international routes are also included in the sale, though those routes come with significantly more restrictions. Fares range from $99 to $239 each way, depending on the route. But those prices are only offered on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. For those who can jump through those day-of-travel hoops, Southwest’s sale covers international flights from Nov. 30 through Dec. 13 and from Jan. 10 through March 2. Either way, bargain seekers will have to act quickly to snag the fares. The sale ends on Thursday (Oct. 6) at 11:59 p.m. local time in city of the departing flight.

It has rolled out similar three-day sales each June and October for the past several years. One sale from June 2015 proved so popular that it crashed Southwest’s website, prompting the carrier to extend that particular sale by an additional 24 hours. In a bit of extra good news for customers, Southwest’s latest sale that came out Tuesday rolled back restrictions the carrier had added to the last broad sale in June. In that sale, Southwest offered its domestic sale fares only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Southwest has used the sales to generate buzz and -- perhaps more importantly -- to sell seats during what are usually some of the slowest travel periods of the year. In earlier versions of the sales, Southwest had pegged fares to mileage thresholds. Earlier this decade, for example, Southwest priced its sale fares at $49 each way for flights of 500 miles or less and prices increased from there. Flights of 501 to 1,000 miles cost $99 each way and flights of 1,001 to 1,500 miles cost $129 each way. Flights of more than 1,500 miles went for $149 each way. Southwest ended the precise mileage component of its big sales a few years ago, but its big sales have continued to closely mimic its previous distance-based promotions. The carrier's four advertised sale-fare tiers for this sale — $49, $99, $129 and $149 each way — match the fares it offered on its distance-based sales of years past. Among the sub-$100 options: Atlanta-Akron/Canton; Albuquerque-Los Angeles; Baltimore-Boston; Boise-Spokane; Chicago Midway-Minneapolis/St. Paul; Cleveland-St. Louis; Dallas Love-Houston Hobby; Denver-Salt Lake City; Kansas City-Milwaukee; Los Angeles-San Francisco; Memphis-Dallas Love; New York LaGuardia-Indianapolis; Oklahoma City-Houston Hobby; Omaha-Denver; Orlando-Atlanta; Pittsburgh-Chicago Midway; Richmond-Atlanta; San Antonio-El Paso; San Diego-Sacramento; Seattle-Oakland; Tucson-Las Vegas; Washington Reagan National-Providence; Wichita-St. Louis.

(Boeing) Speaking during the Association of the US Army's annual conference, Colonel Rob Barrie said that the contract would be for nine additional US Army aircraft plus the potential for 150 Foreign Military Sales (FMS) units. The US Army's acquisition executive in January gave the service permission to proceed with the Chinook Block 2 upgrade programme, an effort aimed at both the Boeing CH-47F and MH-47G fleets in the 2020s. The plan includes new or remanufactured airframes for both regular and special forces units. The army hopes to achieve Milestone B approval quickly and then enter an engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase, Col Barrie said. The army is studying new technologies such as the Advanced Chinook Rotor Blade (ACRB) and other upgrades that would bring the regular army's Chinook's more closely in line with the special forces fleet. This ACRB enhancement would raise the baseline CH-47F's payload from the current 10,886 kg to about 16,286 kg, according to Boeing. It would also increase lift capability by approximately 900 kg per blade (5,400 kg for the helicopter). Company officials have said that the ACRB could be ready for fielding in about 2019. Block 2 will also open the door to an improved engine for the Chinook. The Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE) programme will most likely be competed, Col Barrie added. General Electric Aviation has conducted development work, as has incumbent Honeywell, which has formed a partnership with Pratt & Whitney for the project. Want to read more?

However, the aircraft was landed safely and then grounded. Windshield cracks happen due to uneven heating or something hitting the windshield. | TNN | Updated: Oct 4, 2016, 10.52 AM IST Highlights The windshield of an Air India Dreamliner cracked while flying into Chennai from Singapore on Sunday Windshield cracks happen due to uneven heating or something hitting the windshield AI is hoping that this is a one-off caseRepresentative image NEW DELHI: The windshield of an Air India Dreamliner cracked while flying into Chennai from Singapore on Sunday. However, the aircraft was landed safely and then grounded. AI has faced several instances of windshield cracks in the Boeing 787 and the US major has in last two to three years carried out several modifications to check this issue. "The latest problem happened when the aircraft was approaching Chennai. A windshield has two layers. One of the layers was cracked and the other was intact. So the plane landed safely. The Boeing has managed to reduce the occurrence of windshield cracks in the B-787 and this has re-occurred after some time. The windshield was changed on Monday afternoon and the plane is back in the air," said an official. AI is hoping that this is a one-off case and not the beginning of yet another round of windshield cracks in the Dreamliner. The airline has in the past raised the issue of frequent windshield cracks — which used to be the most recurring problem in its Dreamliner — with Boeing which had managed to control the menace in recent past. Windshield cracks happen due to uneven heating or something hitting the windshield. "This happens when a foreign object hits aircraft which are more than five years old. The Dreamliners have been in AI fleet for just over four years," said a source. "The ongoing investigation by Boeing indicates that moisture ingress has resulted in an increased rate of occurrence (of windshield cracks). A new window design with improved features is in progress to reduce such incidents. The occurrences experienced on the airplanes were cracking of the non-structural outer glass ply, which does not affect the safety of the airplane due to the windshield's 'fail safe' (multiple-layer) construction. AI has taken up the issue with Boeing, who have informed that old windshields shall be replaced by new windshields with improved design features," the aviation ministry had told Parliament in a written reply about two years back when this problem had become a regular affair. Pune rejected take off The Air India flight which had to abort take-off at Pune on Sunday and then evacuate passengers using chutes on the runway had got an 'engine failure' message for one its engines when it was taxiing to get airborne for Delhi. "As a precaution, while taxiing, the pilot was asked to check the engine performance at full power as some repair work was carried out on an engine earlier. At this point, the pilot got a message of engine failure. While returning to the parking bay, the air traffic control saw smoke emitting from the engine and the passengers were then evacuated using slides," said an official. This scare happened on an Airbus A-321 (VT-PPQ) when it was to take off as AI 854 to Delhi. Following examination of the engine, it was found that the engine failure message was incorrect. AI is sending the details of the engine test to the equipment manufacturer. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. Like Musk’s SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies NASA selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Mars Transport Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travelers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It’s like building the Union Pacific railroad,” Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as $100,000. Boeing built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful U.S. rocket ever built, which took men to the moon. Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market.” The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said. “I think it’s a fascinating area for us,” he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, traveling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Science Fiction Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly U.S. travelers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing’s X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. “That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will,” he said. “The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.” Boeing Co.

REUTERS/Anthony Deutsch BY ALEXEI SOBCHENKO The report of the Dutch-led investigation team on the shoot down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine offered a momentary glimpse into the true nature of the proverbial riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. Instead of denying any Russian involvement in the death of 298 people in July 2014, a number of official spokespersons, journalists, and bloggers known for their close ties to the Kremlin reacted nervously and with contradictory responses. Dismissing the report as based on “speculation, unqualified and unprofessional information,” Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov hinted vaguely that new data on the crash had emerged. A representative of Almaz-Antey, the company that produces the Buk missile (the model that destroyed the Malaysian Boeing), did not rule out an accidental launch caused by poor maintenance and a possible violation of procedures by the missile launch crew. A permanent fixture in the presidential press corps, Andrei Kolesnikov, indicated that Russian President Vladimir Putin could have been misled by his advisers, speculating that if Putin finds out that pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas deliberately shot down a civilian airliner, he will turn his back on them. And the chief editor of the influential Echo Moskvy radio station, Alexei Venediktov, said something similar, though he presumed that Putin would thoroughly investigate Russian military involvement in this tragedy. This unusual variety of perspectives on such a crucial issue betrays fear in Moscow’s official circles. Before the report, Kremlin propaganda denied not only Russian or separatist involvement in the tragedy, but even refused to admit that the Boeing was shot down by a Russian-made missile. With a straight face, pro-Kremlin media quoted non-existent Spanish air traffic controller Carlos,Ukrainian Air Force Captain Voloshin, and other fakes, though none of the numerous explanations Moscow offered could hold water. Why would Peskov be so hesitant to deny Russian involvement now, while Almaz-Antey, Kolesnikov, Venediktov, and many others dared to spell out what had been anathema for Kremlin only days before? Putin and his cohorts have been caught red-handed in willful mendacity on many previous occasions and the Russian regime has invariably maintained its collective poker face. No one seriously expects the Russian government to extradite the accused perpetrators to the West. What caused such an uncoordinated response this time? The international investigative team indicated that about a hundred individuals were “linked to the crash or to the transport of the Buk” missile, though the investigators have yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. There is a chance that some of them belong to Russia’s top leadership, perhaps all the way up to Putin himself. We know what happened to the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi after he was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland. Gaddafi became an international pariah, banned from visiting all Western capitals other than New York during UN General Assembly sessions. A similar ban might be considered for the perpetrators of the MH17 shootdown. A quick detour through recent Soviet history can help clarify what such a ban would mean for contemporary Russian elites. Members of the old Soviet ruling class (nomenklatura) who had the privilege of traveling to the West were always conscious that behind them stood not only the military and nuclear might of a superpower, but also Marxism-Leninism. While that ideology was the object of boundless cynicism within the Soviet homeland and even within thenomenklatura, it was relentlessly propagated as an instrument of Soviet power abroad. Over the years, it made disciples among illustrious Ivy League professors, poor third world peasants, and prosperous French and Italian shopkeepers who joined the Communist Party. Regardless of their own lack of belief in communist ideals and its kingdom come of total equality, Sovietnomenklatura were well aware of the international weight of their country’s official ideology. Today’s Russia is not only a smaller and weaker country than the Soviet Union, but it also lacks a universal mobilizing ideology to offer the rest of the world and intimidate opponents. Russian Orthodox Christianity and Russian culture, outside of Russia, have nothing close to the attraction once exerted by Communism. Nor do they engender fear within the US or European governments. The new Russian elites have filled the resulting ideological void by indulging in high-end consumerism abroad. The symbols of their new religion are items from expensive Western stores, large apartments in Londonand New York, luxury yachts and private jets, and enrolling their offspring in boarding schools and universities in Britain and the US. Conspicuous, luxurious consumption abroad has become a defining element of their lifestyle. Being cut off from enjoying their wealth in the West would render Russian elites’ existence drab and even senseless. Nothing would scare them more than an extension of the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which banned a handful of Russian nationals from entering the US due to their complicity in the death of a Russian lawyer investigating corruption. The people responsible for downing MH17 could be subject to a similar travel ban. The dreadful idea of spending summer vacations on the Black Sea instead of the Cote d’Azur, shopping in Moscow instead of London or New York, and skiing in the Caucasus instead of Courchevel would probably suffice to turn some wealthy Russians against Putin. Russian history has several examples of Russian elites turning against their national leader. Putin has every reason to fear the fate of Tsars Peter III and Pavel I, or even General Secretary Joseph Stalin, who died under mysterious circumstances. Alexei Sobchenko, a UkraineAlert contributor, is an independent analyst and a former US Department of State employee.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 5, 2016 at 8:28AM Derived from the world-famous Global Hawk, Northrop's new MQ-4C promises to "make the world's oceans smaller" -- and easier to keep an eye on. Image source: Northrop Grumman. Three years ago, the U.S. Navy awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) to fund the continued development of its newest fixed-wing intelligence drone, the MQ-4C "Triton." Valued at just $28 million, it wasn't a big award, but it did serve to help keep the Triton project alive. And last week, that project finally bore fruit -- when the Navy gave Northrop a new $255.2 million contract, greenlighting construction of the first three production-model Tritons. News of this contract, for which delivery is due in August 2020, first appeared in the Pentagon's daily digest of contracts awarded last week. In a separate award that same day, the Navy ordered $95 million worth of spare parts to keep its new drones flying. Then, three days later, the Navy awarded Northrop even more money -- $49.4 million this time -- to fund the procurement of "long lead components" needed to build the new drones. Add it all up, and in just four days, Northrop Grumman netted just under $400 million in new revenues from Triton. What Triton is Northrop Grumman describes Triton's mission as providing "real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions." Derived from the company's successful Global Hawk drone, but tweaked to specialize in maritime missions, Triton's sensors monitor the ocean in a 360-degree circle. Triton is designed to fly for 24 hours at a time, at altitudes in excess of 10 miles -- and for distances as far as 8,200 nautical miles. Its mission will complement that of the lower-flying, lower-endurance manned P-8A Poseidon drone from Boeing (NYSE:BA). Boeing designed Poseidon primarily for maritime sub-hunting missions. Triton's long range and long endurance allow the drone to circumnavigate one third of the Earth's circumference in one hop before needing to refuel. Equipped with Northrop's own AN/ZPY-3 multifunction active sensor radar, it will monitor air, land, and sea traffic below it all the way. While official confirmation of the drone's capabilities are hard to come by, media reports suggest that one single Triton could potentially survey as much as 2,700,000 square miles of surface area in a single sortie. That's 10% of the Indian Ocean. Or 23% of Africa. Or...87% of the continental United States. What Triton costs According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Navy intends to purchase 66 Tritons at a cost of $130 million apiece ($183 million including research and development costs). Thus, the $400 million spent on buying and supplying three Tritons with spare parts last week probably comes very close to the mark on what the Pentagon will be spending on future Triton drones. In total, GAO values the entire Triton project at $12.8 billion, of which $8.9 billion remains to be spent. What it means for investors So, what do Northrop's new Triton contracts mean to investors in Northrop Grumman stock? More money, obviously. The $12.8 billion value of the Triton program is nearly 30% greater than the total revenues Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems business brought in last year (albeit Triton's revenues will be spread out over a number of years). And according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, these will be very high-margin revenues. S&P Global data show that Northrop's Aerospace unit earns operating profit margins of 12.2% -- 240 basis points better than the 9.8% Boeing earns at its Military Aircraft division. Over the course of the entire $12.8 billion program, investors can therefore expect Triton to generate as much as $1.6 billion in operating profit for Northrop, or roughly $8.74 per share, initially. And over the years to come, maintenance and upgrade revenues at similar margins can be expected. As big as last week's contracts were for Northrop Grumman stock owners, the good news is just beginning. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Boeing has already made a name for itself in space technology, building the first stage for the most powerful US launch vehicle ever flown, the Saturn V – which took astronauts to the Moon. Muilenburg says Boeing will continue to go great guns, envisaging space tourism “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market.” The challenge for the International Space Station (ISS) is to get joined in low-Earth orbit by scores of hotels and factories, carrying out micro-gravity manufacturing and research, Muilenburg said, according to Bloomberg. Read more Mars race to heat up with highly-anticipated SpaceX plan (PHOTOS, VIDEOS) “I think it’s a fascinating area for us,” he noted, adding that Boeing be busy making spacecraft for the new era of tourists. The aerospace giant is currently developing a heavy-lift rocket – NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) – set to become the most powerful rocket ever built, enabling diverse exploration, science and security missions. Boeing is the key contractor for the “design, development, test and production of the launch vehicle cryogenic stages, as well as development of the avionics suite.”  Boeing, along with SpaceX, are the first commercial companies chosen by NASA to deliver astronauts to the ISS. Billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk created a buzz last week, saying he is burning the midnight oil with his SpaceX program to make it possible for anybody who wants to resettle on Mars to do so. He wants humans to become “a multi-planetary species.” “What I want to do here is to make Mars seem possible, to make it seem that is something we can do in our lifetime, and that you can go,” the SpaceX CEO and lead designer told participants of the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. “Is there a way for anyone to go if they wanted to?” Musk wondered. Noting that of all the nearby celestial bodies, Mars and the moon are the most suitable, he said trips to Mars could occur every two years, with spaceships returned to Earth powered by methane mined on Mars and rockets refueling in orbit from rocket boosters. A million people would be required to start a colony on Mars, according to Musk, adding that it would be a real challenge to fund the endeavor and some funds can come from servicing the space station and launching satellites and government and private investment.

India invited bids in May for 22 attack helicopters and at least 15 heavy-lift helicopters as it plans to replace its aging Soviet-era fleet with modern weapon systems. The Apache will be a capable and lethal defender of India's troops and assets, while the Chinook will answer many of the country's military and humanitarian needs, Vivek Lall, vice president and India country head for Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, said on Friday. We have no idea of the timeline and how long will it take as we have just submitted our proposals, Lall told Reuters. The company has already signed a $2.1 billion contract for supplying eight P-8I warfare planes to the Indian Navy. The Indian government says it will priorities defense and push forward pending projects to modernize its armed forces especially after the Mumbai attacks in November revealed security loopholes. It is looking to spend more than $30 billion over the next five years to modernize its defense systems. (Editing by Nick Macfie) Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Boeing 'making progress' on airplane deal with Iran: CEO Reuters 10/4/2016 By Nick Carey © REUTERS/Jim Young The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the "What's Next?" conference in Chicago Aircraft maker Boeing Co (BA.N) is making progress on a deal to provide more than 100 commercial airplanes to Iran though none will be delivered in 2016, the company's top executive said on Tuesday. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 145.53 +0.20 +0.14% The deal is part of efforts to rebuild Iran's elderly fleet, an agreement included in a 2015 pact between Tehran and six world powers to lift most Western sanctions in exchange for limiting Iran's stockpiles of substances that could be used to make nuclear weapons. "We won't deliver any aircraft under that deal this year - these are deliveries that are a year, two, three downstream," Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Chicago on future technologies. "But it's significant opportunity for us and I'm pleased to see that we're making steady progress." Iran announced plans in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) but has complained about unexpected delays in receiving U.S. licenses, which are needed due to the large number of U.S.-supplied parts. © REUTERS/Jim Young President, Chairman and CEO of The Boeing Company Dennis Muilenburg speaks at the "What's Next?" conference in Chicago Boeing has also agreed to provide jets to Iran as it emerges from sanctions. Frustrated with the delays, an Iranian official told Reuters last month that the Airbus deal could be reduced by six airplanes and the Boeing deal could be clipped by one jet to 108 aircraft instead of 109. Muilenburg said Boeing is "in the final stages of working through the deal structure with our customers in Iran" while also working through the U.S. government licensing process. The CEO also said that the company's target to match airplane orders to deliveries this year "versus spreading those orders out over a couple of quarters is not a pressing business issue for us."

The US official also highlighted the draft agreement for the setting up of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco, inviting American companies to follow the example of the global giant. US economic operators can take advantage of investment opportunities in Morocco, particularly in the sectors of renewable energy, transport and tourism, said Kumar. Referring to the Moroccan-US trade relations, he noted that the two countries have made “significant” progress since the conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement in July 2005, expressing the hope to “continue on this path.” For his part, Vice president of Supply Chain Management, Finance &amp; Business Operations-Commercial Airplanes at the Boeing Company, Kevin Schemm, said that Morocco is a “model” of industrial development for other countries, particularly in the aerospace sector. He said that the draft agreement for the setting up of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco is part of a long-standing cooperation between Morocco and the US giant. He expressed the wish to further consolidate this relationship. In this regard, Schemm called for exploring the “important” opportunities of the aerospace industry, a growing sector in Morocco.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Describing the Rafale fighter jets as "exceptional", IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha today said the force would like to have more of the aircraft and insisted that the recently signed contract for 36 fighters was better than other such deals. He also spoke about "unsolicited offers" that India has received from Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin to manufacture fighter aircraft in India and said the company which offers the best deal will be selected. He said Saab's Gripen is a "good fighter" as compared to others like F-16 of Lockheed Martin but the decision will depend on many factors. "Any air force will be proud to have aircraft of the Rafale class which is in mid-weight category. In terms of its weapons capability, air-to-air missiles, beyond visual range, air-to-ground, its avionics, instrumentation and warfare suite, it is exceptional and one of the leading aircraft of the current generation," Raha said. Asked if 18 more aircraft would be procured, he said, "Well, we would like to have more. But it is a decision that will be taken in the near future." The 7.878 billion Euros (Rs 59,000 crore) deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets was signed on September 23. The new planes will give a big boost to IAF's defence and strike power. The most important aspect of the deal, apart from the fact that the Rafale is a 4.5 generation fighter jet, is the firepower that India is getting in the form of long-range and Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missiles. Rafale jets will come equipped with state-of-the-art missiles such as Meteor and Scalp. Meteor is a BVR air-to-air missile with a range in excess of 150km. "It is better in terms of price, performance-based logistics, missiles among others," he said on the Rafale deal in comparison to the MMRCA tender and deals signed by France with other countries in world. On the induction of light combat aircraft Tejas, he said it would be done in six squadrons, including the upgraded version. He said the next version called Tejas 'Mark-A' would come with better radar, weapons, avionics, and its production will start in 2021. Raha also said IAF would also be upgrading the Sukhoi 30 MKI fighter jets besides the Jaguar. On the integration of BrahMos missiles with the Sukhoi 30 MKI, Raha said, "We hope to fire a live missile in three months." The IAF chief, who heads the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC), a body of the three service chiefs, said he hoped the government would resolve the issues of the 7th Pay Commission and that the forces have decided to implement it based on the government's assurances.

The USAF contract will run until September 20, 2017. Other work contained within the deal include mission assurance, program management, systems engineering, integration of the space vehicle with the launch vehicle, launch site and range operations, and launch infrastructure maintenance and sustainment. A freedom of information request diligently requested by Aviation Week has revealed some of the 2,100 would be names submitted as part of the B-1 naming competition. According to the request, “the responses ranged from historically informed to odd, witty and downright inappropriate, with airmen requesting the names Death Star, Meme Machine, Chuck Norris, Taxslayer and Mecca Wrecka.” Of course Nukey McMeltface (not dissimilar to DID’s own Stealthy McBombface suggestion) was just one of several McMonikers to be submitted, joining Stealthy McStealthface, Bombypants McGee and McLovin on the discarded pile. Middle East & North Africa Saudi Arabia is set to buy a further eight UH-60M Black Hawks in a $91 million US Army contract. The foreign military sale will see Sikorsky provide the medium-lift utility helicopters by December 2017. Back in February, Sikorsky and Saudi Arabian firm Taqnia Aeronautics began investigating the possibilities of producing Black Hawks in the kingdom as part of efforts to diversify their economy amid dropping oil prices. Denel Dynamics has moved closer to selling their Ingwe missile to Saudi Arabia following the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi ITEAC Group. The move will see both firms jointly market the South African’s ZT3 Ingwe anti-tank missile to the Saudi armed forces. Denel has been attempting to enter the Saudi defense market for some time, and any deal could likely see technology transfers as well as the setting up of local manufacturing facilities. Europe BAE Systems will commence work on the UK’s newest nuclear submarines following the release of nearly $1.7 billion in funds. The announcement was made by the Minister of Defence on Saturday after approval was given by MPs earlier this year. Known colloquially as the Trident system, the first of the Vanguard-class submarines will enter service in the early 2030s. A collaboration between Leonardo-Finmeccinca, Dassault Aviation and Airbus Defence has launched the European Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System program (RPAS). The project will facilitate the creation of new remotely piloted aircraft systems to support European intelligence-gathering missions, with all three companies to first conduct definition studies to support the program. In addition to intelligence gathering, the drones will be used for infrastructure surveillance, firefighting, border control, and disaster relief efforts. Asia Pacific A week after French and India’s defense ministers finalized their long awaited Rafale deal, manufacturer Dassault and India’s Reliance Group signed contracts in relation to the deal’s production offsets. As much as $4.51 billion, 50% of the total deal, will be reinvested in Indian firms as part of work share conditions attached to the sale of the 36 fighters. As the world’s largest defense importer, New Delhi’s “Make in India” initiative requires foreign defense companies to invest a percentage of the value of deals that they have been awarded into India to help the country build their own manufacturing base and wean them from imports. Lockheed Martin will provide combat systems for Australia’s new fleet of submarines. The move is said to increase interoperability with fellow Lockheed system-user the US Navy. French firm DCNS won the $38 billion Australian submarine contract back in April defeating Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Since then, the company has been dealing with the aftermath of a 22,000 page data leak of submarines they are building for India, drawing a warning from Australian defense officials.

His latest book is "Negrophilia: From Slave Block to Pedestal - America's Racial Obsession." In 2007, he was the first to give national attention to the story of Sen. Barack Obama's ties to militant Chicago preacher Rev. Jeremiah Wright, initiating a media feeding frenzy. Erik has appeared on Fox News' "Hannity and Colmes," CNN, and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances. Follow Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Vladimir Ilyich Lenin once said that the world’s capitalists would sell communists the rope with which the capitalists would be hung. For those who can appreciate the bitter irony in subsequent historical events, have I got a story for you: Some months ago, I was contacted by an individual who was formerly engaged by Ball Aerospace as an independent subcontractor. As many know, since 1956, Ball has been a manufacturer of aeronautic and aerospace components and instruments for national defense, as well as civil and commercial space applications. According to this individual, in 2011 Ball abruptly and comprehensively modified its internal communications protocols and stepped up security on its network and email servers, effectively locking the subcontractors out of areas they had previously been able to access readily. Among some of the more prominent subcontractors at Ball’s Jefferson County and Boulder, Colorado, complexes at the time included Lockheed-Martin, Northrop-Grumman, Raytheon and Boeing. In the practical sense, these new security measures inconvenienced many subcontractors to no small degree. When my source inquired about the move, his contact at Ball told him that a Ball employee of Middle Eastern extraction had turned out to be a spy for a Middle Eastern government. Although my source’s contact did not specify, he presumed it was the Islamic Republic of Iran. The employee had apparently used a data aggregator to compromise the servers in a manner similar to the one used by Edward Snowden to acquire data when he worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA). When asked what information had been compromised, my source’s Ball contact said “everything.” Supposedly, an incalculable amount of information from 1956 to 2011 – thousands of defense contracts into which Ball had entered with the U.S. government – had been deftly plucked from the company’s servers by the interloper. The more recent data included all manner of information and designs on missile defense, aeronautics, drones and space exploration. Obviously, the company found all of this extremely embarrassing, being a defense contractor, and kept as much of it under the table as possible. My source was not sure if the Department of Defense or any other government agencies were made aware of the breach at the time. In 2014, Iran unveiled what it said was a reverse-engineered copy of an American stealth drone it supposedly hacked and landed intact in 2011. The drone was an RQ-170 Sentinel manufactured by Lockheed Martin, but given the sensitive nature of such equipment design, one can only guess as to what extent, if any, Ball Aerospace technology factored into it, or if stolen Ball data aided the Iranian regime in acquiring the drone. Politicians of the more craven variety have a curious habit of vacating positions of influence in furtive attempts to avoid implication in whatever questionable or illegal activities in which they have participated, as though they cannot be held responsible for such actions once they’ve left their jobs. We’ve seen this in spades over the course of Barack Obama’s presidency. Some of the more notable departures have been senior advisers David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel, Attorney General Eric Holder, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, IRS tax-exempt organizations section chief Lois Lerner, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. By September of 2014, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack were the only two remaining Cabinet members who had been with Obama since his inauguration. Duncan resigned in October of 2015. We also witnessed this in the case of former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, who all but spiked the investigation into the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012. Rogers’ wife, Kristi Rogers, had been a senior executive with security contractor Aegis Defense Services. Aegis had contracts with the U.S. to provide security for U.S. interests in Libya. Both Rogers and his wife abruptly left their positions after the Benghazi attack. And, of course, Hillary Clinton resigned as secretary of state in 2013. Reporting on these rats suspiciously fleeing the not-quite-yet sinking ship has been conspicuously avoided by the establishment press when such reportage might reflect badly on the Obama administration, but this of course does not mitigate their subterfuge, nor the damage such parties may have done. According to the nuclear arms deal entered into by the Obama administration and Iran in 2015, in exchange for Iran supposedly curbing its nuclear program (multiple loopholes and early noncompliance on Iran’s part have already alarmed geopolitical experts), that nation received access to billions of dollars in assets frozen as a result of sanctions imposed earlier by the United States and other countries. While press accounts indicate that the finer points of the highly controversial nuke deal were handled by Valerie Jarrett (the Iranian-born senior adviser to Barack Obama), former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is generally understood to have had a major hand in crafting the deal. Clinton’s ongoing endorsement of the deal while voicing her distrust for the Iranian regime (“There is absolutely no reason to trust Iran,” Clinton opined a year ago) suggests that she foresaw a need to publicly maintain a more cynical stance on Iran than the Obama administration, presumably in light of her presidential aspirations. For those who wonder how a nation run by bearded pedophiliac death-cult monkeys in black dresses so quickly developed precisely the technology it required to effectively deliver any nuclear weapons it might illegally develop, their incredulity is certainly not misplaced. What should be evident at this point is that the priorities of progressive-socialist politicians, regardless of their stature, most assuredly do not include a concern for the national security of America and her allies.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended about 110 points higher, with Goldman Sachs, Boeing and Caterpillar contributing the most gains, after rising as much as 147.37 points. “We think the market is getting accepting that rates are going to go higher,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. “It’s interesting because the market was at a point where good news was seen as bad by the market. I think the market is driving away from that, and that’s good.” The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent, with financials and energy advancing more than 1 percent to lead advancers. The Nasdaq rose approximately 0.5 percent. Read the full story › Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Note: Read our discussion guidelines before commenting.

LOUIS, MO, UNITED STATES 10.01.2016 Story by Cpl. Jennifer Webster  9th Marine Corps District ✔ ✗ Subscribe 2 ST. LOUIS – The venerated title that no one dreams of ever receiving: Gold Star family. “Most Americans don’t fully see, don’t fully understand the sacrifice made by the one percent who serve in this all-volunteer armed forces – a sacrifice that preserves the freedoms we too often take for granted. Few know what it’s like to take a bullet for a buddy, or to live with the fact that he or she took one for you. But our Gold Star families, our veterans – they know this intimately,” President Barack Obama said at the Arlington National Cemetery on May 25, 2015. The term “Gold Star” traces back to World War I. During that conflict, Americans would fly a flag bearing a blue star for every immediate family member serving in the armed forces. The star would be changed to gold if the family lost a loved one in the war. The Semper Fi Society of St. Louis hosted the 7th Annual Gold Star Family Luncheon Oct. 1, 2016, at the Boeing Company in St. Louis, Missouri. “Knowing the reality that the price of freedom is high, a leader must ensure that the sacrifice of those lost and those wounded is not forgotten,” said Col. Jason Morris, the guest of honor and the 9th Marine Corps District commanding officer, as he addressed a room full of Gold Star families. Morris was chosen as the guest of honor for his personal connection to those he lost overseas. In September 2009, Morris assumed command of 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, known as “Darkhorse Battalion,” and a year later led a deployment to Sangin District, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. “That deployment I will take to my grave with pride knowing what my Marines did, how they accomplished the mission, went to the gates of hell and back with me, and kept their honor clean,” Morris stated proudly. Throughout that deployment Morris said he became acutely aware of the steep cost paid in life and limb. In roughly 100 days, 25 Marines from 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, and an additional four Marines from two companies in 2nd Marine Division, lost their lives. There were more than 35 Marines who lost limbs and became double, triple and quadruple amputees. Nearly 150 more were wounded. “When you know your Marines, their faces, their wives, and you’ve seen them sweat, curse, laugh, every casualty report takes on a special meaning and every letter home is agonizingly crafted to try and explain the circumstances of their loved one’s passing,” Morris told the room full of family, friends and Marines. “The loss of any Marine is tragic, but we Marines go where our country needs us and execute our orders.” As names of fallen heroes were called, Marines from Recruiting Station St. Louis delivered flags to the Gold Star families in attendance. A few of Morris’ Marines who lost their lives in Afghanistan were represented by their mothers, fathers and children. “As I was delivering flags today it brought tears to my eyes,” Staff Sgt. Manuel Silva said. “You can see the pain in their parent’s eyes and it makes you think, it could be anybody.” One Gold Star mother was comforted by the sight of Marines in dress blues. “In a room full of Marines I feel like my son is with me, like maybe he just went to get a drink of water and I’ll see him come around the corner any second,” Terrie Hobson said, tears running down her face. “I raised a warrior and I’m proud of the man who he had become. I miss him every day.” Terrie lost her only child, Lance Cpl. Jack Kenna, May 17, 2008, in Iraq. “I hear the pride through their tears, as they flip through old photos and run their fingers over shiny medals,” Obama said in closing at the Arlington National Cemetery. “I see that their hearts are still broken, and yet still full of love. They do not ask for awards or honors. They do not ask for special treatment. They are unfailingly humble. In the face of unspeakable loss, they represent the best of who we are.” LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 10.01.2016 Date Posted: 10.05.2016 15:29 Story ID: 211359 Location: ST.

Jerry Siebenmark The Wichita Eagle Triumph Accessory Services-Wellington operates in 92,437 square feet of buildings in the town 35 miles south of Wichita. Jerry Siebenmark The Wichita Eagle 1 of 5 i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WELLINGTON In the time that Triumph Accessory Services has repaired, overhauled and even manufactured refueling booms for the Air Force’s fleet of 59 KC-10s, those tankers have refueled 1.2 million military aircraft with 2.3 billion gallons of gas. On Wednesday, the plant that employs 145 people marked the delivery of its 100th repaired and overhauled boom with a ceremony that included Boeing and Air Force officials and dignitaries, including U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Wichita. “We should be very proud of this milestone,” said Jim Berberet, president of Triumph’s Wellington plant. “We’ve earned this business over the past 17 years with our hard work.” Berberet also named 21 employees he said were key in the boom maintenance, repair and overhaul work. The boom, said Col. Mark Mocio, chief of the Air Force’s legacy tanker division, is a crucial piece of equipment that allows U.S. and allied military fighters and bombers to carry out their missions worldwide. It’s important that the boom work correctly on every refueling mission. There’s “no margin to not get that right, and you guys deliver,” Mocio said. “The work that goes on here is a special, one-of-a-kind capability performed every day for 17 years,” he added. “Your boom is a force multiplier for our Air Force and our nation.” The KC-10 is based on the airframe of a DC-10 widebody airliner first manufactured by the Douglas Corp., later McDonnell Douglas, which was acquired by Boeing in 1997. The jet holds nearly twice as much fuel — 356,000 pounds — as the KC-135. It was put into service by the Air Force in 1981 because of its greater fuel capacity and its hose-and-drogue system, a secondary refueling system for military aircraft not equipped to receive gas from a boom. The boom work is just one of a number of maintenance, repair and overhaul programs at the Wellington plant. Its work extends to commercial and regional aircraft as well to heavy accessories and airborne electrical power generation devices. In addition to the KC-10 boom work, the plant manufactures spare parts for the KC-135 air refueling tanker and does parts work on the Boeing C-17 Globemaster military cargo jet, the Air Force’s E-4B airborne command post and military VIP aircraft. It is one of three Kansas plants — including one in Wichita — owned by Pennsylvania-based Triumph Group.

 The idea that SpaceX's rocket was sabotaged is 'pretty much a joke,' says worker at rival rocket company Dave Mosher Oct. 5, 2016, 12:48 PM 7,690 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX (left) and the Sept. 1, 2016, explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket (right) in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Max Whitaker/Getty Images; USLaunchReport.com; Business Insider On September 1, a SpaceX rocket burst into flames during a routine launchpad test, destroying a $200 million satellite that Facebook planned to lease. An ongoing investigation into the fireball, which occurred at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) in Cape Canaveral, Fla., has narrowed the blast's origin to a breach in a helium tank. However, SpaceX has said the exact cause remains elusive. According to journalist Christian Davenport, writing in the Washington Post, SpaceX investigators have considered "something suspicious" they saw on the roof of its biggest rival: United Launch Alliance (ULA), a company that's jointly owned by aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The unsaid implication and speculation here, an industry source recently suggested to Business Insider, is this: It may be possible that someone could have gotten access to the roof of ULA's building, fired a bullet or other projectile from more than 5,300 feet in the distance, and somehow struck the Falcon 9 rocket's upper stage. Davenport wrote that, based on conversations with three industry officials, SpaceX (reportedly) "had still images from video that appeared to show an odd shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building leased by ULA ... The building ... known as the SMARF [Solid Motor Assembly and Readiness Facility], is just more than a mile away from the launchpad and has a clear line of sight to it." Davenport notes the SpaceX investigation team was simply pursuing all possible leads, and a spokesperson told Business Insider as much in an email. The Washington Post article goes on to say that, while the interaction between SpaceX and ULA officials was "cordial," the US Air Force (USAF) ultimately went up to the SMARF roof to check things out. But does anyone in the industry believe sabotage is a real possibility? We spoke to a ULA worker in Cape Canaveral on condition of anonymity (due to security concerns) who has followed a lot of gossip within the company. The worker told Business Insider that ULA staff seem to be treating the notion as "pretty much a joke out here," though of course this is just one worker's impression. "What happened is SpaceX wanted access to [the SMARF] roof, probably just to tie up a loose end," the worker said. "Instead the Air Force went up, found nothing." The ULA's SMARF building is more than a mile away from the site of the SpaceX launchpad fire. Google Maps/Business Insider Despite its extreme unlikelihood, the worker said, the notion of sabotage has made for "fascinating" gossip among ULA staff. "Could someone sneak a rifle up there, could they disguise the noise, could they hit the rocket, would it do anything if they did hit it?" Still, the source underscored the mundane nature of the theory's alleged origin — and its improbability. "SpaceX has a fault analysis tree, and [sabotage] is a branch of it that needs tying up," the worker clarified, further noting that, based on his impression: "I don't see them or anyone here giving it any credence." That's the word on the street at the ULA office, according to our source, and ULA itself mostly confirmed his take, in broad strokes. When provided with some of these unattributed comments, a ULA representative told Business Insider in an email that the company "cooperated with the Air Force's 45th Space Wing [of the USAF], and nothing associated with the SpaceX accident was found." Given some of the same comments, a SpaceX spokesperson told Business Insider in an email: "The Accident Investigation Team has an obligation to consider all possible causes of the anomaly, and we aren't commenting on any specific potential cause until the investigation is complete. ... We have sought all available data to support the investigation in a timely manner following the anomaly, as expected for any responsible investigation." In the meantime, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are sparring over the independence and rigor of SpaceX's internally led probe, which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved after SpaceX submitted its investigation plan. In one camp are 10 House Republicans who recently called for the FAA, NASA, and USAF to take over the investigation, despite current approval, oversight, and involvement by federal agencies. Those congressmen, as Business Insider recently reported, received campaign donations from ULA, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, and some have local interests in supporting ULA. But a larger, bipartisan group of lawmakers — half of whom SpaceX has donated to in the most recent election cycle, and some of whom represent districts in which SpaceX conducts its business — have rebutted the call for a full government takeover of SpaceX's probe. "Accidents are unfortunate events, and accident investigations should not be politicized. We encourage you to reject calls for your organizations to abandon established, well considered, and long standing procedures," the latter group of lawmakers wrote.

Fuller If a brief intermission is taken from talking about the future — in engine programs Future Vertical Lift (FVL) and Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE) — a quick look to the past will serve as a reminder of the slow-but-sure evolution of research and development. Two companies made headlines this week that have been heavily involved in military initiatives for the past five years and beyond: GE Aviation and the Advanced Turbine Engine Company (ATEC). Boeing AH-64 Apache. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army In May 2012, Robert W. Moorman outlined in R&WI's "Investing in the Future" the fact that funding for research and development for future military rotorcraft was diminishing, despite the need to update fleets. At that time, the Defense Dept. had not yet released the FVL Strategic Plan, and the U.S. Army's Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine (AATE) program still had two years to go before it would see culmination. In fact, GE was working on two demonstrator engines in 2012: one for AATE to replace engines on Boeing AH-64s and Sikorsky UH-60s and one for Army program FATE. The previous year, the Army awarded GE a five-year, $45 million cost-share contract for its FATE engine, with the program aiming to cultivate the design of a 5,000- to 10,000-shp class turboshaft engine that would be applicable to existing aircraft and have FVL capabilities. At the time of the article, this engine was theoretical. But as of this past Monday, that engine has entered the testing phase. According to a company news release, this first full engine test followed the completion of FATE compressor combustor and turbine rig tests in 2015. The compressor rig recorded the highest single-spool compressor pressure ratio in GE Aviation's history. The engine is designed to achieve 35% reduction in specific fuel consumption, 80% improvement in power-to-weight, 20% improvement in design life and 45% reduction in production and maintenance costs relative to currently fielded engines.  Moorman noted in the article that ATEC was also submitting an engine — the HPW3000 — for AATE, for which the Army awarded it a $180 million contract in 2008. This past Tuesday, the Pratt & Whitney-Honeywell joint venture said it won a contract through the Army's Alternate Concept Engine program (ACE). ATEC is building upon the successful AATE demonstration of the HPW3000, and the new development could power the Pentagon’s FVL initiative.  According to a company news release, ATEC will demonstrate advanced variable speed turbine capabilities, among other advanced technologies, in a demonstrator engine test. The ACE program, a science and technology effort with the goal of cultivating engines that can improve Army Aviation rotorcraft, also aims to reduce operational and lifecycle costs and the logistical footprint. In 2012, AATE was on its last legs and all other programs and initiatives were barely in tangible existence. But GE and ATEC are continuing to develop engines to fly tomorrow's rotorcraft as the military invests in upgrades.

The NAE will be utilized to accommodate and operate aircraft which cannot be operated from INS Garuda, the Indian naval air station located near Kochi, due to inadequate runway length available. The setting up of the NAE will facilitate the operations of Boeing P8I aircraft from Cial. This will enhance surveillance of the area around the western coast and the strategically critical Lakshdweep and Minicoy Islands. It will also enable timely assistance to the neighbouring countries. Speaking on the occasion, Admiral Lanba said the inauguration of naval air enclave wil revive the bond between the Navy and civil operators which had come to a halt with the shifting of civil air operations to Cial. The INS Garuda is limited in its operations due to space restrictions, bird menace caused by dense human habitation in vicinity and growing obstructions around the airfield. A release by Navy said establishmenta of Cial and Kannur International Airport Limited (Kial) has offered an opportunity to the Indian armed forces to utilize them to meet their needs. The setting up of the Naval AIr Enclave (NAE) will facilitate the operations of Boeing P8I aircraft from the Cochin International Airport Limited (Cial), which will enhance surveillance around the western coast and the strategically critical Lakshdweep and Minicoy Islands.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 5, 2016 at 8:28AM Derived from the world-famous Global Hawk, Northrop's new MQ-4C promises to "make the world's oceans smaller" -- and easier to keep an eye on. Image source: Northrop Grumman. Three years ago, the U.S. Navy awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) to fund the continued development of its newest fixed-wing intelligence drone, the MQ-4C "Triton." Valued at just $28 million, it wasn't a big award, but it did serve to help keep the Triton project alive. And last week, that project finally bore fruit -- when the Navy gave Northrop a new $255.2 million contract, greenlighting construction of the first three production-model Tritons. News of this contract, for which delivery is due in August 2020, first appeared in the Pentagon's daily digest of contracts awarded last week. In a separate award that same day, the Navy ordered $95 million worth of spare parts to keep its new drones flying. Then, three days later, the Navy awarded Northrop even more money -- $49.4 million this time -- to fund the procurement of "long lead components" needed to build the new drones. Add it all up, and in just four days, Northrop Grumman netted just under $400 million in new revenues from Triton. What Triton is Northrop Grumman describes Triton's mission as providing "real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions." Derived from the company's successful Global Hawk drone, but tweaked to specialize in maritime missions, Triton's sensors monitor the ocean in a 360-degree circle. Triton is designed to fly for 24 hours at a time, at altitudes in excess of 10 miles -- and for distances as far as 8,200 nautical miles. Its mission will complement that of the lower-flying, lower-endurance manned P-8A Poseidon drone from Boeing (NYSE:BA). Boeing designed Poseidon primarily for maritime sub-hunting missions. Triton's long range and long endurance allow the drone to circumnavigate one third of the Earth's circumference in one hop before needing to refuel. Equipped with Northrop's own AN/ZPY-3 multifunction active sensor radar, it will monitor air, land, and sea traffic below it all the way. While official confirmation of the drone's capabilities are hard to come by, media reports suggest that one single Triton could potentially survey as much as 2,700,000 square miles of surface area in a single sortie. That's 10% of the Indian Ocean. Or 23% of Africa. Or...87% of the continental United States. What Triton costs According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Navy intends to purchase 66 Tritons at a cost of $130 million apiece ($183 million including research and development costs). Thus, the $400 million spent on buying and supplying three Tritons with spare parts last week probably comes very close to the mark on what the Pentagon will be spending on future Triton drones. In total, GAO values the entire Triton project at $12.8 billion, of which $8.9 billion remains to be spent. What it means for investors So, what do Northrop's new Triton contracts mean to investors in Northrop Grumman stock? More money, obviously. The $12.8 billion value of the Triton program is nearly 30% greater than the total revenues Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems business brought in last year (albeit Triton's revenues will be spread out over a number of years). And according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, these will be very high-margin revenues. S&P Global data show that Northrop's Aerospace unit earns operating profit margins of 12.2% -- 240 basis points better than the 9.8% Boeing earns at its Military Aircraft division. Over the course of the entire $12.8 billion program, investors can therefore expect Triton to generate as much as $1.6 billion in operating profit for Northrop, or roughly $8.74 per share, initially. And over the years to come, maintenance and upgrade revenues at similar margins can be expected. As big as last week's contracts were for Northrop Grumman stock owners, the good news is just beginning. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

The stubby, single-stage New Shepard rocket took off from Bezos’ ranch north of Van Horn, Texas, at 11:36 a.m. EDT (1536 GMT) Wednesday, about a half-hour later then scheduled after engineers worked out unspecified issues in the final countdown. About 45 seconds later, at an altitude of around 16,000 feet (nearly 5,000 meters) and a velocity close to the speed of sound, a prototype crew capsule fastened to the top of the rocket fired a solid rocket motor to catapult free of the booster for a crucial in-flight test of the spacecraft’s emergency escape system, which would be triggered to whisk passengers away from an exploding launcher. No one was inside the capsule Wednesday, but the abort demo is a major milestone toward Blue Origin’s plans to begin flying test pilots on suborbital jaunts above 62 miles (100 kilometers) — the internationally-recognized boundary of space — as soon as next year. The four-ton capsule spun around and tumbled after the solid-fueled abort motor’s two-second firing, which propelled the vehicle several hundred away from the New Shepard rocket. Guided by reaction control system thrusters, the capsule’s motion stabilized as it deployed three drogue parachutes and three main chutes for a relatively gentle ride back to the ground, touching down at a speed of around  3 mph (5 kilometers per hour) about four minutes after liftoff. The headless booster continued upward after the capsule was severed, defying predictions that the intense aerodynamic loads and heat from the maneuver would be too much for the rocket’s control system to overcome. But the New Shepard’s BE-3 main engine, burning a combination of cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, swiveled to deftly direct its thrust in response to the abort motor firing, keeping the rocket on course. The engine throttled down as programmed after the capsule jettisoned and burned for about three minutes to reach a point near the von Karman line, the edge of space, before falling back to Earth. Commentators on Blue Origin’s live webcast did not say how high the booster flew. On the way back down, the rocket, named for Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, extended a drag brake and wedge fins to slow its velocity, then ignited its BE-3 main engine again less than 30 seconds before landing. Four legs deployed from the base of the booster, and the engine steered the vehicle over Blue Origin’s landing site near New Shepard’s launch pad. The rocket landing occurred about seven-and-a-half minutes after launch. The launcher Blue Origin flew Wednesday has now flown five times, dating back to its maiden launch on Nov. 23, 2015, but this mission was its last. “What an extraordinary test and a tremendous final flight for both craft,” said Ariane Cornell, a manager on Blue Origin’s strategy and business development team, who provided commentary during the company’s webcast of Wednesday’s flight. “As we very optimistically aimed for, both our crew capsule successfully executed its in-flight escape test, and the booster brilliantly continued to space and came home for a fifth landing on our landing pad just two miles north of where it took off from.” Blue Origin’s crew capsule fires its abort motor moments after liftoff on the New Shepard booster. Credit: Blue Origin In an email update last month, Bezos wrote that the booster would probably not survive the test flight. “What of the booster? It’s the first ever rocket booster to fly above the Karman line into space and then land vertically upon the Earth,” Bezos wrote. “And it’s done so multiple times. We’d really like to retire it after this test and put it in a museum. Sadly, that’s not likely.” The New Shepard’s abort system features a solid rocket motor mounted at the base of the crew capsule to push the spaceship away from the rocket to escape an emergency during launch. Most previous human-rated space capsules, including the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft, have their abort motors on top of the rocket, where they would pull the capsule away to get out of the way if the rocket failed. But Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule, like commercial orbital-class spaceships being developed by SpaceX and Boeing, has a “pusher” escape system. The advantage is the escape motor does not have to be jettisoned and thrown away after every mission, as is the case with Soyuz flights. That makes the system more reliable by removing a potential failure mode, and less expensive because the abort motor can be reused until it is needed, then discarded. With a multimillion-dollar government funding arrangement with NASA, Blue Origin tested the escape system during a pad abort test in October 2012, demonstrating the motor’s ability to drive the capsule away from an explosion on the launch pad. NASA no longer provides monetary support to Blue Origin’s rocket development program, but the space agency still has “unfunded” agreements to offer engineering expertise. “This upcoming flight will be our toughest test yet,” Bezos wrote last month. “We’ll intentionally trigger an escape in flight and at the most stressing condition: maximum dynamic pressure through transonic velocities.” A successful escape test was expected to demonstrate the abort motor’s capability to save the passengers aboard the crew capsule even during the most stressing part of the flight. During operational crew-carrying flights, a signal from the booster’s computer, the capsule, or mission control could initiate the abort sequence. While the abort system’s design required the crew capsule to safely land, the New Shepard booster was never designed to survive such a maneuver, according to Blue Origin. The New Shepard booster, under the control of its BE-3 main engine, kicks up dust just before landing Wednesday. Credit: Blue Origin If the rocket ran into trouble after the abort command, its on-board computer would have ordered the BE-3 engine to shut down, and the booster would have plummeted back to the ground and exploded on impact. “The capsule escape motor will slam the booster with 70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust,” Bezos wrote. “The aerodynamic shape of the vehicle quickly changes from leading with the capsule to leading with the ring fin, and this all happens at maximum dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, the booster is very robust and our Monte Carlo simulations show there’s some chance we can fly through these disturbances and recover the booster.” It turns out those computer simulations were right. Blue Origin officials said they plan to put the New Shepard booster and the crew capsule on public display. New Shepard was the first vehicle to fly to space and return to Earth with a vertical, rocket-assisted landing, logging that achievement on its first flight on Nov. 23, 2015. The successful recovery of the New Shepard last year came a month before SpaceX, a rival commercial space firm led by Elon Musk, landed a Falcon 9 first stage booster at Cape Canaveral after it sent 11 Orbcomm communications satellites toward orbit. The Falcon 9 is larger and reached higher speeds than New Shepard, but SpaceX has not yet re-flown a first stage booster. A commercial satellite operator, SES of Luxembourg, agreed in August to put a communications satellite on the first flight of a reused Falcon 9 rocket. The highly-anticipated launch of a “flight-proven” Falcon 9 booster was supposed to occur this month, but SpaceX’s rockets are grounded after an explosion on the launch pad in Florida on Sept. 1. SpaceX aims to resume launches as soon as mid-November, although the company’s investigation into last month’s rocket mishap is still ongoing, so the schedule could slip further. While the launcher flown Wednesday is 5-for-5, Blue Origin lost a previous New Shepard vehicle in April 2015. That rocket failed to land after an otherwise successful launch. A successful test Wednesday could pave the way for Blue Origin to begin flying test pilots on New Shepard launches next year, ahead of the start of commercial operations in 2018. Cornell said Blue Origin is working on the next iteration of its suborbital crew capsule, which could begin launching on a newly-built New Shepard rocket from West Texas in early 2017. It will be outfitted with windows and other accommodations for passengers. “We already have a couple of those capsules in process and almost complete, and those are the ones that are going to be flying next,” Cornell said. Blue Origin last month revealed the basic design of a larger orbital-class booster named New Glenn, after Mercury astronaut John Glenn, that could begin flying by the end of the decade. It will be propelled by a set of larger methane-burning BE-4 engines Blue Origin is currently testing on the ground. United Launch Alliance has also tapped Blue Origin’s BE-4 engine as the preferred powerplant for its next-generation Vulcan rocket, which will replace the company’s existing Atlas and Delta rocket fleet.

 It’s time for the F-35 to start blowing up old F-16s Alex Lockie Oct. 5, 2016, 9:48 AM 33,768 facebook linkedin twitter email print The first QF-16 target aircraft seen at Tyndall Air Force Base in 2012. US Air Force photo by Chris Cokeing Gen. Herbert "Hawk" Carlisle of the US Air Force recently declared a squadron of 15 unmanned F-16s operationally capable, IHS Jane's reports. These drone versions of the F-16, called QF-16s, will provide targets for the Air Force as it tests out new weapons capabilities of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. "The QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target will provide the next generation of combat training and testing for US warfighters," a Boeing statement on the drones said. While the old F-16s may seem like costly targets, the Air Force is touting them as a more realistic opponent than what was previously available, and they are economical to some extent because they're made from older, retired F-16 airframes. "The QF-16 will replace the existing QF-4 fleet and provide a higher-capability, fourth-generation aerial target that is more representative of today's targets and threats," the Boeing statement continued. Having realistic targets to train against will help the F-35 pilots. F-35 Joint Program Office "This leap forward in airframe capabilities, combined with advanced electronic pods, will allow us to properly test and evaluate our 5th generation aircraft and weapons," Lt. Col. Matthew Garrison, the commander of the 82nd Aerial Target Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, told C4ISRNET in an email. In fact, an F-35 already participated in a test in which a QF-16 drone was shot down, though it did so with an SM-6 missile fired from a land-based silo.

Air Canada Part 1: low cost rouge is a pillar of growth; but further expansion might be constrained 5-Oct-2016 During the past year Air Canada has found itself defending its double-digit capacity growth, stressing that 90% of its capacity in 2015, 2016 and 2017 is being deployed to its international network – an entity the company believes is far from reaching maturity. Recently the airline has outlined plans to introduce a raft of new long haul flights to Europe and Asia operated by Air Canada mainline and its low cost arm – Air Canada rouge. Air Canada stresses the pillars of its international expansion – Boeing 787 widebodies and the establishment of its low cost subsidiary rouge – enable the company to enter international markets it once considered unviable due to higher costs. During the summer of 2018 rouge will nearly reach its 50 aircraft cap, and Air Canada needs to start determining if there are further opportunities to grow its low cost unit. Those evaluations will partially dictate Air Canada’s overall growth levels beyond 2018. In the short term Air Canada is not seeing any broad changes in consumer behaviour, reflected in its solid booking curves. Weaker markets in Western Canada, hit by the downturn in the oil sector, are stabilising as capacity cuts have resulted in a rational supply-demand scenario. This is Part 1 in a two part series on Air Canada. The second instalment will focus on the airline’s costs and balance sheet management.

An in-flight dining critic explains By Alison Fensterstock@AlisonF_NOLA Oct 5, 2016 12:00 AM Graphic: Nick Wanserski (Photos from instagram.com/inflightfeed) Graphic: Nick Wanserski (Photos from instagram.com/inflightfeed) Share Tweet Share Tweet Airline food: butt of jokes, favorite subject of ’90s stand-up comedy routines, butt of jokes about ’90s stand-up comedy routines. It’s also the passion of Nikos Loukas, the primary voice behind the 4-year-old website Inflightfeed.com and its associated Instagram account, a hypnotic scroll of seat-back trays and tiny wine bottles that counts more than 12,000 followers. Loukas has spent as many as five days per week traveling over the course of his 15 years in the airline industry. Currently, he’s a training manager for flight personnel, keeping catering crews and other folks in the airline version of back-of-house up to date on the field’s latest technology. On his own time, Loukas also contributes regularly to the trade journal Onboard Hospitality, writing dining-related industry news from an insider’s perspective and offering enthusiastic reviews of airline meals. More than just the standard pretzels or sandwiches on hard rolls, his repasts can be a fascinating mix of rarefied gourmet cuisine—like that found in Air France transatlantic first class—and the wholly eccentric—such as the Taiwanese airline’s Hello Kitty-themed flights that offer salad vegetables, pastry, and bread cut in the shape of the iconic cat (that’s not actually a cat). Between landings and takeoffs, Loukas spoke to The A.V. Club from his home in Germany to discuss dining and drinking at 30,000 feet, as well as his forthcoming documentary on the subject. The A.V. Club: Have you ever worked in the food and beverage industry on the ground, in a regular restaurant, or has it always been in the air? Nikos Loukas: I was going to university to complete a hospitality course, and I wanted to be a chef. Then one day I just kind of snapped and went, “Oh, I don’t want to do this.” I love food and I love travel, and that’s why I think I’m obsessed with the airline food part of things. I love planes. I have ever since I was a small kid. Photo: @inflightfeed AVC: Even if the food on a plane is really good by the standards of airline food, it’s arguably not going to measure up against great dining on the ground. So what makes you so interested in it? Is it just that you’re trapped up there? NL: It’s a form of in-flight entertainment. If you’ve got nothing else to do, it kind of keeps you busy for up to an hour. I remember seeing something at a conference a while ago, where a guy was telling us about research that had been done with passengers, and the top three things that people think about before a flight. It was “Am I going to get there on time?” “Are my bags going to arrive?” and… I can’t remember the third one, but it wasn’t really anything exciting. Then, when they get to the other end, the thing most people talk about is the food, how the crew were, and whether they got there on time. It’s a funny thing. People hate [airline food], they dis it all the time, but they’ll happily accept it if it’s free. Everyone’s always got a story. I’ll ask you now: What’s your most memorable airline meal? I hope you don’t mind me asking, because I’ve got a point to this. How far back can you go? Can you go back 10 or 15 years to a meal that you had, whether it was good or bad? AVC: The first time I flew business class, I was very impressed that we got ice cream sundaes. NL: How long ago was that? AVC: At least 10 years ago? NL: Okay, so what was the last ice cream that you ate? Or what did you have for lunch last Tuesday? AVC: Uh… NL: See my point? I love doing this at conferences, because I’ll say to the airline people sitting in the audience, “Come on, you are creating experiences and memories for your passengers when they’re flying with you. Do you want them to remember the lovely ice cream sundae from 10 years ago, or do you want them to remember some horrid meal that you put together really cheaply? And you know, why don’t you spend a little bit more money?” It’s funny, because I feel like I’m always trying to speak up for airline food. Because it’s kind of the underdog. AVC: Does food taste different in the air or in a pressurized cabin? NL: Yes, it definitely does. Probably if you’re flying in a 787, the food might taste slightly better. The jury’s kind of out for me because everything’s pressurized, and you would have to check this on the Boeing site, but 787s are pressurized at a lower altitude, which means that you do feel better when you get off at the other end. But when we fly, our sense of taste is blocked by about 15 to 20 percent. I believe, in some cases, even 30 percent. I interviewed a guy at Japan Airlines about how they were offering KFC as a second meal service in economy class on certain flights from Tokyo to Europe and America years ago. They worked with KFC, and what they did was they increased the salt by X amount, by 10 or 15 percent, just to make it taste more like KFC when it is in the air. You’ve got airlines like Lufthansa, which uses a hyperbaric chamber in Munich to taste. What they’ll do is they create all the meals and then they get a group of people into this hyperbaric chamber, pressurize it to what an aircraft is flying at when it’s at 35,000 feet, and they taste the meals. [The combination of dryness and low pressure dulls taste buds, studies have shown. —ed.] Photo: @inflightfeed AVC: How has technology affected the way food is prepared in the air? What are the biggest advances? NL: Probably the ovens and the equipment that’s been made available to crews in the last 10, 15 years. Most airlines now have kind of a steamer oven that tends to steam the food, rather than just blowing hot air on it. It makes for a much more moist meal, not as dry. Airlines have now got toasters and proper skillets on board that they’re using. That kind of thing was probably unheard of 20 years ago. Then, back in the ’50s and ’60s, you had airlines like Pan American who were really cooking at 35,000 feet. But there’s so many of us traveling these days that it’s kind of like going to a wedding. It becomes mass catering, and it just becomes a little bit more boring and less exciting than how it was 40 or 50 years ago. AVC: What are some of the hardest things to cook or serve in the air? Is there anything that even if you saw it on the menu in first class, you’d say, “I don’t think I’m gonna go with that?” NL: I’ve had a few really nice fish dishes, but the jury’s still out for me on seafood and fish. One, because it can make you very sick if it wasn’t cooked properly—though the same goes with chicken. I tend to stick to either vegetarian or the chicken or beef. If there’s seafood, I kind of stay away from it. I just think it could end up tasting a little bit rubbery. AVC: What are some of the best things you’ve eaten on a plane? NL: There’s so many different ones. Speaking of seafood, I had a really nice lobster thermidor on a first-class trip with Singapore Airlines. I used miles, because there’s no way I’d pay the exorbitant prices, but that was really nice. I’ve had a really nice schnitzel on a low-cost airline out of Austria. I’ve had fresh sushi that was prepared just an hour before my flight on a Turkish airline, of all things. I’ve even eaten from Lenôtre [a French culinary brand famous for its pastry] in Paris on an Air France flight in economy class. I did pay for that. AVC: It seems like business-class and first-class dining options are getting fancier and fancier, with celebrity chef affiliations and seasonal menus and such, but economy isn’t getting any more interesting foodwise. Unless you count premium economy, which can be inconsistent airline to airline. NL: I do remember being in premium economy and going, “Oh, this is like worse than economy, this meal.” The seat was okay, but it kind of felt like a rip-off. Then you have other airlines that have come out with a premium economy where it was like I was sitting up in business class. They put a really nice tablecloth down, lovely food options. It was quite amazing. There will be airlines that will excel, and then you’ll have others that just don’t care. If you look at the Middle Eastern airlines, a lot of them are doing hot towels and printed menus with up to four meal choices in economy. Then you have other airlines that you can fly with in economy based here in Europe, and they’re not about to give you a choice at all. You just get given a meal—and if you don’t like it, too bad. I really think it depends on the region in the world, where you are. Like in America, Delta has just announced that they’re doing free meals on select flights to Honolulu, even in economy now. I think that’s going to be the start of things changing in America. And so they should, because the airlines there are making an absolute fortune. Photo: @inflightfeed AVC: Usually when you fly domestically in America in economy, all you get is the option to buy a $10 box of crackers and trail mix. It’s very disappointing. NL: Yeah, bring back the free meals, I’d say. It’s happened in Australia. Virgin Blue, they were a low-cost airline and they’ve become a traditional airline offering better food—being able to appeal more to corporate customers, that sort of thing. They reinstated free meals just to go head-to-head with Qantas, the national carrier. It’s now happening in America. In Europe, though, we’ve got so many airlines here that are just taking food back and making you pay for it. AVC: You recently finished a crowdfunding campaign to make a documentary about the world of airline dining, so clearly this is a topic of interest to many. NL: Yeah, we were very lucky, but this is the second time that we’ve tried to do it. We initially were trying to do a worldwide documentary. We were trying to raise about $50,000. We were going to visit all sorts of places around the world, and that failed miserably. Then we went back to the drawing board and were like, “Okay, why don’t we concentrate on Europe, because we’re here and it won’t cost too much to get around.” We needed about $10,000. We got just over $10,000, which is amazing. I’ve had so many airlines contacting us that want to be part of it, which is lovely, but we’re kind of sticking to airlines that have a great story to tell and trying to show people what these guys go through in order to deliver something edible in-flight. It should be fun. We’re going to go to New York in November. Most of the other filming is in London, Paris, Riga, Athens, Istanbul, Frankfurt, here in Europe. Hopefully we’ll finish by about February. AVC: Which airlines have those really great stories, in your opinion? NL: A perfect example is Scandinavian Airlines. For their flights to Japan, they went and found the world’s first sake that’s brewed in Europe, in a little village in the middle of nowhere in Norway. They went and found these people and said, “Look, we want to put your sake on our flights to Tokyo.” They work with local producers there and try to create these fusion dishes that have kind of a Scandinavian feel to it. Aegean Airlines in Greece, they highlight the different Greek Islands on board their flights through taste and smell, for a few months each time. You might jump on a flight next week with them to Athens and they may be promoting, I don’t know, some sort of dish from Corfu. They’ll have it on the in-flight magazine, and it will be on your meal tray, and they’ll play a video about Corfu. They’re kind of like ambassadors for Greece. I think that’s really lovely, because I think the passenger going to Greece for a holiday, it gives them that first taste before they even get there. It’s kind of that last memory that you have before you leave. For people coming home, it’s also a really nice welcome home. I think airlines that do stuff like that, they’re spending money to do that, they’re investing in your experience in-flight, and they’re worth flying with.

(WLS) WLS By Frank Mathie Tuesday, October 04, 2016 CHICAGO (WLS) -- A new exhibit at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry is all about learning to fly. The Boeing Corporation built their first airplane 100 years ago in 1916 and are still flying high. The museum's new exhibit, called "Above and Beyond," which opened Tuesday morning and runs through Jan. 8, 2017, begins with a one-quarter scale model of Boeing's first plane, a two-seater seaplane. From there, visitors travel through time and space to the modern era of flying, to the moon, and back and even beyond. "It's about what is next. When you think about aerospace you think about 100 years. We've gone from the horse and buggy, to manned flight, to exploration of the solar system and going up to the moon. Now we're talking about the next generation. What can we inspire in your youth?" said John Blazey, vice president of Boeing Global Corporate. First you have to learn how to fly. In the exhibit you actually fly like a bird because you are a bird. Just flap your arms and the computer puts you in the air with a flock of geese. There's no stairway to heaven but there is an elevator to outer space. It's a ride that makes the Willis Tower look like a bungalow, but hang in there and don't push the down button. If you have a mind for design, there's also the chance to create your own plane and fly it. "You design your fighter plane on the touch screen and then you can test your design when you're finished and put it up on the big screen and fly it through the course, land. How well you do on the course depends on how well you designed it," said Chaz Bickers of the MSI. Off you go into the wild blue yonder, flying high in your own fighter jet. Thank heavens it's just pretend. "Above and Beyond" is included in the museum admission price. Fly on down.

The cause of the mishap isn't known yet. Media: Wibbitz The long-running feud between Elon Musk's space company and its fierce competitor United Launch Alliance took a bizarre twist this month when a SpaceX employee visited its facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and asked for access to the roof of one of ULA's buildings. About two weeks earlier, one of SpaceX's rockets blew up on a launchpad while it was awaiting an engine test. As part of the investigation, SpaceX officials had come across something suspicious they wanted to check out, according to three industry officials with knowledge of the episode. SpaceX had still images from video that appeared to show an odd shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to ULA, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The SpaceX representative explained to the ULA officials on site that it was trying to run down all possible leads in what was a cordial, not accusatory, encounter, according to the industry sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. The building, which had been used to refurbish rocket motors known as the SMARF, is just more than a mile away from the launchpad and has a clear line of sight to it. A representative from ULA ultimately denied the SpaceX employee access to the roof and instead called Air Force investigators, who inspected the roof and didn't find anything connecting it to the rocket explosion, the officials said.

It is the latest odd development in the mystery surrounding the explosion of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Sept. 1. The rocket blew up while it was being fueled ahead of an engine test fire, creating a huge fireball that charred the launchpad and rattled buildings miles away. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and chief executive, has called the failure "the most difficult and complex" the company has ever had. About a week after the explosion, he pleaded with the public to turn in video or audio recordings of the blast and said that the company has not ruled out sabotage as a factor. Related Stories Lawmakers say SpaceX rocket explosion investigation should not be 'politicized' "Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off," he wrote on Twitter. "May come from rocket or something else." Since then, SpaceX, which is leading the investigation with help from the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, said it is narrowing down on the cause of the explosion, focusing on a breach in a second-stage helium system. At a conference in Mexico this week, Musk said that finding out what went wrong is the company's "absolute top priority," but he said what caused the explosion is still unknown. "We've eliminated all of the obvious possibilities for what occurred there," he said. "So what remains are the less probable answers." He didn't say what those might be. The Air Force's 45th Space Wing, which is helping SpaceX with the investigation, declined to comment because the investigation is ongoing. A SpaceX statement said that the "Accident Investigation Team has an obligation to consider all possible causes of the anomaly, and we aren't commenting on any specific potential cause until the investigation is complete." SpaceX and ULA are heated rivals that are competing over national security contracts that together are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. For nearly a decade, ULA had a monopoly on those contracts as the only launch provider certified by the Air Force. But in 2014, SpaceX sued the Air Force for the right to compete. Last year, the parties settled and SpaceX was finally granted its certification. As a result, ULA fired its chief executive and hired a new one who vowed to compete with SpaceX. This week, 10 Republican House members, many friendly to ULA, told NASA that SpaceX should not be leading the investigation and that authority should be turned over to the federal government. Even though the investigation continues, SpaceX has said it intends to return to flight as soon as November, a timeline that has drawn industry skepticism.   Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The Air Force was called upon two weeks after the blast to inspect the roof of a building belonging to the firm’s competitor United Launch Alliance (ULA) at its facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The move came after a SpaceX employee reportedly visited the facility and requested access, according to The Washington Post. ULA’s building is just over a mile away from the site where SpaceX’s rocket blew up on the launch pad on September 1, destroying Facebook’s $200 million satellite. Scroll down for video  On September 1, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket (pictured) exploded as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Earlier this month, a SpaceX employee was visited the company's competitor United Launch Alliance SATELLITE FIRM CLAIMING DAMAGES FROM SPACEX   The Israeli owners of the destroyed AMOS-6 satellite have reportedly been hard hit by the loss. In a press conference last month, Spacecom said it could seek $50m from SpaceX following the explosion on the launch pad last week. AMOS-6 was supposed to provide home internet for Africa and the Middle East.  In addition, Facebook had signed a deal with Eutelsat to lease broadband capacity from the satellite as part of its efforts to increase internet connectivity across the African continent. There has been intense speculation that an object hit the ill-fated Falcon 9 rocket during fueling. Now, it has been revealed that SpaceX has obtained still images from video that appeared to show an odd shadow, followed by a white spot on the roof of a nearby ULA building, the Post reports. A SpaceX employee was denied access to the roof upon a recent visit to the facility, and ULA instead called Air Force investigators. But, after their inspection, nothing was found in connection to the explosion. ‘ULA cooperated with the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing, and nothing associated with the SpaceX accident was found,’ a ULA representative told CNBC. ULA is a joint project between Lockheed Martin and Boeing and is in heated competition with SpaceX over national security contracts that together are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the Post.

Share this article Share 113 shares It was reported last week that the explosion may have been caused by a large breach in the rocket's helium cooling system. A preliminary investigation by SpaceX has found the hole in the cryogenic system, which cools the upper oxygen tank of the rocket, occurred just moments before the explosion and appears to have triggered a catastrophic chain of events. Exactly what caused the breach is still a mystery, the company has said. The SpaceX employee reportedly asked for access to the roof of one of ULA's buildings, which is a little more than a mile away from where SpaceX's rocket launched. The explosion destroyed the rocket and the satellite it was carrying (pictured) A source familiar with the incident reported to the Post that the SpaceX employee told ULA officials that the company was trying to run down all possible leads and that they aren't trying to accuse ULA of anything. Just over a week after the explosion, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter seeking ‘support and advice’ as the investigation continues, calling the event ‘the most difficult and complex failure’ the firm has ever had. And addressing claims that a mysterious object may have hit the rocket, Musk said they ‘have not ruled that out.’ Musk also wrote on Twitter that he was 'particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off'. Elon Musk took to Twitter on September 9 seeking ‘support and advice’ as the investigation continues. SpaceX wrote a similar message on its Twitter account as well, which was retweeted by the billionaire SpaceX CEO SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk (pictured), called the failure 'the most difficult and complex' the company has ever had 'May come from rocket or something else,' he added.

India signed a Rs 60,000 crore deal with Dassault to procure 36 fighters under the medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) programme recently. The team will be constituted at the Aircraft & Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE) headquartered in Bengaluru, its commandant Air Vice Marshal Sandeep Singh confirmed to TOI. It was ASTE which did the field trials for all six contenders—Lockheed Martin's F-16; Boeing's F/A-18 E/F; European Eurofighter Typhoon; the Swedish Gripen; the French Dassault's Rafale and the Russian Mig-35. Out of the six contenders only the Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale met all the 750 quality requirements, including weapon systems. ASTE clarified that they do not compare aircraft and that only clear them based on requirement and that the decision of picking one is made at a higher level. Singh, explained that the team, once constituted will have pilots, engineers and air crew. "The size of the team will vary. For the Su-30MKI for example, we had a 10 member team," he said. Given that the ASTE has already flown Rafale, a smaller team will be going to France. The advantage that this will give the IAF is that it will bring back a known platform, which its pilots understand. SU30-Brahmos integration soon Further, Singh said that the Su30-MKI and air-launched cruise missile Brahmos will happen soon with the firing of the actual missile. "Advanced trials are ongoing as we speak. We've already completed a dummy drop and the next drop will be the actual missile," he said. The integration will enable IAF to strike targets 300km away and the aircraft had to be modified to accommodate this missile. The IAF's initial requirement is for two Su-30 MKIs with BrahMos but it eventually wishes to integrate 216 missiles on 42 Sukhois. The project was conceived in July-August 2012 and as TOI had reported late in 2015, some quality certification issues has delayed the integration, which was to be complete by the end of 2015.

The hitch: nobody has ever been able to produce the stuff in the volumes needed. JetBlue Airways Corp., United Continental Holdings Inc. and Richard Branson’s Virgin Group Ltd. have begun blending eco-friendly substitutes into traditional jet fuel made from kerosene. Even with that backing, there’s still only a handful of producers of the fuels. They lack the capacity to crank out the billions of gallons needed to supply the global aviation fleet, and the pace of investment is slowing. Even so, airlines are staking their low-carbon future on renewable fuels. The aviation industry, responsible for more than 2 percent of greenhouse gases, is being pushed to act this week by delegates from 190 nations, who are debating a United Nations accord in Montreal that would cap emissions from international flights. Ultimately, that means burning less fossil fuel. With electric planes still experimental, airlines and aerospace companies say biofuels are their best bet. “There is a tremendous amount of determination to make biofuel work because we just don’t have any alternative,” Julie Felgar, Boeing Co.’s managing director of environmental strategy and integration, said in an interview. The biofuel industry currently has enough factories to produce as much as 100 million gallons (378 million liters) of jet fuel annually, said Claire Curry, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That barely registers next to the more than 83 billion gallons airlines consume each year.  Investments in biofuel, meanwhile, are at a record low, with $322 million in backing globally during the first six months of 2016, according to BNEF. That’s off 64 percent from the first half of 2015 and down 98 percent from a decade ago, when ethanol production for automobiles took off. “This is still a pipe dream,” Curry said. “No one has figured out how to make these fuels at scale yet. The technologies are really complicated. They often don’t work. And the plants can cost half a billion dollars to build.” Advocates for renewable jet fuel say the industry will develop after the UN accord takes effect and drives up demand, just as ethanol production boomed in the U.S. after lawmakers passed the Renewable Fuel Standard in 2005. Patrick Gruber, chief executive officer of Gevo Inc., said its jet fuel works, and scaling up is “cookie cutting.” “We know how to do this,” Gruber said. “We just have to make more production lines.” His company is based in Englewood, Colorado, and makes renewable fuel from corn and other crops. It’s backed by the French oil company Total SA and has sales agreements with Alaska Air Group Inc. and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. Yet it’s not always easy to scale up biofuel manufacturing, a complex process involving tiny microbes. In 2012, a contamination problem temporarily derailed Gevo’s efforts to increase output of its primary jet fuel ingredient, isobutanol, at its refinery in Luverne, Minnesota. Gruber said the issues are “well behind us.” Major oil companies have also struggled to develop cost-effective transportation biofuels. “The smartest minds in my company and others haven’t yet cracked the code on pairing the right feedstock conversion technology and logistics in an economic and scalable package,” Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said in a 2014 speech. The aviation industry supports the pending UN accord and has set ambitious environmental goals of its own. Those include improving average fuel efficiency by 1.5 percent a year through 2020 and reducing emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2050. Jet fuel is among airlines’ biggest expenses, and squeezing every last mile from a gallon is crucial to the bottom line. ‘Creating Demand’ “Airlines are stepping up and creating demand,’’ Sophia Mendelsohn, JetBlue’s head of sustainability, said in an interview. “It is hard for me to envision a long-term situation where the biofuel industry does not mature and develop.’’ Airlines began testing biofuels in 2008 and have since used them on more than 1,500 passenger flights. JetBlue agreed in September to buy more than 33 million gallons of blended fuel annually, using renewable fuel from S.G. Preston Co. In March, United Continental announced a three-year deal to buy 15 million gallons of biofuel from AltAir Paramount for flights out of Los Angeles. Not all deals have worked out. In 2014, British Airways Plc announced a $550 million agreement with Solena Fuels for a factory in London to convert municipal trash into jet fuel beginning in 2017. The airline agreed to buy about 30 millions gallons a year at market price. At the time, oil was $109 a barrel. Within a year, it was below $50 a barrel, and Solena dropped the project. “We couldn’t compete with oil that cheap,” Solena CEO Robert Do said in an interview. The products offered by Solena, Gevo and others are almost chemically identical to kerosene. They’re considered renewable because their carbon comes from plants that can be re-grown to refresh supplies. Fuels made from petroleum, by contrast, are exhausted when they are burned, releasing carbon into the air. Environmental Concerns Still, environmental concerns remain. It takes energy to produce biofuel, and emissions from that process may offset gains from using less fossil fuels in the sky. As the industry expands, advocates worry that growing corn and sugar cane for airlines will affect forests, food supplies and water. “All of these issues need to be monitored and taken into account,” said James Beard, who focuses on energy and climate at the  World Wildlife Fund. Airlines aren’t depending on biofuels alone to cut emissions. They’re also working on more aerodynamic planes, cutting cargo weight, improving air-traffic control procedures and enlisting other technological and operations measures. But in the end, they will also need to wean themselves off petroleum-based fuel. “You can only push fuel efficiency so far,” said Nancy Young, vice president of environmental affairs for the trade group Airlines for America. “It is a matter of physics.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Caroline Houck Atlantic Media fellow at Defense One Read bio October 3, 2016 Topics Industry AUSA AA Font size + Print There are more than 600 exhibitors at this year's annual meeting of the Association of the United States Army. Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Caroline Houck Atlantic Media fellow at Defense One Read bio October 3, 2016 Pentagon leaders regularly tout Silicon Valley innovation, but entrepreneurs seem largely absent from the largest defense industry events. Wander the exhibit floors of the military’s largest conferences this fall, and you’ll see everything from ground combat vehicles to veteran-trained service dogs, from bit players hawking flooring for overseas installations to industry giants showing off futuristic ideas. One thing you won’t see much of, if at all? Startups. Pentagon leaders regularly laud Silicon Valley-esque companies and have repeatedly said that harnessing entrepreneurs’ innovative ideas is crucial to the U.S. military’s qualitative edge. Just this month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced the Pentagon will be opening a third Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility in Austin. But that praise—and a planned $65 million in investments funneled through DIUx—have yet to translate to booths on the ground. At the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space and Cyber conference last month, for example, none of the 120-plus exhibitors were what might conventionally be called a startup. “Why would you expect to see a millennial at the opera?” said Air Force Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski, who leads Air Force Materiel Command. “By that I mean, the forum that’s here for AFA, a booth concept, is not the environment that the entrepreneurial community they engage with is one that they come to. It’s not of interest to them.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. A smattering of small businesses That’s not to say that there aren’t small businesses at AFA and the other large conferences, tucked amid the sprawling exhibits from the likes of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. This week’s Association of the United States Army conference has a program, now in its fourth year, that grants small businesses a membership-free trial exhibit at the show, AUSA Industry Affairs Director Michael Scanlan said. This year, the program accounts for more than 80 of AUSA’s 600-plus exhibitors. It doesn’t specifically target startups, because “that’s not how I look at the market,” Scanlan said. What matters is the company’s interest in working with the defense industry, not its age, growth plans, or a self-designation as a startup, he said. “We’ve had a steady stream of interest from smaller, more nimble companies,” Scanlan said. “We try to provide the Army with an opportunity to talk to small businesses and learn from them.” But even though small businesses generate innovative ideas and can share characteristics with startups, the two are not synonymous, the Air Force’s Pawlikowski said. It’s the younger, entrepreneurial startups that are even less likely to be found at traditional industry conferences. Only a handful of the companies in AUSA’s three small business pavilions, for example, were created in the last decade. Hurdles to participating Part of it’s a financial calculation. Larger defense contractors can easily account for the time and resources it takes to develop and man a sufficiently impressive booth for a three-day show, said Andrew Borene, a management consultant with executive experience both at IBM and a microrobotics startup. That becomes a difficult calculus for small, cash-strapped startups. “When you’re talking about those massive-scale shows, they’re long shows, sometimes three or more days,” Borene said. “If you’re a lean startup, you’re not only paying for booth space, you’re taking sellers out of the field for that time. There are small businesses, but they’re generally across that five-year operating hump, they’re not really quite a startup business. Typically they’re there because they have enough operating capacity and stabilized capital.” Then there’s the cost of the space itself. A 10-by-10-foot plot, the smallest stand offered at both AUSA and AFA’s conferences, runs about $5,000—before membership dues to either organization. Though it’s not significantly more than the thousands it costs to exhibit at a few of the biggest tech conferences or innovation-focused events like SXSW, it’s orders of magnitude greater than the fees for a number of startup-oriented conferences. Companies have to decide to invest that capital relatively far in advance as well. A week after AFA’s conference wrapped up, they had already sold 83 percent of the floor space available next year, according to an official. Medium-term prospects like that, as well as the longer-term investments in industry association memberships, aren’t always possible for small businesses and startups, Scanlan said. “It’s challenging for a small business,” he said. “Their business cycles move so fast.” And purchasing booth space a year in advance is one of the shorter lead times startups will encounter when working with the military industrial complex. Protracted acquisition timelines and complicated regulations can turn off entrepreneurs who might otherwise be interested in working with the military, said Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “There are startup companies that are interacting with the department and with the Air Force,” Selva said, speaking on an AFA panel with Pawlikowski. “But they don’t find themselves comfortable in the environment we’ve created. They are not comfortable inside the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and they’re certainly not comfortable on the long lead time and very long development cycles that we normally bring to programs.” Hidden, but not entirely absent One way to “see” startups on the floor? Look to the products and innovations the biggest companies are displaying. The largest contractors play an integrating role with the rest of the industry, from collaborating on specific offerings to sponsoring startup incubators, said Bernie Skoch, the coordinator of the AFA conference. “If you stroll the booths…you’re not going to see [startups’] logos or their brands on the floor necessarily,” he said. “But a lot of the integrators, each one of the primes, they partner with startups, small businesses, those non-traditional companies.” For those startups not already wrapped into one of the big contractors’ fold, purchasing exhibit space is the most visible way to participate at the large conferences, but it’s not the only one. Skoch said a number of small businesses and startups have connected with the association’s other members by sponsoring a panel or tables at the receptions, although AFA does not make those sponsorship lists public. And multiple sources said walking the floor as an attendee—rather than exhibiting on it—can prove just as fruitful for smaller-staffed startups. “I have seen people from companies that are small and in startup phase buying a full access ticket and having a lot of success,” Borene said. “That’s the other reason you’re not seeing them on the exhibit floor. It’s a guerrilla tactic…a smart startup CEO is leveraging every angle.” Another viable option is one of any of the shorter conferences outside the D.C. Beltway that still provide a “safe, ethical means for startups to get access” to military leaders, acquisition officials and potential partners, Borene said. “If you’re a small [company], you kind of have to be a contrarian—you’ll get drowned at AUSA,” Borene said. “But if you go to some of the smaller ones, they tend to be a day or at most two days, so you’re not burning resources manning a booth.” Meeting in the middle Whether it’s through formal exhibits or informal conversations at AUSA’s or AFA’s summits, a DIUx award, or another avenue, the military has to find environments in which startups are comfortable, Selva said. “What we have to do, and what we have been doing is trying to nurture relationships with those small companies by placing bets and asking them hard questions and giving them some time to chew on them,” Selva said. That increased engagement with small entrepreneurs might not translate to a significantly larger startup presence on the exhibit floor, or even a desire for it. Though the AFA hasn’t wrapped up its post-conference survey from attendees and exhibitors, Skoch said they hadn’t yet received any feedback requesting a greater startup presence on the floor. “We haven’t completely tabulated the data, but what we heard from the exhibitors is this was one of the most engaged years, the busiest they’ve seen the floor,” he said. “I have not heard a specific desire for non-traditional exhibitors.” Recognizing the difficulties startups face when engaging with the large-scale conferences, the Air Force and other services have started to meet them where they’re most comfortable instead, Pawlikowski said. “We have to reach out to the forums they’re participating in,” she said. “I, personally, out in Los Angeles participated in a venture capitalist conference to talk about space … After I participated in a panel, I had about a dozen venture capitalists come up to me, wanting [me] to know that they had entrepreneurs that were interested in getting involved.” Outreach like that is starting to return dividends, Borene said. Startups may not be expressing their interest by purchasing booths at the massive industry events, but they are expressing it. He pointed to organizations like Eastern Foundry, which has created a homebase with office space and resources just down the road from the Pentagon for startups interested in the defense sector. “The Pentagon, with its giant bureaucracy, is making all of the right moves in embracing and getting out to the clusters of ingenuity in the civilian sector, and on the other side, you’re seeing those entrepreneurs aggregating here in DC in order to start addressing that need,” Borene said. “The macro trends are all moving in the right direction to start seeing innovation in the defense industrial base.” Caroline Houck is an Atlantic Media fellow at Defense One.

A system of two geostationary satellites is used to relay information between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, spacecrafts or airbornes and fixed ground stations. EDRS will enable satellites to immediately transfer data to the ground instead of waiting for up to hours before flying over a fixed ground station*. The SpaceDataHighway is a public–private partnership between ESA and Airbus Defence and Space. The DLR German Aerospace Center funded the development of the cutting-edge laser technology that forms the backbone of the system. The first node, EDRS-A, was launched on 29 January 2016 as a hosted payload on the Eutelsat-9B satellite. The second, the dedicated EDRS-C satellite, will be launched in 2017**. "SpaceDataHighway is no longer science fiction. It will revolutionise satellite communications, and help to keep the European space industry at the forefront of technology and innovative services," said Evert Dudok, Head of the Communications, Intelligence & Security (CIS) business line at Airbus Defence and Space*.

Lockheed Martin is responsible for producing 42 Modernized Day Sensor Assembly (M-DSA) upgrade kits and spares as part of Lot 1 production under the deal. M-DSA provides the ability to more rapidly identify targets and co-ordinate with troops on the ground. Its modular design also reduces operation and support costs, according to Lockheed Martin. Specifically, M-DSA provides the ability to view high-resolution, near-infrared and colour imagery on cockpit displays. It includes a new laser pointer marker that improves co-ordination with ground troops. An updated multi-mode laser with eye-safe lasing capability supports soldiers in urban environments and home-station training. M-DSA was developed in two phases. Phase 1 began in 2011 when Lockheed Martin received an army contract to deliver 680 Selex Galileo laser range finder/designator kits for US and international Apaches. Phase 2 was mainly about providing colour in the cockpit. It included upgrades such as a new structure to house M-DSA technology, a modernised sensor that provides high-resolution colour, an inertial measurement unit, a laser marker, and a new digital colour display inside the cockpit.

The aircraft, however, landed safely. AI has faced several instances of windshield cracks in the Boeing 787 and the US major has in the past two to three years carried out several modifications to check this issue. "The problem occurred as the aircraft was approaching Chennai. A windshield has two layers. One of the layers cracked and the other was intact. So the plane landed safely. Boeing has managed to reduce the occurrence of windshieldcracks; this has re-occurred after some time. "The windshield was changed and the plane is back in the air," said an official.

A bipartisan group of 24 members of Congress has written a letter praising the role NASA, the FAA and the Air Force are taking in the investigation of a massive fire on a Cape Canaveral launch pad in early September that claimed both a SpaceX rocket and a nearly $300 million satellite. The letter encourages the agency to reject calls to turn the investigation entirely over to federal hands. Just a week ago, 10 members of congress wrote their own letter to the same three agencies, questioning the leading role SpaceX is playing in the inquiry. "We feel strongly that the current investigation should be led by NASA and the Air Force to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied and that the outcomes are sufficient to prevent NASA and military launch mishaps in the future," said the letter dated Sept. 29 and signed first by Rep. Mike Coffman, R-CO. The more recent letter, dated Tuesday, appears to be a response to this call. "Accidents are unfortunate events, and accident investigations shouldn't be politicized," said the second letter, signed first by Rep. Bill Flores (R-TX). Some of the lawmakers who signed each letter have interests that align with various private space companies, the Los Angeles Times noted. show chapters <p>Sabotage speculation surrounding SpaceX</p> <p>CNBC&#039;s Morgan Brennan reports the latest details surrounding the SpaceX &quot;sabotage.&quot;</p> Sabotage speculation surrounding SpaceX    Monday, 3 Oct 2016 | 4:44 PM ET | 01:33 Flores' district is home to a SpaceX rocket facility, while Coffman's district houses the headquarters of the United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that competes with SpaceX for contracts. News of the investigation took a curious turn last week when the Washington Post reported that SpaceX had been considering sabotage as a possible cause of the mishap. A SpaceX employee requested access to a building owned by ULA, after SpaceX reportedly produced still images of an "odd shadow then a white spot" on the roof. The employee was turned away, and Air Force investigators found nothing on the roof. On Wednesday, Business Insider reported speaking to an anonymous source at ULA, who said the incident became "pretty much a joke" among ULA employees, and speculated that SpaceX was likely simply trying "just to tie up a loose end." The employee said that the story has become the source of "fascinating" gossip and theorizing among ULA staff.

News World Europe Nicolas Sarkozy hints he wants to ban Muslim headscarves in France But his campaign team claim it was an off-hand comment May Bulman Wednesday 5 October 2016 18:14 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Mr Sarkozy made the hardline comments on French radio, but they were later disputed by his campaign team AFP/Getty Nicolas Sarkozy has indicated he plans to ban the Muslim headscarf in public if he gets into power next year. Mr Sarkozy, who is seeking the Republican Party nomination to run as a presidential candidate in the 2017 election, told a French radio show he intended to ban the headscarf in order to achieve "strict equality" between men and women and comply with the values of the French Republic. During an interview on Radio Classique, the right-wing politician was asked whether he was preparing to ban the headscarf, to which he replied: "Exactly". Read more Nicolas Sarkozy branded a 'fake tough guy' obsessed with Carla Bruni's breasts in blistering new memoir Nicolas Sarkozy promises to offer UK chance to change decision on Brexit if he becomes French president Nicolas Sarkozy says immigrants should 'speak French' and attacks 'medieval' burkini Nicolas Sarkozy 'should stand trial' over 2012 election spending allegations When the journalist then asked: "Yes or no?" Mr Sarkozy replied with a clear "Yes", adding: “On French soil, we don't accept inequalities between men and women." The politician and former French president proceeded to argue that a ban of headscarves and burkinis was required to achieve gender equality and uphold the "national identity" of the French Republic. He said: “No headscarves, no burkinis, no specific swimming times at the public pools, and strict equality when it comes to the rights and of men and women - that is the French republic. "We have a national identity, a way of life. There are countries in the world where women can't drive. If you want to live there you can go live there. In the Republic of France, we do not accept that." Despite Mr Sarkozy's comments his team has denied they are working on a proposal to ban the headscarf, claiming hid remarks had been overplayed in the media.

(Photo courtesy of CSUSM) Big Grant Puts Cal State San Marcos Step Closer to Launching Engineering Program Cal State San Marcos is a step closer to launching an engineering program thanks to a nearly $6 million grant received from the U.S. Department of Education. The five-year grant — from the Hispanic-Serving Institutions STEM Program — will provide nearly $1.2 million each year beginning this month. “This grant is a significant first step toward launching our engineering program,” CSUSM President Karen Haynes said. “Over the next several months we will be working to secure the necessary private sector funding that will allow us to bring the program to reality.” Gerardo Dominguez, an associate professor of physics at CSUSM, is the project director for the grant, which is titled “Si Se Puede!” to Close the Equity Gap in Engineering Degree Completion. “I’m thrilled that this proposal has been chosen and I am excited about the possibilities that this brings to the campus community,” Dominguez said. “It will increase the professional and education opportunities for the residents of North County and the broader area served by CSU San Marcos. I am particularly excited that the funding provided by this grant will allow CSU San Marcos to start offering engineering options for our students in the near future.” The purpose of the grant is to develop and carry out activities to improve and expand CSUSM’s capacity to serve Hispanic and low-income students. The project’s goals include developing innovative degree programs in software engineering and electrical engineering; developing the engineering curriculum and transfer pathway between community college partners and CSUSM; and building and supporting an educational ecosystem focused on equitable student success and completion through best practices. _______________________ Accion San Diego Awarded $1 Million To Bolster Loans to Low-Income Clients Accion, a San Diego-based nonprofit microlender, was awarded a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund to serve low-income people and communities that lack access to affordable financial products and services. It is the largest CDFI Fund grant that the organization has ever received, having been awarded $880,000 in 2014. It is also the single largest financial contribution received in the organization’s 22-year history. “We are so pleased to be recognized by the U.S. Department of the Treasury through this award,” said Accion CEO Elizabeth Schott. “We look forward to continuing to strengthen the roots of underserved communities by providing essential capital to local entrepreneurs who may not be able to obtain it otherwise. This $1 million grant will enable us to reach more business owners than ever before.” The fund will be used for loan capital, which will be deployed in two of the counties in Accion’s service area, San Diego and Imperial. Accion was one of two organizations in San Diego County to receive the award and the only Imperial County nonprofit to receive funds from CDFI. Two other members of the Accion U.S. Network were also awarded grants from the CDFI Fund: Accion, based in New York City, received $1.75 million. Accion, based in Albuquerque, N.M., received $2 million. _______________________ Federal Grant to Scripps Research Institute Expands to $207 Million Scripps Research Institute has been awarded an additional $87 million from the National Institutes of Health for a greater role in its Precision Medicine Initiative. The award marks a significant increase in scope from the initial award announced in July and provides additional details about the network of partners in the TSRI-led consortium. The action expanded a five-year funding award to the institute from $120 million to $207 million. “The size of this award underscores the critical nature of this research in improving our ability to prevent and treat disease,” said TSRI President Peter Schultz. “We are thrilled to be part of such a major undertaking and look forward to supporting Dr. Eric Topol in leading this unprecedented project.” Topol, who is director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, professor of genomics at TSRI and chief academic officer at Scripps Health, will direct the award as part of the PMI Cohort Program, which seeks to engage one million or more U.S. participants in a historic medical research effort aimed at improving the ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in lifestyle, environment and genetics. _______________________ California Awarded $844,214 to Boost Export Growth for Small Businesses The U.S. Small Business Administration announced an award of $844,214 to California to support export growth among small businesses. The funding was awarded through SBA’s competitive State Trade Expansion Program (STEP). The California funding was part of an $18.85 billion nationwide grant program. “Exporting provides tremendous opportunities for America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs,” said SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet. “Two-thirds of the world’s purchasing power can be found outside of the United States, but only about one percent of America’s 28 million small businesses are reaching customers beyond our borders. Exporting is an important growth opportunity for our small businesses that are ready to expand their reach into new and increasingly borderless global markets.” These awards are granted to U.S. states and territories to support programs that help small businesses expand their export-related activities. _______________________ The Architecture Pavilion at USD. Rob Quigley Designs Pavilion to Expand USD Architecture Program A new pavilion, designed by award-winning architect Rob Quigley in collaboration with University of San Diego students, will add studios, seminar and exhibition space to the university’s architecture program. “The Architecture Pavilion will allow our students to design and build on a much larger scale,” said Juliana Maxim, USD associate professor and Architecture Program director in the Department of Art, Architecture + Art History. “Our students were also thrilled to work with a world-class architect like Rob Quigley on the project’s design.” An opening celebration for the Architecture Pavilion will take place Friday from 4:30 to 7 p.m. on the patio behind Camino Hall. Built with a pre-engineered steel structure and simple materials, the 2,100-square-foot pavilion includes indoor-outdoor studio spaces and seminar room, all under natural, filtered light. The flexible environment can be easily transformed to allow for lectures and exhibitions, expanding the range of public events the program can host. “All this is key to the identity and larger regional presence of our architectural program,” Maxim said. “Our goal was to achieve multi-functionality and sustainability with simple means.” “It was a delight to work with creative students to achieve this unusual building,” Quigley said. “The new Pavilion leverages San Diego’s benign climate to expand the utility of the structure. Large overhead doors open to the central courtyard and also the tree shaded east lawn for expanded programs and interaction. The building is an instructional model of passive environmental design. Soft, natural daylighting floods the interior. Oversized ceiling fans circulate the air and special manually operated ‘air scoop’ windows channel the afternoon breezes thru the space.” _______________________ Moores Cancer Center Joins Initiative to Tackle Pancreatic Cancer The Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health has been selected as one of 12 clinical trial sites for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s newly created Precision Promise, the first large-scale precision medicine trial network designed to transform outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. “Precision Promise is a clinical trials network that will provide patients with access to trials rooted in science that are tailored to each person,” said Dr. Andrew Lowy, chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at Moores Cancer. “Every possible patient with pancreatic cancer should be enrolled in a clinical trial because standard treatments are not enough. Precision Promise will offer a trial for every patient.” Nationally, only 4 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer enroll in clinical trials. To address this, Precision Promise is bringing together leaders in the field, including clinicians, researchers and drug developers, and is putting the patient at the center of every decision to advance the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s goal of doubling survival by 2020. The network will allow researchers at all 12 clinical trial sites to evaluate the success of each other’s patients as they progress through treatment. If a treatment is not effective in an individual, the team will have access to the latest tissue samples that can be studied to determine why that person did not respond to a therapy. _______________________ Postcards will begin showing up in mailboxes this week. Voter Registration Deadline Coming Up on Oct. 24 The San Diego County Registrar of Voters is sending courtesy postcards to two groups of county voters in an effort to reduce unnecessary provisional voting at the polls on Nov. 8. One is going to approximately 20,000 mail ballot voters whom Postal Service records show have recently moved but have not re-registered. They will be receiving a postcard reminding them to complete a new registration form with their new home address. If they do not, they might not receive their mail ballot or voting information. They may also need to vote provisionally if they show up at their poll on Election Day. The other postcard aims to help about 30,000 mail ballot voters who voted provisionally in the June election avoid that happening again on Nov. 8. If you vote by mail, the Registrar encourages you to vote and return that ballot promptly through the mail. Postcards will begin showing up in mailboxes this week. For more information, visit sdvote.com or call (858) 565-5800.  _______________________ Workshop for Warriors Receives $50,000 Grant from Boeing Workshop for Warriors, a nonprofit school providing veterans free training in machining and welding, announced it received a $50,000 grant from Boeing. The organization said the grant is crucial in allowing Workshops for Warriors to support workforce development by providing quality training, accredited STEM educational programs and opportunities to earn third-party nationally recognized credentials. “Boeing is not only the leader in the Aviation and Aerospace, but they are big supporters of programs like ours that enhance STEM, workforce training, and educational and career pathway opportunities for Veterans,” said Hernàn Luis y Prado, founder of Workshop for Warriors. Founded in 2008, the organization offers classes in CNC machining, CAD/CAM programming and welding. Between 2011 and 2015, Workshops for Warriors trained more than 200 veterans and wounded warriors.  _______________________  Chargers Stadium Would Bring Economic Boost, Study Claims By City News Service A Chargers stadium and convention center annex being proposed under Measure C would be an economic boost and bring an array of benefits for San Diego workers and residents, according to a study released Tuesday by two local economists. The study was panned by Measure C opponents. The team-funded study was authored by Alan Gin, an associate professor of economics at the University of San Diego, and Murtaza Baxamusa, director of planning and development for the San Diego County Building and Construction Trades Council Family Housing Corporation. “The Chargers gave us complete freedom to do our research over the summer months and to come to whatever conclusions we believed were warranted,” Gin said. “The study we are releasing today is the result of three months of intensive work by Dr. Baxamusa, our research assistant Kelly Allende and me.” The study found that the project, if approved by two-thirds of voters in November, would create 15,000 construction jobs and 6,400 permanent jobs. Regional economic output was projected to increase by $1.2 billion, while labor income would be increased by $1.2 billion. The San Diego County Taxpayers Association released a statement with a different view.” Study after academic study over a quarter century have all reached the same conclusion — football stadiums do not foster economic development. They are not good for the tax base,” SDCTA President and CEO Haney Hong said. “Urban theorist Richard Florida recently put it this way: ‘The overwhelming conclusion of decades of economic research on the subject is that using public funds to subsidize wealthy sports franchises makes zero economic sense and is a giant waste of taxpayer money.’” Read more…       About the author View all articles by SD Metro Magazine ← Daily Business Report-Oct. 4, 2016 Daily Business Report-Oct. 6, 2016 → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

We’d like to throw open the door for suggestions for topics. What do you want to know? What do you think you know, but aren’t sure? What are you certain you know, but want to prove it beyond doubt? Ideally, we’d like to see questions that have to do with public policy. Some areas may include Mayor Filner’s first 100 days job performance, should the city be responsible for economic growth and the creation of new jobs, how important are infrastructure improvements to our daily lives (streets and bridges, etc.), how important is water independence, how satisfied are residents with public transit or how do city residents value Balboa Park and other open spaces? Do you believe the City Council should revive the Plaza de Panama plan for Balboa Park?

Top Countries That Benefit From Global Arms Trade © Photo: Pixabay Military & Intelligence 19:08 05.10.2016(updated 19:09 05.10.2016) Get short URL 511301140 Imagine a conversation where you ask a new acquaintance what line of work they are in, and they say, "in the export and import business." You could very well be speaking to someone involved in the lucrative trading of weapons worldwide. Chances are, they may be doing rather well too, as war is profitable, especially in the current geopolitical climate. And where there is demand, there will always be supply. The global arms trade consists of a number of commercial companies, arms manufactures and war contractors, ready to deliver their goods to the highest bidder.  The Arms Trade Treaty went into force in December 2014 to promote #Peace #SDG16 marking a global achievement https://t.co/yqRjRjCHeG pic.twitter.com/bpoUb47Tan — Safecity/Rasha (@pinthecreep) October 5, 2016​ According to data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the private weapons industry is worth over a whopping US$400 billion (£313.97bn) worldwide. The biggest independent arms exporting countries, earning the largest estimated profits between 2010-2014, according to SIPRI, were the United States, Russia, China, Germany and France. The ﬁve biggest importers were India, Saudi Arabia, China, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan.  © Flickr/ Hamed Parham Ten Percent of Global Military Budget Would End World Poverty and Hunger Lockheed Martin (US) is top of the overall list of profiteers with annual weapons sales said to reach US$35.49 billion. They are followed by Boeing (US) at US$30.70 billion and then, BAE Systems (UK), whose annual sales are estimated at US$26.82 billion. The EU's Airbus Group, is a little further down the list, as well as many other companies from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Israel and India — who have also made the top 100. Interestingly, the top five countries profiting the most from arms trade happen to be the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: the US, UK, France, Russia, and China. Seeking global peace with the strategy of war is certainly a very confusing foreign policy which is to this day adopted by governments around the world. But the creation of national wealth and providing jobs is often given as the reason for why the arms industry is necessary and continues to thrive, even more paramount it seems, than the ethical responsibilities the industry fails to acknowledge. In our latest #Peace & #Justice blog: @Oxfam’s @DeborahHardoon on #inequality & violence https://t.co/PtAbhAvBkI https://t.co/PTh5SKo9R6 pic.twitter.com/TRmBdbFHIC — Saferworld (@Saferworld) October 4, 2016​ And beyond the physical arms trade industry, we shouldn't forget the growing demand for cyberdefense technologies. Not only are countries engaged with the import and expor of arms, major corporate organizations and governments are also putting in a lot of effort and money into improving their cybersecurity systems too. The big companies involved in delivering cyberdefense systems include the likes of Intel (US), BAE Systems (UK), Raytheon (US) and Shoji Communications (India).    ...

So the article can try to implicate China and Russia as equal partners in war crimes all it wants, but that's not the truth, if the truth means anything anymore.

"Redundant separation systems will sever the crew capsule from the booster at the same time we ignite the escape motor." Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Once ejected, the capsule  shot away from the failing booster and coasted through the air before three main parachutes and thrusters deployed to bring it safely to landing. Three minutes later, the booster stage returned to Earth, landing vertically. A Blue Origin booster stage touches down in a West Texas desert, in a successful test of a reusable escape motor. Screenshot The system had been tested on the ground, but this was be the first in-air test and the company has programed the capsule to deploy at the most stressful point in the launch, according to Bezos. Escape systems are not a new concept and have been built into even the earliest rockets, including the Mercury, Apollo, and Soyuz spacecraft. But those escape motors sat on top of the passenger capsule and thus had to be jettisoned during the flight for the capsule to make it to space. Blue Origin’s escape motor lies below the capsule and will need to be jettisoned only in the event of a rocket failure, rather than with every flight, whether it is successful or not. Making both the rocket and the escape motor reusable will drive down the cost of space travel. Bezos's competitors are working on similar technology: SpaceX has demonstrated its escape plan on 3D printed models, while Boeing plans to test the escape system on its CST-100 Starliner in 2017. The rockets' successful landing was unexpected, even to Bezos. The 70,000 lbs. of force required to eject the capsule, even in the event of a simulated rocket malfunction such as this one, is enough to render the rocket unusable.

"Although almost all applications are delivered over some segment of public network, often of variable quality, it is still the case that most applications first meet the network in production. This means that any network performance related issues are discovered at deployment and not in the Q&A phases where remediation would be cost effective and mitigate risks including reputational damage and rollback/remediation costs," explains Frank Puranik, Senior Product Specialist, iTrinegy. "The reason for this is that most testing, including automated testing, is functional rather than covering any deployment risk. Although, bizarrely, this is completely counter to the personal experience of testers, users and management alike, who will be well aware how applications that they themselves use, are affected by the network. This includes both application performance and the associated end user experience." "iTrinegy's Virtual Test Network technologies remove all of the hurdles of testing in real-world network environments, whether still using the waterfall development approach or the more modern continuous integration and testing of DevOps." iTrinegy can be found at Booth #32 where its team of specialists will be on hand to show visitors how virtual test networks and network profiling technologies can provide organizations with the means to ensure the success of their next deployment and protect their reputation for both delivering quality applications and quality customer service. The STARWEST exhibition, takes place over October 5 & 6 at the Disneyland Hotel, Anaheim, CA and is part of the overall STARWEST conference running from October 2-7. Further details on the STARWEST 2016 Expo can be found at: https://starwest.techwell.com/expo/about-expo About iTrinegy  iTrinegy is a world leader in Networked Application Risk Management and is trusted by governments, military organizations and enterprises across the globe including Alcatel, Aviva, BT, Boeing, Cisco, Fidelity Worldwide Investments, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, National Australia Bank, Raytheon, Thomson Reuters, Salesforce and Starbucks.

Photograph: HBO Sarah Morgan Wednesday 5 October 2016 07.22 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 15.39 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In the aftermath of a disastrous birthday party, which saw her best friend’s husband have a heart attack, and her husband, Robert, nearly get shot, Frances (Sarah Jessica Parker) asks Robert (Thomas Haden Church) for a divorce. His response is to vomit into his wine glass, and then over the shoes of a police officer. Frances looks mildly annoyed, and turns, apologetically, to the cop. “I’m sorry – he had a lot of fondue.” And so opens Divorce, HBO’s viscerally captivating new comedy by Sharon Horgan. Horgan is apparently building an empire of one-word-title sitcoms that take a domestic situation we think we’ve seen on TV before, and go fully forensic on it – Waking The Dead-style – so we get to see all the disgusting guts and fluids within. Divorce is about falling out of love, through indifference, and into hate, and the Venn diagram where they all overlap In Catastrophe, she exploded the notion that motherhood somehow grants you wisdom or serenity. In Divorce, she explores what happens when you fall out of love, through indifference, and into hate, and the bit of the Venn diagram where those three overlap. Because it’s Parker and HBO, everyone is rich and blow-dried, and it’s lovely to look at; because it’s Horgan, everyone is just enough of a broken monster you fall slightly in love with them. Tonally, it’s like a dream after eating a wheel of stilton and falling asleep in front of Sex and the City. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sarah Jessica Parker in Divorce. Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/AP I have a soft spot for watching couples like Frances and Robert, relationships that feel like two people slowly eating each other with teaspoons. When your domestics are about dishwashers, toxic couples can be a sort of emotional tourism. They lie, cheat and scream at each other, and have all the feelings so you don’t have to. Because cosiness is TV death. Carrie and Mr Big fought, fucked, philandered, and failed to ever be comfortable with each other. In contrast, the plot of Sex and the City 2 hinges on Carrie being grumpy that Mr Big has bought a TV for their bedroom. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The original toxic couple... Kermit and Miss Piggy. Photograph: Henson Assoc./Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar As a child, I got hooked on the co-dependent nightmare romance between a narcissistic starlet and her hyperactive, emotionally withholding producer. Yes, Kermit and Miss Piggy were the prototype toxic couple – Piggy, like all great divas, leaked hunger (for food, fame, frogs, the world), in contrast to Kermit’s masculine professionalism (the show must go on, no matter the emotional cost). They had no weakness but each other. Smushed nose-to-cathode-ray, aged six I was certain that true love was karate chopping your amore in the face on national TV for doing a sex-look at Raquel Welch. Soon after came Eastenders’ Den and Angie. Owners of the Queen Vic, their relationship was a booze-drenched battle royale of emotional cruelty and blue-mascara tears. When Ange found out Den was cheating, Angie did what any brass-ovaried badass would do, and told him she was dying of cancer (she wasn’t). Den discovered the truth, and retaliated on Christmas Day 1986 with a present – divorce papers. “’Appy Christmas, Ange!” One of TV’s most rootable-for love affairs has a toxic underbelly. In the finale of Friends, Ross chased Rachel to the airport to stop her getting on a plane to Paris to take her dream job. Classic toxic boyfriend: “Shhh, you don’t need your career, babe, you’ve got me now …” We all applauded, before remembering they have a child together. Is baby Emma still in a Boeing on a JFK runway? Their lives are a mess, but TV’s new heroines make us all feel better Read more We love Olivia and Fitz in Scandal, Lucious and Cookie in Empire, Piper and Alex in Orange Is The New Black. Alex put Piper in jail, Piper nearly got Alex murdered, but they still they fight-fuck all over the library floor. But Piper resents that her carefully cultivated prison top dog persona doesn’t wash with her long-term love. We’ve all been there too, right? “Ungh, do you have to see and love me as I am? Can’t you see and love me as, I dunno, Lemmy from Motörhead? That’s kind of how I see myself.” When I look down the sofa at the love of my life, sharer of my box sets, the person with whom I will devour Divorce with teas-on-laps and twin slankets, I consider that toxic TV couples provide a safe peephole into a dystopian future – yes, we may be happy beanbags now, but if the stakes were high enough, could we still enflame such passions in each other? Would you die for me? Kill for me? Fake cancer for me? Yes, Cara Mia, a thousand times. But it’s definitely not my turn to load the dishwasher.

Watch Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin test the last-ditch escape system on its tourist spacecraft Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business October 05, 2016 A successful escape Nushmia Khan Your browser does not support HTML5 video. A successful escape 0:00 0:00 Share this video http://qz.com/799209 Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business October 05, 2016 Jeff Bezos is promising a show today (Oct. 5) as his space-flight startup Blue Origin demonstrates a rocket-powered escape system, designed to provide maximum safety to future passengers. After several delays during the countdown, the test came off without a hitch, as you can see in this video below: His company’s reusable New Shepard rocket is designed to carry a six-passenger space capsule to altitudes just above 100 kilometers, where space begins. Like most launch vehicles, Blue Origin’s rocket booster, loaded with propellant and engines, is designed to separate from the capsule at just the right time to sling into space. But what if something goes wrong between launch and that time? That’s what we’ll find out when the company tests its launch escape system. A successful test would confirm that if something goes wrong with the rocket during flight, the passengers could escape disaster. The rocket, which has already flown four times, will take off normally. After about 45 seconds of flight, when the rocket is nearly 16,000 feet in the air, the capsule will be commanded to break free of the booster and, if all goes well, use its own motor to fly to safety before deploying parachutes to bring it safely back to Earth. The booster would most likely be destroyed in the process, slammed, as Bezos described it in a recent blog post, with “70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust.” This no doubt complicates the already tricky process of landing a rocket back on Earth. But Bezos notes that there’s a small chance it could survive. “If the booster does manage to survive this flight—its fifth—we will in fact reward it for its service with a retirement party and put it in a museum,” the Amazon founder and billionaire wrote in an update. “In the more likely event that we end up sacrificing the booster in service of this test, it will still have most of its propellant on board at the time escape is triggered, and its impact with the desert floor will be most impressive.” Escape systems have been built into rockets since the earliest days of manned spaceflight. Both the Mercury and Apollo spacecraft used rocket “towers” on top of the capsules for this purpose, but as Bezos notes, these systems must be jettisoned during flight for the capsule to deploy its parachutes, which can create complications. The Apollo crew capsule escape rocket is tested in 1965. (NASA) That led Blue Origin to choose an internal rocket motor for its escape system, which it tested in 2013. Today’s test will essentially replicate this effort, but during an actual rocket flight. Blue Origin’s competitors have demonstrated similar systems for their rockets. SpaceX’s Dragon II space capsule used 3D-printed rocket motors to demonstrate last year how to escape from tricky situations, and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner is expected to test its own internal escape system sometime in 2017. SpaceX’s Dragon II demonstrates its launch escape system in 2015. (SpaceX) SpaceX has yet to demonstrate its escape system during flight, but founder Elon Musk has said that it likely would have been sufficient to save the cargo that was destroyed during a failed 2015 mission to the International Space Station. For Blue Origin, a successful test would be another step forward in bringing the long-stealthy rocket startup into the public eye. The company has not said when it will start offering seats on its rocket to paying customers, nor how much it will cost.

A declaration to be made public Wednesday by the State Department sets the stage for a meeting next year to create a standards-setting organization. The statement has been signed by some of the U.S.’s closest allies, including the U.K., Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. While President Barack Obama has called for more transparency in the use of armed drones, human-rights groups have said the U.S. continues to keep most such operations secret and has significantly underestimated civilian deaths from its use of the aircraft against terrorists in Pakistan and other nations. ‘Legitimate Interest’ “Recognizing that misuse of armed or strike-enabled” drones “could fuel conflict and instability and facilitate terrorism and organized crime, the international community must take appropriate transparency measures to ensure responsible export and subsequent use,” the U.S.-backed declaration says. But it adds that such concerns shouldn’t be seen as undermining a state’s “legitimate interest” to produce, export or acquire such systems. The declaration is intended to deal with armed aircraft and not the burgeoning interest in using pilotless craft for non-lethal intelligence, surveillance or “delivering pizzas,” according to  Brian Nilsson, deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls. Related story: Burritos-by-Drone Quietly Tested in Virginia Israel and China, two of the world’s largest drone-makers and exporters, haven’t signed the declaration, according to Nilsson. “We continue our engagement with them,” he said. Russia, whose relations with the U.S. are increasingly strained, also is absent from the joint statement. The declaration “is the beginning of a discussion on a controversial topic that warrants its own stand-alone” evaluation, Nilsson said in a telephone interview. “This is getting people comfortable” that “we need to have a discussion and it commits them to participate.” Nilsson said that being a signatory to the declaration will be a consideration when he weighs whether his office, which issues export licenses to U.S. companies, should approve a sale. Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and General Atomics are the biggest U.S. makers of unmanned aerial vehicles. General Atomics makes the armed Predator and Reaper drones used by the U.S. Air Force and the CIA to attack terrorists. Civilian Deaths Coming in Obama’s final months in office, the declaration reflects an evolution of U.S. drone policy that started in 2013 with a White House directive to review the issue. That was followed by the State Department’s establishment last year of an export control policy governing the commercial sale of armed drones. The White House released statistics in July indicating that as many as 116 civilians were killed in 473 clandestine strikes by U.S. drones and piloted aircraft outside the war zones of Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria from the beginning of Obama’s presidency in 2009 to the end of 2015. The strikes killed as many as 2,581 combatants, the White House said. Outside estimates are much higher. The London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates that 380 to 801 civilians were killed by U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya during the same period.

Source: Boeing In a bid to bolster its strike capabilities amid growing threats from Pyongyang, South Korea is planning to buy additional Taurus KEPD 350K air-to-surface cruise missiles that can be carried by its F-15K Slam Eagle fighters, Yonhap news agency reported on 4 October. "The military has recently decided to acquire 90 more Taurus missiles to further beef up its anti-nuclear and anti-missile capabilities. The process to purchase the additional missiles is under way," a defence ministry official told the media outlet. The decision to do this was reportedly triggered by North Korea's fifth nuclear test on 9 September and the country's continued test-firing of ballistic missiles. Some 170 Taurus missiles are already scheduled to be deployed with the Republic of Korea Air Force (RoKAF). South Korea is set to become the first Asian country to operate fighters armed with the advanced German-built missile system, which has a range of over 500 km, the official said. The South Korean military is also considering adopting the GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II), which can destroy moving targets more than 60 km away in all kinds of weather, the official added. The SDB II can reportedly be dropped from the F-15K fighter and strike North Korea's moving missile launchers. Want to read more?

Der Mensch konnte niemals und wird es nie können, nämlich das Klima auf der Erde zu verändern, geschweige denn die Erdtemperatur konstant zu halten. Wie seit eh und je wird das Klima auf der Erde fast ausschließlich von der Sonne beeinflusst, auch wenn Pseudowissenschaftler, ideologisch verbildete Wirrköpfe und unbedarfte Politiker etwas anderes behaupten. Und Klimaveränderungen gab es schon immer auf der Erde. Zuletzt gab es im Mittelalter eine Warmzeit und eine Kleine Eiszeit .Man sollte nicht durch den Unfug von Ideologen großen Schaden, vor allem in den Entwicklungsländern, anrichten, sondern vielmehr versuchen, die schädlichen Folgen einer eventuellen Klimaveränderung so gering wie mögl Antwort schreiben Weshalb vorenthält man Ihnen Ihre benötigte von Robert Klatenbrecher 24.10.2016 Medikation? Pseudowissenschaftler und Ideologen, so so, Sie sollten sich schleunigst von Ihrem Alu-Hut trennen. Selbst Grundschüler werden Ihnen vorrechnen können, dass das Verbrennen von Mrd. Tonnen in der Erde gespeichertem Öl nicht sonderlich gut für unsere Umwelt ist. Völlig unerheblich davon, was es auslöst. Da ich aber keine Nachkommen habe, interessiert es mich, so wie Sie, nicht im gerings Weitere Kommentare (5) Endlich ist es soweit! von Artur Strunk 05.10.2016 1 Antwort Endlich ist die "Grenze" von 400 ppm von CO2 in der Atmosphäre unumkehrbar überschritten. Nun können alle Pflanzen wieder nach Herzenslust wachsen, denn sie lieben Kohlenstoff und brauchen CO2 zum Gedeihen. Nur: Unsere Politiker und Pseudowissenschaftler wissen das nicht. Es gibt aber eine Partei, die der Klimawandel-Religion ein Ende bereiten will: AFD. Antwort schreiben Kindergarten-Denken von rene koenen 06.10.2016 Was sie praktizieren ist das übliche Denken kleinerer Kinder . Die Biomasse der Erde und auch die immer mehr versauernden Ozeane nehmen nur eine bestimmte Menge CO 2 auf. Der Rest wandert dann in die Atmosphäre Sie "Experte". Biomasse nimmt genau so viel CO 2 auf wie es benötigt. Natürlicherweise würde die Biomasse dann, wie in früheren Zeiten, dann zunehmen......kann sie aber wegen Mensch nicht Na endlich von Jörg Richter 05.10.2016 Es gab schon zig tausend Male einen Klimawandel, Eiszeiten, Hitzeperioden, lange bevor es Fabriken, Autos und Dieselfahrzeuge gab. Die Welt hat es immer überlebt. Es ist ja nicht einmal wirklich geklärt ob nicht gerade wieder ein Klimawandel ansteht. Aber, letztendlich, seien wir mal ehrlich, der Klimawandel wird auch durch die Überbevölkerung ausgelöst. Da wir keine verheerenden Kriege mehr habener täglich mehr Menschen hinzukommen, als sterben, ist eine natürliche Minderung notwendig. Die Erde wehrt sich gegen diese unmengen an Menschen. Natürlich klingt das unmenschlich, aber bitte, wie soll man mit dem begrenzten Lebensraum und auch begrenzten Mitteln, diese Mengen an Menschen ernähren? Irgendwann wird es dann zu kriegen kommen für Wasser oder Essen. Das ist im Prinzip nichts anderes. Antwort schreiben IST DOCH LOGISCH von Udo Thünken 05.10.2016 dass sich der Klimawandel durch die abwechslungsreichen und erholsamen Erlebnisreisen unserer Politiker nicht aufhalten lassen kann. Antwort schreiben Na gut, von Roland Reinhard 05.10.2016 da hat sich ja Merkels unselige Politik für die "erschöpften Flüchtlinge" bald von selbst erledigt, wenn die "Forschungen" der "Experten" recht behalten. Das Klima schafft das, alternativlos und postfaktsich auch. Antwort schreiben Jetzt ist der Klimawandel unaufhaltsam von Hans Meyers 05.10.2016 1 Antwort Dann bin ich jetzt etwas beruhigter. Als die Titanic den Eisberg rammte, war es egal, ob sich die Passagiere Sekt oder Selters gönnten. Am Untergang konnten sie nichts ändern. Wir können jetzt zumindest die restliche Zeit fröhlich feiern, anstatt uns von den Ökos auch noch das Essen vorschreiben lassen. Antwort schreiben Es ist ja von Wolter Thomas 22.10.2016 Unglaublich, wie gleichgültig und dämlich hier auf den Klimawandel reagiert wird, ich hab gedacht, das hier doch schlauer geschrieben wird, ich bin auch kein Prophet,aber für mich ist ganz klar, wir alle sind selberSchuld daran ,in dem wir Flugzeuge on Mass nutzen, Wälder roden auf Teufel komm raus, es immer mehr Fahrzeuge auf der Welt gibt, Schiffe ,Industrie ohne Schornsteinfilter,usw fahren Videos 24.08.2016 12 Bei Proxima Centauri Nur einen Stern weiter: Forscher entdecken erdähnlichen Planeten in RekordnäheSind wir allein im Universum?

The core stage liquid hydrogen tank has completed welding on the Vertical Assembly Center at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. Credit: NASA/MAF/Steven Seipel The first of the massive fuel tanks that will fly on the maiden launch of NASA’s SLS mega rocket in late 2018 has completed welding at the agency’s rocket manufacturing facility in New Orleans – marking a giant step forward for NASA’s goal of sending astronauts on a ‘Journey to Mars’ in the 2030s. Technicians have just finished welding together the liquid hydrogen (LH2) fuel tank in the Vertical Assembly Center (VAC) welder at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in New Orleans. The VAC is the world’s largest welder. Welding is nearly complete on the liquid hydrogen tank will provide the fuel for the first flight of NASA’s new rocket, the Space Launch System, with the Orion spacecraft in 2018. The tank has now has now completed welding on the Vertical Assembly Center at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com This flight version of the hydrogen tank is the largest of the two fuel tanks making up the SLS core stage – the other being the liquid oxygen tank (LOX). In fact the 130 foot tall hydrogen tank is the biggest cryogenic tank ever built for flight. “Standing more than 130 feet tall, the liquid hydrogen tank is the largest cryogenic fuel tank for a rocket in the world,” according to NASA. And it is truly huge – measuring also 27.6 feet (8.4 m) in diameter.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com I recently visited MAF to see this giant tank when it was nearly finished welding in the VAC. I also saw the very first completed test tank version of the hydrogen tank, called the qualification tank which is virtually identical. The precursor qualification tank was constructed to prove out all the manufacturing techniques and welding tools being utilized at Michoud. The first liquid hydrogen tank, also called the qualification test article, for NASA’s new Space Launch System (SLS) heavy lift rocket lies horizontally beside the Vertical Assembly Center robotic weld machine on July 22, 2016 after final welding was just completed at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com SLS is the most powerful booster the world has even seen and one day soon will propel NASA astronauts in the agency’s Orion crew capsule on exciting missions of exploration to deep space destinations including the Moon, Asteroids and Mars – venturing further out than humans ever have before! NASA’s agency wide goal is to send humans to Mars by the 2030s with SLS and Orion. The LH2 and LOX tanks sit on top of one another inside the SLS outer skin. Together the hold over 733,000 gallons of propellant. The SLS core stage – or first stage – is mostly comprised of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen cryogenic fuel storage tanks which store the rocket propellants at super chilled temperatures. Boeing is the prime contractor for the SLS core stage. The SLS core stage stands some 212 feet tall. The SLS core stage is comprised of five major structures: the forward skirt, the liquid oxygen tank (LOX), the intertank, the liquid hydrogen tank (LH2) and the engine section. The LH2 and LOX tanks feed the cryogenic propellants into the first stage engine propulsion section which is powered by a quartet of RS-25 engines – modified space shuttle main engines (SSMEs) – and a pair of enhanced five segment solid rocket boosters (SRBs) also derived from the shuttles four segment boosters. NASA engineers successfully conducted a development test of the RS-25 rocket engine Thursday, Aug. 18 at NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Miss. The RS-25 will help power the core stage of the agency’s new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket for the journey to Mars. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The vehicle’s four RS-25 engines will produce a total of 2 million pounds of thrust. The tanks are assembled by joining previously manufactured dome, ring and barrel components together in the Vertical Assembly Center by a process known as friction stir welding. The rings connect and provide stiffness between the domes and barrels. The LH2 tank is the largest major part of the SLS core stage. It holds 537,000 gallons of super chilled liquid hydrogen. It is comprised of 5 barrels, 2 domes, and 2 rings. The LOX tank holds 196,000 pounds of liquid oxygen. It is assembled from 2 barrels, 2 domes, and 2 rings and measures over 50 feet long. The maiden test flight of the SLS/Orion is targeted for no later than November 2018 and will be configured in its initial 70-metric-ton (77-ton) Block 1 configuration with a liftoff thrust of 8.4 million pounds – more powerful than NASA’s Saturn V moon landing rocket. Although the SLS-1 flight in 2018 will be uncrewed, NASA plans to launch astronauts on the SLS-2/EM-2 mission slated for the 2021 to 2023 timeframe.

Speaking to newsmen in Lagos on Monday, the chairman of Air Peace Chief Allen Onyema, said that foreign investors should take advantage of the business opportunities in the country by deepening their investments despite the economic challenges. Onyema said that the recent Federal Government approval given the Air peace to operate direct flights on the Enugu- Liuangzhou-Enugu routes would showcase the huge business opportunities in the country. He said that the federal government had also approved Air Peace to operate flights to Atlanta, USA Dubai, Jonannesburg and Mumbai, Kenya, among other International routes. He reiterated that the airline would improve its services for more efficient service delivery to its customers even as it maintain high standards in accordance with best international practices obtainable in the industry. The Air Peace boss added that the airline has recently launched its Lagos-Benin-Lagos and Abuja-Benin-Abuja routes besides its approved international routes, and will deploy a Boeing 777 aircraft on the Enugu-Guangzhou-Enugu route. He said that with the Boeing aircraft on its international route, the trips would be seamless, safe and comfortable. Onyema said that the airline had retained the services of some of the best facilities in the world for the maintenance of its aircraft because of the premium it placed on the safety and satisfaction of its passengers.

On Tuesday, flight 131 took off from Mumbai at 6.20am for London. Forty minutes into the flight, the pilots discovered that the Boeing 787s windshield had cracked. They then decided to return to Mumbai as the plane could not have continued on the almost nine-hour journey to UK. The aircraft landed safely in Mumbai at 8.30am. AI then arranged for an alternate aircraft on which the passengers were flown to London. But this episode has left AI deeply worried. Tuesday's windshield crack is the second such instance in last two days. On Sunday, another AI B-787 flying from Singapore to Chennai had the same issue. "We have had four instances of Dreamliner windshields cracking in last two months. We had this problem of windshields of Boeing 787s cracking three years back and after that Boeing did some modifications due to which this issue subsided. However, now it is again back and we are in touch with Boeing to find out what needs to be done," said a senior AI official. AI started getting its Dreamliners four years back and the issue of windshield cracks started soon thereafter. Windshield cracks happen due to uneven heating or something hitting the same. This happens in an aircraft usually after five years or when some foreign object hits the same and not in new planes. The Dreamliners have been in AI fleet for just over four years," said an official. The on-going investigation by Boeing indicates that moisture ingress has resulted in an increased rate of occurrence (of windshield cracks). A new window design with improved features is in progress to reduce such incidents. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

A webcam image from NASA'S Kennedy Space Center in Florida shows SpaceX's launch site shortly after a Sept. 1 explosion. (NASA) Samantha Masunaga SpaceX’s investigation into the mysterious explosion of its rocket last month is drawing political support — and branching out in unusual directions. A bipartisan group of 24 members of Congress — many of whose interests align with those of SpaceX — have sent a letter to the heads of the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration praising the agencies’ roles in assisting or overseeing SpaceX’s investigation into its September launch pad explosion that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket and a communications satellite. That comes a week after 10 Republican House members, including a number of representatives whose districts host space operations by the company’s competition, criticized SpaceX’s role in leading the investigation. In the latest letter, dated Sept. 30, the congressional members said they were “pleased that the FAA is maintaining a strong and prudent oversight role that appropriately draws upon private sector insight in ensuring a robust investigative process and safe return to flight for SpaceX.” Congress members question whether SpaceX should conduct its own investigation Samantha Masunaga Ten Republican Congress members led by Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) have sent a letter to the heads of the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration questioning whether SpaceX should be allowed to lead its own investigation into a Sept. 1 launch pad explosion that destroyed a Falcon... Ten Republican Congress members led by Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) have sent a letter to the heads of the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration questioning whether SpaceX should be allowed to lead its own investigation into a Sept. 1 launch pad explosion that destroyed a Falcon... (Samantha Masunaga) The House members, led by Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas), also supported NASA and the Air Force’s roles in assisting the investigation, saying it is “consistent with long-standing accident investigation procedures.” “We are confident that current NASA and Air Force procedures will ensure that future U.S. government missions that utilize the Falcon 9, and any other launch vehicle system, will undergo appropriate flight worthiness evaluations prior to flight,” the letter states. NASA and the Air Force said they received the letter and are reviewing it. The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter sharply contrasts with — and at one point appears to rebuke — the letter sent last week by SpaceX critics. Those critics, led by Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), suggested instead that NASA or the Air Force should take charge “to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied and that the outcomes are sufficient to prevent NASA and military launch mishaps in the future.” “Accidents are unfortunate events and accident investigations should not be politicized,” the letter led by Flores states. “We encourage you to to reject calls for your organizations to abandon established, well-considered and long-standing procedures.”  Under federal law, SpaceX is allowed to conduct its own investigation. SpaceX, whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp., and other companies lobbied successfully to extend the law last year. The FAA oversees such investigations. Flores’ congressional district includes McGregor, Texas, where SpaceX has a rocket development facility. Among the letter signers were several members of Congress who represent states where Hawthorne-based SpaceX has operations, including California.  Coffman’s congressional district includes the headquarters of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. that had long held a lucrative monopoly on national security launches until SpaceX was certified by the Air Force in 2015 to compete for these contracts. Meanwhile, the explosion investigation veered off in an unexpected direction when the Washington Post reported last week that in an attempt to chase down all possible leads, a SpaceX employee asked for access to the roof of a nearby building leased by ULA after “SpaceX officials had come across something suspicious they wanted to check out.” Citing unnamed industry sources, the Washington Post said the encounter between the SpaceX employee and ULA officials was “cordial, not accusatory,” and that the SpaceX worker had still images from a video showing an “odd shadow, then a white spot” on the roof of the ULA building. ULA ultimately denied the SpaceX employee access to the roof, instead calling the Air Force to come and inspect, according to the Washington Post. In a statement, ULA said it “cooperated with the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing and nothing associated with the SpaceX accident was found.” SpaceX said its accident investigation team “has an obligation to consider all possible causes of the anomaly,” and that the firm would not comment on any specific potential cause until the investigation was complete. “We have sought all available data to support the investigation in a timely manner following the anomaly, as expected for any responsible investigation,” SpaceX said in a statement. About two weeks ago, SpaceX said a preliminary review of the data suggested that a “large breach” took place in the helium system of the upper-stage liquid oxygen tank. The cause of the breach is still unknown.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists, the Rams break ground on their new stadium, Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration, and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake.

Airport sources said the re-carpeting work including the laying of final layer of the runway should have commenced on September 20, but it was not done because of the irregular rains that would have affected the bitumen work. About 75 per cent of the runway work has been completed now. The entire work is expected to be completed by November. The work is scheduled to be completed in February 2017. “Despite the rains, the grading work along the runway and drainage work as well as electrical work progressed without any hitch,” said Mohammed Shahib of Air Traffic Control, who is in charge of the airport. Officials associated with the renovation project said that the procedures for tendering the works had been quick and smooth. Now the State government should provide assistance for the quick transportation of red earth that is required for the airport works. Permission had to be obtained from the Department of Mining and Geology for the purpose. Passengers’ plight Air passengers from north Kerala had been experiencing air connectivity problems especially to Gulf nations on account of the eight-hour closure of the airport since the renovation work started in September 2015. The runway is closed from noon to 8 p.m. However, the airport functioned with flights landing and taking off as usual during the rest of the time. The airport had been partially shut down for the runway work from May 1, 2015 to ensure safety of the flights. Thus Boeing B-747 and B-777, Airbus A-330, and other wide-bodied aircraft under Code E are not allowed to operate. However, official sources said that even after the completion of the runway strengthening works wide-bodied aircraft would not be allowed to operate services from the airport. The Airports Authority of India had suspended the operation of Code E aircraft following a directive from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation . The decision not to allow wide-bodied aircraft had affected hundreds of Haj pilgrims. The Calicut airport had been the embarkation point for the pilgrims in the State, but it was shifted to the Cochin International Airport two years ago.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Canadian military to ask Ottawa to approve up to $500 million in spending for CF-18 upgrades David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen  10.04.2016 A Canadian Forces CF-18 Hornet fighter jet. The CF-18 upgrade would keep the planes flying until 2025, giving the government some breathing room to organize the purchase of replacements A CF-18 Hornet on the runway at CFB Cold Lake Alberta, Oct. 21, 2014. ShareAdjustCommentPrint The Canadian military is hoping to ask the government early next year for approval to spend up to $500 million to modernize its CF-18 fighter jets. The upgrade would keep the planes flying until 2025, giving the government some breathing room to organize the purchase of replacements and make sure they are delivered before the older jets are taken out of service. Work has already started to ensure the CF-18s are structurally sound. Now, the military is analyzing improvement options for communications equipment to deal with changes in civil aviation regulations. There could be other upgrades to weapons and how the CF-18s communicate and operate with Allied fighter jets. “This project is expected to go for potential government submission early in 2017,” said Ashley Lemire, Department of National Defence spokeswoman. The options focus “on what is required from a regulatory and interoperability perspective.” The DND estimates the cost of the modernization at between $250 million and $499 million, depending on the options chosen and what the government accepts, say defence sources. Military officers say the upgrades will have to be done by 2021 to make financial sense — new fighter jets are expected by 2025. That means decisions on the upgrades must be made and contracts placed by 2018. Since 2002, Canada has spent $2.6 billion modernizing the CF-18s. The planes were bought in 1982. The Conservative government planned to buy 65 F-35 stealth fighters to replace the CF-18s. The purchase was put on hold as the cost ballooned and technical problems emerged. During last year’s federal election, the Liberals said they would buy a less expensive fighter jet if they came to power. In June, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the F-35 “does not work, and is far from working.” But the Liberal promise not to buy the F-35 has been thrown into question by Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, who has said any competition would be open to all jets. He  has insisted the government must move “quickly” selecting a new fighter jet, but has not outlined any timetable. Last month, the House of Commons defence committee called on the government to pick a replacement within a year. It pointed out the costs of the new jets should be well documented so other military equipment programs would not be affected. Both the NDP and Conservatives argued the report was written to support the Liberal government’s defence strategy. “The committee report marshals evidence to bolster the Liberal decision to sole-source the purchase of Super Hornets,” the NDP said in its submission. That refers to the Liberals’ attempt in the summer to buy Super Hornet fighter jets, built by Boeing, instead of holding a competition. The plan was put on hold after it prematurely became public when Postmedia revealed the scheme. Industry sources say they believe some senior Liberals still hope to revive the Super Hornet sole-source purchase in the near future. Sajjan has said the Canadian military is facing a “capability gap” since the CF-18 fleet can’t handle  the country’s commitments to NATO and the North American Aerospace Defence Command’s needs to protect the continent. “Between our NORAD and NATO commitments and how many jets are serviceable at one time, we cannot meet both those requirements simultaneously,” he said in July. “The Canadian Armed Forces have been risk-managing this problem for some time now and the previous government found it acceptable. I do not, and I want to make sure that we give all the tools necessary not to put the Canadian Armed Forces in a scenario to risk-manage.” Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

For several months, she’d been handling the legal aftermath of her adult son Jerry’s sudden disappearance from Alabama. He was facing 13 counts of forgery for writing bad checks in connection with his motorcycle business, and in addition to juggling Jerry’s leftover red tape, Marjorie was also dealing with the police and the FBI as they searched for her 23-year-old son. But in January of ’79, Marjorie saw a photo in LIFE magazine that shocked her. In the image, which depicted hundreds of the deceased victims of the Jonestown Massacre in Guyana from the previous November, she spotted Jerry and his wife, Debbie, along with Debbie’s 5-year-old son. Marjorie contacted the U.S. State Department’s Jonestown Task Force and told them she wanted to claim the body of her son. But the State Department informed her that none of the bodies examined were “anywhere close” to being that of Jerry Balisok, nor were any those of his wife and stepson. Dental X-rays had been taken of all the deceased, and there were zero matches with Jerry’s dental records. This was before DNA testing was available, and the government was extremely reluctant to release a body to anyone unless its identity had been 100 percent confirmed. They couldn’t just take a grieving mother’s word, especially when it was based off of a grainy photo in a magazine. Marjorie tried sending the task force an X-ray of Jerry’s pelvis, showing a steel pin that was inserted after a motorcycle accident, and demanded that they examine all of the unclaimed bodies to find out if anyone had a pin in their hip. Task force officials informed her that with the very rapid damage the corpses had already suffered from lying for days in the hot Guyanese sun, and the months that had elapsed since the incident, the bodies were way too decomposed to allow that kind of manhandling. Again, she was denied. But Marjorie became obsessed with the photograph in LIFE. She told the press, “[t]here is no doubt in my mind about that figure being the body of my son. He is lying with his dark brownish-auburn curly head pointing toward the bottom of the picture and the page.” However, a member of the Jonestown Task Force, Reid Clark, said that they enlarged the photograph in question 40 times, and told the press: “I defy anyone to say that’s him ... You’d think she’d be thanking us instead of damning us.” Google News/Spartanburg Herald   Marjorie also revealed another source of frustration to the Associated Press: “I have tried in every way to have my son’s body returned to me for burial,” she told a reporter. “I have insurance policies of all kinds that I cannot cash in until I have a death certificate or certificate of presumed death.” Naturally, the FBI was also investigating the Jonestown lead, but they ultimately determined that there was no evidence Jerry Balisok had even left the United States. It was known that Jerry and his wife had been on the lam in the Caribbean about a year before the massacre—which his mother learned when she was sent a bill for about $10,000 her son had charged on her American Express card from the Bahamas—and prior to that there had been a flurry of charges in Miami. Investigators seemed to think that was a better place to look for Balisok than anywhere overseas. In May 1979, 248 unclaimed bodies from Jonestown were sent to Oakland, California, for burial. According to an acquaintance of hers, Marjorie Balisok was waiting for the plane when the coffins were unloaded, ready to intercept and locate her son’s, but she was evidently unsuccessful. The bodies went into the ground, with Marjorie convinced that Jerry and his wife Debbie were definitely among the 20 adults who were buried in the mass grave. With no options left other than to get the very last word, Marjorie had a tombstone made for her son and installed above an empty grave in the family plot at Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama. The inscription reads, in part, “DAMN THE STATE DEPT.” along the bottom. Marjorie herself died in 1983, maintaining to the end of her days that her son was a victim of the Peoples Temple cult. Her own tombstone, which she shares with her husband Coleman, can be found next to that of her youngest son. The FBI placed surveillance on Marjorie’s funeral, camping out on the chance that Jerry would turn up, but no dice. A few years later, with still no sign of Jerry Balisok, the authorities were at last satisfied that he was dead, and dropped all charges against him. The view from Tiger Mountain. Image credit: Joel via Flickr // CC BY-NC-ND 2.0   That's where the story stayed until 1989, when a 34-year-old man named Ricky Wetta was arrested and tried in Seattle for attempted murder. After shooting his former business partner in the head following an afternoon of target practice on Tiger Mountain near Issaquah, Washington, Wetta was booked into the King County Jail, but his fingerprints soon revealed that he wasn’t who he said he was. There was, it seemed, a real Ricky Wetta living in Florida (who had fingerprints on record from a misdemeanor 15 years earlier), but the man in custody in Seattle wasn’t him, and he refused to cop to his true identity. Leaning on Fifth Amendment guarantees that protect a suspect against self-incrimination, the man went through the entire trial as John Doe. A month after the trial, though, a persistent King County Police detective named Randy Mullinax finally sussed out the suspect’s birth name: Jerry Bibb Balisok. Instead of defecting to Guyana and meeting death in Jonestown, Jerry and Debbie had, in fact, hung out in Florida for a while (just as the cops had suspected), then moved to the mundane Seattle suburb of Renton at some point. After obtaining Ricky A. Wetta’s birth certificate, Jerry helped himself to the man’s identity, and the family lived as Wettas for over a decade, having three more kids. Jerry worked various jobs over the years, including a gig as a professional wrestler named Mr. X and a stint at Boeing—until he was fired when HR figured out he didn’t actually go to the University of Cambridge in the UK as he’d purported. Later, it seems, he decided he preferred investment schemes to jobs. While wandering from scam to scam, Jerry drifted into the acquaintance of Emmett Thompson, 12 years his junior, with whom he “did business” for a time. Although they were friendly for a while, Thompson had begun the process of extracting himself from Balisok/Wetta’s life by the time his business partner invited him to go target practicing on Tiger Mountain, about an hour outside of Seattle. In an ensuing trial, Thompson testified that he was shot four times on the mountain, allegedly over a 1988 arson plot targeting the Columbian Hotel in Wenatchee, Washington. (Balisok had purchased the hotel for $135,000, then taken out a $4.6 million insurance policy on it a month before it burned down.) Throughout the trial, Balisok steadfastly declined to answer almost all queries about his identity; he was addressed variously as John Doe and Ricky Wetta. Based on the transcript from the 1989 cross-examination, questioning Ricky/John/Jerry went something like this: DEPUTY PROSECUTOR MICHAEL HOGAN: You've talked about your health history, Mr. Wetta. You've testified that your weight, as you went through school – where did you go to school, Mr. Wetta? DEFENSE ATTORNEY ANNE ENGELHARD: Objection. This isn't relevant. THE COURT: You may answer. HOGAN: Where did you go to grade school, Mr. Wetta? JOHN DOE: I refuse to answer your question. HOGAN: Where did you go to high school where you told us those weights? DOE: I believe I got a G.E.D. in the State of Washington in 1979. HOGAN: But when you were a teenager, did you attend high school? DOE: I refuse to answer that question also. HOGAN: And you used to be a professional wrestler, didn't you, Mr. Wetta? DOE: And I also refuse to answer that question. Balisok claimed to have shot Thompson in self-defense, but the jury didn’t buy it, and in February of 1990 he was found guilty. Two months later, Balisok was sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempted murder in the first degree. He was ultimately acquitted of the arson charges. A few years later, in 1992, Balisok’s wife, Debbie, divorced him, changing her surname and those of their three children from Wetta to Taylor, her maiden name. (One of their sons, John, is now a fitness coach who was featured on the weight-loss series Too Fat for 15.) Balisok’s long stay at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla was characterized by multiple lawsuits against prison staff, alleging violations of his First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights for not being allowed to wear his yarmulke in solitary confinement, or arguing that his due process rights were violated when he was expelled from a prison math class as a sanction for withholding information about a classmate who’d cheated on a test. (He lost both of these cases.) One of these lawsuits, against Balisok’s hearing officer, went all the way to the Supreme Court, and although Balisok lost yet again—he’d alleged that his hearing officer had concealed witness statements that could have helped him during a disciplinary proceeding—the case was important because it affirmed the ability of prisoners to challenge such disciplinary proceedings in the first place. Philip Cohen via Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0   Balisok’s life got no less bizarre after he was released from prison in 2003. He changed his name from Jerry Bibb Balisok to Harrison Rains Hanover the following year, then married two different women in short succession, both of whom filed for protection orders against him, citing domestic abuse. In 2008, before they were divorced, the second of these women registered a nonprofit with the state of Washington called the First Hanoverian Church, listing herself as the director and Balisok/Hanover as chairman. He also occasionally used the variant Harrison Hansover, with an s. A year after the church was registered, he fled to Costa Rica after getting busted on a failed scheme to embezzle approximately $4.6 million. The idea was to intercept funds to be paid by telecommunications companies Cox and Comcast to a mutual vendor they both used, but the money was instead diverted into a bank account opened by Balisok and an accomplice. The bank quickly froze the funds, however, and Balisok ended up with only about half a million in his pocket before he skipped town. He then popped up next door in Nicaragua in October of 2012, where he was arrested and charged with a handful of crimes related to the sexual exploitation of minors. Balisok/Hanover was sentenced to 24 years in a Nicaraguan prison; his lawyer, found guilty as his accomplice, received six years herself. In April 2013, a flurry of articles in Spanish-language newspapers throughout Latin America reported that Balisok had suffered a heart attack while in prison in Granada, Nicaragua, and died after being transferred to the hospital. The newspapers tied the event to his former accomplishments as Jerry Balisok and attributed the cause to extreme heat in his cell, which triggered other inmates’ families to file complaints about the high temperatures the prisoners were suffering, along with other health hazards within the prison. Normally, a report of a person’s death in multiple newspapers would probably be enough to affirm their death, but an exception might be made in the case of Jerry Balisok. As of this writing, no death certificate for Balisok has been made publicly available, nor is the location of his burial known. Without those pieces of data, and knowing Balisok’s predilection for deceit, it might be wise to stay skeptical about whether he’s actually gone from this earth. One thing’s for sure: whether or not Jerry Bibb Balisok a.k.a. Ricky Wetta a.k.a. Harrison Rains Hanover a.k.a. Harrison Rains Hansover is, in fact, dead, his body isn’t under that headstone in Alabama with his name on it. At least, not yet.

"We would like to have more (Rafales) but it is a decision which will be taken in the near future, based on capability and desirability for the aircraft of this kind," the Air Force chief said at the annual IAF press conference here. The presser comes ahead of Indian Air Force Day on October 8. "Any air force will be proud to have an aircraft of Rafale class, which in the mid-weight category." "In terms of weapon capability, its avionics, instrumentation and electronics are exceptional. It is one of the leading fighter aircraft of the current generation. We are proud the contract has been signed and we will get it in three to five and a half years," Raha said. India inked a deal with France to buy 36 Rafale multi-role fighters manufacturered by Dassault Aviation on September 23. The $7.87 billion (about Rs 59,000 crore) inter-government agreement on the purchase of the aircraft in fly-away condition was signed by Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian. "We want to have a mix of fighter aircraft like the Sukhoi Su 30, the medium-weight category like Rafale, and of course the light-weight category Tejas, which we will induct in large numbers in the next 10 years," he said. The IAF chief also spoke on the plans to start a new line of manufacturing of fighter jets in India and said there were unsolicited offers, adding that (Swedish) Gripen was the best as it is the latest. On the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, Raha said two LCAs have already been pressed into service whereas two more will be inducted in its first squadron by the year-end. "In another year and a half, we will have a full squadron of the LCA with IOC (initial operational clearance) version," he said. Tejas is an Indian single-seat, single-jet engine, multi-role light fighter plane designed by Aeronautical Development Agency and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the IAF and the Navy. Tejas has so far got only the initial operational clearance. The final operational clearance (FOC) for Tejas is awaited which, Raha said, will be coming in five to six months. "We have also cleared formation of a squadron with FOC version towards which HAL is working very hard. We are sure that in five to six months, the clearance will be obtained and the company will start production of this aircraft as well," he said. The IAF chief said the FOC version is likely to be operational in an IAF squadron in another three years. He said there are "unsolicited offers" from aircraft manufacturers like Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin to manufacture fighter aircraft in India and said the company which offered the best deal will be selected. "I mentioned earlier that the government of India and the Air Force are thinking of getting another fighter aircraft production line in India under manufacturer licence. It will be proper transfer of technology so that we have good share of technology and India will become a hub for manufacturing as well as repair and overhaul," Raha said. "Whosoever gives the best deal; they are all very capable... I think Gripen is latest in terms of generation. It is a new aircraft compared to F-16, but it depends on the capability and what sort of technology transfer in terms of depth and quantity and quality, and of course the price tag, will decided which aircraft will be manufactured in future under the 'Make in India' initiative. It is on the table and nothing is decided yet." On the inter-government agreement with Russia for the purchase of a fifth-generation aircraft, the Air Force chief said the discussions are in an advanced stage and a "lot of clarity" has come in the matter. He expressed the hope that a decision in the matter will be taken "sooner than later". --IANS ao/tsb/vm Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Sections The Evolution of Mission Control Share Facebook Twitter Email Presented by The Evolution of Mission Control Explore in 360-degree video how NASA’s flight control facilities have evolved from the historic 1960s to the present day. By Christian Davenport, Deepak Chetty, video and production, and R.B. Brenner, executive producer ADVERTISEMENT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google Plus Share via Email More Options Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Published on October 4, 2016 It could almost pass for an ordinary office. Rows upon rows of computers. Muted tones on the wall. The tense hush preserved from a bygone era. NASA’s original Mission Control room is now a tourist site, a historic time capsule that commemorates Neil Armstrong’s “One small step.” But NASA has recently built a new control room, one that it hopes will witness the first steps on the Martian surface. And it’s renovating yet another to be used for the International Space Station. Across the country, new control rooms are popping up. SpaceX, the upstart company founded by Elon Musk, has put its right near the entrance of its headquarters outside of Los Angeles. The sleek, glass-encased room has already witnessed several historic feats: the first commercial spacecraft to reach the station, the first landings of an orbital-class rocket.  Boeing, which along with SpaceX has a contract to fly astronauts to the space station, is building its own control room at Cape Canaveral Florida. Now the two companies are getting closer to restoring the United States’ ability to fly humans again. And with the growth of the commercial space industry, which also promises to soon start flying paying tourists, there is much history yet to be written. Houston is home to NASA’s Mission Control Facilities (Deepak Chetty and R.B. Brenner) The Johnson Space Center is home to astronaut flight training and to Mission Control -- the current facility as well as the historic room used during the Apollo and Gemini missions. Today Mission Control monitors commercial launches and tracks the International Space Station (Deepak Chetty and R.B. Brenner) The modern mission control is primarily tasked with monitoring the astronauts aboard the international space station (ISS) and overseeing the flights that support the ISS. Mission Control oversaw the Apollo space flights and helped save the Apollo 13 crew (Deepak Chetty and R.B. Brenner) NASA has preserved the 1969 control room, allowing a glimpse into the facility that once defined America’s technical achievements and creativity in the face of challenges like the Apollo 13 mission.

One option? Sabotage. The Washington Post reports the company is looking into potential sabotage as a factor in the explosion of the company’s Falcon 9 rocket on Sept. 1. Officials say they’ve ruled out all the obvious factors that could’ve caused the rocket to fail and explode, and now they’re looking into the “less probable answers” that could possibly explain the accident. Apparently sabotage is one of those less probable answers. According to the report, a SpaceX representative went to a ULA building in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and asked for access to the roof. If you’re unfamiliar, ULA is a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing — a major competitor for SpaceX. The encounter was described as a “cordial, not accusatory, encounter,” but ULA refused access and instead contacted Air Force investigators (who are assisting in the explosion investigation). After checking out the roof, the Air Force team apparently found nothing that could connect ULA to the explosion. In a statement, SpaceX said the company would not be commenting on the investigation or any potential cause (at least until the case is solved). Regardless, this is just a really weird twist in the ongoing investigation of the Falcon 9 explosion.  With the company keen to get back into the air by November, it’s no surprise SpaceX is working fast and furious to figure out what happened so it can be avoided in the future.
