Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Aviation News: Boeing and Chinese Aviation Authority Set Stage for Improved Airspace and Air Traffic Management in China Seattle | 11 Apr 2017 | By Boeing Boeing [NYSE:BA] has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Air Traffic Management Bureau to begin the process of developing joint airspace and air traffic management projects to alleviate increasing congestion in the skies over China. Through the MOU agreement, Boeing will collaborate with the Chinese authority on their current and long-term plans to enhance the efficiency and capacity of China’s airspace system, as China continues to grow into one of the world’s largest and most complex aviation operating environments. “We are focused on making sure that the airspace system does not limit growth of the airlines while maintaining the highest-levels of safety,” said Che Jinjun, director general of the CAAC Air Traffic Management Bureau. “Airspace capacity and air traffic management is a shared interest between our organizations, and a natural space where we need to cooperate. We look forward to this collaboration with Boeing.” The scope of the agreement provides Boeing’s industry-leading expertise in support of key initiatives of the Chinese authority in airspace management, flow management, aviation data, communication, navigation, surveillance, meteorology, general aviation and training. The new agreement builds upon existing cooperation between Boeing and the CAAC Air Traffic Management Bureau, which includes airspace simulation projects, technical and management training and new technology initiatives. “This MOU reaffirms our longstanding relationship with the CAAC Air Traffic Management Bureau and highlights Boeing’s expertise in the aviation services industry with airspace and air traffic management solutions that enhance efficiencies on a wide scale,” said John Bruns, president of Boeing China. “China is the largest commercial market for Boeing with tremendous growth potential. It is mutually beneficial for Boeing and the CAAC to work together to develop lasting solutions that build and enhance airspace capacity in China.” To illustrate the need for increased capacity and more efficient air traffic management, the airspace shared between Shanghai, Nanjing, Ningbo, and Hangzhou, China exceeded 150 million passengers in 2016. This represents one of the busiest airspace corridors in the world. Shanghai reached new records in 2016 with 100 million passengers, which makes it one of the top five busiest airports following London, New York, Tokyo and Atlanta.

Norsk Titanium, a Norwegian firm, confirmed Monday the production order for 3-D printed structural titanium components for the Dreamliner 787. The new process should reduce the costs of production, according to John Byrne, Boeing vice president of airplane materials and structures and suppler management. "From the outset, the 787 has been the hallmark of innovation and efficiency. We are always looking at the latest technologies to drive cost reduction, performance, and value to our customers," Byrne said. The 3-D printed parts will make up a portion of the load-bearing structure of the plane, the report said. The Dreamliner 787's list price is $312.8 million and Boeing builds them at its North Charleston, South Carolina factory, CNBC reported. "This means $2 million to $3 million in savings for each Dreamliner, at least," Chip Yates of Norsk Titanium said, reported Reuters. Norsk said that printers in Norway will produce the parts at first, but the company plans to have nine printers at work in New York by the conclusion of 2017, according to Reuters.

(Photo: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)    Report: Boeing To Deliver Airplane To Iran Way Ahead Of Schedule Thomas Phippen Author 12:37 PM 04/11/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5586541 Iran will receive its first Boeing airplane within a month, according to an Iranian official, well ahead of the scheduled delivery date for the first commercial airplane sale to Iran. Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy minister of roads and urban planning for the Iranian government, said Boeing will deliver a 777 airplane that Turkey ordered, but no longer wants, the New York Times reports. Iran Air currently flies planes that are decades old, and is desperate to update its fleet. Kashan said the unwanted plane ordered by Turkey fits what Iran Air needed, and since it’s a new plane, it made sense to have it rerouted to Iran as Boeing’s first delivery. Under a pending deal made possible by former President Barack Obama’s signature 2015 accord that lifted sanctions on Iran, Boeing plans to deliver 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion to Iran Air, the main airline in the country. Boeing is not obligated to deliver planes to Iran Air until 2018. “However, our order matched this Boeing model and it is a propitious time to receive one,” Kashan said, according to Iran’s Mehr News Agency. If confirmed, the delivery of the 777 would be the first Boeing plane to land in Tehran since 1979. Boeing did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. Boeing has a separate deal in the works to provide 30 of Boeing’s 737 MAX 9 planes to Iran Aseman Airlines. (RELATED: Boeing Inks $3 Billion Deal To Sell Airplanes To Iran) The U.S. Department of the Treasury approved the sale of Boeing planes to Iran Air in September, but many lawmakers have criticized the deal over concerns that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would repurpose the civilian planes to commit acts of terrorism. (RELATED: Congressmen Warn Iran Will Turn Commercial Jets Into ‘Warplanes’) Congress can still block the deal through legislation, and Illinois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam has promised to work to block the deal. “Congress will have a lot to say, particularly working in concert with an administration that has a fairly low view of this deal,” Roskam told USA Today in December.

Boeing manages to build 144 of its 787 Dreamliner commercial aircraft every year. Each one costs $265 million, with $17 million of that going on strong and lightweight titanium alloy components required to support the carbon fiber fuselage and wings. However, thanks to Norsk Titanium, the Dreamliner is about to get cheaper, saving Boeing as much as $3 million per plane. Yesterday, Norsk Titanium delivered the world's first FAA-approved 3D printed, structural titanium component. These components use Norsk's Rapid Plasma Deposition (RPD) process, and the results are thanks to a close collaboration with Boeing who designed the parts for use in the Dreamliner. As reported by Reuters, Norsk's Chip Yates, vice president of marketing, claims the switch to 3D printed titanium parts, "means $2 million to $3 million in savings for each Dreamliner, at least." Related Boeing 787 Dreamliner Bug Fix Requires Turning It off and on Again Boeing 787 Dreamliner Bug Fix Requires Turning It off and on Again If the $3 million saving is realized, it scales up to a cost reduction of $432 million every year based on current production numbers. Seeing as the Dreamliner only started generating a profit for Boeing last year and already cost the company around $29 billion in "production-related losses," this is surely welcome news. Norsk Titanium President & Chief Executive Officer Warren M. Boley, Jr. commented that, "The Norsk Titanium team will continue to expand the portfolio of components supplied to Boeing meeting stringent certification requirements." That suggests this could just be the start of the cost savings brought about by replacing traditional and expensive manufacturing with significantly cheaper and faster 3D printing.

(Randall Hill/Reuters) Related Stories Iconic 747 jumbo jet could be phased out by Boeing Stop giving tax breaks to Boeing, WTO warns U.S. Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower defence revenue Boeing Co. hired Norsk Titanium AS to print the first structural titanium parts for its 787 Dreamliner, a shift that the Norwegian 3D printing company said would eventually shave $2 million to $3 million US off the cost of each plane. The contract announced on Monday is a major step in Boeing's effort to boost the profitability of the 787 and a sign of growing industrial acceptance of the durability of 3D printed metal parts, allowing them to replace pieces made with more expensive traditional manufacturing in demanding aerospace applications. Strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more costly than aluminum, and accounts for about $17 million US of the cost of a $265 million US Dreamliner, industry sources say. Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower defence revenue Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fiber fuselage and wings. Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus Group SE's rival A350 jet. "This means $2 million to $3 million in savings for each Dreamliner, at least," starting in 2018 when many more parts are being printed, Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium's vice president of marketing, said in a telephone interview. Boeing builds 144 Dreamliners in a typical year. The company declined to comment on the estimate but said Norsk's technology would help reduce costs. The Dreamliner turned profitable last year after racking up nearly $29 billion US in production-related losses. Norsk worked with Boeing for more than a year to design four 787 parts and obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification for them, Yates said. Norsk expects the U.S. regulatory agency will approve the material properties and production process for printed parts later this year. That will "open up the floodgates," Yates said, by allowing Norsk to print thousands of other parts for each Dreamliner, without each part requiring separate FAA approval, resulting in the millions in expecting savings per plane. "You're talking about tons, literally," on the 787 that would be printed instead of made with traditional, expensive forging and machining, he said. General Electric Co is already printing metal fuel nozzles for aircraft engines. But Norsk and Boeing said the titanium parts are the first printed structural components designed to bear the stress of an airframe in flight. Norsk said it will print initially in Norway, but aims to have nine printers running by year-end at a 67,000-square-foot ) facility in Plattsburgh, N.Y. © Thomson Reuters, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines United Airlines shares drop as travellers react to video of passenger's removal April 11, 9:31 PM ET read comments video Canada faces risk from potential housing correction: Moody's April 11, 3:18 PM ET Freedom 85?

Victoria Moores Related Media Gallery: Latest developments in cabin interiors Advertisement UK-based aircraft lighting specialist STG Aerospace has certified a square reading light and secured floor path lighting contracts with China Eastern Airlines and Icelandair. The square-beam liTeMood LED reading light has been certified for the Boeing 737NG and 757, entering immediate service with UK carrier Titan Airways and Romania’s Blue Air, which helped with the certification trials. Rather than the traditional circular beam, which can overspill into neighboring passenger seats, STG Aerospace’s square beam is contained within the passenger’s own personal space. This is the first time a square light pattern has been used for this purpose, STG Aerospace CEO Nigel Duncan told ATW at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg. “There’s a slight red pigmentation, which makes food look fresher, magazines brighter, colors appear more vibrant and text appear sharper,” Duncan said. The lighting requires no structural changes, additional wiring or new control systems, as it directly replaces the existing light unit. A passenger service unit of three lights can be installed within 10 minutes. Aside from the obvious lighting benefits, Duncan said when the environment feels better, passengers will spend more onboard. “It gives economy passengers, in particular, a sense of privacy and control over their environment. People get anxious about travel because they lack control, so if you give them more control, they will be in a more relaxed state and more inclined to spend. Also, if the crew is relaxed, customer service improves and that increases yield. I don’t believe our product should be on aircraft if there is no return on investment for the airline,” Duncan said. As well as the square reading light certification, STG Aerospace’s blue-glowing emergency floor path lighting—known as saf-Tglo blu—has been certified by the FAA for more Airbus, Boeing and Embraer types. This is the first time a blue-glowing photoluminescent product has been approved, versus the traditional green glow.  “Following the EASA approval last year, we’re delighted we now have FAA certification for the leading aircraft types and we are already seeing significant interest in the product from both OEMs and airlines across the globe,” STG Aerospace director of innovation Sean O’Kell said. At AIX, STG Aerospace announced that Icelandair has selected saf-Tglo blu for its new fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 9s, which will enter service from the end of 2017. As a further boost, Boeing has selected the STG Aerospace’s saf-Tglo SuperSeal UltraLite (SSUL) floorpath lighting as a line-fit option for the 787, building on the two companies’ existing relationship on the 737NG. SSUL has also been selected by China Eastern Airlines for retrofit across 125 737NGs, as well as line fit on new deliveries from Boeing. China Eastern Airlines opted for STG Aerospace’s PatternMatch product, where the strips also bear the aircraft carpet pattern. Duncan said this required close cooperation with Boeing, which had to add these specific pattern strips to its catalogue to line-fit equip the aircraft. “We had to get it added because China Eastern didn’t want to go for the retrofit without the line-fit option,” he said. The initial line fit China Eastern Airlines 737s under the contract will be delivered from Boeing in June 2017, and the first retrofit kits have already been dispatched to China Eastern. STG Aerospace’s products are currently installed in over 11,000 aircraft, roughly one-third of the world’s passenger fleet.

The US plane maker’s Starliner CST-100 is designed to take up to seven people into space, initially to the International Space Station (ISS) but the company envisages commercial travellers being ferried into orbit soon after the first crew flights to the ISS. Nasa provided Boeing with an investment of US$4.2 billion in 2014 to build and fly the passenger spacecraft. Already, Bigelow Aerospace and Space Adventures have been working with Boeing to advance space tourism. Other firms such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic are also in the market for space tourism. In February, Mr Musk announced two mystery space tourists put down a "significant deposit" with SpaceX to take a round-trip around the Moon. While it is extremely difficult to say how much they might have paid, it will certainly have been in the multiple millions of dollars each. Nasa estimates that a round-trip to the ISS on the SpaceX Crew Dragon or the Boeing CST-100 Starliner would cost about US$58 million per person, according to the science journal The Verge. Looking to the future, Brandon Setayesh, an engineer on the CST-100 programme, says that he sees spaceflight being as common as air travel is today. "It’s very common to get a flight to go to another city, to go to another country within one day, within a few hours," he says. "And so we plan to do that with commercial space travel." Siamak Ghofranian, a Boeing technical fellow, helped to develop a docking system for the Starliner, called the NDS, which has been tested in Alabama and Texas. The NDS is designed to dock with the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter, which was installed on the ISS during spacewalks by the Nasa astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins. In January, Boeing unveiled the advanced new lightweight spacesuits that space tourists will sport aboard the Starliner space taxi during commercial trips to and from and the ISS and other low-Earth orbit destinations. The signature "Boeing Blue" spacesuits are much lighter, as well as more flexible and comfortable compared to earlier generations of spacesuits, Boeing says. "We slogged through some of the real engineering challenges and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it’s time to get on to the rubber meeting the road," says Chris Ferguson, a former Nasa Space Shuttle commander who now works for Boeing as a Starliner programme director. The inaugural Starliner flight tests are slated to begin in 2018 under contract to Nasa. The first test flight will carry a crew of two. Soon after the crew size will grow to four when regular crew rotation flights to the ISS start as soon as 2019, to be followed by flights for up to seven fee-paying passengers. "To me, it’s a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we’ve been," Mr Ferguson says. "The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft." Boeing is currently manufacturing the Starliner spacecraft at the company’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Source: Sikorsky-Boeing Sikorsky-Boeing has revealed a Future Vertical Lift (FVL) attack helicopter concept based on the SB>1 Defiant that it is developing for the US Army's Joint MultiRole-Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD)/FVL effort. The concept, which features in a promotional video posted online by the partnership on 10 April, shows an attack variant of the SB>1 Defiant co-axial compound helicopter flying alongside the baseline transport helicopter. While both platforms appear to share much in terms of commonality, the attack variant features the twin-seat tandem cockpit, weapon-festooned stub-wings, and chin-mounted gun that are synonymous with this class of rotorcraft. The Department of Defense (DOD) has launched its JMR-TD/FVL programme to create a family of platforms to replace its current helicopters. This family is to be divided into FVL Medium (to replace the Apache and Black Hawk platforms) and FVL Heavy (to replace the Chinook). The US Army's current emphasis is on FVL Medium, and it is for this requirement that the SB>1 Defiant and the Bell Helicopter V-280 Valor are being developed (in addition to Boeing-Sikorsky and Bell, the army has awarded contracts to AVX and Karem to continue their research into future helicopter technologies). While FVL Medium is one requirement, it might not necessarily be satisfied with a single platform. It could be that FVL Medium includes a derived attack platform along the lines of the concept shown in the Sikorsky-Boeing video, or perhaps a bespoke solution such as the Sikorsky S-97 Raider. Both Sikorsky-Boeing and Bell Helicopter were downselected in October 2014 to develop and demonstrate their SB>1 Defiant and V-280 Valor platforms respectively by the end of 2017. While Sikorsky-Boeing is building on the former's X2 to develop a compound co-axial helicopter for the Defiant, Bell has opted to continue with its tiltrotor development for the Valor (AVX is maturing its co-axial compound helicopter design, while Karem is focusing on its Optimum Speed Tilt-Rotor [OSTR] concept).

"The figure shows that the BBJ fleet has tripled [in China] over the last five years in this burgeoning market," said Greg Laxton, vice president with Boeing Business Jets, at the 2017 Asian Business Aviation Conference and Exhibition.  "We are confident that strong growth will continue in China. We expect the new BBJ MAX family to be very popular in this market with additional cabin space and significant range increases," state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Greg as saying. Boeing said the BBJ fleet in China would continue to expand in 2017 with two BBJs, one BBJ 2 and one BBJ 787 entering service. In 2018, two BBJ MAX 8s will be delivered to customers. Boeing Business Jets has signed an agreement with Ameco Beijing to serve as an official BBJ Warranty Service Center. The agreement allows BBJ customers in China to receive customised support for their aircraft. "We are committed to offering world-class customer support to customers in China. This new agreement is another way for them to access support that is fast and customised to their specific needs," Laxton said. Boeing and GE jointly initiated Boeing Business Jets in 1996. Till date the company has more than 400 jets in operation worldwide.

For the construction of its airframe, it uses composite materials. Typically, Boeing manufactures around 144 Dreamliners in a year. The plane manufacturing company recently partnered with Norwegian company Norsk Titanium AS to create 3D printed structural titanium components as reported by Reuters. Notably, General Electric does print fuel nozzles for plane engines. But Boeing is the first company that will use printed components designed to endure the pressure of an airframe during the flight, as per Reuters. Just in January, Bloomberg reported that Boeing's shares touched an all time high. During that time, Boeing Co.'s shares rose to $167.94 at 4.6 percent. This helped the company emerge from a 10-year period of losses. The Chicago company also mentioned that its revenue will be in the range of $90.5 to $92.5 billion. While, analysts estimated yearly sales of $93 billion, Bloomberg reported. Boeing 787 Dreamliner utilizes more metal in comparison to the other models due to its carbon-fiber wings and body. Moreover, lightweight and sturdy titanium compound is about 7 times costlier than aluminum. Out of the total $265 million cost of a 787 Dreamliner, it costs around $17 million, as quoted by industry sources. Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Save Costs Screenshot of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner Starting in 2018, Boeing expects to cut-off around $2 to $3 million of each Dreamliners manufacturing expenses. 3D printed parts will significantly replace the expensive traditional materials. This comes as a big move by the company to boost Dreamliner 787’s profitability. Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium’s Vice President of Marketing said that his company worked with Boeing for almost a year. They designed four parts of 787 meanwhile obtaining a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the same. Norsk Titanium expects the approval for production process and material properties to be passed by the U.S Regulatory Agency later during 2017. Once this is done, each part won’t require a separate FAA approval. This will allow the Norwegian 3D printing company to significantly print numerous parts for each Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Certainly, it will garner more savings in the manufacturing of each Dreamliner. Norsk Titanium mentions that the printing will initially take place in Norway. But Norsk eventually aims to have a fleet of nine printers by the year end. According to Reuters, this will take place at a 6,220 square meter (67,000 square foot) facility at Plattsburgh, New York.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Failure is not an option – creating a world that doesn’t break down By Robert Golightly Feature  In creating a world that doesn’t break down, a huge $20B opportunity is on the table for the process industry to address. Shares In creating a world that doesn’t break down, a huge $20B opportunity is on the table for the process industry to address. Astute manufacturers should focus on reducing unplanned downtime and increasing asset utilisation, as both processes represent the biggest opportunities for financial improvement in production operations.  Albert Einstein could well be alluding to smart manufacturing when he said: “If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on it, I would use the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.” The evolution of maintenance In the past five decades, maintenance as a practice has evolved to better serve the manufacturing sector in the areas of reliability and availability. However, change is imminent. The current approaches, such as run-to-failure, calendar, usage-based, condition-based and reliability centred maintenance (RCM), are less than ideal.  Two key challenges remain. First, despite the increasing complexity of these maintenance initiatives, the exact science of when to conduct inspections and service the machines is less than scientific. Second, the current slew of maintenance methodologies focuses on wear and tear as the root cause of failure. This literally sidesteps the fact that 80 per cent of degradation and failure in mechanical equipment is process driven.  This view is further reinforced by Boeing, a company at the cradle of RCM and the aircraft industry. Boeing basically acknowledges that up to 85 per cent of all equipment failures happen on a time-random basis, no matter how much you inspect and service. ARC analyst, Peter Reynolds, gives a useful indication of what works by saying: “A useful prognostics solution is implemented when there is sound knowledge of the failure mechanisms that are likely to cause the degradations leading to eventual failures in the system.”  However, the industry reality today is that in order to maximise profitability, processes tend to be operated as close to key limits as possible. This can be detrimental, as process excursions quickly place an asset in an undesirable operating point, where damage or excessive wear and tear to the asset occurs. This means that maintenance decisions need to be further mitigated by better understanding the impact on asset and process. A new generation of analytical capabilities is required to provide deeper insights into the asset, process and interaction between them. While operators need predictive solutions to red flag impending trouble, the software needs to be able to guide them away from trouble with prescriptive guidance. This requires the preferred solution provider to have deep domain and process expertise with the ability to extract data from design, production and maintenance systems.  The next generation Asset Performance Management (APM) In the broader scheme of things, McKinsey & Co has observed: “…entirely new and more affordable manufacturing analytics methods and solutions – which provide easier access to data from multiple data sources, along with advanced modelling algorithms and easy-to-use visualisation approaches – could finally give manufacturers new ways to control and optimise all processes throughout their entire operations.”  ARC Research Group further crystallises this view by saying: “With a good APM strategy, operations and maintenance groups become more collaborative, exchanging information to manage critical issues and operational constraints, while improving overall operating performance. Combining the information from traditionally separate operations and maintenance solutions improves the effectiveness of both areas, and offers new opportunities for managing risk and optimising performance.”  In taking a step into the future of manufacturing, APM 2.0 incorporates the advanced analytics that predict issues and prescribe operator actions. With a holistic view of the process and asset, Aspen APM software suite combines asset analytics, reliability modelling and machine learning to analyse, understand and guide. Principles of data analytics and data science enable the reliability strategy, which includes machine learning. A dominant predictive analytics technology in information technology today, machine learning on manufacturing assets requires domain specific knowledge of chemical processes, mechanical assets and maintenance practices, etc.  For industrial prowess, machine learning needs to interpret and manage complex, problematic sensor and maintenance event data. Eventually, it can determine the operating conditions and patterns that can have a deleterious impact on the asset by capturing the patterns of process operation and merging them with failure information.  One of the world’s largest plastics, chemical and refining companies, LyondellBasell, agrees that APM can unlock significant value, in saying: “AspenTech’s new Asset Analytics contains a unique set of modelling and data science-based technologies. Utilising the additional process insight available from this promising new software solution brings with it the potential to operate closer to the true flooding limit on this tower. For a world scale olefins unit, this would be worth millions of dollars per year.”   A system of success is long overdue While predictive analytics can reduce downtime, disruption seldom happens in isolation. Instead, dozens of reliability, process and asset issues happen simultaneously. This presents a systemic problem for RCM, a current maintenance approach that conducts static assessments, by delaying the decision-making process.  As such, dynamic assessment is required, as new warnings need to be evaluated alongside other active conditions to prioritise and allocate resources. However, we cannot address everything at once. A system of success is mandatory to address problems and prioritise them, according to the level of risk they represent.  With Aspen APM software, each new alarm triggers a recalculation of risk profiles to guarantee that the most current financial and risk probability assessment is used.  However, to be thoroughly successful, companies need to adopt a holistic approach in implementation. First, they need to communicate their goals clearly. This helps in effective problem solving. Second, it is necessary for companies to genuinely embrace a data-driven world. Third, they need to differentiate between lagging and leading indicators, as well as how to respond accordingly. Fourth, the right mix of people, technology, strategy and solution is essential – along with the use of relevant case studies. Fifth, companies need to invest time and master the technology well. Sixth, the adopted analytics program needs to be well aligned with business goals. Seventh, companies need to deploy the appropriate software and hardware to solve problems. Eighth, companies need to execute well and with a keen sense of urgency. With operational excellence and profitability at stake, it is imperative that organisations are successful in developing the best asset performance strategy.  Indeed, failure is not an option – in creating a world that doesn’t break down!  From a number of recent surveys, it’s clear that more and more organisations are happy to accept that they will suffer a network security breach at some point and it is simply a matter of time until their D-Day arrives. Clearing up the mess post-issue and how to do it seems to be the focus now – which is a bit of a shame since there are various ways to avoid the mess in the first place. If we think of the networks we’re protecting as fortresses, the fact is that unfortunately, most companies rely on increasing the size and scope of perimeter defences for their security – a bit like digging a wider moat around the fortress or increasing the height and thickness of the external walls. It’s a great idea, unless the drawbridge is down and the guards are asleep.  Or someone tunnels under the moat and walls. They might even have a friend on the inside who knows where the back door is.  History has taught and continues to teach us many lessons, but if we do not learn from them we are doomed to repeat the failures of the past. What were those Trojans thinking anyway? Someone dumps a big wooden horse outside the gates and they cheerfully wheel it in without a second thought or at least a cursory inspection?  No wonder Troy was lost. Cyber criminals are not attacking organisations for fun, they’re doing it for commercial gain.  Stealing bank account or identity information that they can sell on or encrypting data and demanding a ransom for its release. Businesses fail to recognise the cyber criminal as a human threat. Well, most cyber criminals are still only human.  Remember the school bully? How they always picked on someone they perceived as being weaker than them? It’s human nature to go for the easy win, yet the more difficult something is to do, the less likely we are to do it. After all it’s a numbers game – the softer the target, the more they extract and the more money they make.  Harden the target and they’ll move on – it’s just too much effort to break down all the defences and it takes too long to make it viable. This is why an “if it’s going to happen it will” attitude to network security can be self-fulfilling. Too many organisations are now being defeatist, thinking it’s only a matter of time before they suffer a network security breach and only focusing on how they will clear up the mess after it happens, rather than carrying on trying to prevent it.   Transforming the digital fortress into a house of horrors for the cyber attacker will keep a business safer, even when the attacker gains access. You can keep the moat and walls but build additional defences inside; ramparts, spikes, bear traps even and section if off limiting the access to each section to a small number of controlled points, creating “one way” systems so that no one section can act as a universal jump-off point to anywhere in the fortress. In IT security terms, we’re talking about security zones, micro-segmentation, network access control, authentication-based firewall policies, SSL visibility; there are multiple options. If the malware can’t go anywhere and you have it locked down in a particular part of your network, it can’t proliferate and the problem is contained. The “serious” bad guys are only interested in one thing – breaching your defences for their gain. They can devote time and effort to this single purpose, but only to a point. Harden the target with multiple layers of defence, create one way systems and implement access restrictions and the bad guys will soon realise they’re wasting their time and move on to something softer and likely easier to penetrate. It’s easy to get blinkered and focus on new products but, generally, by the time you deploy them, the world and the bad guys have moved on. Sometimes it’s better to step back and have a more considered wider strategic view. For example, we worked with a video games company that was being constantly hit by DDOS attacks on their live gaming site. So they did some lateral thinking and routed the gaming site through a secondary channel. The attackers have gone off and found a softer target. So be proactive and make it hard for the attackers. Create multiple layers of defence, one-way “streets” and access control systems. They may devote time and effort to breaking down these barriers, but they too have limits to what is and isn’t worthwhile.  And like the bully, they’ll soon move on, attracted by the prospect of an easier win.

Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. 5 Trade ideas excerpted from the detailed analysis and plan for premium subscribers: Boeing, Ticker: $BA Boeing, $BA, had a strong run higher out of a base beginning in October. It paused and consolidated the move from December through January and then resumed. It peaked at the beginning of March and has digested that move with a shallow pullback since. The digestion looks to be turning higher now, with the MACD level and the RSI holding at the mid line while the Bollinger Bands® squeeze. Look for continuation higher to participate..... CBOE, Ticker: $CBOE CBOE, $CBOE, moved up out of a double bottom in January. Into February the pace slowed and it started to consolidate in an ascending triangle. Friday ended at the top of the triangle with the Bollinger Bands® squeezing, often a precursor to a move. The RSI is in the bullish zone while the MACD is flat, but positive. Look for a push over resistance to participate higher..... Costco, Ticker: $COST Costco, $COST, started higher to of consolidation in December. It paused in January for a bit, before a second leg higher, taking it to a peak at the beginning of March. It gapped lower from there, falling back to the prior consolidation level and paused before moving back higher at the end of last week. Now it sits at the bottom of the gap with the Bollinger Bands® opening and the RSI rising into the bullish zone. The MACD is also about to cross to positive. Look for a push into the gap to participate higher..... Mylan, Ticker: $MYL Mylan, $MYL, pulled back from a top in August, finding support in November. It consolidated in a broad range at that bottom until pushing higher out of it in February. The break out failed to make a new high though and started falling back at the beginning of March. Last week it found support and started to consolidate. Friday it started to push back higher, reversing. The RSI is also moving up off of an oversold condition and the MACD is leveling. Look for follow through to participate to the upside..... UnitedHealth Group, Ticker: $UNH UnitedHealth Group, $UNH, started higher off of the 50 and 100 day SMA's in November. It met resistance in mid-December and consolidated again until a break out to the upside at the end of February. That move came back to retest the break out level and has found support at the 20 day SMA. The RSI is turning back higher and the MACD is about to cross up, giving it support for a move up. Look for a push up above the current consolidation to participate higher.....

By Mary-Ann Russon Updated April 11, 2017 15:33 BST Boeing hopes to soon use 3D printed components made from carbon fibre and titanium to save millions on Dreamliner production Getty Images Boeing has signed a deal with a Norwegian firm to 3D print titanium aeroplane components, in order to eventually reduce the costs of producing each 787 Dreamliner by between $2-$3m (£1.6-£2.4m). The 787 Dreamliner contains more components made from titanium than any other Boeing aircraft – about 14% of the total airframe – because titanium can withstand comparable loads far better than aluminium and is highly resistant to erosion. Using a composite made from carbon fibre and titanium for the fuselage and wings would also be 20% lighter than aluminium. However, titanium is seven times more expensive than aluminium, and it makes up $17m of the total $265m cost of a Dreamliner, so the aerospace manufacturer is turning to 3D printing, also known as "additive manufacturing", which is a new technology that enables industries to manufacture materials much faster and cheaper than the traditional injection moulding technique. "This means $2m-$3m in savings for each Dreamliner, at least," Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium's vice president of marketing told Reuters. Boeing hired Norsk Titanium AS to develop four 3D printed titanium parts for the 787 Dreamliner and to seek out and obtain certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the parts are safe for use in aircrafts. Since Grade 2 Commercially Pure Titanium is already considered to be safe for aircraft, Norsk and Boeing anticipate that the FAA will give its approval for Norsk's signature carbon fibre-titanium composite material later this year, which will enable production using 3D printed parts to begin in 2018. Once the composite material is given approval, Norsk will be able to print out any number of 3D printed components without each specific component needing to be certified by the FAA, which will enable the millions in promised savings. In the UK, BAE Systems is already 3D printing parts from titanium and Flame Retardant Nylon to help speed up the manufacturing processes for the Eurofighter Typhoon and the BAE Systems Hawk fighter jets, and General Electric is 3D printing metal fuel nozzles for aircraft engines. However, Boeing and Norsk insist that they are the first to develop 3D printed structural components designed to bear the stress of an airframe in flight.

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz Battle for the Sky: F-35 Stealth Fighter vs. Block III Super Hornet James Mugg April 11, 2017 TweetShareShare A debate over the future of US naval fighter jets has been on a slow burn for months, but it’s starting to heat up. There are reports that Boeing is surreptitiously marketing the F/A-18XT or ‘Block III Super Hornet’ to decision-makers in Washington via a one-page ‘white paper’. The chain of events stretches back to at least December, when Donald Trump announced to the Twitterverse that he’d ‘asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet’ as an alternative to the F-35. (Though Boeing has had plans for a further evolution of the Super Hornet for several years.) The notion of a Super Hornet alternative to the F-35 Alpha or Bravo models for the Air Force and marines respectively was promptly (and rightly) squashed, but Defense Secretary Mattis ordered a review of current plans for acquiring the F-35C carrier variant. The Pentagon’s thinking about how much they’re willing to pay for the extra capabilities afforded by the F-35C, and how many aircraft they need for the kinds of missions only an F-35 can do. I can’t find the white paper online (and it apparently doesn’t have ‘Boeing’ branding), but as reported, it suggests the USN could save US$8b in procurement costs by reducing the number of F-35Cs and making up the numbers with Block III Super Hornets. Based on their cost estimates—US$79m for an XT or US$120m for an F-35C—that works out to a reduction from 340 to fewer than 150 F-35Cs. It’s worth noting that even the most ambitious plans for the F-35C don’t include replacing all the Navy’s fighters. Each carrier air wing (CVW—of which there are ten) optimally includes four tactical fighter squadrons; currently one squadron of legacy Hornets and three of Super Hornets. The JSFs are initially intended to replace the legacy Hornets by 2028 and, under current plans, a second carrier squadron will be replaced with F-35Cs by 2033. The white paper appears to suggest capping F-35C numbers at just one squadron per CVW, plus spare and training aircraft, for a total of about 140 aircraft. It’s not an altogether terrible idea. Cancelling the F-35C completely—which has been mooted from time to time—makes little sense. For air strikes on terrorists in Iraq/Syria, older platforms are more than sufficient. But in a high end war, the F-35’s stealth and situational awareness could make it an invaluable addition to the CVW—especially in the first days of the war.  And, despite President Trump’s comments to the contrary, making an aircraft stealthy isn’t as simple as ‘[putting] a stealth component onto it.’ The F/A-18XT looks essentially the same as the Advanced Super Hornet demonstrator tested in 2013. It features conformal fuel tanks, improved sensors, new cockpit avionics and compatibility with the EA-18G Growler’s jamming pods. But the XT appears to exclude the earlier demonstrator’s ‘stealthy’ enclosed weapons pod. Being based on a well-established design, it’d likely be less expensive than the F-35C. The latest low-rate F-35 production contract (LRIP-10) includes two F-35Cs at a flyaway cost of US$121.8m each. The number of F-35Cs produced has been the lowest of the three variants, with just 47 aircraft ordered so far, including LRIP-10. As numbers ramp up it’s likely that the cost will continue to come down. Historical Super Hornet and Growler deliveries have had a flyaway cost of about US$70m each, but that’s based on high production rates. The F/A-18XT will be more expensive (additional capability always is), but by how much is unclear. If Boeing can deliver the F/A-18XT at US$80m (which remains to be seen) and the F-35C price drops to US$100m (ambitious, but possible), the USN will have to decide if the F-35C’s capability is worth the extra US$20m unit price. They might well decide that it is, but that conclusion would be shakier if the cost difference is closer to US$40m—and that’s the thrust of Boeing’s case.

As IoT adoption continues to surge and VR investments soar, 3D printing is perhaps the area to which we should all be averting our gaze. IDC estimates that there was more than $13bn worth of 3D-printing-related purchases in 2016, with the market expected to grow to $28.9bn by the end of the decade. When big industry gets involved, you know that growth is more and more achievable. On that note, Boeing has revealed a new partnership with Norsk Titanium AS, to print the first structural titanium parts for its 787 Dreamliner. The Norwegian 3D printing tech company claims that the move could knock up to $3m off the price of each plane, with more parts to be printed in 2018. This is one of the biggest ever votes of confidence for 3D printing, with durability and safety two concerns that have held back a technology continuing to undergo massive innovation. According to Reuters, strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more costly than aluminium, and accounts for about $17m of the cost of a $265m Dreamliner. “Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fibre fuselage and wings,” said Reuters. Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus Group SE’s rival A350 jet. “This means $2m-$3m in savings for each Dreamliner, at least,” said Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium’s vice-president of marketing. Last week, it was revealed that Adidas was dipping its toe in the 3D-printing industry, using the latest technology to create its ‘Futurecraft 4D’ shoe. Adidas is partnering with Carbon – a Silicon Valley start-up that can 3D print fast enough with good quality – to allow for the mass production of footwear later this year. The soles of the shoes will be 3D printed, replacing the injection mould process that is largely the norm in the industry. “This is a milestone – not only for us as a company, but also for the industry,” said Gerd Manz, head of technology innovation at Adidas. “We’ve cracked some of the boundaries.” Fashion and aerospace: two industries now embracing what appears an inevitable future.

Norsk Titanium confirmed on its website Monday that it's now received a production order from Boeing for 3-D printed structural titanium components to be used on the Dreamliner 787. The Dreamliner will be the first plane to fly with "Additive-Manufactured" 3-D parts that make up part of the plane's load bearing structure. On the release, Boeing said the new process should save on the cost of production. "From the outset, the 787 has been the hallmark of innovation and efficiency," said John Byrne, vice president, Airplane Materials and Structures & Supplier Management at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "We are always looking at the latest technologies to drive cost reduction, performance and value to our customers and Norsk Titanium's RPD™ capability fits the bill in a new and creative way." Norsk told Reuters it will print initially in Norway, but aims to have nine printers running in New York by the end of 2017. The Dreamliner 787 plane sells for a list price of $312.8 million and is being built at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The Dreamliner turned profitable for Boeing last year after the cost of each plane produced finally fell below the sales price. Boeing's largest and latest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, tested successfully in March and claims to have 10 percent better fuel efficiency than any commercial plane currently in the sky. Airlines who buy the Dreamliner can choose engines from General Electric Co in the U.S. or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 11 April 2017 | MYT 3:00 PM Printed titanium parts expected to save millions in Boeing Dreamliner costs Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fiber fuselage and wings. Pictured is the 787-10 Dreamliner. — Reuters SEATTLE: Boeing Co hired Norsk Titanium AS to print the first structural titanium parts for its 787 Dreamliner, a shift that the Norwegian 3-D printing company said would eventually shave US$2mil (RM8.97mil) to US$3mil (RM13.3mil) off the cost of each plane. The contract announced on Monday is a major step in Boeing's effort to boost the profitability of the 787 and a sign of growing industrial acceptance of the durability of 3D printed metal parts, allowing them to replace pieces made with more expensive traditional manufacturing in demanding aerospace applications. Strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more costly than aluminum, and accounts for about US$17mil (RM75.4mil)  of the cost of a US$265mil (RM1.1bil)  Dreamliner, industry sources say. Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fiber fuselage and wings. Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus Group SE's rival A350 jet. "This means US$2mil (RM8.97bil) to US$3mil (RM13.3bil) in savings for each Dreamliner, at least," starting in 2018 when many more parts are being printed, Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium's vice president of marketing, said in a telephone interview. Boeing builds 144 Dreamliners in a typical year. The company declined to comment on the estimate but said Norsk's technology would help reduce costs. The Dreamliner turned profitable last year after racking up nearly US$29bil (RM128.6bil)  in production-related losses. Norsk worked with Boeing for more than a year to design four 787 parts and obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification for them, Yates said. Norsk expects the US regulatory agency will approve the material properties and production process for printed parts later this year. That will "open up the floodgates," Yates said, by allowing Norsk to print thousands of other parts for each Dreamliner, without each part requiring separate FAA approval, resulting in the millions in expecting savings per plane. "You're talking about tons, literally," on the 787 that would be printed instead of made with traditional, expensive forging and machining, he said. General Electric Co is already printing metal fuel nozzles for aircraft engines. But Norsk and Boeing said the titanium parts are the first printed structural components designed to bear the stress of an airframe in flight. Norsk said it will print initially in Norway, but aims to have nine printers running by year-end at a 67,000-sq ft (6,220sq m) facility in Plattsburgh, New York. —  Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Uber offers free rides on Turkish referendum day Uber to restart Taiwan operations after two-month pause US payments startup backed by Amazon founder expands to UK Relocation of eight air bases to cost RM2.7bil IGP: Missing activist Peter Chong spotted in Thailand US-based Osprey Packs confirms severed ties with Terry Yee over dog attack Others Also Read Japan's Asada 'gave her all', has no regrets Low-cost flats get free rubbish bins from state govt Judge: British baby can be allowed to die against parents' wishes advertisement Latest News SWIFT to introduce tool to spot fraudulent inter-bank messages Yahoo accused of mismanaging funds meant for Chinese dissidents Canada judge denies bail for man US wants over Yahoo hack Facebook's EU regulator says close to deal on sharing of WhatsApp data Amazon said to mull Whole Foods bid before Jana stepped in Most Viewed in Tech Internet trolls United Airlines with creative memes in response to forceful flier removal Swift to start suspicious-payment alerts to help defend banks Two new price-crunching handsets from Honor, including top-end Honor 8 Pro Don’t be so sure about an Apple iPhone ‘super cycle’: opinion Apple-Qualcomm billions put at risk as phone alliance frays Facebook's EU regulator says close to deal on sharing of WhatsApp data Wal-Mart offers discounts for online orders picked up in store Amazon said to mull Whole Foods bid before Jana stepped in SWIFT to introduce tool to spot fraudulent inter-bank messages Uber offers free rides on Turkish referendum day Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Image: Norsk Titanium 3D printing may not be the home phenomenon many hoped for, but the technology continues to find a place in the world of industrial manufacturing. Reuters reports that Boeing will start using 3D-printed titanium parts in the construction of its 787 Dreamliner jet airliner. These are the first 3D-printed structural components to be approved by the Federal Aviation Authority, says manufacturer Norsk Titanium, and could eventually save Boeing up to $3 million in construction costs on each jet built. These cost savings are important for Boeing, which lost money on each 787 built until last year. This is quite normal for commercial jet programs, which sink a lot of money into initial research and engineering, before trimming expenses by making the manufacturing process more efficient. Production of the Dreamliner only became profitable in 2016 after Boeing racked up some $29 billion in losses. A 787-9 Dreamliner (with longer fuselage) built for Air New Zealand. Photo by Stephen Brashear / Getty Images The 787 is particularly worrying cost-wise due to its extensive use of titanium. This metal alloy is strong, lightweight, and helps to keep the plane fuel efficient, but costs seven times more than aluminum, which is commonly used in commercial jets. As of 2015, Boeing lost $30 million on the cost of each $265 million Dreamliner, with titanium parts accounting for $17 million of the overall price tag. 3D-printing helps to bring these costs down. Norsk has developed its own technology for creating titanium parts, using a technique named Rapid Plasma Deposition or RPD, in which titanium wire is melted in a cloud of argon gas to create each part. This process cuts down on both raw material costs and energy usage compared to traditional forging and machining, says Norsk, making each jet cheaper to build.

Image: Norsk Titanium Boeing is no stranger to using 3D-printed parts (it’s previously deployed them in jet engines and its space taxis), but Norsk says its products are the first approved by the FAA as structural, load-bearing components. Later this year, the company expects to get its entire manufacturing process approved, rather than each individual part, allowing it to produce even more parts for Boeing and other firms. This will “open up the floodgates” for 3D-printed titanium in commercial jets, Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium's vice president of marketing, told Reuters.

The contract is a major step in Boeing’s effort to cut the cost of its barely profitable 787 and a sign of growing industrial acceptance of the durability of 3D printed metal parts, allowing them to replace pieces made with more expensive traditional manufacturing in demanding aerospace applications. Strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more costly than aluminum, and accounts for about $17m of the cost of a $265m Dreamliner, industry sources say. Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fibre composite fuselage and wings. Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus’ rival A350 jet. "This means $2m to $3m in savings for each Dreamliner, at least," starting in 2018 when many more parts are being printed, said Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium’s vice president of marketing. Boeing declined to comment on the estimate but said Norsk’s technology would help to reduce costs. Norsk worked with Boeing for more than a year to design four 787 parts and obtain US federal aviation administration (FAA) certification for them, Mr Yates said. Norsk expects the US regulatory agency will approve the material properties and production process for the parts later this year, which would "open up the floodgates" and allow Norsk to print thousands of different parts for each Dreamliner, without each part requiring separate FAA approval, Yates said. "You’re talking about tonnes, literally" on the 787 that would be printed instead of made with traditional, expensive forging and machining, he said. General Electric is already printing metal fuel nozzles for a line of new aircraft engines. But Norsk and Boeing said the titanium parts are the first printed structural components designed to bear the stress of an airframe in flight. Norsk said that initially it will print in Norway, but is building up a 6,220-square-metre facility in Plattsburgh in upstate New York, where it aims to have nine printers running by year-end. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Emirates hits back at United Airlines for mistreatment of passenger - video UAE drone users must register themselves and their device under strict new rules Aircraft leasing firm DAE reports lower income for last year Dafza wants to upend the way Dubai’s Government does business MOST VIEWED Business | All Emirates hits back at United Airlines for mistreatment of passenger - video Dafza wants to upend the way Dubai’s Government does business Omani developer plans Westfield-inspired mall near Muscat Subsidiary of Al Fardan purchases Carlton Downtown hotel in Dubai Airbus flying cars accelerate city transport revolution Dubai Islamic Bank beats earnings estimates American Airlines ups outlook as rival United’s passenger scandal bites Jump in Dubai home sales a ‘false start’, says expert Goldman registers mutual funds for UAE retail investors Capital restructuring will allow Arabtec to focus on long-term prospects, says chief executive More Most Viewed Teachers from certain countries to be fast-tracked through UAE’s new education licensing scheme Iran's agitation in the Gulf hides defeat at home Dh1 million awarded to victim of Exential forex scam Emirates hits back at United Airlines for mistreatment of passenger - video New Mers Coronavirus case discovered in Abu Dhabi UAE weather: highs of 45°C in Abu Dhabi Six men given community service for reckless driving in Abu Dhabi Dubai policeman who forged sick notes so he could go on holiday to Thailand is jailed Nine killed after Abu Sayyaf militants attack Philippine tourist island Bohol UAE public and private sector Israa wal Miraj holidays announced More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: There’s nothing flowery about the renewables bidding bubble Tipping in the UAE: Some are more equal than others Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT G7 states reach no deal on UK call for further Syria and Russia sanctions Six men given community service for reckless driving in Abu Dhabi Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

The airline yesterday partnered with with General Electronic and Boeing to donate a Sh200 high-tech aircraft engine to support Aerospace and Aviation Engineering programme at the Technical University of Kenya. The engine powers Airbus A310, A300, A330, Boeing 767 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft. KQ's strategic and performance management director Thomas Omondi said the joint initiative aims at ensuring capacity building in aviation training. He said other donations include aviation maintenance training books, training aids, reading materials, used aircraft parts and aircraft manuals. Omondi said that the partnership will go a long way in bridging human labour gaps that cripples the aviation industry. Kenya Airways loses about 200 technicians and engineers annually to other international airlines which offer better remuneration. “We have always had a challenge with technicians and engineers as we lose about about 100 engineers and technicians respectively who are recruited to the Middle East," Omondi said. He also said access to quality technical training was limited by inadequate training facilities. “The truth is that more than 90 per cent of graduands already in the market have not had a chance to practically access things like engines that's why they take a lot of time transcending theoretical material to hands-on reality at work,” he said. Omondi said, through the partnership, the airline would offer internship opportunities to students under the engineering programme. "As we speak, we already have several technicians on board and we recently interviewed another lot who recently graduated and will will be brought on board soon," he added. The airline last year suffered a considerable brain drain leaving the technical department greatly understaffed causing delays and safety concerns. The Technical University of Kenya's vice chancellor Francis Aduol said about 400 students undertaking diploma to 5 year Bachelors degree programme in aviation engineering will benefit. "We have about 150 students taking Bachellors in engineering, 120 undertaking Diploma, 120 under Bachelor in technology program and we intend to introduce the Masters programme and PhD," he said.

Click here to see suggestions from google Money NAC Boeing 757 for sale, minimum offer $1.71 million Send Off - Post Report, Kathmandu Apr 11, 2017- Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) has put one of its two Boeing 757s up for sale. On Monday, the national flag carrier issued an auction notice setting a minimum sale price of $1.71 million for the 30-year-old Karnali bearing registration number 9N-ACA. The aircraft has been sitting outside the NAC hangar at Tribhuvan International Airport since April 2016 following the corporation’s policy to phase out Boeing aircraft, the airline said.  “We have decided to retire the aircraft after conducting a cost-benefit analysis. Based on the operational cost analysis, it does not make sense to fly the aircraft,” said Rabindra Shrestha, spokesperson for NAC.  He added that the Boeing 757 burns 4 tonnes of fuel per hour compared to 2.5 tonnes for new aircraft. The move is also part of the national flag carrier’s plan to have an all-Airbus fleet for its international operations.  The corporation has given a May 24 deadline for the submission of tender documents by interested parties. The corporation plans to retire its second Boeing 757 by 2019.  The 9N-ACA arrived in Nepal in 1987 and flew on long-haul routes, displaying the national flag at world airports. The 757 holds 190 passengers. The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow body twin engine jet built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It debuted in the late 1980s and was in production until 2004. NAC moved to sell off its two 757s as it is no longer profitable to fly them due to their high maintenance costs compared to the revenue they bring in. Each of NAC’s Boeings earns about Rs2 billion annually, and it costs the carrier almost the same in maintenance expenses, according to the carrier.  As per the notice, the successful bidder shall have to bear insurance charges after 90 days from the signature date of the binding contract. All charges for deregistration and applicable taxes on the sale shall be borne by the buyer, and the sale of aircraft does not include any spare parts. NAC recently announced that it would be launching four new long-haul routes besides resuming its London service after acquiring two wide body jets in 2018.  Last Friday, the NAC signed a $209.6 million deal to purchase two Airbus A330-200 long-range jets from US-based AAR Corp, marking the largest ever jet purchase deal in Nepal’s aviation history. The national flag carrier plans to connect Kathmandu with Seoul in South Korea, Tokyo in Japan, Dammam in Saudi Arabia and Sydney in Australia. It has also announced increasing flight frequencies to key destinations like Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Doha.   Nepal Airlines has taken the top spot in international passenger carriage for the first time in years, flying 275,701 travellers during the first nine months of 2016. It began flying high after inducting two new Airbus A320 aircraft into its fleet in 2015. It resumed flights to Dubai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi soon after acquiring the new jets, and now serves eight international destinations.

I was disappointed by the remarks and rhetoric from newly appointed District Attorney Faith Johnson and her staff at a community forum last week in southern Dallas. When prosecutors use the terms monsters and lost souls to refer to criminal defendants, they are participating in the same shameful and dehumanizing behavior that has plagued the Dallas County district attorney's office for decades. This ideology has led to wrongful convictions, blatant racism, failure to indict officers who murder, and the targeting of mentally ill persons. In addition, this rhetoric and the policies it represents do little to reduce or deter real violence. We need a district attorney who can lead Dallas in the 21st century and address all of the historical flaws and habits of the office, not one who perpetuates them. MarySue Foster, Dallas PC speech Re: "Lost souls, not monsters" by Rick Halperin, Friday Letters. Just when I thought that PC speech policing by college officials could not possibly get worse, here it is from a Southern Methodist University administrator. Halperin objects to calling the worst violent offenders monsters and claims, "There is no such thing as a lesser person." The dictionary defines a monster as one who is morally wicked, and threatening or terrifying. Nowhere does it say a monster is a lesser person, although that would appear obvious to those who believe moral behavior is a measure of our humanity. Ken Ashby, Dallas Big D street life vs. Chicago Re: "Boeing unit landed -- New global services division with ambitious plans putting HQ at Plano's Legacy West," Thursday Business story. Years ago, Boeing turned down downtown Dallas for its world headquarters, moving management from Seattle to Chicago. That struck hard at Dallas' self-esteem. Boeing complained that Dallas' downtown streets were empty, while Chicago had street life. Now Boeing is coming around to Legacy West, even one relatively small division. Thank you. Meanwhile Uptown, largely undeveloped then except for Caroline Hunt's Crescent, has become so highly developed that even vacant cemetery space is being reclaimed for buildings. Major money in Dallas got behind completion of the Arts District. The central Dallas complex would be a much stronger competitor for Chicago today. Development is spreading south from the Arts District into the older downtown in a way that Boeing could have found a place, but street life is hard to build. We're grateful for the Boeing division moving to Legacy West. With Chicago's high murder rate, maybe Chicago's street life isn't as alluring. Dallas could get another bite at the Boeing apple. Frederick W. Fraley, Dallas Pro-law, not anti-immigrant Re: "Rallying for rights -- Thousands turn out to support immigrants," Monday news story. There is no anti-immigrant feeling in the country or the Trump administration There is a definite pro-law mood in the country as it sees an invasion of illegal immigration continue to tear down our infrastructure, culture and education. Coddling and enabling illegal aliens is an insult to the many who have come to this country legally. It can be an arduous process, and it is frustrating for those who follow the rules to see line-jumpers be not only accommodated but lionized. Stop repeating talking points that are basically lies. The country and the Trump administration are not anti-immigrant. They are pro-law. Tom Huber, Irving Prioritize Texas resources Re: "Proposed cuts take many by surprise -- House amendment would strip money, but state budget isn't final yet," Saturday Business story. I'm glad the Legislature is debating the necessity and effectiveness of the Texas Enterprise Fund in the face of fiscal shortcomings and potential cuts to the state's social safety net, such as Texas' Medicaid program. I agree with Rep. Angie Chen Button on the efforts to diversify the state's economy away from one solely based on oil production as being crucial to Texas' future prosperity. However, Rep. Sergio Muñoz Jr. has won the debate in pointing out that this debate should be one based on how the state prioritizes its limited resources and funding. While luring business to the Lone Star State reaps many benefits, the well-being of Texas' most vulnerable must take precedent over economic development. Texas' families with children with special needs should not live in fear of their physical therapy and rehabilitation services being cut in the face of a projected revenue shortfall. Michael Clarke, Far North Dallas Promises to government workers As president of Chapter 254 of the National Treasury Employees Union, I represent a group of middle-class Americans who are proud to work for the U.S. government but are concerned about some of the talk in Washington about budget cuts. Many of us choose to work for the government because of the professional challenge and the opportunity to serve the public, sometimes at salaries lower than we could receive in the private sector, particularly for scientists, engineers and medical professionals. Part of that decision was to work in exchange for a modest retirement provided by the fully funded and financially sound Federal Employees Retirement System. Since 2010, Congress has twice increased employee contributions to the fund, essentially cutting the take-home pay of federal employees. Those pensions are part of our employment contract with Congress and the American people we serve. The members of NTEU Chapter 254 who work in the Food and Drug Administration urge Congress to respect that contract and allow federal employees to retire with the security they have been promised. David Arvelo, Dallas Nuclear-option madness Both Democrats and Republicans have to remember that any use of the nuclear option, whether military or political, is accompanied by mutually assured destruction. The same nuclear option you used against your opponent, no matter how much you justify its use at the time, will be used against you when the opportunity presents itself. John A. Bianchi, Wylie Is Bannon an anarchist? Re: "Bannon loses NSC insider spot," Thursday news story. This article says that Steve Bannon describes himself as "virulently anti-establishment" and a revolutionary out to destroy the "administrative state." How does this description differ from that of an anarchist? If not, please explain, and also tell me why Bannon should retain any position in this administration.

Mr Pyne on Wednesday opened the aerospace giant's Adelaide hub, which will undertake research and development and create 250 jobs over the next five years. The minister said it was one of many defence-focused offices he had opened in the past nine months as part of the expansion of Australia's defence industry. That growth was reaping benefits for both the SA and national economy, he said. "For the first time in living memory, defence industry showed up in the national accounts in the last quarter of last year as helping to drive the economy - larger than the National Broadband Network," he told reporters. Mr Pyne said the federal government would spend $195 billion over the next 10 years to continue that growth. "The largest peacetime build-up of our military capability in our history," he said. The SA government is backing Boeing through its Investment Attraction South Australia and Defence SA groups, but has declined to reveal how much money the company has received. Boeing's biggest presence outside of the USA is in Australia, with Queensland boasting the lion's share of the 3500 Australian jobs it maintains. The company, which manufactures commercial airliners, military aircraft and defence, space and security systems, has 140,000 employees worldwide. © AAP 2017 South Australia Jobs TRENDING VIDEO Ashton Kutcher addresses Demi Moore rumours and praises Mila Kunis Ashton Kutcher is a Hollywood leading man, tech entrepreneur, husband, and father-of-two, and as he shared recently, there are several key experiences that got him where he is today.

The Pioneering Spirit –longer than six Boeing 747s and nearly twice the size of the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers – will prise the 24,000-ton top platform off Shell's Brent Delta rig and lift it on board. It will ferry the 230-square foot structure – helipad included – intact for nearly 500 miles trip through to the Able UK yard in Teesside where it will drop it off to be recycled. If successful, the mission will mark a key step in winding down the Brent field, which has supplied around 10 per cent of the UK's oil since it was discovered in the 1970s but is coming to the end of its life. Sea monster: The Pioneering Spirit is longer than six Boeing 747s and nearly twice the size of the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers What to do with the ageing rigs has been a conundrum for Shell and will only become more pressing as the North Sea declines.  Rather than dismantling the platform offshore, Shell bosses have decided it would be safer, quicker, cheaper and more efficient to take it ashore, intact, where it can be taken apart.

Share this article Share Alistair Hope, project and technology director for Brent decommissioning at Shell, said: 'They [Brent platforms] are a nightmare to pull apart so it is far better to bring them ashore in one piece and dismantle them in a much more controlled way on the quayside.' Designed by Swiss-Dutch company Allseas Group, the Pioneering Spirit is the only ship that can do that on the scale Shell needs.  Built between 2011 and 2014 in South Korea, she has a deck space equal to six football pitches and can carry up to 47,200 tons. Yet her mission is extremely delicate, requiring movements controlled down to the inches. Sixteen giant steel arms will attach to points on the underside of the rig platform and lift it up.  But she has to be able to do that in waves potentially nearly ten feet high, in as little as nine seconds. Originally planned for last summer, the Brent Delta lift has been pushed back due to its complexity.  Tests have been done in simulators and a special test rig in Rotterdam, where the Pioneering Spirit is anchored. Last summer she removed Repsol's Yme 13,300-ton platform from the Norwegian North Sea. Edward Heerema, president and founder of Allseas, said he isn't worried about the upcoming job. 'We have been preparing for five years,' he says. And with more than 470 North Sea platforms likely to need decommissioning by the 2050s, the effort is also being watched closely by the oil industry. As it approaches the Able UK yard in Teesside, the Brent platform will be transferred onto a purpose built barge, the Iron Lady, before being slid onshore.  It is hoped 3 per cent or less will go to landfill while the rest can be re-used or sold off for scrap. Yesterday in Rotterdam, the Pioneering Spirit's crew were working on final preparations for the lift. 'There was a lot of scepticism at the beginning,' said Allseas construction manager Daan Akerboom. 'But when you see it at work, it's unbelievable,' he said.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Santander fobs off fraud victims in just 24 hours: We... Now that's a mortgage price war!

Published: 17:39 April 9, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dallas, Chicago: United Parcel Service Inc. purchased its first used Boeing Co. 767s, grabbing older models that are in high demand as package shipments increase globally and production slots for new versions of the plane are sold out. The three passenger aircraft, 767-300ERs that will be converted to carry freight, were bought “within the past couple of days,” UPS spokesman Jim Mayer said Friday. He declined to identify the seller or the cost and couldn’t say when the new planes will begin flights for the Atlanta-based courier. The company has 59 of the model now, all ordered from Boeing in January 1993. The 767, which debuted in 1982 as Boeing’s first twin-engined wide-body, has enjoyed a resurgence as a freighter as the passenger version loses popularity. Boeing plans to speed output by 25 per cent later this year as it juggles contracts to build the first of potentially 400 aerial tankers for the US Air Force and 50 freighters for FedEx Corp. “It’s simply a plan for investment in capacity we need for growth,” Mayer said of the 767 purchase. The planes will be deployed “pretty much anywhere we operate.” The price of used aircraft vary widely depending on age, condition and other factors. Consulting firm Avitas gives the 767-300ER a book value of between $9 million for a 20-year-old plane to $20 million for one that’s a decade old. UPS in October ordered 14 larger Boeing 747 jumbo jets valued at $5.3 billion amid strong package-volume growth in China and Hong Kong. Mayer didn’t know if UPS had sought to order new 767s before buying the used ones. Air Transport Services Group Inc. and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. have been acquiring used 767s to operate for Amazon.com Inc.’s nascent air-cargo service. Each will operate 20 of the planes for the online retailer. Cargo Facts reported earlier that UPS purchased a 767 from Japan Airlines Co.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Wednesday April 12, 2017 Life & Style Travel Larger / SmallerNight Mode Cathay Pacific Airbus A350 starts Melbourne flights Craig Platt 1 Feb 2017, 4:54 p.m. New cutting-edge aircraft makes first flight on Hong Kong-Melbourne route. Cathay Pacific Airbus A350 starts Melbourne flights The Cathay Pacific A350 arrives in Melbourne for the first time. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Cathay Pacific's new Airbus A350 aircraft arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday on its first flight into Australia. It kicks off daily flights for the A350-900 on the Melbourne to Hong Kong route for the airline. The new A350-900 is Airbus' rival to the Boeing Dreamliner. Like its rival, the A350 is also a lightweight aircraft, but with some key differences. Unlike the Dreamliner, which has a body is composed primarily of carbon fibre, the A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials, helping airlines save on fuel. The aircraft manufacturer says its A350 uses 25 per cent less fuel than Boeing's longest-range plane, the 777. Airbus says that, also like the Dreamliner, the A350 helps reduce jet-lag on long-haul flights, thanks to a lower cabin altitude than previous generation planes, meaning higher oxygen levels. The airline says the draught-free air circulation system – filtering the cabin air every three minutes – will keep humidity levels in check. The Cathay A350 features three classes - business, premium and economy - for a total of 280 seats. The 38-seat business class cabin features more legroom for passengers, with an extra three inches (7.6 cm) in seat pitch. The seat, which converts to a fully flat bed, also features extra storage space, 'do not disturb' and 'wake up call' functions. One of the most unusual aspects of the economy class cabin is the 3-3-3 layout. For a large, twin-aisle aircraft, having only three seats in the middle of the cabin, instead of four or five, means there are only three "middle" seats per row. Another unusual feature of the new economy class seat is the headrest - Cathay's new design is a six-way headrest with larger side-cushions that can be folded in and out at different angles. Possibly the best seat outside the premium classes is row 60 on the window. The exit row in front of this seat features only two, not three, economy seats, meaning the passenger in the window seat enjoys significantly extra legroom. Melbourne Airport chief of aviation, Simon Gandy, welcomed the arrival of the new plane into Melbourne. "Right now we're witnessing the greatest revolution in aircraft technology since the invention of the jet engine. These aircraft are lighter, more fuel efficient, and have far greater range than their predecessors," he said. Cathay will fly the A350 on one its three daily flights from Melbourne to Hong Kong. It will also begin flying an A350 on the Brisbane-Hong Kong route from March. Qatar Airways became the first airline to fly the A350 to Australia when it started flights on the Adelaide-Doha route in May last year. Singapore Airlines also began A350 flights to Australia last year, but only for a brief period before moving the aircraft onto its Singapore to San Francisco route.

Pegasus experienced a difficult 2016, with the combination of geopolitical events and terrorist attacks within its home country, leading to a sharp downturn in tourism. However, the LCC still succeeded in increasing passenger numbers by more than 8% to 24.1 million, but posted a loss of TL136 million ($36.4 million). “Despite all the challenges of the past year, we achieved operational growth in 2016 and we are hopeful for 2017, but the real growth will come in 2018 and beyond,” CEO Mehmet Nane said April 10. “While the international flight market shrank by 15.5% we recorded growth of 3.9%,” he added. Fleet utilization averaged 12 hours daily. As Turkey and Russia reached a rapprochement following a diplomatic chill caused by the shooting down of a Russian military aircraft, it was notable that Pegasus’ route map grew particularly strongly in Russia, with Grozny, Samara, Nizhny Novgorod and Volgograd added to the list of destinations. In 2016, “Our priority was reducing costs. Through strategic steps such as bringing forward our Airbus orders, with their higher fuel efficiency, and rescheduling our Boeing deliveries, we have reformed both our cash flow and our fuel cost management,” Nane said. Further fleet economies were achieved in 2016 and 1Q 2017 “by renting out four of our Boeing 737-800 aircraft to Pakistan Airlines and two to [Saudi Arabian LCC] Flynas on a wet lease,” he said. “Then, on March 20, we sold seven Boeing 737-800 aircraft … to Air Lease Corp. for $178.7 million. The income that we receive from the sale, which is expected to be completed by the end of October, will be used to pay for these aircraft, which we have added to our fleet using financial leasing and to realize new investments,” Nane said. “With this sale, we have accelerated portfolio replacement to ensure optimization of fuel use within the scope of our 100-aircraft Airbus neo agreement from 2012 and increased the number of new A320neo purchases planned for 2017 from three to six. Thus, our average fleet age will fall and we will achieve an improvement in aircraft operating costs,” he added. Since May 2016, Pegasus has taken over all its ground management operations at its main hub of Istanbul’s Sabiha Gökçen airport. “With this project, we have achieved a major improvement in cleaning and reducing delays caused by ground services and boarding/de-boarding procedures. For example, we saw an improvement of 30% in baggage waiting times and a 35% improvement in lost/damaged baggage cases.” Nane said Pegasus aims to increase the number of passengers 5%-7% in 2017. “We have great faith in the Turkish economy and its tourism potential. That is why, though we see 2017 as a period of renewal, we expect the real growth to occur in 2018 and beyond.” Alan Dron alandron@adepteditorial.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Transportation Dude, Who Plugged in My Plane? Adam Minter is a Bloomberg View columnist. He is the author of “Junkyard Planet: Travels in the Billion-Dollar Trash Trade.” Read More. @AdamMinter April 11, 2017 9:30 AM EDT a | A By Adam Minter The concept is familiar: Replace car journeys with high-speed, electric-powered travel for the masses. China does it with a famous (and famously expensive) high-speed train network. Last week, the Boeing Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. invested in another idea: electric planes. If their bet pans out, travelers could start making their first trips in the Teslas of the air in a decade. That could transform the way great swathes of the world get from point A to point B -- to everyone’s benefit. Electric planes aren’t a new idea, of course; evangelists have promised their imminent arrival for decades now. But recent advances, particularly in batteries and electric propulsion, make the possibility far more realistic. Boeing and JetBlue were confident enough in the technology to back Zunum Aero, a Washington-based startup that hopes to complete a battery-powered jet by 2020. The need is very real. In theory, by virtually eliminating fuel costs, electric planes would make currently unprofitable routes viable. According to the FAA, roughly 70 percent of U.S. commercial passenger air traffic passes through just 30 airports. This hub-and-spoke system leaves the commuters who use small, regional airports stranded. Airfares at these smaller airports tend to be significantly higher and, in many cases, subsidized by the government. (The Trump administration wants to end those subsidies.) Rather than flying, Americans thus take slow-moving cars for more than half of all trips under 750 miles (or drive long distances to cheaper, busier airports) in order to save money. That’s not only inefficient, it’s also terrible for the environment: Cars generally burn more fuel per passenger than planes. QuickTake Batteries Big developing countries such as India and China are only now beginning to develop long-distance car cultures. If they follow the U.S. model, at far greater scale, both their already smoggy skies and their ambitious emissions targets will suffer. Electric jets could help them accelerate the process of building aviation links to less-developed rural areas. In effect, such planes could become the high-speed, low-carbon competition for long car rides, expensive commuter rails and trans-city buses. Until quite recently, electric-powered flight seemed like a stunt more than a pathway to the transportation future. Solar-powered aircraft, for example, are great at raising awareness, but not at moving people around, much less in comfort. Yet advances in lightweight materials, electric motors and, most importantly, batteries have opened up new possibilities. In 2011, a battery-powered, two-seater aircraft built by the University of Stuttgart flew 62 miles on 25 Kwh of electricity that cost around $3. Three years later, Airbus SE followed with the E-Fan, an all-electric, lithium-battery-powered two-seater. Like automakers, plane manufacturers are focusing now on hybrid technologies that could extend the range of electric planes and be implemented more quickly. Citing recent advances in electric-propulsion technologies, for instance, Airbus announced last week that it was dropping plans to produce the E-Fan in favor of a hybrid-electric regional jet that could fly within the next three years. NASA, too, is pursuing a 60- to 90-seat hybrid jet, working closely with Hyannis-based Cape Air Corp., the largest private regional airline in the U.S. NASA scientists took baseline flight and fuel-economy data on an Italian commuter plane the airline was considering, and are in the process of retrofitting it into an electric plane with new wings and engines. NASA estimates that the electrical upgrade should trim operational costs by 30 percent and result in zero in-flight carbon emissions. Tests should commence this year. With their investments in four-year-old Zunum Aero, Boeing and JetBlue are looking to a hybrid future that extends the range of electric aircraft to 700 miles. Zunum is planning 10- and 50-seat planes that are 40 to 80 percent cheaper to operate than conventional counterparts. That’s not all: Its technology map also includes the possibility of 100-seat airliner that would debut in the 2030s. For now, the biggest roadblock remains battery technology. Recent advances are due in large part to batteries becoming lighter and more efficient. If Zunum and other electric-plane companies are to realize their sci-fi dreams, they’ll need today’s capacities to double over the next few years. That’s not entirely crazy: Battery energy density has improved by around 8 percent annually for the last 30 years, and massive investments by Tesla Inc. and other technology companies should help the improvements keep coming. Don’t be surprised if one day soon, your next plane turns out to be a plug-in. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

It also helps companies and users create working prototypes on the fly, and we’ve also seen how it can be used in the fashion industry to help create customized sneakers. However it seems that very near future should be ever get to fly on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, know that there will be some components that are made as a result of 3D printing. This is thanks to Boeing teaming up with Norwegian company Norsk Titanium who will be using 3D printing to create structural titanium components for the plane. Boeing expects that by 2018, the use of 3D printing will help them shave $2-3 million off the cost of each 787 Dreamliner. Note that planes already do use 3D printed parts to some extent, as Reuters points out, where General Electric already uses 3D printing for the fuel nozzles for aircraft engines, but this will be the first time a 3D printed part will be used in a part of a plane that bears the stress of the frame during a flight. According to Boeing the reason for turning to 3D printing is because for the 787, it uses more metal compared to other models and traditionally manufactured titanium alloy can be very expensive.

Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: HITCO Carbon Composites, LISI AEROSPACE, RUAG Aerostructures, TRIUMPH GROUP, Exelis (Harris), Ferra Engineering, and TAL Manufacturing Solutions. Commenting on the report: “One trend in market is emergence of thin wings. Globally, the airline market is facing challenges with respect to operational costs. Around 40% of the operational costs constitute of the fuel cost. In order to reduce the fuel consumption and increase the operational efficiency, the OEMs are focusing on designing an efficient aircraft model featuring a lighter wing. Currently, NASA and Boeing are working together to design and develop a longer, thinner, and lighter aircraft wing. As a part of NASA’s Advanced Air Transport Technology project, they are developing a trust-braced wing.” According to the report, one driver in market is advent of new wing designs to enhance aircraft efficiency. The shape and design of aircraft wings play an important role in defining aircraft operations. For aircraft airframe, the wing is a vital element that enhances aircraft performance and maintains operating costs within specified limits. The fundamental aim of aircraft design is to generate the required lift at streamline airflow while minimizing drag and weight acting on the aircraft. This phenomenon results in low fuel consumption and high cruise range. However, optimizing an aircraft wing design with such requirements is often challenging as wing structure cannot attain both minimum drag design as well as minimum weight design.

Airlines face challenges during retrofit projects, i.e., while replacing old components with new ones. The processes involve additional costs, cumbersome certification processes, and limited expertise to conduct verification. Also, public support is often required to implement advanced systems, since an infrastructure needs to established. Further, for the aerospace domain, the stakeholders need to meet stringent environmental regulations to avoid penalization. These rules can exist at federal, state, and local levels. After the systems, have been integrated, a list of authentication checks and certification processes follows.

Boeing’s new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co’s venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. “These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies,” he said. Upskill’s software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers’ tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company’s revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters. “Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual,” Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production. Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, “but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts,” spokesman Chaz Bickers said. Nordlund was formerly vice president of strategy for Boeing’s defense, space and security business and was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

He won a BMW by acing the 7th hole at Harbour Town Golf Links in the Monday pro-am at the RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing. “My girlfriend came up and told me, ‘You know, you can win me this BMW if you hit a hole in one,’ ” Mabry said. “I had not paid any attention, but that’s what I did.” Now he thinks she’ll tell him to go buy a lottery ticket, to “see how that works out.” But BMW’s big prize is like taking sand to the beach. Mabry owns two car dealerships back home in Virginia: Lynchburg Nissan and Lynchburg Mazda, as well as Lynchburg Polaris. He drives a Nissan Armada but now has won outright any BMW of his choice up to $50,000. “I’m still trying to decide what I’m going to do,” he said. “I’m not sure. This is an unusual circumstance.” The Heritage has been dangling the prize for six years, and Mabry is the first winner. He’s used to being on the other end of the deal. “I’ve put up probably 100 cars for charity hole-in-one prizes, and I’ve never been able to give one away,” he said. He’s a 16-handicapper who plays golf several times a month. At 54, he’s been playing about 30 years. This was his fifth Heritage Monday pro-am. He used a pitching wedge to reach the middle pin-placement at 146 yards, playing with professional Brooks Blackburn. He plans to stay through two rounds of the Heritage, unless he has to leave early for the arrival of his first grandchild. “This could be a really good week,” he said.

Gabor Degre | BDN The aircraft at the Bangor International Airport. By Danielle McLean, BDN staff Posted April 11, 2017, at 7:06 p.m. Last modified April 11, 2017, at 7:35 p.m. Bangor residents who looked up Tuesday afternoon may have seen the President of the United States’ famed white and blue jetliner. Called Air Force One when the president is onboard, one of the two specially configured Boeing 747s, which dons “United States of America” on its side, landed at Bangor International Airport at around 4 p.m., according to several people who saw it land. It then stood idly on the airport’s tarmac for at least a couple hours while crew and refueling trucks hovered around it. At the scene, the BDN found no evidence that Donald Trump was onboard and the plane had landed at the Pease Air National Guard Base in Portsmouth, NH earlier in the day without the president. Risteen Bahr, BIA’s marketing manager, did not immediately return calls for comment. The presence of the president’s plane is not an unusual sight in Bangor. In 2012, the white and blue 757 that typically carries the vice president and other U.S. dignitaries performed touch-and-go landings at BIA. Bahr said at the time the airport is a frequent stop for military jets due to its 11,440-foot runway, proximity to the Maine Air National Guard Base, and quiet air pattern. Last September, Air Force One, carrying then-President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton and then-Secretary of State John Kerry was expected to land at BIA on a refueling stop but that landing was evidently called off. The plane that landed on Tuesday had the number 29000 on its tail, marking it as one of the president’s two aircraft. It transported former President George W. Bush immediately following the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center South Tower in New York, according to the Air Force.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Thousands of Maine men are missing from the workforce, and no one really knows why Former midcoast mansion owner sues auctioneer who sold it for mere $1.4 million Somali man ICE arrested in court is a permanent resident who’s lived in U.S. for 20 years Plane crashes on I-295 in Bowdoinham, but pilot and passenger walk away President’s plane lands in Bangor Maine’s new income surtax for education is a step toward a prosperous society for all Maine’s ‘opioid health homes’ are so intricate there will probably be only a few Teddy Roosevelt would have had high hopes for North Woods monument It’s costly, inefficient to recycle big bottles under Maine’s redemption program You don’t improve a well-functioning nursing program by destroying it first Legendary Belfast High wrestling coach dies at 74 UMaine associate men’s hockey coach Jay Leach resigns This Maine high school sport continues northward expansion UMaine’s snub of Montgomery did championship hockey coach a huge favor Two more Orono track standouts heading to Division I programs STATE & CAPITOL Poll: LePage as popular as ever; King eclipses Collins #MAINE Deer tackles man, probably seeking vengeance for lost brothers STATE & CAPITOL Collins’ goal if she runs for Maine governor? ‘Heal the state’ VITAL SIGNS It may be 2017, but syphilis is making a comeback in Maine DEAR LIZ What is spousal support and how much can I get in a divorce?

Heath Robinson and Riley Jordan have been friends since the sixth grade. Recently, they became champions, winning a first place award at the Alabama Science and Engineering Fair in Huntsville. Robinson and Jordan, both seventh graders, collaborated on an aeronautical science project. The Carver Magnet School students designed more efficient turbine blades for an aircraft, used a 3-D printer to generate models of their design and used a wind tunnel they made to test their design. Robinson and Jordan won first place in the engineering category, junior best of show, a Toyota Excellence in Science Research award, a Boeing Best in Tech Award, Broadcom Masters Award, the Huntsville Rotary Junior Best of Show Award and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Special Award. “We were very excited and proud of ourselves for having the opportunity to go up there and for excelling in the competition,” Jordan said. Robinson said that the hardest part of their project was getting the school’s 3-D printer to create the model turbine blades. Robinson said it took 17-and-a-half hours to print the blades. Robinson credited his partnership with Jordan for their success. “I couldn’t have done it without him,” he said. “Riley’s much smarter than me.” Jessica Freeman, a Carver Magnet School science teacher, said the students were one of the few team entries that won awards. She said most of the winning entries were from solo students. Freeman said Riley and Robinson’s teamwork exemplified the collaboration that takes place in science-related professions. “I think they did an awesome job,” she said.

KOLKATA: Airports in Kolkata and Bagdogra will be a lot busier this summer than earlier as the regulator, DGCA, gave the nod for a bevy of flights to Bengal's twin airports. Kolkata will add at least 11 more flights by May and Bagdogra six. Though airlines have been granted many more slots till September, they are subject to availability of aircraft. All Indian carriers are set to augment their fleet as Airbus Industrie and Boeing Co delivers the orders placed with it and some carriers, such as Air India, take more planes on lease. Air Asia India will be the new addition to the airlines that will start services between Kolkata and Delhi and Ranchi from Poila Baisakh, the Bengali new year on April 15. Its Bagdogra flights will start later. "We are prepared for the additional flights and augmenting the facilities at the airport. In-line baggage will be operational by July-August. Retail, which has begun, will be fully operational in two months, so will the new food court next to Biswa Bangla and the more spacious duty-free facility," said Kolkata airport director Atul Dikshit. IndiGo, the largest airline operating out of Kolkata with 78 departures a day, will add six daily flights, including one to Srinagar from April 15. This will take its departure count to 84, with more lined up. Jet Airways will add at least two more flights— to Mumbai and Lucknow—taking its departures to 29. The carrier is also set to replace its ageing ATR-72 fleet with Boeing 737-800 aircraft. SpiceJet will start a service to Dhaka and to Silchar, taking the departure number to 24. Vistara will add a new flight to Pune, logging seven departures, while Air India, which has 23 departures, will add two flights to Bengaluru and Ranchi. The Bagdogra airport, already bursting at the seams, has to content with four more flights, including three to Delhi and one to Mumbai. While Jet Airways has introduced the Mumbai service, IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir will get one more frequency to Delhi each. This will take the daily Delhi-Bagdogra services to 13. "The hills, forests and tea estates in Darjeeling, Sikkim and the Dooars are drawing Western tourists in big numbers. Every airline is keen to operate more Bagdogra-Delhi flights," said Badgogra airport director Rakesh Sahay. With the terminal operating beyond its capacity, tackling flyers will be tough. AAI has urged airlines to operate before noon or after 4pm. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A post-election rally in defense stocks is sputtering as concerns grow that division in the Republican-controlled government could thwart President Donald Trump's pledge to boost military spending the most since the Reagan administration. Fiscal conservatives may insist on maintaining spending caps set under President Barack Obama. Lawmakers still haven’t approved a fiscal 2017 budget as a government shutdown looms this month. The easiest solution would be to extend for the full year a temporary measure known as a continuing resolution that holds funding at 2016 levels. Doing so would starve spending for new ships, bombers, missiles and helicopters built by companies like Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. Analyst Douglas Harned offers a blunt assessment: During the next six months to a year, the news for defense investors “is more likely to be bad than good, as it becomes clear that the president and Congress will be unable to bring a budget together that significantly increases defense spending.” The S&P 500’s defense group has notched a 15 percent gain since Trump’s Nov. 8 victory, outpacing the broader market. But half that run-up came in the first week after the election, when big Pentagon spending increases seemed like a slam dunk. The group has been a middling performer on the broader index, which is led by a 34 percent gain for casinos and gambling companies. “Irrational exuberance has waned after year-end 2016 euphoria,” Robert Stallard, a defense analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients Monday. “A combination of conservative guidance for this year and the Trump agenda hitting the reality of Congress appear to have flushed out some investors.” Companies that benefit from Trump administration policies that don’t rely on Congress have fared better. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama administration order directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to phase out its use of private lockups. Prison operators CoreCivic Inc. and Geo Group Inc. have risen 126 percent and 97 percent, respectively, since the election. The U.S. spends about $600 billion a year on its military, about as much as the next 14 nations combined. Trump would have to pull off a remarkable political feat for military spending to reach Reaganesque levels without increasing revenue, persuading conservatives to accede to higher deficits. Another, less palatable option: Geopolitical tensions would need to “escalate into an all-out war,” Harned, senior aerospace and defense analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Inc., wrote in a note to clients Monday. “We would not predict either of those events in the near term.” Trump, who ran as a blunt talker with an arsenal of simple-if-vague solutions, has been frequently stymied as he encounters the complexities of governance. Despite his promises to stanch the flow of companies to Mexico, relocations have resumed after a post-election pause. Last month, a plan pushed by Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan to end the Affordable Care Act fizzled without a floor vote after seven years of Republican promises. “It raises the question about how strong Speaker Ryan in fact is, or how capable he is of finding an appropriate middle ground,” said Howard Rubel, managing director with Jefferies LLC. “The health-care vote could be a precursor to other embarrassments to the Republican party if they aren’t careful.” Republicans are splintered ahead of the budget showdown. Members of Congress, now on a two-week recess, will have about four days to approve a catch-all omnibus spending bill covering the remainder of fiscal 2017 -- or extend a temporary measure due to expire on April 28 to keep government open. The Trump administration has requested a supplemental spending bill that includes $30 billion for defense and $3 billion for a border wall, at a price of significant non-defense cuts. A compromise defense-spending measure already approved by the House may carry funding for all the other government agencies. Most of the bill is already agreed on, according to Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and veteran member of the Appropriations Committee. Democrats, like Senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Dick Durbin of Illinois, the ranking member on the defense spending panel, indicated they would back it. The budget drama should be in full swing as defense company CEOs present first-quarter results -- and try to temper expectations, according to Ken Herbert, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. “Considering the hype around defense spending under the Trump administration, we see some risk,” Herbert wrote in a report Monday. “The defense fundamentals will take a few quarters to catch up with expectations,” Military-service chiefs warned Congress last week of dire scenarios should lawmakers resort to another continuing resolution. They range from the Navy canceling deployment of ships, to the Air Force cutting non-war related aircraft refueling missions. Then there’s the prospect of adding to the wear-and-tear on equipment and weapons due to spending constraints and years of war. The average age of the U.S. Air Force aircraft fleet is 27 years, according to data compiled by Jefferies. That’s why analysts think defense stocks have good growth prospects -- eventually. “There’s not a question that we need to boost defense spending because we’re using up our material faster than we should,” Rubel said. “It’s appropriate to bump up the budget.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

The company is able to 3D print titanium units, and it plans to use that system to generate airplane parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet airliner. Norsk Titanium's 3D-printed airplane parts were recently approved for use by the Federal Aviation Authority after a rigorous testing phase. This approval is massive for Boeing, as the incredibly efficient manufacturing process has the potential to save the company between $2 million and $3 million per jet.

China does it with a famous (and famously expensive) high-speed train network. Last week, the Boeing Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. invested in another idea: electric planes. If their bet pans out, travelers could start making their first trips in the Teslas of the air in a decade. That could transform the way great swathes of the world get from point A to point B -- to everyone's benefit. Electric planes aren't a new idea, of course; evangelists have promised their imminent arrival for decades now. But recent advances, particularly in batteries and electric propulsion, make the possibility far more realistic. Boeing and JetBlue were confident enough in the technology to back Zunum Aero, a Washington-based startup that hopes to complete a battery-powered jet by 2020. The need is very real. In theory, by virtually eliminating fuel costs, electric planes would make currently unprofitable routes viable. According to the FAA, roughly 70 percent of U.S. commercial passenger air traffic passes through just 30 airports. This hub-and-spoke system leaves the commuters who use small, regional airports stranded. Airfares at these smaller airports tend to be significantly higher and, in many cases, subsidized by the government. (The Trump administration wants to end those subsidies.) Rather than flying, Americans thus take slow-moving cars for more than half of all trips under 750 miles (or drive long distances to cheaper, busier airports) in order to save money. That's not only inefficient, it's also terrible for the environment: Cars generally burn more fuel per passenger than planes. QuickTake batteries Big developing countries such as India and China are only now beginning to develop long-distance car cultures. If they follow the U.S. model, at far greater scale, both their already smoggy skies and their ambitious emissions targets will suffer. Electric jets could help them accelerate the process of building aviation links to less-developed rural areas. In effect, such planes could become the high-speed, low-carbon competition for long car rides, expensive commuter rails and trans-city buses. Until quite recently, electric-powered flight seemed like a stunt more than a pathway to the transportation future. Solar-powered aircraft, for example, are great at raising awareness, but not at moving people around, much less in comfort. Twitter slogans, late-night talk shows mock United over passenger dragging video Yet advances in lightweight materials, electric motors and, most importantly, batteries have opened up new possibilities. In 2011, a battery-powered, two-seater aircraft built by the University of Stuttgart flew 62 miles on 25 Kwh of electricity that cost around $3. Three years later, Airbus SE followed with the E-Fan, an all-electric, lithium-battery-powered two-seater. Like automakers, plane manufacturers are focusing now on hybrid technologies that could extend the range of electric planes and be implemented more quickly. Citing recent advances in electric-propulsion technologies, for instance, Airbus announced last week that it was dropping plans to produce the E-Fan in favor of a hybrid-electric regional jet that could fly within the next three years. NASA, too, is pursuing a 60- to 90-seat hybrid jet, working closely with Hyannis-based Cape Air Corp., the largest private regional airline in the U.S. NASA scientists took baseline flight and fuel-economy data on an Italian commuter plane the airline was considering, and are in the process of retrofitting it into an electric plane with new wings and engines. NASA estimates that the electrical upgrade should trim operational costs by 30 percent and result in zero in-flight carbon emissions. Tests should commence this year. With their investments in four-year-old Zunum Aero, Boeing and JetBlue are looking to a hybrid future that extends the range of electric aircraft to 700 miles. Zunum is planning 10- and 50-seat planes that are 40 to 80 percent cheaper to operate than conventional counterparts. That's not all: its technology map also includes the possibility of 100-seat airliner that would debut in the 2030s. Expect gas prices to rise 10 percent this summer, EIA says For now, the biggest roadblock remains battery technology. Recent advances are due in large part to batteries becoming lighter and more efficient. If Zunum and other electric-plane companies are to realize their sci-fi dreams, they'll need today's capacities to double over the next few years. That's not entirely crazy: Battery energy density has improved by around 8 percent annually for the last 30 years, and massive investments by Tesla Inc. and other technology companies should help the improvements keep coming. Don't be surprised if one day soon, your next plane turns out to be a plug-in. By Adam Minter is a Bloomberg View columnist, but his opinion is his, not Bloomberg's.

Britain’s 2,400 aerospace companies are specialists in manufacturing engines and complex components for aircraft, which make up 79pc of the sector’s £28.4bn of annual exports. The airliner market is dominated by pan-European Airbus and US-based Boeing, and although neither builds complete aircraft in Britain, both rely on UK-built parts to make their products. Both manufacturers have record order books, meaning that even as they ramp up production rates they have almost a decade’s worth of work in hand, and are reliant on UK aerospace businesses to help them meet demand. Airbus transports wings from its UK plant around the world using 'Beluga' jets Paul Brooks, Santander's head of business development for manufacturing, said: “The UK is 'hardwired' into the global supply chain".  "Our aerospace industry has thrived off the back of its competitive advantage in the production of high-value added technology-intensive products, and we forecast that this will continue. Since 2002, the UK industry has more than doubled overseas sales from £13.2 billion to £28.3 billion, an increase of 114pc," he added. However, Britain’s essential role in the global aerospace industry could come under pressure as a consequence of the Brexit process. For example, Airbus builds the wings for its jets in Britain, with the company’s huge plant in Broughton, North Wales, and exports them to factories around the world. “The concerns around the nature and conditions of any Brexit deal raise serious questions about the next generation of aircraft and where they will be produced,” the report warns. “Airbus could face growing political pressure to bring jobs back to France, Germany and Spain as a result of the [UK's] decision to leave the single market. “Broughton is likely to face competition for wing work from Germany and Spain as it is the most lucrative part of the supply chain and both nations are keen to accelerate their aerospace sectors.” If Britain - which is already in the grip of a skills shortage - loses access to talented engineers and technicians as a result of freedom of movement controls arising from Brexit, Germany and Spain will have their position strengthened when bidding for new aircraft models, the report said. Concerns about protectionist measures in the wake of Brexit are also flagged as a key risk.   Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, the industry is exempt from tariffs, but EEF and Santander caution that “there is a growing concern that competitors could try to encourage governments to find loopholes to raise the cost of production for UK businesses”. Examples of this include EU exemptions on raw materials used to make components being reversed, raising the cost of British-built parts, or customs delays which would slow down the export of components, making the UK a less attractive location for work. A further worry is over Britain’s membership of aerospace certifying authority the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). If Britain creates its own regulatory regime, then manufacturers will still need to have parts authorised by the EASA, raising costs and adding red tape, which would discourage further investment in the sector.

SpaceX CAPE CANAVERAL, FL—An email received by the Observer indicates that SpaceX, the Elon Musk-founded space flight company, will launch a classified payload to support clandestine activities for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). The mission is not listed on SpaceX’s customer manifest. Very little is known about the mission, though the limited public knowledge is consistent with the protocol for NRO activities. We do know that SpaceX is targeting April 30th at 7AM ET for liftoff of the agency’s payload from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. A test fire of a brand new Falcon 9 rocket being used for the delivery is scheduled for April 26th. The payload is, most likely, a spy satellite, due to the long history of these NRO launches and citizen-sleuths who keep close watch on the skies. On the heels of re-flying the world’s first re-useable orbital rocket, this is another milestone for the company in as many weeks and sharpens SpaceX’s competitive edge when vying for lucrative military contracts. This will be the first time the company is exclusively launching a classified payload for the NRO. Previous missions for the agency—which describes itself as “the U.S. Government agency in charge of designing, building, launching, and maintaining America’s intelligence satellites”—have been previously facilitated by veteran military defense contractor (and primary SpaceX competitor) United Launch Alliance. ULA is a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch with NROL-76 now NET April 30, 7 am Eastern Window Open. Static Fire NET April 26. @abbygarrettX unofficial patch: pic.twitter.com/T0UKZM2AEY — Chris B – NSF (@NASASpaceflight) April 7, 2017 “Since its establishment on Aug. 25, 1960, the NRO has been an entirely ‘black’ organization. The Federal Government has never admitted that it exists, and its name is officially secret,” explained a 1985 New York Times article. The initial purpose and objectives of NRO spacecraft are almost never revealed. But later reporting has concluded that the agency, which is based in Fairfax, Virginia, oversees surveillance activities for the Navy, Air Force, NSA, and the Central Intelligence Agency. Satellite images obtained by an NRO satellite in 2012, for instance, show the movement of Syrian troops and artillery around civilian areas that would later be devastated by bombardment. The US Ambassador to Syria during the Obama Administration, Robert Ford, posted the images on facebook during the second year of the Syrian civil war (and subsequent refugee crisis) to argue for intervention by the United Nations Security Council and Arab league states. Satellite images provided by NRO spacecraft showing military mobilization in the Syrian towns of Zabadani and Homs. Ambassador Ford/Facebook “When the United States needs eyes and ears in critical places where no human can reach – be it over the most rugged terrain or through the most hostile territory – it turns to the National Reconnaissance Office,” explains the agency’s website. “We never lose focus on who we are working to protect: our Nation and its citizens.” The Observer was on-site last year for a previous NRO mission that saw the world’s most powerful rocket in operation–the Delta-4 Heavy–launch a secretive payload to a distant orbit. Days after the launch in June of 2016, Dutch satellite tracker Marco Langbroek and Australian astronomer Paul Camilleri discovered the agency’s satellite over the Strait of Malacca–located between the Indonesian Island of Sumatra and the Malaysian Peninsula. According to well-known citizen skywatcher Ted Molczan, the payload delivered during that mission, designated NROL-37, is believed to be a MENTOR satellite equipped with state-of-the-art eavesdropping technology. Molczan also claims that the satellite deployed a football field-sized mesh antenna to capture electronic signals from other satellites, ships at sea, and aircraft. MENTOR was developed with insight from the Central Intelligence Agency and encrypts the captured data before beaming it back to federal authorities in the United States. According to Spaceflightnow, the spacecraft “likely intercept telephone calls, radio signals and missile telemetry transmissions.” SpaceX’s mission for the NRO is designated NROL-76 and was first hinted to during a congressional hearing in 2013 according to SpaceNews. They also reported that NRO director Betty Sapp lauded SpaceX at the GEOINT 2016 conference for “challenging the conventional wisdom about how to build a rocket” and announced that the spy agency has “bought launches from SpaceX.” The NRO previously piggybacked on a SpaceX/NASA orbital demonstration flight of the Falcon 9 in 2010 in which a smaller, agency-owned cubesat was delivered as a secondary payload. In a statement to SpaceNews, an NRO spokesman said they are “anticipating the possibility of SpaceX supporting additional missions based on future competitions” following the launch of NROL-76 at the end of the month. Robin Seemangal has been reporting from the newsroom at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center for the last two years for Observer with bylines also in Popular Science and Wired. He does in-depth coverage of SpaceX launches as well as Elon Musk’s mission to send humans to Mars. Robin has appeared on BBC, Russia Today, NPR‘s Are We There Yet Podcast and radio stations around the world to discuss space exploration. 28.474009 -80.577174 Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA SEE ALSO: This 17-Year-Old Takes Mind-Blowing Photos of Rocket Launches Observer Daily Observer Delivered to Your Inbox Sign Up Submit Must Reads Observer Politics Entertainment Lifestyle Arts Health Contact About Newsletters Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP We noticed you're using an ad blocker.

Julie Johnsson and Roxana Tiron Bloomberg News Published Tuesday, Apr. 11, 2017 12:14PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Apr. 11, 2017 1:31PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print These should be lush times for those who profit from conflict. Global tensions are rising while President Donald Trump promises the most spending on U.S. troops and military hardware since Ronald Reagan’s buildup of the 1980s. Instead, a post-election defence-stock rally is sputtering as concerns grow that dysfunction and division in the Republican-controlled government could thwart that plan. It’s another Trump trade at risk of being undone by congressional leaders ill-schooled in the art of compromise and by fiscal conservatives, who may insist on maintaining spending caps set under President Barack Obama. Lawmakers still haven’t approved a fiscal 2017 budget as a government shutdown looms this month. The easiest solution would be to extend for the full year a temporary measure known as a continuing resolution that holds funding at 2016 levels. Doing so would starve spending for new ships, bombers, missiles and helicopters built by companies like Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. Analyst Douglas Harned offers a blunt assessment: During the next six months to a year, the news for defence investors “is more likely to be bad than good, as it becomes clear that the president and Congress will be unable to bring a budget together that significantly increases defense spending.” Best-Laid Plans The S&P 500’s defence group has notched a 15-per-cent gain since Mr. Trump’s Nov. 8 victory, outpacing the broader market. But half that run-up came in the first week after the election, when big Pentagon spending increases seemed like a slam dunk. The group has been a middling performer on the broader index, which is led by a 34-per-cent gain for casinos and gambling companies. “Irrational exuberance has waned after year-end 2016 euphoria,” Robert Stallard, a defense analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients Monday. “A combination of conservative guidance for this year and the Trump agenda hitting the reality of Congress appear to have flushed out some investors.” Companies that benefit from Trump administration policies that don’t rely on Congress have fared better. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama administration order directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to phase out its use of private lockups. Prison operators CoreCivic Inc. and Geo Group Inc. have risen 126 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively, since the election. Combat Pay The U.S. spends about $600-billion a year on its military, about as much as the next 14 nations combined. Mr. Trump would have to pull off a remarkable political feat for military spending to reach Reaganesque levels without increasing revenue, persuading conservatives to accede to higher deficits. Another, less palatable option: Geopolitical tensions would need to “escalate into an all-out war,” Mr. Harned, senior aerospace and defence analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Despite his promises to stanch the flow of companies to Mexico, relocations have resumed after a post-election pause. Last month, a plan pushed by Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan to end the Affordable Care Act fizzled without a floor vote after seven years of Republican promises. “It raises the question about how strong Speaker Ryan in fact is, or how capable he is of finding an appropriate middle ground,” said Howard Rubel, managing director with Jefferies LLC. “The health-care vote could be a precursor to other embarrassments to the Republican party if they aren’t careful.” Republicans are splintered ahead of the budget showdown. Members of Congress, now on a two-week recess, will have about four days to approve a catch-all omnibus spending bill covering the remainder of fiscal 2017 -- or extend a temporary measure due to expire on April 28 to keep government open. The Trump administration has requested a supplemental spending bill that includes $30-billion for defence and $3-billion for a border wall, at a price of significant non-defense cuts. A compromise defence-spending measure already approved by the House may carry funding for all the other government agencies. Most of the bill is already agreed on, according to Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and veteran member of the Appropriations Committee. Democrats, like Senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Dick Durbin of Illinois, the ranking member on the defense spending panel, indicated they would back it. The budget drama should be in full swing as defense company CEOs present first-quarter results -- and try to temper expectations, according to Ken Herbert, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. “Considering the hype around defence spending under the Trump administration, we see some risk,” Mr. Herbert wrote in a report Monday. “The defence fundamentals will take a few quarters to catch up with expectations,” Military-service chiefs warned Congress last week of dire scenarios should lawmakers resort to another continuing resolution.

Global tensions are rising while President Donald Trump promises the most spending on U.S. troops and military hardware since Ronald Reagan’s buildup of the 1980s. Instead, a post-election defense-stock rally is sputtering as concerns grow that dysfunction and division in the Republican-controlled government could thwart that plan. It’s another Trump trade at risk of being undone by congressional leaders ill-schooled in the art of compromise and by fiscal conservatives, who may insist on maintaining spending caps set under President Barack Obama. Lawmakers still haven’t approved a fiscal 2017 budget as a government shutdown looms this month. The easiest solution would be to extend for the full year a temporary measure known as a continuing resolution that holds funding at 2016 levels. Doing so would starve spending for new ships, bombers, missiles and helicopters built by companies like Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Fresh off a win against protectionism in New York, Premier Kathleen Wynne was in Chicago on Monday to continue the fight. It’s become an urgent battle for Ontario, whose economy depends profoundly on goods and services we sell to states led now by the nationalist and capricious Donald Trump. So far it’s going pretty well, but it might go even better if we practised more of what we’re preaching. Much of the fighting goes on behind the scenes, and overwhelmingly at the state level, where Ontario has to deal with a dozen governors and scores of legislators. Monday, Wynne announced she was meeting with Boeing executives, with Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, with leaders of groups that promote trade and co-operation around the Great Lakes, and with participants in a roundtable led by former U.S. ambassador David Jacobson — none of which took place in public. The New York win was a withdrawal of harsh new rules that would have made it very difficult for the state government there to buy Ontario products for anything. Gov. Andrew Cuomo proudly included the rules in the state budget he proposed to his state legislature in January. “This initiative will reinvest in the talent that made this state and this country what it is today and strengthen our role as a global leader in manufacturing for years to come,” Cuomo said. There were a bunch of exceptions — the head of a state agency could certify that buying American wasn’t in the public interest, for instance, and put the rules aside — but overall they’d be the toughest such rules in America. Related After $30B exchanged in trade in 2016, Wynne ‘pleased’ with N.Y dropping Buy American policy Liberals to consider possible retaliation against Trump’s ‘Buy American’ policies: document Ontario warns New York consequences of Buy American would harm state businesses Wynne, her cabinet, business leaders and diplomats all went to work to explain to New York legislators why this would be a problem: how much stuff New York buys from Ontario ($17.7 billion worth each year), how much stuff Ontario buys from New York ($12.6 billion), how badly screwed-up our relationship could get. Car parts and raw materials go across that border all the time in tightly integrated supply chains. In successive iterations, the protectionism in the budget bill got ground down harder and harder until by the time the legislature sent a final version to Cuomo to be signed, the Buy American provisions were simply gone. Cuomo’s a pretty liberal Democrat and a naturally kindred political spirit for Wynne; the Illinois governor’s a Republican and so’s Rick Snyder, the governor of Michigan with whom Wynne has spent hours in the past six months. The swing-state Republicans will be the key to resisting protectionism from the U.S. federal government. Appealing as it is, protectionism in procurement is crummy government policy. By definition, it means favouring more expensive, lower-quality vendors because they happen to be nearby, when you could get more for your public dollars with wide-open competition. Toronto sole-sourced a huge contract for new subway cars to Bombardier a decade ago, partly on the grounds that it meant employment for fellow Ontarians in Thunder Bay. Competitor Siemens alleged Toronto overpaid by as much as $100 million — though there was no bidding, so it’s hard to know for sure. Toronto followed up in 2009 with another massive contract for streetcars that’s already a legendary transit fiasco of delays and poor assembly. And now Bombardier and Metrolinx, the provincial agency that handles big-picture transit in greater Toronto, are squabbling in court over whether delays in filling yet another order are Bombardier’s fault or Metrolinx’s for changing its specifications. One reason for favouring Bombardier is that Ontario has its own Buy Canadian rule. It’s not as stringent as the one Wynne fought in New York, but it still requires that 25 per cent of a large transit procurement be spent on Canadian goods and services. Ottawa has a whole light-rail assembly operation on Belfast Road now thanks to this, putting together trains we’re buying from Alstom, a French company. We had to send Canadians to an Alstom plant in, ironically, southwestern New York to learn how to do the assembling. The New York plant “builds” the trains before sending them up here in pieces to be put together like Ikea furniture. It’s providing work for Canadians, no question. How sustainable the business of assembling a particular model of train is long-term, and how much less tax money we might have needed to spend if we just let the New Yorkers tighten the bolts themselves, those are different questions. “We can always accomplish more by working together and today, Gov. Rauner and I reaffirmed our commitment to the foundation of our economic partnership — free trade,” Wynne said after seeing the governor in Chicago. We need them and they need us. Living the free-trade ethos we promote to others would help that crucial case. Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Main | Polls Open in S.C. Senate 3 GOP Primary » Tuesday Apr112017 Teachers Learn to Use Gardening Science at Clemson Event Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 9:08AM Teachers from Upstate South Carolina, including Anderson, gathered in Greenville recently to learn more about how to use school gardens to sow student knowledge about healthy eating and garden-based science concepts. About 30 educators from 18 schools met with Extension agents and community partners to learn more about how to use school gardens to teach their students the healthy benefits of eating fresh vegetables they grow themselves. (See images) The event last month at the Clemson Extension office was part of an initiative funded by grants from Boeing. “Research shows that if children grow it, they will eat it,” said Amy Dabbs, an area horticulture agent and Master Gardener coordinator from the Charleston Extension office. All of the teachers who participated in the event have completed an online training course and now have gardens at their schools, said Patricia Whitener, a Greenville County 4-H agent. As part of the training, the teachers received pre-packaged gardening kits; calendars with planting, harvesting and crop rotation schedules; and vegetable transplants from Wabi Sabi Farms. Laura Bell from Centerville Elementary School in Anderson said students at the school have learned about science and developing social skills by growing a garden. “Some of the students who planted the garden at our school are in the special education program,” said Bell. “We also have students in the English as a second language program and students who have autism or are learning-disabled. This program has been great because it gives these students an opportunity to be leaders. They are growing vegetables and sharing these vegetables with other students. It’s great to watch how this gardening project has our students to interact with one another and how it has given students who might otherwise not have opportunities to be leaders be able to engage in a project that has campus-wide recognition.” The first-grade class at Centerville Elementary School is using the garden as part of their science curriculum. The teachers also learned about food safety and the Seed Fairy program from Zack Snipes, commercial horticulture Extension agent for Charleston. The Seed Fairy program provides seeds to school and community-based garden projects throughout South Carolina thanks to a donation from Botanical Interests. These donated seeds are distributed from the Clemson Extension office in Charleston and Greenville counties for use in nonprofit, school and community garden projects. Visit here for more information. Participants also learned about services provided by Clemson Extension Master Gardeners around the state, as well as the South Carolina 4-H Small Garden Project, a composting program provided by Greater Greenville Sanitation and the Ag in the Classroom program provided by the South Carolina Farm Bureau. The program was designed to teach educators the horticulture principles so they can be successful building and growing school gardens. The program was developed in partnership with the College of Charleston’s Food Systems Change Initiative, a multiagency partnership that works to improve student learning and health outcomes with funding from Boeing South Carolina.

In particular, Arconic suggests that all shareholders ask Elliott questions on these important points: After three directors on Arconic’s Board were added last year at Elliott’s recommendation, Elliott has now nominated four more directors.Question: How are other shareholders’ interests served by giving Elliott, a 13.2% shareholder, the privilege of nominating seven of Arconic’s 13 directors? Elliott suggests that Arconic’s Board install Larry Lawson as the new CEO of Arconic. Mr. Lawson has a non-compete agreement with his prior employer that legally restricts him from serving as Arconic’s CEO. In fact, Mr. Lawson’s prior employer has stated that he is already in violation of the agreement due to his involvement with Elliott.Questions: Does Elliott believe that Mr. Lawson should violate his contractual commitment to his prior employer? Is Mr. Lawson treating his prior employer ethically by violating his non-compete agreement by offering to work for Arconic? Mr. Lawson is on Elliott’s payroll. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification for breaching his non-compete agreement. In total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years, regardless of whether Mr. Lawson becomes Arconic’s CEO.Questions: Aren’t other shareholders’ interests best served by assigning the full Board the responsibility of selecting the CEO? Why should that be Elliott’s privilege? How would Elliott propose to resolve the apparent conflict of interest caused by appointing a CEO to whom it is paying tens of millions of dollars on the side? When Elliott began its proxy contest, it produced an analysis indicating that it thought Arconic’s Global Rolled Products (“GRP”) division, which generated EBITDA of $577 million in 2016, could increase its EBITDA by $750 million. Within a matter of days, Elliott issued multiple revisions of its analysis and now seemingly believes that EBITDA can only be expanded by $245 million.ii Questions: Does the same prescription apply to a division that has an opportunity to increase EBITDA by 42% as one that could more than double its EBITDA? In light of Elliott’s admitted, significant analytical error, how can shareholders rely on Elliott’s analysis or plans for Arconic’s future? Elliott has compared Arconic’s Engineered Products Solutions (“EPS”) business to that of Precision Castparts (“PCC”). However, EPS is significantly smaller than PCC and does not participate in some of the higher margin segments in which PCC is a market leader. Cowen and Companyiii recently published a report noting “the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar.”Questions: Are Elliott’s conclusions about margin potential and underperformance well informed? How specifically does Elliott suggest that EPS, despite being much smaller and not participating in some high margin segments, close the margin gap to PCC? Klaus Kleinfeld was appointed as CEO of Alcoa Inc. when the Company was highly levered and the price of aluminum was near an all-time high. In the nine months thereafter, aluminum prices collapsed and Alcoa Inc.’s stock price fell dramatically. Since then, shareholders of Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, have seen Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) of 182%iv, as the Company generated $8 billion in shareholder wealth in eight years.i Alcoa Inc. shareholder return also outperformed both the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the overall S&P Metals & Mining Index since 2009.v Alcoa Inc. was included in these two indices from 2009 until the separation in November 2016, and unlike the broad S&P 500 index, these indices include companies where earnings power and share prices are highly correlated to underlying commodity prices, making these indices the appropriate benchmark for comparison.Questions: How can Elliott ignore the impact of the global financial crisis when evaluating Alcoa Inc.’s shareholder returns? How does providing a comparison to (i) broad market indices that are not directly levered to commodity pricing or (ii) companies that were not comparable to Alcoa Inc. for the vast majority of the time period provide shareholders with any insight into Alcoa Inc.’s relative performance? Shouldn’t Elliott focus on relative performance to indices that include large-scale commodity producers with share price correlation to commodity markets (i.e. S&P Metals & Mining and S&P 500 Metals & Mining indices)? Elliott has commended Alcoa Inc. for separating its business into two publicly traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. Indeed, Elliott said that Alcoa Inc. would not be fully valued unless the Company took action to split its businesses into two public companies. Now, however, Elliott is using TSR data that deliberately excludes the value created by the separation by measuring Mr. Kleinfeld’s performance (and the Alcoa Inc. stock performance) only until the day before the split into two public companies.Questions: Why should shareholders ignore the value created by the successful separation of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation in calculating the value created by the current leadership team? Isn’t it disingenuous to suggest that shareholders ignore the successful culmination of the strategic transformation of Alcoa Inc. that was executed by Mr. Kleinfeld and the rest of the management team under the oversight of the Board? The current management team, led by Mr. Kleinfeld, has a strong track record of performance that has been demonstrated before, during and after completing the highly complex separation of Alcoa Inc. Following actions taken to save Alcoa Inc. during the global financial crisis by reducing costs and strengthening the balance sheet, the management team executed a complex transformation of the upstream and downstream businesses. The transformation built Arconic into the company it is today, completing divestitures, organic growth projects and acquisitions to focus on the high growth, high value aerospace and automotive markets. Leadership created a successful culture of innovation and technology, with a strong focus on cost competitiveness and established deep customer partnerships that are the lifeblood of Arconic. Arconic’s major customers, including Airbus, Boeing, GE and United Technologies have all expressed their strong support for Mr. Kleinfeld and his continued leadership of Arconic.Question: Why aren’t shareholders’ interests best served by a management team with a strong and proven execution-focused track record? Wouldn’t critical customer relationships be jeopardized by a change in leadership and strategy as Elliott is proposing? Arconic has a substantially new Board; seven of its 12 independent directors have joined the Board in the last 15 months. Three of those directors were added at the recommendation of Elliott. Directors have met with Elliott, other shareholders, customers, suppliers and employees. The Board has engaged in extensive analysis of Elliott’s claims and of the strategy, performance and leadership of Arconic.Questions: Why should shareholders doubt the judgment of highly qualified independent directors who have worked diligently to evaluate Elliott’s claims and have access to information that Elliott does not? Why aren’t shareholders best served by these independent directors, a majority of whom are new, three of whom were recommended by Elliott, and all of whom concluded that Arconic has the right strategy and the right leadership? Information regarding the Company’s track record and plan for continued value creation is available in its presentation to shareholders dated March 27, 2017.

Dissemination of Company Information Arconic intends to make future announcements regarding Company developments and financial performance through its website at www.arconic.com. Forward–Looking Statements This communication contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “guidance,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “sees,” “should,” “targets,” “will,” “would,” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that reflect Arconic’s expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts relating to the growth of end markets and potential share gains; statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; and statements about Arconic’s strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: (a) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (b) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Arconic; (c) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated from restructuring programs and productivity improvement, cash sustainability, technology advancements, and other initiatives; (d) changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (e) Arconic’s inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (f) the impact of cyber attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (g) political, economic, and regulatory risks in the countries in which Arconic operates or sells products; (h) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation; and (i) the other risk factors discussed in Arconic’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Arconic disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this communication is derived from Arconic’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconic’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume. _______________________________ i Value represents the aggregate change in market value of the total shares outstanding of Alcoa Inc. from March 18, 2009 through March 1, 2017, plus dividends. Analysis begins on March 18, 2009, the day prior to Alcoa Inc.’s recapitalization. Management and the Board took decisive action to stabilize Alcoa Inc. in the face of extreme market headwinds. On March 19, 2009, Alcoa Inc. priced $906M of common equity and $575M of convertible debt, which ensured Alcoa Inc. would have adequate liquidity to survive the 2009 financial crisis.

(NYSE: BA) airplanes or other investments, allowing Trump to claim he negotiated a deal to help the economy," Jacques deLisle, professor of Chinese Law at the University of Pennsylvania, told Bloomberg yesterday (April 5). "One of the few things the Chinese president could easily offer [Trump] is more Chinese investment in infrastructure and America's manufacturing heartlands, whose voters propelled the U.S. president to victory in last November's election," wrote Financial Times' Beijing bureau chief Tom Mitchell this morning. But President Trump's acceptance of these economic enticements may come at the expense of U.S. allies in Asia… The Cost of a Deal with China: The Safety of U.S. Allies "Economic deals are fleeting," wrote Michael Fuchs, a former State Department deputy secretary and current research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress Institute, in The Guardian today. "Security frameworks take decades to build, but minutes to squander." Fuchs explained that if Xi offers packages of economic investments in the United States, he may very well ask that that the U.S. roll back its military presence in the Pacific in return… Specifically, the Chinese president could make the following requests: That Trump reduce the number of military exercises it carries out on the Korean peninsula That Trump attempt to restrain U.S. ally Japan in the East China Sea That the U.S. either reduce or halt its "freedom of navigation" exercises in the South China Sea Agreeing to these measures could result in our own allies doubting America's reliability, leaving them instead with the message that we value economic deals more than their safety. And a diminished U.S. presence in each of the aforementioned regions – the East China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea – could compromise our allies' strongholds there. Up Next China thinks it can push the United States and its allies out of Asia altogether to secure its energy riches for itself. Thanks to a small $6 U.S. defense contractor with top-secret technology, the Pentagon has a plan to stop China dead in its tracks. Click here for the full briefing.

Lightsabers — the favored weapon of the Jedi in “Star Wars” films — will remain in the fictional realm for now, but after decades of development, laser weapons are here and are being deployed on military vehicles and planes. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon — all the big defense players — are developing prototypes for the Pentagon. The navy has since 2014 been testing a 30-kilowatt laser on one of its warships, the USS Ponce. Lockheed Martin has just announced a 60-kilowatt laser weapon that soon will be installed on an army truck for operational testing against mortars and small drones. The weapon can take out a drone from a distance of about 460 meters by keeping its beam locked onto the target for a few seconds, Jim Murdoch, an international business development director at Lockheed, told reporters this week. But unlike in the movies, the laser beam is invisible to the naked eye. By focusing the beam on a target, the technology rapidly heats the inside of an incoming mortar round, causing it to explode midair. An impressive feat considering the round is moving at hundreds of miles per hour. The laser weapon can also pierce the outer skin of a drone, taking out key circuits and making it crash. For the moment, the lasers being tested are all of about this same power. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, sees that relatively small output increasing rapidly. Within just a few years, he expects far more powerful prototypes of more than 150 kilowatts. Such a laser could knock out a missile from the side, where it is most vulnerable. He said special operations forces want to test such a system by 2020 on an AC-130 gunship that specializes in ground support for troops. And within six to eight years, U.S. forces could begin using laser systems of more than 300 kilowatts, he added. That degree of power could knock out an incoming missile head-on. Eventually, reality will increasingly catch up with fiction. The U.S. military is also weighing the possibility of mounting lasers on drones flying at very high altitudes, making them capable of shooting down ballistic missiles shortly after launch. Another bonus for the military from lasers is the promise of seemingly unending and cheap firepower. Unlike conventional canons that need shells, laser canons are limited only by the amount of electricity that can be generated. Gunzinger deems lasers as especially promising on warplanes, which could potentially get an unlimited reservoir of firepower to defend against adversaries’ missiles. “An aircraft doesn’t have to return to base to upload more weapons. It could refuel and continue to operate with its nearly unlimited magazine,” he said. But before laser technology can be integrated into combat planes, it must first be shrunk in size. Currently engineers are running into physical limitations on how much portable power can be produced and ways of cooling the technology. Lockheed wants to increase the power of its truck-mounted laser. “For a vehicle like this, there will be some engineering limits,” said Murdoch. “We will run out of space … that’s the kind of challenge we are working.” But industry reps and military officials say there’s only one thing stopping lasers from garnering widespread operational use: government funding. Congress is cautious. Lawmakers recall a lengthy program that cost more than $5 billion in which a Boeing 747 was retrofitted to carry a laser gun supposedly capable of shooting down enemy missiles. The program was scrapped in 2012 over concerns it could never be operationally viable. The laser beam used in that technology was generated by chemicals and was not strong enough to take out a missile.

[Photo/China Daily]  The rapid growth of China's business aviation market has attracted aircraft makers to increase their service offerings tailored for the country, where more than 600 business jets, worth $18 billion, are being operated. "China has become the second-largest business jet market, and it also enjoys the fastest growth in the world," Liao Xuefeng, chairman and CEO of China Business Aviation Group, said while attending the annual three-day Asian Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition, which opens on Tuesday in Shanghai. To boost their market share, major aircraft manufacturers are rolling out new plans to upgrade their services and offer products tailored for the Chinese market. At ABACE 2017 on Monday, Airbus Corporate Jets announced a new initiative, or Easystart, to offer tailored support to buyers of its corporate jets already in service. There are more than 180 Airbus corporate jets in service globally, with about 20 in China, according to Airbus chief operating officer of customers John Leahy. Easystart will help buyers understand how an Airbus corporate jet can perform on their key missions, how it can be an attractively affordable upgrade, and how services, such as training, support and upgrades, are available to ensure a smooth entry into service. Similarly, Boeing Business Jets recently signed an agreement with Aircraft Maintenance & Engineering Corp Beijing to serve as an official BBJ warranty service center. The BBJ and Ameco agreement allows BBJ customers based in China customized and fast support for their aircraft. Boeing Business Jets is seeing unprecedented growth in China, where the fleet size has tripled over the past five years, having 29 BBJ aircraft in operation. Also on Monday, Malta-based VistaJet, a company specializing in premium long-range private jet travel, launched its sales platform on WeChat, a popular social media platform in China. The launch of this service stems from the 11 percent year-on-year passenger growth in China last year, and 17 percent of its global customer base is represented by China, according to Ian Moore, chief commercial officer of VistaJet. Bombardier Tianjin service center was launched on Friday, marking the operation of Bombardier Business Aircraft's first service center in China, and its eighth globally. "With a growing fleet of more than 110 aircraft in China out of 280 in Asia, Bombardier Business Aircraft's Service Centers offer comprehensive capabilities and flexibility to our customers. Our priority is to ensure that we are ready to support our customers wherever their needs arise," said Lanny Schindelmeiser, general manager of Bombardier Tianjin Aviation Services Co Ltd. "In a number of ways, business aviation is evolving and growing in Asia, just as ABACE continues to evolve and grow as an Asian show," said National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen. "The industry is becoming ever-more established in this region, and that means it will continue to become increasingly important in China, across the Asia-Pacific and around the world," added Bolen. ABACE 2017 has more than 170 exhibitors, the largest number ever at the event, and showcases 35 aircraft. Follow China.org.cn on Twitter and Facebook to join the conversation.

(Zach Gibson/Getty Images) Monday, 10 Apr 2017 08:43 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Opponents of a proposal to create a U.S. border tax on imported goods are targeting lawmakers in their home states for the next two weeks while Congress is in recess, according to organizers of the lobbying effort. The anti-border tax coalition, known as Americans for Affordable Products, includes large corporations that require imports like automakers and retail giants like Target , Best Buy and Walmart. The tax opponents will target 40 members of Congress in 11 states, said coalition spokesman Joshua Baca. "We're talking to businesses, local associations, having a frank conversation with them about how dumb this idea is," Baca said. His group argues the proposal will raise consumer prices. As part of a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed lowering the corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, imposing a 20 percent tax on imports and excluding export revenue from taxable income. The proposal has some strong corporate backers who say it will boost American jobs and not raise prices, including companies that do considerable amount of exporting, such as Boeing, Caterpillar and Pfizer. The anti-border tax group is planning to host a town hall meeting next week in Nevada with Republican Senator Dean Heller, which will also be co-sponsored by local business groups and Americans For Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the Republican Koch brothers which also opposes the border tax. Town hall meetings have gained more attention recently as events featuring Republican lawmakers have been targeted by activists to voice their opposition to several proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act which widened health insurance coverage for about 20 million Americans. Additionally, the anti-tax group will hold a discussion in Ohio with Republican Representative David Joyce, where he will hear from local furniture store owners who would be affected by a border tax, Baca said. Concurrently, members of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is comprised of large retailers like Autozone , Walgreens Boot Alliance, Inc. and J.C. Penny Company, are using the recess to give members of Congress behind-the-scenes tours of both their headquarters and stores in an effort to persuade them against the tax, spokesman Brian Dodge said. Both groups are hoping to make more voters aware of their position and are armed with an opinion poll by a pollster who also works for several Republican members of Congress. The poll, shared first with Reuters and which was conducted with funding from opponents of the tax, found 63 percent of voters are against the tax, including 70 percent of women. Additionally, the poll makes the case that 56 percent of voters say they would be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who supports the tax proposal.  © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Jeff Mason and Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with "something else." At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for them. "For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday. "That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many," he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the "Financial CHOICE Act" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N); Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo (PEP.N); Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co (BA.N); Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM (IBM.N); and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co (GE.N). The business leaders are part of Trump's "Strategy and Policy Forum" that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. "NAFTA is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you," he said.

Fed's Kashkari sees room for improvement on inflation, jobs Neel Kashkari, the chief of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve who was the lone dissenter on the Fed's rate hike last month, repeated Tuesday his view that there is still slack in the labour market and that inflation is still lower than it should be.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) New exhibit at flight museum explores the factors that lead to war Dan Catchpole Tue Apr 11th, 2017 10:10pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — You are the head of an African nation where people are dying of thirst. Radical rebels are demanding you step down. What do you do? Negotiate? Mobilize your military? Nothing? The clock is ticking. Thousands of lives — maybe even your own — hang in the balance. The hypothetical scenario is part of the Flying Heritage &Combat Armor Museum’s effort to help visitors explore the factors and decisions that can lead to war. The exhibit “Why War?” unpacks the causes and consequences of armed conflict. The permanent installation opened in early March at the museum’s Paine Field location. “This isn’t People magazine history,” said Adrian Hunt, the collection’s executive director. “This is based on serious scholarship.” Design consultants and museum staff translated that high-level research into material that is simple enough for grade school children to grasp without gutting the topic’s complexity. Greg Cashman, a retired political science professor at Salisbury University in Maryland, guided the exhibit. The installation focuses on the most common factors, identified by decades of empirical research and in case studies, said Cashman, who has spent more than 20 years studying the topic. His textbook “What Causes War?” is read by college students across the country. Those factors include national rivalry, territorial disputes, power shifts and domestic turmoil. Hunt contacted Cashman after reading the book. Cashman said he never expected to work on a project such as this exhibit. “I wasn’t sure how they’d make it work,” he said. “It’s really quite amazing.” The museum hired Seattle-based Belle &Wissell to design the exhibit. The exhibit includes giant touchscreen monitors that allow visitors to explore the causes of various conflicts involving the United States. Then there are the hot-seat scenarios where visitors play national leader in a series of hypothetical scenarios. The collection’s owner, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, wanted the exhibit to talk about the consequences of war, Hunt said. The exhibit includes a room on nuclear war with replicas of Fat Man and Little Boy — the two atomic bombs dropped by U.S. forces on Japan during World War II. On a wall are copies of a letter from Alfred Einstein to President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 discussing the possibilities of developing nuclear weapons and a few pages from Major Robert Lewis’ eyewitness account of dropping the first atomic bomb, Little Boy, on Hiroshima on Aug. 6. After the bomb exploded above the city, the B-29 Enola Gay turned away, and “there in front of our eyes was without a doubt the greatest explosion man has ever witnessed,” wrote Lewis, the Boeing airplane’s co-pilot. Allen owns the originals of the Einstein letter and Lewis account, which are archived for safekeeping. In another room, visitors can explore the human side of conflict, including sculptures crafted out of artillery shells during World War I. Visitors can digitally thumb through interactive displays recounting the wartime experiences of children, women and men. The exhibit is “an explicit change in the direction of the work we do,” Hunt said. It is meant to attract younger visitors and provide context for the painstakingly restored tanks, aircraft and other war machines on display at the museum at Paine Field south of Everett. The museum is looking to add another hangar to accommodate its growing collection. Its two hangars are already crowded with 45 big war machines, including 26 aircraft and 19 tanks, vehicles and weapon systems. “We’re not interested in being the best museum in Everett or in the Pacific Northwest,” he said. “We’re just interested in being the best, period.” Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com; Twitter: @dcatchpole.   A mural shows soldiers watching children jumping rope as Hunter Thompson, 17, front, listens to war stories next to his father, Jason, in the Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum’s new exhibit, “Why War?” on Thursday in Everett.

EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all for being here.  Very much appreciate it.  I want to thank Steve Schwarzman for putting together this very incredible group of world-class business leaders.  That’s what you are.  Also, joining us are Secretary Betsy DeVos, Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary Elaine Chao, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, and my budget director, Mick Mulvaney.  That’s an easy job.  Where’s Mick?  (Laughter.)  Such an easy job.  It’s the easiest job of anybody in the government — right, Mick? At the top of our agenda is the creation of great high-paying jobs for American workers.  And we’ve made a lot of process.  You see what’s going on; you see the numbers.  We’ve created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it’s going to really start catching on now, because some of the things that we’ve done are big league and they are catching on. Already, we’ve created more than almost 600,000 jobs.  And yesterday, Toyota just announced that it will invest more than $1.3 billion — it’s probably going to be $1.9 billion — into its Georgetown, Kentucky plant, an investment that would not have been made if we didn’t win the election.   We have a lot of work to do.  In the last two decades, our nation has lost a third of its manufacturing jobs, and our business tax is one of the highest in the world.  It actually is, of developed countries, the single highest tax anywhere in the world.  For too long, we’ve punished production in America and rewarded companies for leaving our country.  And we’re going to reverse that.  We would reward companies, give them incentives to leave.  NAFTA is a disaster.  It’s been a disaster from the day it was devised.  And we’re going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you. My administration has already taken historic action to unleash job creation.  We’ve signed dozens of bills and executive actions to reduce federal overreach and expand domestic production.   On the environment, we’re going to be very, very careful on the environment.  It’s very important to me and the administration.  But we’ve allowed a lot of companies to go back to work.  They were being restricted; their jobs were being restricted.  We’ve unleashed a lot of companies, especially right now in the energy sector — you see what’s going on there.  It was impossible for people to do what they had to do, and now they can do it.  It’s all done.   We’re also working to modernize our economy and harness the full potential of women in the workforce, which is crucial to our economic success.  Economic confidence is sweeping the nation.  You saw the new survey that came out.  It’s at 93 — which is the highest it’s ever been — 93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future.  It was a 27 percent increase over two months ago when it was also high because of the administration, and much higher than it’s ever been — 93 percent.  Highest it’s ever been. This is just the beginning.  We’re going to reduce taxes.  We’re going to eliminate wasteful regulations, which we’ve already done — probably 25 percent.  You can take a look at Dodd-Frank.  For the bankers in the room, they’ll be very happy because we’re really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else.  But that will be the minimum.  But we’re doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many.   And we’re going to put many millions of people back to work.  The banks will be able to lend again.  So many people come to see me, I see them all the time — small businesses — they’re unable to borrow from banks.  They never had a problem five, six, seven, ten years ago.  They had great bankers.  They had great relationships.  Now they can’t borrow.  And we’re going to let the banks loan them money, and they can build their businesses.  So with your help and insights, we will use the private sector innovation to drive job creation and reform government.  A lot of reform.  We have a computer system in this country that’s 40 years old.  So when you hear we’re hacked and we’re this, that — we’re like easy targets.  And one of the things we’re doing, in fact — we’re working with a very, very wonderful woman from IBM, and others — and others, okay?  (Laughter.)  Many others.  It’s like when I said to Lockheed, I like the F-35 fighter jet, but then I said, but I also like the Boeing F-18.  Okay?  (Laughter.)  So I love your computers, but we’re also looking at others, all right? But we are.  We’re going to have a massive program to modernize our equipment — ideally get brand-new equipment.  The cost of maintaining our computers is a number that is so high that it’s not even a believable number.  Now, I’ve heard anywhere — is this possible? — from $39 billion to $89 billion a year.  Is that even possible?  That’s for keeping our computers updated and running.  And I think we can buy a whole new system for less money than that, wouldn’t you say?  I mean, I hope so.  We’ll give you $10 billion right now — modernize it.  (Laughter.)  So I want to thank everybody for being here.  I know most of you.  You really are the top.  And I want to thank my friend, Jack Welch, for being with us too.  I’ve known Jack so long.  We did deals together, right?  Trump International — a big success — and the other one on Park Avenue.  We had great success together with your real estate group who are terrific people.  Dale Fry and everybody — right?  Terrific.  And John.  So I just want to thank you.  You’ve been a special guy for a long time.   And we’ll get down to business.  Maybe before the media leaves, we can go around the room, and we’ll just introduce.  We all know Steve, and I want to thank you, Steve, for putting the group together. MR. SCHWARZMAN:  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Would you like to say something while all those cameras are running? MR. SCHWARZMAN:  I think we should say that we’ve had a really interesting day so far.  What we did is we divided into five groups, meeting with each of the five Secretaries that the President mentioned.  It’s an open discussion.  The Secretaries presented what they were trying to achieve, and we had several people from the forum meeting with them and making comments on what they were doing to hopefully make their jobs better.   We’ve been looking at trade, education and workforce development, energy and the environment, regulatory reform, and infrastructure.  All these things are really important, and we’re focused.  The people in the administration are also focused.  And working together, hopefully we’ll have a bunch of really good outcomes.

Fiji Time: 7:05 PM on Wednesday 12 April Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Border tax target Reuters Wednesday, April 12, 2017 OPPONENTS of a proposal to create a US border tax on imported goods are targeting lawmakers in their home states for the next two weeks while Congress is in recess, according to organisers of the lobbying effort. The anti-border tax coalition, known as Americans for Affordable Products, includes large corporations that require imports like automakers and retail giants like Target (TGT.N), Best Buy (BBY.N) and Walmart (WMT.N). The tax opponents will target 40 members of Congress in 11 states, said coalition spokesman Joshua Baca. "We're talking to businesses, local associations, having a frank conversation with them about how dumb this idea is," Mr Baca said. His group argues the proposal will raise consumer prices. As part of a total overhaul of the US tax code, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed lowering the corporate income tax to 20 per cent from 35 per cent, imposing a 20 per cent tax on imports and excluding export revenue from taxable income. The proposal has some strong corporate backers who say it will boost American jobs and not raise prices, including companies that do considerable amount of exporting, such as Boeing (BA.N), Caterpillar (CAT.N) and Pfizer (PFE.N). The anti-border tax group is planning to host a town hall meeting next week in Nevada with Republican Senator Dean Heller, which will also be co-sponsored by local business groups and Americans For Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the Republican Koch brothers which also opposes the border tax. Town hall meetings have gained more attention recently as events featuring Republican lawmakers have been targeted by activists to voice their opposition to several proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act which widened health insurance coverage for about 20 million Americans. Additionally, the anti-tax group will hold a discussion in Ohio with Republican Representative David Joyce, where he will hear from local furniture store owners who would be affected by a border tax, Mr Baca said.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with "something else." At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for them. "For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday. "That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many," he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the "Financial CHOICE Act" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo ; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co ; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM ; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co . The business leaders are part of Trump's "Strategy and Policy Forum" that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. "NAFTA is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you," he said.

Since then, the airline has spread its wings far and wide. And to mark the special date the president and CEO of ANA Holdings Inc., Shinya Katanozaka, spoke at Tokyo American Club to members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan about the DNA of ANA and the challenges of the international airline business. TAKING WING “When I joined ANA in 1979, Japan Airlines (JAL) was the only Japanese airline that was allowed to offer scheduled international service,” Katanozaka began. “ANA had been limited to the domestic market. It wasn’t until 1986 that we were finally able to launch our service to international areas.” At the time, Katanozaka was in his seventh year at ANA, assigned to the corporate planning department in Tokyo. He had a “front row seat as ANA broke through the one-international-airline policy barrier.” But it was not a turbulence-free flight. Katanozaka explained that ANA’s international passenger business operated in the red for 18 years after takeoff. “There was talk of pulling out during that difficult period,” he said. “But successive ANA presidents believed in the value of this business, and I, too, stood by that belief consistently.” The merger of JAL and Japan Air System Co., Ltd. in 2004, along with the expansion of the Shinkansen network and a population decline, stymied ANA’s domestic growth. But, the airline persevered. “ANA now serves 42 cities in North America, Europe, and Asia,” Katanozaka said. “And with 65 routes, our international flights are now a major pillar of our business; so I would say that we definitely made the right choice.” FLYOVER After a decade of perseverance, in 2010, through ANA’s resolve and against government policy, Haneda Airport regained its role as an international hub. Along with financial challenges came global political and social ones. Katanozaka named five main issues that have impacted ANA’s business: natural disasters such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in 2011; instances of terrorism such as the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States; conflicts such as the Gulf War; epidemics such as those of SARS and avian flu; and political instability such as that caused by Brexit and the recent US presidential election. “Today’s world has been more difficult to forecast, and ANA must be vigilant because these kinds of [challenges] can have a big impact on our business,” he explained. Nevertheless, group revenues have continued to rise under Katanozaka’s guidance. Including the full-service carrier ANA and the two low-cost carriers (LCCs) Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air, there are a total of 80 groups under ANA Holdings Inc. Group revenues for the 2016 fiscal year were about ¥1.8 trillion, with domestic passenger revenue topping ¥700 billion and international passenger revenue reaching ¥500 billion. Katanozaka attributes a core part of ANA’s success to the United States. “We now serve 11 cities in North America,” he said, highlighting the benefits of ANA’s partnership with United Airlines, Boeing, GE, Pratt & Whitney, and others. NON-STOP Looking ahead, Katanozaka outlined a mid-term strategy comprising three pillars: “The first is the growth of our international flight operations; the second is the expansion of the group’s two LCCs; the third is a strategy to target resort markets.” The Japanese government’s goal of 40 million visitors by 2020 is a policy he described as a “strong tail wind” for the company. Introducing new routes — something Katanozaka has strongly advocated since becoming president of ANA Holdings in 2015 — is vital to achieving this goal. Globalization is key for the growth of both the airline and the United States, Katanozaka concluded. “Protectionism and anti-globalization seem to be recent trends around the world, but airlines such as ANA can demonstrate the value of the free movement of people, products, and money, and help overcome those close-minded views.” Custom Media publishes The Journal for the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan.

Kim Hong / AFP/Getty Images Share Adjust Comment Print The Conservative critics for Public Services and Procurement, MPs Alupa Clarke and Kelly McCauley, put forward a motion today to try to get more information from the Liberal government on the fighter jet procurement. They moved the following motion: “That, the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates invite the Minister of National Defence to appear before the Committee no later than on Tuesday, May 30, 2017, to substantiate the use of the exception contained in subsection 3(1)(g) of the Government Contracts Regulations regarding fighter jet procurement; and that every effort be made to ensure that the appearance of the Minister be televised.” The Conservatives, however, have complained that debate on this motion was shut down twice by the Liberal majority on the committee. “The Liberals have once again used their majority on the Committee to shut down a much needed study of their decision to sole-source 18 Super Hornets from Boeing,” Clarke and McCauley said in a statement. Opposition parties, they noted, have repeatedly asked for proof of what the Liberals have called a ‘capability gap’ in fighter jets. That capability gap has been used to justify the purchase of the interim fleet of Super Hornets. “When we asked the Parliamentary Secretary for Public Services and Procurement to show us the evidence used to justify sole-sourcing the contract, he told the House that the Minister of National Defence would provide answers,” the two Conservative MPs noted. “But when we asked the Minister of National Defence to appear before the committee to supply that information, Liberal MPs shut down the discussion without debate – twice.” The Conservatives allege the Liberals are trying to hide details of the upcoming purchase. The Liberal government has responded that the capability gap was caused by the mishandling of the fighter jet procurement by the previous Conservative government.   Boeing Company sponsored Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates Super Hornet Russian aircraft to fly over Canada next week on pre-approved observation...

Their recovery from a price collapse that sent the industry spiraling into crisis is delivering a fresh challenge — renewed scrutiny from major investors eager to magnify returns. Billionaires Paul Singer, Alisher Usmanov and Anil Agarwal are among those to add holdings this year after a rebound in profits from the lows of 2015 and 2016. Mining companies’ management will have to adapt to a more critical eye and greater public notice as their businesses become more compelling to investors, according to Brenton Saunders, a Sydney-based investment analyst and portfolio manager at BT Investment Management Ltd. “Everybody is being questioned,” Saunders said by phone. “Investors have grown up a little in the post-supercycle period, in terms of the way they evaluate strategy.” BT Investment manages about A$87 billion ($65 billion) of assets and holds shares in BHP Billiton Ltd., which is fending off a three-pronged proposal from Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. that the hedge fund believes will deliver a 50 percent lift to shareholder returns. Restive investors including Elliott are pushing mining companies to reappraise strategy, by focusing on issues that existing holders may have become weary of raising, said Saunders. “Even though the questions can often be quite obvious and clumsy, it does make everybody sit up and think,” he said. Proposals Rejected While Anglo American Plc’s new investor Agarwal says he’s no activist and is backing management, his ultimate intentions after unveiling a complex transaction to become its second-biggest shareholder last month remain unclear. Analysts have speculated that he might be planning to force a break up of the company or engineer a merger. BHP, the world’s top miner, and New York-based jet- and auto-parts maker Arconic Inc. on Monday rejected separate proposals from Singer’s Elliott to overhaul their operations. Melbourne-based BHP said the benefits of the hedge fund’s ideas, including the demerger of U.S. oil assets that Elliott estimates are worth $22 billion, would be outweighed by their costs and aren’t worth the risk. BHP is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on its defense, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Elliott’s attempts to oust Klaus Kleinfeld as chief executive officer of Arconic, the Alcoa Corp. spin-off, risk jeopardizing ties to customers, according to the company, which said its current strategy has the backing of companies including Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. The price-to-book ratio of the Bloomberg World Mining Index of almost 130 producers has jumped since tumbling to the lowest on record last year, touching a near four-year high in February, as investors ascribe a greater value to the companies’ assets. Since raw materials prices bottomed in early 2016, the index has surged more than 80 percent. Mining companies have reaped the benefit of stimulus in China, the world’s biggest consumer, amid government policies to curb pollution and over-capacity that trimmed its domestic production. Surging prices of iron ore to coking coal have delivered a profit bonanza after dividends were slashed and assets sold to bolster balance sheets. The sector has survived a “near-death experience,” Franco-Nevada Corp. Chief Executive Officer David Harquail said last month. The clamor for change and higher returns from some activist investors comes after they under-invested during the sector’s downturn, according to Craig Evans, a Sydney-based portfolio manager for Tribeca Investment Partners Pty, which has assets of about A$2.5 billion under management, including BHP and other miners’ shares. “We still feel there are a lot of people who are underweight this space at an institutional level,” Evans said. “In the short-term, we’re pretty bullish as buyers in this space. We think more will come back over the short to medium term.” Others remain cautious. Prices of commodities including iron ore and coking coal are likely to fall as much as 40 percent over the next three years as demand peaks, according to Dion Hershan, managing director and head of Australian equities at Melbourne-based Yarra Capital Management. Yarra Capital, which has about A$7.5 billion of funds under management, is retaining an underweight position on the mining sector, Hershan said this week in a letter to investors following a visit to China.

Texas Real Estate Market Active for Real Estate Crowdfunding $28.1M Raised Through RealtyShares Investing Marketplace for Texas Properties Infographic: real estate crowdfunding in Texas via RealtyShares (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Infographic: real estate crowdfunding in Texas via RealtyShares (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail April 11, 2017 01:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RealtyShares, a leading online marketplace for real estate investing, has just released data showing the total amount of crowdfunded real estate investments in Texas. To date $28.1 million has been raised for 31 real estate deals, ranking Texas among the most popular states for investors on the RealtyShares platform along with California and Florida. Nearly half of all deals funded in Texas to date have been for multifamily properties with a trend favoring equity over debt. Investments have been spread throughout the state, with the most investments centered around the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, followed by Austin and Houston. “Texas remains a very popular and active investment market for us given its attractive yields and strength of economy,” said Brian Esquivel, Senior Director of Commercial Equity Investments at RealtyShares. “We continue to pursue debt and equity investment opportunities in Texas and are always on the lookout for new relationships with strong operating partners.” The average investment in Texas since inception is $907,000, with the largest being a $3.25 million Class A multifamily property in Grand Prairie sponsored by Ventures Development Group. “We are pleased to partner with RealtyShares for the development of The Watson Apartments in Grand Prairie,” said Sean Siebert, Principal at Ventures Development Group. "RealtyShares was very responsive and creative in structuring the investment to suit our needs in completing the capitalization for the project.” For Ventures Development Group, Texas has several factors that make it an intriguing investment market. “The State of Texas, especially the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, continues to be a leader in population and job growth opportunities,” said Rob McConnell, Principal at Ventures Development Group. “We believe this results from a diversified economy, coupled with pro-business governmental and regulatory guidelines. UPS and Boeing just announced further expansions in the area, and as a result we believe the resulting real estate opportunities could potentially provide above-average prospects for investment returns.” RealtyShares is bringing marketplace lending to real estate and building an ecosystem around it. By infusing technology into the archaic real estate industry, the company connects investors with pre-vetted real estate operators across the country looking to raise capital. To date, the RealtyShares network of investors has funded upwards of $300 million across more than 550 investment opportunities on the platform, funding residential and commercial projects in 35 states. About RealtyShares RealtyShares is transforming the real estate investment landscape by connecting borrowers and sponsors to debt and equity capital from accredited and institutional investors, across an array of financing products. Private investments are highly illiquid and risky and are not suitable for all investors. Through the RealtyShares website, these investors can browse investment opportunities, perform due diligence, invest online and have 24/7 access to an investor dashboard to watch how their investments are performing. RealtyShares offers securities through North Capital Private Securities Corporation, member FINRA/SIPC.

President Trump called on IBM (IBM) and other companies to help improve the nation’s antiquated government computer system during meeting with a group of CEOs at the White House Tuesday. Continue Reading Below “We have a computer system in this country that’s 40 years old,” Trump said. “So when you hear we are hacked and we’re this and we are like easy targets… one of the things we are doing is, in fact, we are working with a very, very wonderful woman from IBM and others.” IBM CEO Ginni Rometty was one of the business leaders meeting with Trump, along with top White House officials including Gary Cohn, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus to name a few. Trump hopes to neutralize the high cost of updating and maintaining the computers with a “massive” upgrade which includes brand new equipment. “I’ve heard anywhere… from $39 billion to $89 billion a year… That’s for keeping our computers updated and running,” he said.  “I think we can buy a whole new system for less money than that.” Despite the shout out to IBM, Trump clarified that he looks at many companies across multiple industries when evaluating products and services. “When I said to Lockheed, I like the F-35 fighter jets, then I said but I also like the Boeing F-18. So I love you’re [IBM] computers, but we are also looking at others,” he added. Trump is no stranger to calling out public companies, verbally or on social media, for better or worse. Nordstrom (JWN), Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) have all earned mentions on his Twitter feed.   Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Big announcement by Ford today.

"We're going to reduce taxes, we're going to eliminate wasteful regulations," Trump said at a meeting attended by corporate leaders and members of his Cabinet. Earlier this year, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for the regulations. "For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday. "That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many." Participants in the meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric. The business leaders are part of Trump's "Strategy and Policy Forum" that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. "Nafta is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on Nafta, that I can tell you," he said.

Lynch | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with "something else." At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for them. "For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday. "That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many," he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the "Financial CHOICE Act" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N); Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo (PEP.N); Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co (BA.N); Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM (IBM.N); and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co (GE.N). The business leaders are part of Trump's "Strategy and Policy Forum" that last met with him in February.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Texas Real Estate Market Active for Real Estate Crowdfunding SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–RealtyShares, a leading online marketplace for real estate investing, has just released data showing the total amount of crowdfunded real estate investments in Texas. To date $28.1 million has been raised for 31 real estate deals, ranking Texas among the most popular states for investors on the RealtyShares platform along with California and Florida. Nearly half of all deals funded in Texas to date have been for multifamily properties with a trend favoring equity over debt. Investments have been spread throughout the state, with the most investments centered around the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, followed by Austin and Houston. “Texas remains a very popular and active investment market for us given its attractive yields and strength of economy,” said Brian Esquivel, Senior Director of Commercial Equity Investments at RealtyShares. “We continue to pursue debt and equity investment opportunities in Texas and are always on the lookout for new relationships with strong operating partners.” The average investment in Texas since inception is $907,000, with the largest being a $3.25 million Class A multifamily property in Grand Prairie sponsored by Ventures Development Group. “We are pleased to partner with RealtyShares for the development of The Watson Apartments in Grand Prairie,” said Sean Siebert, Principal at Ventures Development Group. „RealtyShares was very responsive and creative in structuring the investment to suit our needs in completing the capitalization for the project.” For Ventures Development Group, Texas has several factors that make it an intriguing investment market. “The State of Texas, especially the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, continues to be a leader in population and job growth opportunities,” said Rob McConnell, Principal at Ventures Development Group. “We believe this results from a diversified economy, coupled with pro-business governmental and regulatory guidelines. UPS and Boeing just announced further expansions in the area, and as a result we believe the resulting real estate opportunities could potentially provide above-average prospects for investment returns.” RealtyShares is bringing marketplace lending to real estate and building an ecosystem around it. By infusing technology into the archaic real estate industry, the company connects investors with pre-vetted real estate operators across the country looking to raise capital. To date, the RealtyShares network of investors has funded upwards of $300 million across more than 550 investment opportunities on the platform, funding residential and commercial projects in 35 states. About RealtyShares RealtyShares is transforming the real estate investment landscape by connecting borrowers and sponsors to debt and equity capital from accredited and institutional investors, across an array of financing products. Private investments are highly illiquid and risky and are not suitable for all investors.

Advertisement As technologies become more prevalent there is often a need to produce guidelines that will ensure standardization. One such technology is Augment Reality (AR). On April 11, a standard was released by UI Labs The Augmented Reality for Enterprise Alliance (AREA). The (AR) hardware and software functional requirements guidelines will help AR technology companies develop products for industrial users.  These AR functional requirements documents will lead to technology that improves the performance and efficiency for manufacturers in a number of areas, including employee training and safety; factory floor and field services operations; machine assembly, inspection and repair; manufacturing space and product design, according to the groups. Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble initiated the guidelines development process as part of a project through the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII)), a UI LABS collaboration. Recently, 65 organizations — including industry, AR providers, universities, and government agencies — came together for a workshop to offer insight into their challenges and needs to further develop the guidelines. >The functional requirements were created in March at the DMDI workshop, whose participants included the three project leads — Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble — along with Microsoft, General Electric, Rolls-Royce, Dow Chemical, Intel, the US Air Force, Stanley Black & Decker, Johnson & Johnson, Newport News Shipbuilding, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, DAQRI, Upskill, Optech 4D,  ScopeAR, IQagent, Six 15 and Real Wear along with others. “For the first time, industry — both suppliers and users in the AR space — will have access to a  benchmark set of requirements that will help them develop a roadmap and source, select, evaluate and deploy augmented reality solutions,” said Mark Sage, executive director of AREA. “These functional requirements will be used to help continue the development of the AR ecosystem.” The documents address features that include: Hardware: Battery Life; Connectivity; Field of View; On-board Storage; On-board Operating System; Environmental; Inputs/Outputs and Safety. Software: Authoring; AR Content; Creating 3D Content; Deployment of AR Content and Internet of Things. Augmented reality superimposes computer-generated content on a user’s view of the real world, using glasses, headsets or tablets to provide a composite view. Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, AR retains the existing environment and displays new information on top of it. The global AR market is expected to exceed $95 by 2023, according to a recent Credence Research report. Big Market Research reports that the  global augmented reality and virtual reality gear market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 37.45% between 2017-2021. “Augmented reality has immense potential to transform manufacturing, and early adopters are seeing impressive productivity and quality improvements,” said Thomas McDermott, executive director of DMDII. “However, wide adoption of this technology requires collaboration among the industrial companies operating on the front lines and the AR providers designing solutions to ensure the technology under development meets the needs of industry.” Popular Now Closing the Skills Gap with Plant Tours, Pep Talks and Child Care OEE – Learn How to Use It Right Are 'Concrete Heads' Wrecking Your Lean Manufacturing Efforts?

I wonder if those previous pings would give a finite range of probable flight paths where authorities and computers could mathematically interpolate the end destination? We could both be mistaken though. Positive And Negative Impacts To Tourism In Malaysia I am not on-board with the pilot suicide scenario. But in a related note, I am curious why the officials have not declared who actually said the final words 8775 alright, good night 8776 . Was it the Captain, First Officer, or neither? Speculation has been FO due to common practice, but I have not seen that officially confirmed. Sheridan Rogers - Inspirational recipes, cooking classes *I know you asked us not to speculate, but here is mine Pilot suicide. Its happened before and it would explain whey there were no mayday. SPM SAMPLE OF ESSAYS - CONTINUOUS WRITING - English For All Furthermore, for a flight that turned so far south, the route taken around the Malaysian peninsula strongly indicates a deliberate intention to be avoided. 6) it crossed the peninsula at the Malay, Thai border which, would tend to not alert the ATC of either country, then proceed to make a very wide berth around a very active surveillance of Indonesian airspace. All up, very deliberate and with a fully functional plane. The storyline of busting down a door, fight, dumping into the sea is all a bunch of extra drama that doesn 8767 t really advance the plot. My issue is that 8775 to make it look like an accident 8776 is anything but too planned. The only thing helping it is the failure of the Malaysian authority and military to report and track the plane in the first hours after it went off track. If this were to happen over, say the USA, they plane would be greeted with fighter jets immediately and at least some cause would be observed. 6. I read about ACAR as well as another system called AHM, which sent out pings for different things, ACARS for events like departure, cruising altitutde throttle back, and landing gear deployment. And AHM pings sent based on regular time intervals, as opposed to being trigger by flight events. As we are being withheld information about all the pings, could it be that the last ping and the last partial ping are representing different systems? Could it have therefore be an indication of landing gear being deployed? 7,755 hours is still a heck of a lot of flying. You don 8767 t get certified to fly passenger jets let alone huge ones on intercontinental flights unless you know what you 8767 re doing.

How an Airline Tragedy Brought GPS to the Masses The Soviet shootdown of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983 spurred Ronald Reagan to open the US military’s satellite-based Global Positioning System for civilian use. A version of this story was originally published on War Is Boring. In April 1978, the shootdown of Korean Air Lines Flight 902 by a Soviet Su-15 fighter plane killed two passengers and spared 107 others. The incident distressed the Soviet Air Defence Forces, not because it had shot down a civilian airliner, but rather that it had gotten so far into Soviet airspace before being intercepted. Five years later, a second encounter between Su-15s and a Korean airliner would result in a heavier loss of life. That shootdown would become a flashpoint of the Cold War. And due to the mind-boggling navigational errors that led to the tragedy, it would spur US President Ronald Reagan to share the space-based radionavigation technology known as the Global Positioning System, or GPS for civilian use, notably as a location-spotting mechanism aboard commercial airliners. Today, of course, you very likely have that technology in your pocket. Any of the navigation and ride-hailing apps on your smartphone, from Google Maps to Waze to Uber and Lyft, owes their existence in no small part to the over-zealousness of the Soviet air force. But prior to that, GPS had been in the hands of only US military. Here's how it played out. Image: Benjamin B. Fischer/Wikimedia Commons On August 30, 1983, KAL Flight 007 departed from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, bound for Seoul, South Korea, with 269 crew and passengers aboard. The 747 airliner made a refueling stop at Anchorage, Alaska, where the crew was informed that one of the radio navigation beacons the flight computer usually relied on was non-functional. The crew was supposed to switch the computer to follow the gyroscope-based Inertial Navigation System, but for some reason it was not properly reset. Thus, when the plane missed the beacon, its autopilot remained fixed on a straight-line heading mode which led it hundreds of miles off course toward the Kamchatka peninsula, which served as a base for Russian nuclear forces. Cold War tensions were at peak that year, and an American RC-135 reconnaissance plane had snooped just outside the Kamchatka airspace earlier that day. When Soviet radars detected the approaching jumbo jet, the Soviet Air Defenses Forces (PVO) scrambled four MiG-23 interceptors to deal with the interloper. However, heavy winds had disabled several ground-based defense radars in the region, and without full coverage the Soviet fighter planes could not locate the airliner. The MiG-23s returned to base, short on fuel. This was in part due to a policy of limiting the fuel load on standby aircraft after defector Victor Belenko flew his MiG-25 all the way to Japan in 1975. Korean Air Lines HL7442. Photo: Hansueli Krapf/Wikimedia Commons Thus, a jumbo jet flying at high altitude in a straight line, making no evasive maneuvers, managed to confound the Soviet air defense system and soar across the Kamchatka peninsula and back into international airspace. PVO commanders were hopping mad at the failure. Declassified transcripts of the conversation between Gen. Valery Kamensky, commander of the Eastern District of the PVO, and his subordinate Anatoly Kornukov reveal that Kamensky was ready to shoot down the escaping airplane over international airspace—after confirming it was not a civilian plane. Kornukov, however, felt that the intruder was clearly a military spy plane, and advocated a shoot-first approach. Unfortunately, Flight 007's straight-line path took it back over Soviet airspace as it overflew the Sakhalin islands. The PVO had a new wave of three Su-15s and one MiG-23 ready to catch the intruder. Radio communication transcripts reveal that around 6:12 UTC, the Soviet fighters entered visual contact with Flight 007 and began acquiring missile locks. Years later, Soviet pilot Genadi Osipovich recalled seeing the 747's running lights and the row of lit windows along the passenger compartment. "I knew it was a civilian plane," Genadi admitted in an interview with Izvestia, "but it is easy to turn a civilian type of plane into one for military use." The 707 airliner is indeed the basis for a number of American reconnaissance planes. However, there are no espionage variants of the 747, which has an iconic humped profile. In any case, Genadi did not tell his commanders that he had intercepted an airliner, and they did not ask him to I.D. the plane. They did instruct him to fire several warning bursts with his underwing cannon pods. Genadi fired more than 200 23-millimeter shells across the airliner's nose, but the shots likely went undetected by the airliner crew, as his weapons lacked tracer ammunition. A 747 in flight. Photo: Jon Rawlinson/Flickr Around this time, the Korean pilot even radioed flight control in Tokyo that he was climbing for reasons of fuel economy, without ever mentioning the Russian fighters. The Soviets perceived this as an evasive maneuver, which was seen as an admission of guilt. Flight 007 would soon be exiting Soviet air space, so the PVO instructed Osipovich to "destroy the target." Like Kamensky before him, Osipovich was actually too close to use his missiles against the slow-moving airliner, and he had expended his cannon rounds on the warning shots. He instead dove a mile below the airliner, flipped his plane back up using his afterburners, and successfully acquired a missile lock from below. Two R-98 missies—an evolved variant of the R-8—streaked upwards toward the Boeing. One of the missiles detonated its large 88-pound proximity-fused warhead around 50 meters behind the 747's tail. The blast severed the airliner's elevator cables, disabled one of the four turbojet engines, and knocked out multiple hydraulic systems. Shrapnel also tore a nearly two-foot wide hole in the fuselage, depressurizing the airplane. The second missile likely missed. The damaged elevator cables actually caused Flight 007 to climb to higher altitude. The flight crew reported the damage to Tokyo and managed to keep their mortally wounded plane airborne for a dozen more minutes before the Boeing spiraled into the Sea of Japan near Moneron Island. Soviet communications were intercepted by way of the listening post at Wakkanai, Japan. Photo: 100yen/Wikimedia Commons Moscow initially denied knowing anything about the disappeared plane. However, Reagan decided to release the radio-intercepted communications between the Soviet pilots and their ground controllers—a capability the US military had kept secret until then—in order to embarrass the Soviets. Moscow eventually admitted to the shootdown, but even then, the Soviet account contained numerous "small lies," as Maj. Osipovich later admitted. Meanwhile, Reagan played up the incident to rally anti-Soviet sentiment internationally, leading to a flurry of tit-for-tat diplomatic reprisals in the United Nations and the deployment of Pershing II nuclear missiles in West Germany. Soon, rival Soviet and Western rescue fleets clashed in the Sea of Japan as they searched first for survivors, and later bodies and wreckage, including the doomed flight's black box recorders. By the end of the month, the Soviets turned over to Japan more than 200 shoes and other bits of luggage from Flight 007's passengers. They found little in the way of human remains. The Soviet Union never formally apologized for shooting down Flight 007, maintaining it had been involved in a spy flight. (Five years later, the US would decline to formally apologize after US Navy cruiser USS Vincennes mistakenly shot down Iranian Air Flight 655 over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 on board.) For years, the Flight 007 shootdown generated numerous conspiracy theories attributing the airliner's aberrant flight path to a nefarious CIA espionage plot. But shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian government revealed it had secretly located the wreckage of Flight 007 seven weeks after the incident and had recovered the black box flight recorder. Because the flight recorder failed to support the Soviet account, Moscow maintained a fake salvage mission to give the impression it was unaware of the wreck's location. Russia finally shared the black box with the international community in 1992. The recording revealed the South Korean crew to be in a relaxed mood, completely unaware they were far off course and in mortal peril until after the missile struck their plane. It also revealed the jumbo jet had likely been hit while flying over international airspace. The Flight 007 tragedy did contribute to aviation safety protocols requiring long-range military radars to assist in managing civilian air traffic. Three years later, Moscow and Washington established a joint air-traffic system. And just two weeks after the accident, Reagan announced he was opening up GPS tech to the civilian world. Of course, GPS would likely have ended up in civilian use one way or another. But the Flight 007 catastrophe was the catalyst that finally made civilian GPS a reality, and may have facilitated its earlier adoption.

Economy April 11, 2017 TEHRAN- Iran’s national flag-carrier airline Iran Air has signed a contract to buy 20 ATR 72-600 from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer and four planes of the kind will be delivered to the country in 15 days, Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan announced on Monday. As he added, nine of the accorded planes will be delivered to Iran by the end of 2017 and the rest will arrive in 2018, IRNA reported. Representatives of ATR traveled to Iran in early February to negotiate terms of a deal for the sale of at least 20 aircrafts. Iran Air finalized a deal on the purchase of the aircrafts with ATR in mid-February.  On February 4, Fakhrieh Kashan said the value of the deal is about $400 million. Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi announced in mid-January that renovation of the fleet of Iran Air has begun, adding that according to the contracts with world major plane makers, Iran Air is to receive 200 new planes, of which 100 will be purchased from Airbus and 80 from Boeing. The first, second and third planes that Iran has purchased from the European aviation giant Airbus landed in Tehran on January 12, March 11, and March 25,  2017, respectively. Also, the first Boeing 777 airplane will be delivered to Iran within a month, Mehr news agency reported on Sunday, quoting Fakhrieh Kashan.

His latest book is Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex. Does President Trump stand to personally profit off the wars he is escalating in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Somalia and beyond? That’s the question many are asking, after it emerged that Trump has personally invested in Raytheon, the military contractor who makes the Tomahawk missiles used in the U.S. strike on a Syrian airbase last week. Raytheon’s stocks briefly surged after the attack. Overall, the stocks of defense contractors, such as Boeing and General Dynamics, have increased since Trump’s election, further fueled by his promise of a "historic" 10 percent increase in U.S. military spending. For more, we speak with William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. His latest book is "Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex." TRANSCRIPT This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: On Friday, the stock price of the military contractor Raytheon briefly surged after the U.S. attack on a Syrian airbase, which used 59 of the company’s Tomahawk missiles, estimated to cost $1.4 million apiece. While the stock surge was brief, it called attention to the fact that President Trump himself has held personally—has been personally invested in Raytheon in the past. A 2015 Federal Election [Commission] disclosure, filed when Trump launched his presidential bid, reveals that he held Raytheon stocks worth $1,000 to $15,000 in value. AMY GOODMAN: While the value is low, the revelations have raised additional questions about the lack of transparency in Trump’s financial holdings and the fact that he could potentially benefit from almost any military decision he makes as president. Overall, the stocks of military contractors, such as Boeing and General Dynamics, have increased since Trump’s election, further fueled by his promise of an "historic" tens of billions of dollars’ increase in U.S. military spending. For more, we’re joined by Bill Hartung. He’s the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. Latest book, Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex. William Hartung, welcome back to Democracy Now! WILLIAM HARTUNG: Thank you. AMY GOODMAN: So, tell us, as those Tomahawk cruise missiles were pummeling this base, though not enough to take it out—it was immediately in use again—how did President Trump profit personally? WILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, as far as we know, he may still have shares in Raytheon, as reported in his financial disclosure. Of course, as with all things Trump, there’s a black box here, because he’s not reporting his tax returns, he hasn’t done a blind trust. As you said, virtually anything he does, not just in the military sphere, could benefit him, his family, his inner circle financially. And the only way to deal with that is release the tax returns, that people have demanded, and have a true blind trust that’s not run by his family. But it’s—no question, it’s an outrage to have the commander-in-chief profiting from a military contract in the middle of a conflict, however small the amount may be. And the fact that he’s not willing to disclose his current position, in some ways, makes it even worse. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you, in terms of this—the emphasis on military action that’s emerging in the first few weeks of the Trump administration—you wrote a piece for TomDispatch titled "Could War with Iran Be on Washington’s Agenda?" Could you talk about that? WILLIAM HARTUNG: Sure. Well, there’s this sort of notion that, you know, the adults in the room are Mattis and McFarland—rather, McMaster, who are, you know, military people, they’ll be careful, they know the costs of war. But they’re also among the most hawkish generals of their generation. Mattis himself wanted to attack Iran during the Iraq War, which is one of the reasons— AMY GOODMAN: This is "Mad Dog" Mattis, self-described. WILLIAM HARTUNG: Yes, exactly, is his self-described moniker. And he, you know, in the middle of that war, actually left the administration, because he wanted to attack them at the very same time they were negotiating to limit Iran’s nuclear options. So, they’ve already stepped up in Yemen—more special forces, more airstrikes. They’re still arming the Saudis, who are killing thousands with civilian bombings. So, they see that as a strike against Iran. Of course, Iran is not the problem there, but their worldview says it is. And now the step up in Syria, of course, Iran is allies with Assad, so it’s another kind of potential strike at Iranian concerns. Now the question is: Will they go further? And I think there, you know, Iran would have many ways to respond—through nonstate actors, through missile strikes. It’s not a small country. You know, invading Iran would make the Iraq War look like a walk in the park. So, how are these military people going to address this? But there’s certainly a danger of some sort of military action. And, of course, they’re not going to telegraph it. I mean, Trump apparently decided this on rather short notice, if we’re to believe the accounts. He saw something on TV, and he got exercised. AMY GOODMAN: You’ve got the advertisements on television, and then the news being an advertisement, as well, for these weapons contractors. Let’s turn to MSNBC’s Brian Williams the night of the Tomahawk cruise missile attack. BRIAN WILLIAMS: Go into greater detail. We see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two U.S. Navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean. I am tempted to quote the great Leonard Cohen: "I’m guided by the beauty of our weapons." And they are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments making what is for them a brief flight over to this airfield. What did they hit? AMY GOODMAN: I daresay Leonard Cohen might be rolling over in his grave and not rock 'n' rollin’. WILLIAM HARTUNG: No question. AMY GOODMAN: Bill Hartung? WILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, you know, obviously, it’s obscene to worship weaponry, whoever it’s targeted at. And on Raytheon’s webpage, where they’re advertising the cruise missile, they have exactly the same kind of pictures. So, to have them on MSNBC and CNN is all the publicity money could buy and more. And, of course, this has happened before in wartime, and even in the first Persian Gulf War under Bush the elder, where these kinds of displays have upped the images of these companies and almost made the weapons seem benign. There’s all these things about how accurate they are and how they’re not going to hit civilians, which has been disproved almost uniformly in the history of U.S. intervention in the Middle East. So there’s that. And also it’s a question of how it’s going to affect Trump’s push for his military buildup, because he’s going to sort of posture as the wartime president. You know, as Fareed Zakaria said, much to his detriment, he’s now the president; he’s proved he’s the president, because he can launch a military strike—which, again, to me, is not what this country should stand for. AMY GOODMAN: Bill Hartung, we thank you for being with us, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. That does it for our broadcast. I’ll be in Cambridge, Massachusetts on April 24th and 25th and moving on to Vermont, from Burlington to Montpelier, from Middlebury to Brattleboro. Check our website at democracynow.org.

These AR functional requirements documents will lead to technology that improves the performance and efficiency for manufacturers in a number of areas, including employee training and safety; factory floor and field services operations; machine assembly, inspection and repair; manufacturing space and product design; and much more. Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble initiated the guidelines development process as part of a project through the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII), a UI LABS collaboration. Recently, 65 organizations — including industry, AR providers, universities, and government agencies — came together for a workshop to offer insight into their challenges and needs to further develop the guidelines. Augmented reality superimposes computer-generated content on a user’s view of the real world, using glasses, headsets or tablets to provide a composite view. Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, AR retains the existing environment and displays new information on top of it. The global AR market is expected to exceed $95 billion USD by 2023, according to a recent Credence Research report. Big Market Research reports that the global augmented reality and virtual reality gear market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 37.45% between 2017-2021. “Augmented reality has immense potential to transform manufacturing, and early adopters are seeing impressive productivity and quality improvements,” said Thomas McDermott, executive director of DMDII. “However, wide adoption of this technology requires collaboration among the industrial companies operating on the front lines and the AR providers designing solutions to ensure the technology under development meets the needs of industry.” The AREA, a membership-funded alliance helping to accelerate the adoption of enterprise AR, will be responsible for the ongoing development, maintenance and updating of the documents produced through this initiative. “For the first time, industry — both suppliers and users in the AR space — will have access to a benchmark set of requirements that will help them develop a roadmap and source, select, evaluate and deploy augmented reality solutions,” said Mark Sage, executive director of AREA. “These functional requirements will be used to help continue the development of the AR ecosystem, and AREA is looking forward to communicating and driving future changes.” Groundbreaking AR Functional Requirements and Workshop The functional requirements were created in March at the DMDII workshop, whose participants included the three project leads — Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble — along with Microsoft, General Electric, Rolls-Royce, Dow Chemical, Intel, the US Air Force, Stanley Black & Decker, Johnson & Johnson, Newport News Shipbuilding, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, DAQRI, Upskill, Optech 4D, ScopeAR, IQagent, Six 15 and Real Wear along with others. The documents address features that include: Hardware: Battery Life; Connectivity; Field of View; On-board Storage; On-board Operating System; Environmental; Inputs/Outputs and Safety. Software: Authoring; AR Content; Creating 3D Content; Deployment of AR Content and Internet of Things.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Manufacturers Unite to Shape the Future of Augmented Reality CHICAGO & WAKEFIELD, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–UI LABS and The Augmented Reality for Enterprise Alliance (AREA) announced today the release of the world’s first augmented reality (AR) hardware and software functional requirements guidelines, which will help AR technology companies develop products for industrial users. These AR functional requirements documents will lead to technology that improves the performance and efficiency for manufacturers in a number of areas, including employee training and safety; factory floor and field services operations; machine assembly, inspection and repair; manufacturing space and product design; and much more. Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble initiated the guidelines development process as part of a project through the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII), a UI LABS collaboration. Recently, 65 organizations — including industry, AR providers, universities, and government agencies — came together for a workshop to offer insight into their challenges and needs to further develop the guidelines. Augmented reality superimposes computer-generated content on a user’s view of the real world, using glasses, headsets or tablets to provide a composite view. Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, AR retains the existing environment and displays new information on top of it. The global AR market is expected to exceed $95 billion USD by 2023, according to a recent Credence Research report. Big Market Research reports that the global augmented reality and virtual reality gear market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 37.45% between 2017-2021. “Augmented reality has immense potential to transform manufacturing, and early adopters are seeing impressive productivity and quality improvements,” said Thomas McDermott, executive director of DMDII. “However, wide adoption of this technology requires collaboration among the industrial companies operating on the front lines and the AR providers designing solutions to ensure the technology under development meets the needs of industry.” The AREA, a membership-funded alliance helping to accelerate the adoption of enterprise AR, will be responsible for the ongoing development, maintenance and updating of the documents produced through this initiative. “For the first time, industry — both suppliers and users in the AR space — will have access to a benchmark set of requirements that will help them develop a roadmap and source, select, evaluate and deploy augmented reality solutions,” said Mark Sage, executive director of AREA. “These functional requirements will be used to help continue the development of the AR ecosystem, and AREA is looking forward to communicating and driving future changes.” Groundbreaking AR Functional Requirements and Workshop The functional requirements were created in March at the DMDII workshop, whose participants included the three project leads — Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble — along with Microsoft, General Electric, Rolls-Royce, Dow Chemical, Intel, the US Air Force, Stanley Black & Decker, Johnson & Johnson, Newport News Shipbuilding, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, DAQRI, Upskill, Optech 4D, ScopeAR, IQagent, Six 15 and Real Wear along with others. The documents address features that include: Hardware: Battery Life; Connectivity; Field of View; On-board Storage; On-board Operating System; Environmental; Inputs/Outputs and Safety. Software: Authoring; AR Content; Creating 3D Content; Deployment of AR Content and Internet of Things. About UI LABS and DMDII UI LABS brings University + Industry together with startups and government to collaborate on problems too big for any one organization to solve on its own. UI LABS is building a portfolio of applied research and commercialization innovation platforms that improve its partners’ competitiveness and financial performance, and transform entire industries. Across its current platforms, UI LABS has more than 300 members from industry, government, community organizations, and academic and research institutions. Learn more at uilabs.org. In February 2014, UI LABS announced the formation of its first innovation platform, the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII), in partnership with the Department of Defense, to transform American manufacturing through the digitization of the supply chain. DMDII’s goal is to provide U.S. factories with the tools, software and expertise they need to build things more efficiently, less expensively, and more quickly, so they can win more business and bring jobs back to the United States. Learn more at dmdii.org. About the AREA The AREA supports innovative companies aspiring to invest in AR who need a better understanding of the tools available, application possibilities, methods of implementation and return on investment.

According to the press service of the Ukrainian space department, the relevant plans were confirmed by the parties during the talks between acting Head of the State Space Agency of Ukraine (SSAU) Yuriy Radchenko with the Associate Administrator of the U.S. National Space Agency (NASA) on human exploration and operations William Gerstenmaier during the 33-rd Space Symposium, which was recently held in Colorado Springs (U.S.). As part of the participation in the leading world forum on space activities, the Ukrainian side also held talks with representatives of the U.S. State Department, as well as with world leaders in the aerospace sphere - American Boeing and Lockheed Martin, as well as the Canadian MDA, a report says. As it was reported, the first meeting of the Ukrainian-American working group on cooperation in the field of exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes was held in the U.S. in May 2016. The parties are holding a dialogue in the new conditions on a qualitatively new content of the agenda of bilateral technological and industrial cooperation in the space sector. Among the new promising areas of partnership are, among other things, rocket engine building, the fight against space debris.

Tulsi Gabbard. NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images In response to a chemical weapon attack in Syria, the Trump administration increased U.S. involvement in Syria through airstrikes targeting the Syrian government. The act received bipartisan support. However, the Hague’s Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has not yet attributed the chemical weapon attack to the Syrian government, pending an investigation. At the United Nations Security Council, Italy’s delegate Sebastiano Cardi called a military approach from the international community in Syria “wrong and delusional” adding, “the solution will never be found through military means.” China, Japan, Bolivia, Uruguay, Egypt and several other countries affirmed that an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons needed to be completed to confirm the attack. In 2013, the United States, Britain and France attributed a sarin gas attack to the Syrian government, but the United Nations debunked that claim and cited that rebel forces conducted the attack, though the Syrian government and ISIS have been known to use chemical weapons throughout the past six years of war. Further, the United States shouldn’t override an international investigation by increasing its involvement in the war. The CIA already funds Syrian rebels who have been known to work with terrorist groups with $1 billion annually, and the Trump administration has been quietly increasing U.S. troops on the ground in Syria. The Los Angeles Times interviewed a civilian on the ground in Syria where the airstrikes were conducted who told them the attack was “proof that the U.S. helps Daesh,” meaning ISIS. “This administration has acted recklessly without care or consideration of the dire consequences of the United States attack on Syria without waiting for the collection of evidence from the scene of the chemical poisoning,” said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq War Veteran currently serving as a major in Hawaii’s National Guard. She went on to assert that she would support Assad’s prosecution and execution as a war criminal if the attacks were proven. “A successful prosecution of Assad (at the International Criminal Court) will require collection of evidence from the scene of the incident, and I support the United Nation’s efforts in this regard. Without such evidence, a successful prosecution is impossible.” Gabbard warned that escalating military intervention would “mean more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of terrorists and a possible nuclear war between the United States and Russia.” Opposing increased U.S. involvement in the country’s civil war is being misconstrued by pro-war enthusiasts on both sides of the political aisle as pro-Putin or alt-right to reduce all anti-war sentiments. Center for American Progress’ Neera Tanden and former DNC chair turned corporate lobbyist Howard Dean criticized Gabbard for her anti-war stance, stating she shouldn’t be in Congress. Tanden’s think tank is funded by the military industrial complex through companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, who have used the think tank in lieu of lobbyists to propagate their own agendas. To the contrary, opposing an interventionist foreign policy acknowledges the implications of the U.S. meddling in foreign military conflicts and a historical awareness of the disastrous consequences it produces. “I’m sorry to say our greatest challenge is trying to avoid a war with Russia. We’ve gotten to a point where that is a real possibility,” said William J. Perry, former secretary of defense under Bill Clinton, at a conference held by Stanford University in December 2016. “I would go one step farther than that and say that if we get in any kind of military conflict, even a relatively small military conflict, the danger of it escalating is great. The Russians knowing they are outgunned in conventional forces by the United States and NATO have made it quite clear they would move to what they call tactical nuclear weapons. Nobody who has thought about this problem seriously at all believes that once you go to tactical nuclear weapons there is any way of keeping that from escalating to a general nuclear war. So, the greatest challenge we have today is avoiding that first step to a military conflict, because once that starts, nobody knows how to control the escalation.” Unfortunately, the political climate is dominated by Clinton partisans and war hawks like Sen. John McCain who transmogrify any de-escalation of tensions between the United States and another nuclear power as portraying weakness.

Musguin, 31, is a freelance film-maker who lives in Suttons Wharf North, a new development in Mile End, east London. The housing was commissioned and is run by One Housing Group, which oversees more than 15,000 homes in the capital and its surrounding counties. Close by is Suttons Wharf South, completed in 2009. Together, the two developments have benefited from £32m of Greater London Authority grants. Housing associations face storm of complaints over new-build homes Read more “We had problems from day one,” says Musguin, whose flat was built in 2012. “When we moved in, we turned on the taps in the kitchen sink and water flooded everywhere, including into the flat below us. And the boiler went almost immediately. We’d be without hot water for two, three weeks at a time. At one point, three flats would give each other their kettles so we could run ourselves a bath.” At Suttons Wharf, residents say hot water outages remain a big issue, made worse by One Housing’s poor customer service. The housing association says it is aware of such outages, and is spending £150,000 “as we continue to work to resolve them”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A ceiling in Suttons Wharf South. Photograph: Suttons Wharf Residents Group At a recent residents’ meeting which the Guardian attended, other issues raised included poor cleaning standards, wildly varying service charges, and an infestation of moths in one block, which was damaging people’s clothes and carpets. Over the Christmas period of 2015, one block was left without its main front door for a week, which meant that it was open to intruders. At Suttons Wharf South, though One Housing claims that the association is not aware of any “outstanding reported defects”, the vice-chair of the residents’ association, Taz Kha’lique, says he and other residents have suffered an even bigger range of problems, including complete outages of hot and cold water; plug sockets and phone points with no wiring behind them, and incoming moisture because of faulty seals on windows. Gabriela Boeing, who has lived in a shared-ownership fifth-floor flat in the same development for nearly six years, says as well as issues with leaking water, she and other residents have had longstanding problems with mice.

Photograph: Suttons Wharf Residents Group In 2013, she received an email from One Housing’s home ownership adviser claiming : “I have had had no other complaints regarding mice at Suttons Wharf South.” Boeing says she knew of at least two other residents who had raised the same problem, which reflects a common theme in a lot of residents’ accounts: One Housing allegedly responding to complaints by claiming they are unique to a particular flat and therefore the resident’s responsibility, when residents know the issues in question are being widely experienced. One Housing did not directly answer this point, but told the Guardian “we have robust structures in place to monitor incoming reports and complaints ”. Musguin strikes a rather different tone. “No one calls the repairs line now,” she says. “There’s no point.” Have you experienced problems with your housing association home?

David StringerPerry Williams A file photo of mining billionaire Anil Agarwal. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint Melbourne/Sydney: The world’s mining giants better get used to the attention. Their recovery from a price collapse that sent the industry spiraling into crisis is delivering a fresh challenge—renewed scrutiny from major investors eager to magnify returns. Billionaires Paul Singer, Alisher Usmanov and Anil Agarwal are among those to add holdings this year after a rebound in profits from the lows of 2015 and 2016. Mining companies’ management will have to adapt to a more critical eye and greater public notice as their businesses become more compelling to investors, according to Brenton Saunders, a Sydney-based investment analyst and portfolio manager at BT Investment Management Ltd. “Everybody is being questioned,” Saunders said by phone. “Investors have grown up a little in the post-supercycle period, in terms of the way they evaluate strategy.” BT Investment manages about A$87 billion ($65 billion) of assets and holds shares in BHP Billiton Ltd, which is fending off a three-pronged proposal from Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. that the hedge fund believes will deliver a 50% lift to shareholder returns. Restive investors including Elliott are pushing mining companies to reappraise strategy, by focusing on issues that existing holders may have become weary of raising, said Saunders. “Even though the questions can often be quite obvious and clumsy, it does make everybody sit up and think,” he said. Proposals rejected While Anglo American Plc’s new investor Agarwal says he’s no activist and is backing management, his ultimate intentions after unveiling a complex transaction to become its second-biggest shareholder last month remain unclear. Analysts have speculated that he might be planning to force a break up of the company or engineer a merger. BHP, the world’s top miner, and New York-based jet- and auto-parts maker Arconic Inc. on Monday rejected separate proposals from Singer’s Elliott to overhaul their operations. Melbourne-based BHP said the benefits of the hedge fund’s ideas, including the demerger of US oil assets that Elliott estimates are worth $22 billion, would be outweighed by their costs and aren’t worth the risk. BHP is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on its defence, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Elliott’s attempts to oust Klaus Kleinfeld as chief executive officer of Arconic, the Alcoa Corp. spin-off, risk jeopardizing ties to customers, according to the company, which said its current strategy has the backing of companies including Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. The price-to-book ratio of the Bloomberg World Mining Index of almost 130 producers has jumped since tumbling to the lowest on record last year, touching a near four-year high in February, as investors ascribe a greater value to the companies’ assets. Since raw materials prices bottomed in early 2016, the index has surged more than 80%. Mining companies have reaped the benefit of stimulus in China, the world’s biggest consumer, amid government policies to curb pollution and over-capacity that trimmed its domestic production. Surging prices of iron ore to coking coal have delivered a profit bonanza after dividends were slashed and assets sold to bolster balance sheets. The sector has survived a “near-death experience,” Franco-Nevada Corp. chief executive officer David Harquail said last month. The clamour for change and higher returns from some activist investors comes after they under-invested during the sector’s downturn, according to Craig Evans, a Sydney-based portfolio manager for Tribeca Investment Partners Pty, which has assets of about A$2.5 billion under management, including BHP and other miners’ shares. “We still feel there are a lot of people who are underweight this space at an institutional level,” Evans said. “In the short-term, we’re pretty bullish as buyers in this space. We think more will come back over the short to medium term.” Others remain cautious. Prices of commodities including iron ore and coking coal are likely to fall as much as 40% over the next three years as demand peaks, according to Dion Hershan, managing director and head of Australian equities at Melbourne-based Yarra Capital Management. Yarra Capital, which has about A$7.5 billion of funds under management, is retaining an underweight position on the mining sector, Hershan said this week in a letter to investors following a visit to China.

Sainato by Tweet Email In response to a chemical weapon attack in Syria, the Trump Administration increase U.S. involvement in the war in Syria through airstrikes on the Syrian Government. Though the United Nations The act received bipartisan support, despite the Hague’s Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has not yet attributed the attack to the Syrian Government pending an investigation. At the United Nations Security Council, Italy’s Delegate Sebastiano Cardi called a military approach from the International Community in Syria “wrong and delusional” adding, “the solution will never be found through military means.” China, Japan, Bolivia, Uruguay, Egypt, and several other countries affirmed an investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons needed to be completed to confirm the attack. In 2013, the United States, UK, and France attributed a Sarin Gas attack to the Syrian Government, only for the United Nations to debunk that claim, citing rebel forces conducted the attack, though the Syrian Government and ISIS have been known to use chemical weapons throughout the past six years of war, making a knee-jerk assessment irresponsible. Nor should the attack immediately elicit the United States overriding an International investigation and solution to increase its involvement in the war. The CIA has already funded Syrian rebels who have been known to work with terrorist groups to the tune of $1 billion annually for most of the war, and the Trump Administration has quietly been increasing U.S. troops on the ground in Syria. The Los Angeles Times interviewed a civilian on the ground in Syria where the airstrikes were conducted, who told them the attack was ““proof that the U.S. helps Daesh,” referring to ISIS. “This administration has acted recklessly without care or consideration of the dire consequences of the United States attack on Syria without waiting for the collection of evidence from the scene of the chemical poisoning,” said Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), an Iraq War Veteran and currently serving as a Major in Hawaii’s National Guard, in a statement, asserting she would support Assad’s prosecution and execution as a war criminal if the attacks were proven. “”A successful prosecution of Assad (at the International Criminal Court) will require collection of evidence from the scene of the incident, and I support the United Nation’s efforts in this regard. Without such evidence, a successful prosecution is impossible.” Gabbard warned that escalating military intervention would ” mean more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of terrorists, and a possible nuclear war between the United States and Russia.” Opposing the war in Syria and the increased U.S. involvement in the country’s civil war is being misconstrued by pro-war enthusiasts on both sides of the political aisle as pro-Putin or alt-right to reduce all anti-war sentiments on grounds of aligning with unpopular factions. Center for American Progress’ Neera Tanden and former DNC Chair turned corporate lobbyist Howard Dean criticized Gabbard for her anti-war stance, claiming she shouldn’t be in congress. Tanden’s Think Tank is funded by the military industrial complex through companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, who have used the think tank with other corporations in lieu of lobbyists to propagate their own agendas. Rather, opposing an interventionist foreign policy is predicated on acknowledging the implications of U.S. meddling in foreign military conflicts and a historical awareness of the disastrous consequences it produces. “I’m sorry to say our greatest challenge is trying to avoid a war with Russia. We’ve gotten to a point where that is a real possibility,” said Former Secretary of Defense under Bill Clinton, William J. Perry at a conference held by Stanford University in December 2016. “I would go one step farther than that and say that if we get in any kind of military conflict, even a relatively small military conflict, the danger of it escalating is great. The Russians knowing they are outgunned in conventional forces by the United States and NATO have made it quite clear they would move to what they call tactical nuclear weapons. Nobody who has thought about this problem seriously at all believes that once you go to tactical nuclear weapons there is any way of keeping that from escalating to a general nuclear war. So the greatest challenge we have today is avoiding that first step to a military conflict, because once that starts, nobody knows how to control the escalation.” Unfortunately, the political climate has been hijacked by Clinton partisans and neo-con war hawks like Senator John McCain (R-AZ) who transmogrify any standard de-escalation or easing of tensions between the United States and another Nuclear super power as a dubious, evil conspiracy.

The WSU Everett Engineering Club placed second last year in the University Rover Challenge. (Contributed photo) You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Washington State University’s Mars Rover Team has earned a spot in the 2017 University Rover Challenge in Utah. It’s the second year the team from WSU’s Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture at the Everett campus has entered the international robotics competition. Last year, the students earned second place and became the top-placing American team. The team will largely utilize the same rover they constructed for the competition in 2016, calling it simply Rover 2.1. They will face new challenges, which means making major upgrades. Nineteen students are part of the WSU Everett Engineering Club. Mitch Elder, a senior mechanical engineering student, is the president of the club. Mark Walsh is the team lead on the project. Walsh spent 12 years in the U.S. Air Force and has a background for this competition. Several companies have donated money and other support for the project. Sponsors have included Blue Origin, Electroimpact, Metal Supermarkets, Boeing, Pacific Power Batteries and Janicki Industries. Elder also thanked Everett Community College, which is providing use of its Advanced Manufacturing Training & Education Center. The team still needs support to build the rover and to pay for the students to attend the competition.

Space Nothing compares to NASA… in the public sector, at least Alan Martin @alan_p_martin 11 Apr 2017 whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email Recently, President Donald Trump signalled his commitment to America’s space programme with a $208 million increase in funding for NASA, taking the total to $19.5bn. That may seem like a glorious return to the space race, but the truth is actually a little more mundane. NASA’s budget reached its highest ever point in 1966 during the Apollo missions, when it hit $5.9bn – and although that sounds like nearly a quarter of what it is today, you have to appreciate that in today’s money, that comes to around $43.5bn: a pretty unsustainable 4.41% of the total federal budget. Back then, space was demonstrably a bigger priority than it is today where it takes up a reedy 0.47% – the lowest it's been since 1959, when NASA was just two years old. In fact, the country as a whole spends more on pizza than it does on space exploration (albeit with a disappointing lack of state subsidy). And yet, despite successive generations of US governments putting space science on the backburner, NASA is still the world’s most funded space agency, as the chart below from our friends at Statista demonstrates. The US spends more than three times as much as Europe, nine times as much as China and over seven times as much as old cold war rivals Russia. Although the US leads the way, in terms of growth it’s pretty stagnant. The budget rise from 2016 to 2017 was just over 1%, while the European Space Agency’s jumped by around 9.5%. It’s still better than Russia’s Roscosmos, mind, which was subject to a 30% cut in 2016. See related  Space semantics: NASA scientists want to redefine what constitutes a planet New NASA online library is a space-lover’s dream NASA computer upgrade means we can finally make that Venus trip Of course, what the chart doesn’t tell you is anything about the private sector, and given that the world’s second richest man, Jeff Bezos, recently revealed that he invests $1bn per year in his private space venture (making the Amazon founder’s pet project only slightly poorer than India and Japan’s space programmes), you can bet there’s a lot of money sloshing around there too. And here’s where it gets a bit fuzzy too, because plenty of NASA’s budget is spent within the private sector. Contracts with Boeing and SpaceX have proven necessary since the space agency retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, for example, and these contracts frequently run into the billions of dollars – making these companies of similar scale to some government agencies. Perhaps it’s no wonder that Elon Musk – both a competitor and friend of NASA – seems a little underwhelmed by how little NASA’s budget is moving under a president that promised: “Under a Trump Administration, Florida and America will lead the way into the stars.” The costs involved still mean some kind of state help is necessary when it comes to the astronomical figures involved in dealing with life beyond Earth. @karaswisher Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 22, 2017 Read more about: Space Politics You are here: Home Space How much do governments spend on space science?

Tinker Air Force Base said in a statement Friday that authorities evacuated an area near Gott Gate after security at the Oklahoma City base learned that a truck making a routine delivery was stopped due to the possibility of an explosive residue. Tinker officials say the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office responded and determined there was no threat to the base or surrounding buildings. The affected area was in the southeast corner of the base near private offices housing employees of The Boeing Company. The truck and its driver turned around and the delivery was denied. The base says the evacuation order was lifted around 11:30 a.m. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(File Photo | Reuters) WASHINGTON:   President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with "something else." At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for them. "For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday. "That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many," he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the "Financial CHOICE Act" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo ; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co . The business leaders are part of Trump's "Strategy and Policy Forum" that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. "NAFTA is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised.

PHOTO: REUTERS WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with “something else.” At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a “major haircut” for them. “For the bankers in the room, they’ll be very happy because we’re really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else,” Trump said on Tuesday. China will get better U.S. trade deal if it solves North Korea problem: Trump “That will be the minimum. But we’re doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many,” he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month’s end of sweeping legislation known as the “Financial CHOICE Act” that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday’s meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N); Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo (PEP.N); Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co (BA.N); Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM (IBM.N); and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co (GE.N). Trump, May aim to convince Moscow to end Assad support The business leaders are part of Trump’s “Strategy and Policy Forum” that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. “NAFTA is a disaster. It’s been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we’re going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you,” he said.

In particular, Arconic suggests that all shareholders ask Elliott questions on these important points: After three directors on Arconic's Board were added last year at Elliott's recommendation, Elliott has now nominated four more directors. Question: How are other shareholders' interests served by giving Elliott, a 13.2% shareholder, the privilege of nominating seven of Arconic's 13 directors? Elliott suggests that Arconic's Board install Larry Lawson as the new CEO of Arconic. Mr. Lawson has a non-compete agreement with his prior employer that legally restricts him from serving as Arconic's CEO. In fact, Mr. Lawson's prior employer has stated that he is already in violation of the agreement due to his involvement with Elliott. Questions: Does Elliott believe that Mr. Lawson should violate his contractual commitment to his prior employer? Is Mr. Lawson treating his prior employer ethically by violating his non-compete agreement by offering to work for Arconic? Mr. Lawson is on Elliott's payroll. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification for breaching his non-compete agreement. In total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years, regardless of whether Mr. Lawson becomes Arconic's CEO. Questions: Aren't other shareholders' interests best served by assigning the full Board the responsibility of selecting the CEO? Why should that be Elliott's privilege? How would Elliott propose to resolve the apparent conflict of interest caused by appointing a CEO to whom it is paying tens of millions of dollars on the side? When Elliott began its proxy contest, it produced an analysis indicating that it thought Arconic's Global Rolled Products ("GRP") division, which generated EBITDA of $577 million in 2016, could increase its EBITDA by $750 million. Within a matter of days, Elliott issued multiple revisions of its analysis and now seemingly believes that EBITDA can only be expanded by $245 million.ii Questions: Does the same prescription apply to a division that has an opportunity to increase EBITDA by 42% as one that could more than double its EBITDA? In light of Elliott's admitted, significant analytical error, how can shareholders rely on Elliott's analysis or plans for Arconic's future? Elliott has compared Arconic's Engineered Products Solutions ("EPS") business to that of Precision Castparts ("PCC"). However, EPS is significantly smaller than PCC and does not participate in some of the higher margin segments in which PCC is a market leader. Cowen and Companyiii recently published a report noting "the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar." Questions: Are Elliott's conclusions about margin potential and underperformance well informed? How specifically does Elliott suggest that EPS, despite being much smaller and not participating in some high margin segments, close the margin gap to PCC? Klaus Kleinfeld was appointed as CEO of Alcoa Inc. when the Company was highly levered and the price of aluminum was near an all-time high. In the nine months thereafter, aluminum prices collapsed and Alcoa Inc.'s stock price fell dramatically. Since then, shareholders of Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, have seen Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") of 182%iv, as the Company generated $8 billion in shareholder wealth in eight years.i Alcoa Inc. shareholder return also outperformed both the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the overall S&P Metals & Mining Index since 2009.v Alcoa Inc. was included in these two indices from 2009 until the separation in November 2016, and unlike the broad S&P 500 index, these indices include companies where earnings power and share prices are highly correlated to underlying commodity prices, making these indices the appropriate benchmark for comparison. Questions: How can Elliott ignore the impact of the global financial crisis when evaluating Alcoa Inc.'s shareholder returns? How does providing a comparison to (i) broad market indices that are not directly levered to commodity pricing or (ii) companies that were not comparable to Alcoa Inc. for the vast majority of the time period provide shareholders with any insight into Alcoa Inc.'s relative performance? Shouldn't Elliott focus on relative performance to indices that include large-scale commodity producers with share price correlation to commodity markets (i.e. S&P Metals & Mining and S&P 500 Metals & Mining indices)? Elliott has commended Alcoa Inc. for separating its business into two publicly traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. Indeed, Elliott said that Alcoa Inc. would not be fully valued unless the Company took action to split its businesses into two public companies. Now, however, Elliott is using TSR data that deliberately excludes the value created by the separation by measuring Mr. Kleinfeld's performance (and the Alcoa Inc. stock performance) only until the day before the split into two public companies. Questions: Why should shareholders ignore the value created by the successful separation of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation in calculating the value created by the current leadership team? Isn't it disingenuous to suggest that shareholders ignore the successful culmination of the strategic transformation of Alcoa Inc. that was executed by Mr. Kleinfeld and the rest of the management team under the oversight of the Board? The current management team, led by Mr. Kleinfeld, has a strong track record of performance that has been demonstrated before, during and after completing the highly complex separation of Alcoa Inc. Following actions taken to save Alcoa Inc. during the global financial crisis by reducing costs and strengthening the balance sheet, the management team executed a complex transformation of the upstream and downstream businesses. The transformation built Arconic into the company it is today, completing divestitures, organic growth projects and acquisitions to focus on the high growth, high value aerospace and automotive markets. Leadership created a successful culture of innovation and technology, with a strong focus on cost competitiveness and established deep customer partnerships that are the lifeblood of Arconic. Arconic's major customers, including Airbus, Boeing, GE and United Technologies have all expressed their strong support for Mr. Kleinfeld and his continued leadership of Arconic. Question: Why aren't shareholders' interests best served by a management team with a strong and proven execution-focused track record? Wouldn't critical customer relationships be jeopardized by a change in leadership and strategy as Elliott is proposing? Arconic has a substantially new Board; seven of its 12 independent directors have joined the Board in the last 15 months. Three of those directors were added at the recommendation of Elliott. Directors have met with Elliott, other shareholders, customers, suppliers and employees. The Board has engaged in extensive analysis of Elliott's claims and of the strategy, performance and leadership of Arconic. Questions: Why should shareholders doubt the judgment of highly qualified independent directors who have worked diligently to evaluate Elliott's claims and have access to information that Elliott does not? Why aren't shareholders best served by these independent directors, a majority of whom are new, three of whom were recommended by Elliott, and all of whom concluded that Arconic has the right strategy and the right leadership? ​Source: http://www.arconic.com/global/en/home.asp Download PDF Copy Request Quote Comments Tell Us What You Think Do you have a review, update or anything you would like to add to this news story?

Donald Trump’s plans to slash taxes for corporations and wealthy individuals and impose a border tax will harm average consumers further, Oxfam said in a report published on Tuesday. The 50 largest companies disclosed use of 1,751 subsidiaries in countries classed as tax havens by the OECD and the US National Bureau of Economic Research, an increase of 143 on a year earlier, the charity found. The true number may be far higher as only “significant” subsidiaries have to be disclosed. Read more Donald Trump’s 'phenomenal' tax reform: What we know so far Big multinationals such as Google, Amazon and Apple have come under fire for routing sales through countries such as Bermuda, Ireland and Luxembourg, which offer them low tax rates. While this is legal, critics say it does not reflect where the firms actually do business. The top rate of US corporate tax is 35 per cent - one of the highest rates in the world, incentivising many companies to hold billions offshore. Mr Trump has pledged to reduce this to 15 per cent and a one-off rate of 10 per cent for money currently held abroad. That will hand a $328bn tax break to the 50 biggest companies, with Apple, Pfizer and Microsoft the biggest gainers, accounting for 40 per cent of the total, Oxfam estimated. While some have welcomed the move as a sensible way to bring profits of US companies back to the country, Oxfam warns that it risks accelerating a race to the bottom that will harm consumers in America as well as the world’s poor as global tax rates plummet.

As a result of the US trade embargo and other inefficiencies of Cuba's economy, thousands of basic household items are inaccessible to Cubans meaning that sometimes a little creativity is required to get the job done. At El Canal, a winery in Havana, Orestes Estevez and his family fill glass jugs with grapes, ginger and hibiscus, before securing a condom over each glass jug Allowing Heathrow to expand will create “a serious obstacle” to meeting the UK’s commitments on climate change and reducing air pollution, a leading scientist has warned. AP 4/34 'Pink Star' diamond sells for world record £57m in Hong Kong auction - Tuesday April 4 A rare pink diamond dubbed the “Pink Star” has become the world's most expensive gemstone to sell at auction, coming under the hammer in Hong Kong on Tuesday for $71.2m (£57.3m). The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded. It sold after a five-minute bidding war, that started at $56m, to Hong Kong jewellery retailer Chow Tai Fook at Sotheby's. AP 5/34 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. Getty 6/34 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’. The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 7/34 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market. Reuters 8/34 Philip Hammond downgrades UK economic growth for Brexit years - Wednesday March 8 The Chancellor was forced to slash his official economic growth forecasts while the Brexit talks take place, as he delivered his first Budget. Philip Hammond told MPs that Britain’s economy would grow faster than previously expected in the next financial year – by 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent. PA 9/34 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy. Reuters 10/34 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 11/34 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 12/34 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target. Getty Images 13/34 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country. Eight aquariums run by the company Sea Life are calling on visitors to spare lettuce or broccoli for their shelled inhabitants who, as a result of a shortage of some vegetables in the UK, are missing out on their favourite meals. GREG WOOD/AFP/Getty Images 14/34 Tim Cook met Theresa May and said the UK would be 'just fine' post Brexit - Thursday February 9 The chief executive of Apple has told Prime Minister Theresa May that he is “very optimistic” about the UK’s future outside of the European Union. Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 15/34 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years. Getty 16/34 Founder of Morrisons supermarkets dies at the age of 85 Sir Ken Morrison, the founder of supermarket chain of Morrisons, who was instrumental in growing the company into one of Britain’s leading retailers, has died at the age of 85 Rex 17/34 Boohoo staff can get fired 'for smiling' - Monday January 30 Employers working for online fashion retailer Boohoo.com risk getting fired for smiling or checking their mobile phones, an investigation by Channel 4 has found. The investigation comes after online fashion retailer Asos was accused last year of exploitative working practises with staff reportedly unable to take regular water and toilet breaks for fears of missing targets. The company denied those allegations. Getty Images 18/34 Tesco to buy wholesaler Booker in £3.7bn deal to create 'UK's leading food business' - Friday January 27 Britain's biggest retailer announced that it was merging with Booker, the UK's top food wholesaler, in a £3.7bn deal.

Tesco 19/34 Tobacco giant Imperial Brands scraps chief executive pay rise - Thursday January 26 The chief executive of Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes, is unlikely to get a pay rise this year in what seems to be another battle over boardroom greed. Alison Cooper received a total pay package of £5.5m in the last financial year, up from £3.6m the year before. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads READ MORE Link between high executive pay and performance ‘negligible’ A new pay policy that would have had the effect of taking Ms Cooper’s remuneration to £8.5m in 2017 was expected to be put to a shareholders’ vote on 1 February. However, in an announcement to the stock exchange on Thursday, Imperial Brands said it would not put the policy to a vote as originally planned. Rex 20/34 The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just reached 20,000 points for the first time ever - Wednesday January 25 Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index on Wednesday hit the 20,000 mark for the first time in its history. In morning trading in the US, the index added around 0.5 percent to surpass the psychologically important threshold and take its gains since this time last year to 23.8 per cent according to Thomson Reuters data. Thomson Reuters Eikon 21/34 HSBC to close 62 high street branches in 2017 resulting in up to 180 job cuts - Tuesday January 24 HSBC plans to close 62 branches this year, resulting in up to 180 job losses, in response to the rising popularity of online and mobile banking, the bank announced on Tuesday. In a statement, HSBC said that over the past five years, the number of customers using HSBC branches had fallen by almost 40 per cent and 93 per cent of customers’ contact with the bank is now done on the telephone, internet or via smartphone. A total of 97 per cent of cash withdrawals are made via an ATM. Getty 22/34 Theresa May criticised by top economists for trying to ‘have her cake and eat it' with Brexit - Wednesday January 18 Top economists and strategists have warned that Theresa May’s vision of Brexit lacks credibility and clarity, a day after the Prime Minister delivered an agenda-setting speech on Britain’s future outside the EU. In her speech in London on Tuesday, Ms May confirmed that Britain will leave the EU’s single market to regain control of immigration policy and said that she wants to renegotiate the UK’s customs agreement and seek a transition period to phase in changes all while remaining a “best friend” to the bloc. Getty 23/34 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused the company of using software that allowed excess diesel emissions in just over 100,000 US trucks and SUVs sold since 2014. READ MORE Six senior Volkswagen employees charged over emissions scandal Shares listed in Europe were recently trading around 18 per cent lower on the day. Shares in the US fell 16 per cent before being halted from trading, wiping $2.3bn (£1.88bn) off the company's market value. 24/34 Rising inequality behind Brexit and Trump victory is top global threat for the next decade, says WEF - Wednesday January 11 A rise in global income inequality, that already helped spur the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s election victory, are expected to shape world developments over the next decade, according to the World Economic Forum. For a report published ahead of its annual summit in Davos next week, the WEF surveyed 750 risk experts and found that rising income and wealth disparity were cited as the most important trends in determining global developments over the next 10 years. Getty 25/34 Mayor Sadiq Khan axes new Routemaster bus from the streets of London - Friday January 6 London Mayor Sadiq Khan has ended any hopes to purchase new Routemasters bus for the capital's streets as he tries to balance the books on London's transport budget. Once called 'Boris buses' named after his the previous mayor, every bus would cost around £350,000 each, or around £50,000 more than an ordinary bus. But the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions. Getty Images 26/34 FTSE closes 2015 at record high - Friday December 31 Britain’s blue chip FTSE 100 set a new record on the last day of trading of 2016 after climbing to record closing highs for two consecutive days.

Reuters 28/34 World's oldest bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena on brink of £17bn Italian state bailout - Thursday December 22 The world’s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, is poised for a multi-billion state bailout after it admitted on Wednesday that a private rescue plan was unlikely to succeed.

Getty 33/34 Brexit: Banks in 'advanced talks' over mass move to Paris, says French regulator - Thursday December 8 Leading international UK-based banks are in advanced stages of planning to shift operations to Paris as London braces for the impact of Brexit, France's chief financial regulator has said. Paris is among a number of European cities seeking to woo firms considering a move away from London to maintain their access to EU markets, and faces competition from Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, among others. Reuters 34/34 Pfizer fined record £84.2m for overcharging NHS 2600% -Wednesday December 7 Drug firms Pfizer and Flynn Pharma have been fined nearly £90m by the UK’s competition watchdog for “unfair” pricing to the NHS after hiking up the cost of an anti-epilepsy drug by up to 2,600 per cent. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said these “extraordinary price rises” have costs taxpayers “tens of millions of pounds”. Getty The average statutory corporate tax rate for the G20 group of leading economies fell from 40 per cent in 1990 to 28.7 per cent in 2015. The UK has already cut its rate from 30 per cent in 2008 to a planned 17 per cent in 2020. The President has also put forward plans for a border adjustment tax, which could, in effect impose up to a 20 per cent tariff on imports. Oxfam said companies would still be able to game the system and its main outcome would be to increase prices of imported goods, hurting the poor in America, and in countries that rely on exporting to the US. Proponents say it will cause a sharp rise in the value of the dollar which will offset any rise in import costs. Oxfam’s Head of Inequality Ana Arendar said: “These companies have deepened their use of tax havens and increased efforts to build influence to push for even greater tax breaks than they already have.  “Corporate tax dodgers cheat the US out of approximately $135 billion in unpaid tax revenues every year and poor countries out of an estimated $100 billion annually.”  More about: Donald Trump tax avoidance Amazon Google Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Aerojet-Rocketdyne (AJRD) is leaving Sacramento, California, a longtime hub of the aerospace industry, CBS Sacramento reports. The defense and aerospace company announced Monday it is closing its Rancho Cordova manufacturing plant by 2019 and eliminating or moving nearly 1,100 jobs. The company has previously called its Sacramento-area site “one of its high-cost locations,” the Sacramento Bee reported.  In recent years, manufacturers have moved operations from states with high rates of union membership to parts of the U.S. where labor is less organized and where laws limiting union funding make it harder for workers to unionize. Aerojet employees left work for the first time Monday with the startling announcement. As they drove past the company gates, one stopped for a brief interview. “Can you tell me what the mood is there with the announcement?” CBS13’s Steve Large asked the employee.  “It’s not good, people aren’t feeling very good about it,” the worker replied. 29 Photos Apollo 11: The original moonwalk President John F.

For the Sacramento region, it’s a loss of a major, high-profile private employer. The company has a rich American history; its engines were used in NASA’s Apollo program, which led to the first moon landing. The site that houses Aerojet has been in use since the 1950s. “When people talk about large, successful, companies in the region, Aerojet always ranks near the top,” Sacramento State finance professor Sanjay Varshney said. Aerojet-Rocketdyne has downsized since the end of the space race, but remained one of Sacramento’s only publicly traded companies. The company moved its headquarters from Sacramento to Southern California last year in a move that foreshadowed its latest relocation plan. Its decision to leave now is a clear sign to Varshney this region is not doing enough to attract business.

The region will gain about 800 jobs from the move, AL.com reported. Other manufacturers, including Boeing, DynCorp, Honeywell and Raytheon all have a presence in Huntsville, a city of 190,000 people near the border with Tennessee. “North Alabama remains the nation’s epicenter for aerospace and defense research, development and production,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told AL.com.   The Aerojet-Rocketdyne CEO issued a statement saying the move would save the company $85 million. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

The new price target for the Pentagon’s F-35, once called the most expensive weapons system is history, is $80 million, according to officials involved in the negotiations.  The next order is slated to be one of the largest additions of F-35s to the US armed forces. The deal could include as many as 130 new jets.  © AP Photo/ Trump May Not Like it, But US Navy Proceeds With F-35 Buy The US managed to buy the F-35s for an average unit cost of approximately $94 million in the tenth block of jets, which represented substantial savings from the previous price of $102 million per jet.  While US President Donald Trump claimed personal credit for the savings, cost reductions were already built into the procurement process. Namely, when manufacturers boost production of the stealth fighter, it allows the manufacturer to spread fixed costs over a larger number of units.  Pentagon officials are eyeing a batch of 130 jets for its next procurement package. The Defense Department and F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin have an agreement in place to buy more than 2,000 units. In March, F-35 program director Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan said that by 2020 the price of the jet would fall below $80, a roughly 16-percent drop from its current sticker price, Defense News reported.  © Flickr/ Lockheed Martin UK Should Consider Alternative for F-35 Jet Servicing Instead of Turkey- Lawmaker Boeing recently made a push to influence the Trump administration to buy “advanced” F/A-18 Super Hornets. That effort reached an ostensible end.  US Navy Rear Adm.

Inter-country commerce in goods and services has raised the overall standard of living of people across the world and one only needs to look at Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong to see how untrammelled trade transformed these former backwaters into the thriving and prosperous centres they are today. We have recently witnessed an emergence of rhetoric and regimes espousing a different worldview - one of turning inward and slamming the doors on economic integration and trade. The spectre of protectionism has begun to cast a long shadow over the globe. Today, the world is interlinked through trade like never before. China and Brazil are twelve time zones apart, yet China's economic slowdown has affected GDP growth in Brazil. As China's voracious appetite for raw materials decelerates, Brazil, with excessive reliance on commodity exports, finds demand for its products decreasing and is in the midst of stagflation, with GDP falling and inflation rising. Other examples of interdependence between countries abound and the question of economic integration and its pros and cons has never been so critical. Diligence, persistence and a genuine desire to lift average real incomes resulted in multilateral trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and, more recently, the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP is in fact a next generation trade treaty that goes beyond the more obvious trade barriers that lie at the borders of countries and delves into technical standards, intellectual property and environmental criteria that would actually benefit the United States. Tearing up this agreement without apparently bothering to understand its nuances and benefits, as the incoming US president has done in an ostensible move to spite his predecessor, is hazardous for the US. It will pave the way for countries like China to push its own Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) forward and assume a leadership role in Pacific basin trading arrangements in the future, leaving the US on the sidelines. It is interesting to note that China's RCEP initiative is being held up by none other than India, which runs a large trade deficit with China and possibly fears an invasion of cheap Chinese goods into its markets as a result of RCEP becoming a reality. So, instead of focusing on the future, old hackneyed arguments about big, bad trade deficits, which were fashionable in the 1980s when Japan ran large trade surpluses with the US and the OECD countries are now being dusted off, with China replacing Japan as the punching bag. The fact is that the US has run large current account deficits with the rest of the world as far back as anyone can remember - without deleterious consequences. The present US viewpoint is thus a somewhat naïve one and is predicated on the simplistic thesis that trade has caused jobs in manufacturing and services to leave American shores, disadvantaging US workers. It is well known that trade creates jobs as long as increases in productivity lead to maintaining comparative advantage in goods and services. The US president speaks about 'bringing jobs back' but the jobs he is referring to cannot be brought back as they never left in the first place. He also may not realise it but the US economy is operating at very close to full employment at present. If we look at manufacturing over the past three decades, it has either been a case of technology replacing humans (robots in automobile production) or productivity rising sharply and allowing more output to be produced with fewer people. The US should be lauded for its continuous increase in productivity because this is the foundation for long-term economic growth. If the US lost 7 million manufacturing jobs during the first decade of this millennium, it also gained 30 million jobs in the services sector. This is not exactly a bad thing as it means that the country is moving up the value chain and leaving economic activities like certain types of manufacturing to countries that are more adept at it. The US is not alone in this. The European Union is also heading in the same direction. The arguments for free trade (or almost-free trade) are compelling. Protectionism makes domestic firms less competitive in the export market by raising prices of intermediate goods used in the production of goods for export. The OECD estimates that each dollar of increased protectionism leads to a drop of 66 cents in GDP. And for major trading nations, an increase in import tariff revenues can result in a drop of double that amount in world exports. How can this possibly be good for a world that has just emerged, after a lot of hard yards, from the worst recession since the Great Depression? America blames China for the loss of manufacturing jobs. Are there really firms in the US who can produce, at a competitive price, all the hundreds of thousands of SKUs that are found in US hypermarkets like Walmart? Similarly, are there sufficient numbers of resident US programmers who can fill the void that might be left by the new H1-B visa rules announced by the US president? More importantly, in an age of outsourcing, will domestic firms be able to survive the high costs of 'insourcing'? Trade barriers meant to protect infant industries in developing nations made some sense in the latter half of the 20th century. But India carried it too far and was a case study in import substitution gone wrong in the 1950-1990 period. The country protected hugely inefficient state-owned behemoths that produced shoddy goods at costs that were multiples of the prevailing world prices. It took the millennium change in 1999-2000 for India to finally find its mojo in IT and to realise that it was in services like IT, and not in manufacturing, that it would ever gain a comparative advantage over other nations. Today's world is all about specialization. David Ricardo, who first enunciated the principle of comparative advantage almost exactly two hundred years ago, would probably not rest easy if he knew what was afoot today. Only Boeing and Airbus can make large commercial aircraft at a viable cost and of unquestionable reliability. India has established skills in business process outsourcing. Dubai attracts expats and visitors at all levels from all over the world because of its attractive business climate and tourism infrastructure. Countries specialize in activities that afford the lowest opportunity costs and leave the rest to international trade to sort out. One can only hope that when the dust settles with the newly installed US administration, and there seems to be no paucity of dust, the idea of building walls, both in a physical and figurative sense, will subside and the shadow of protectionism based on flawed logic and facts will give way to sensible policies of trade and investment that will surely lift the standard of living for all the world's citizens. - Dr Sanjay Modak is Visiting Professor of Economics at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Dubai.

The taxiway is an exclusive lane connecting apron with the runway. With 29 aircraft operating from the airport and international operations set to start from fourth week of April, the airport authorities had appealed to the state government to hand over the land to for expansion. BMC sources said survey for relocating the dwellers has been complete and the families will be shifted to another place land for which has been allotted by the general administration department. Around Rs 6 crore has been estimated to be spent to rehabilitate the families. Due to the slum, acquisition of 47 acres of OUAT is not possible for expansion of the runway. On March 21, the state government asked the airport authorities to make a request to GA department for acquisition of 47 acres. The OUAT will be provided alternative land at Sakhigopal. "The OUAT land will help check bird menace as it is now a wet field and birds flock to it for eating insects," said a senior officer of the airport. Currently, the required 150-metre space towards the north side of the runway is not there. At present, the taxiway category of the airport is 4C. It will be 4D after expansion, which can facilitate movement of Boeing-767 (airbus-321) aircraft. The expansion is required for long-term benefits. After international operations begin, some airlines may like to land big aircraft, said the airport officer.
