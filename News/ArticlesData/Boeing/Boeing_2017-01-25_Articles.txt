(AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Dow 20,000 wasn't exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Being the first to take possession of the new jetliner is a sign of the fast-growing carrier's increasing stature among the world's airlines. "Norwegian will now be the first airline to take delivery of the Boeing (BA) 737 Max and we will be the first airline in the world to operate this brand-new aircraft type," an airline spokesman said in an email. Norwegian said it will take delivery of the first of its Max jets in May and "then it will take a little time before it enters operation," the spokesman added. The airline has ordered 100 of the jets. But being the first comes with added challenges, as the first operator typically works out the early kinks of a new design. When Norwegian first took its 787 Dreamliner in 2013, its early operations were repeatedly disrupted by reliability issues with the advanced long-range airliner. Related: Boeing chases airlines for stretch 737 Norwegian plans to use the single-aisle 737 Max, with its increased range, to fly between Europe and smaller cities in the U.S. The low-cost airline's long-haul operations from Europe are flown today with larger 787 Dreamliners. A rendering of Norwegian Air Shuttle's soon-to-be-delivered 737 Max jetliner. The airline has been at the center of a fierce controversy with U.S. airlines and their labor unions over the Department of Transportation's approval of the carrier's ability to fly from Ireland to the U.S.. The unions claim Norwegian will undercut wages for U.S.-based pilots and cabin crews or hire less expensive non-U.S. crews while flying to America. Related: Richard Quest flies around the world on low-cost airlines Southwest Airlines (LUV) was the first carrier to place a firm order for Boeing's updated single-aisle jet back in December 2011 and has long been expected to take the first jet from the plane maker. Southwest said Thursday that it won't take its first Max until July and it will start flying passengers on October 1. Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that the Max, which has been in testing since January 2016, will deliver during the second quarter, but did not say which airline would take the first jet. Related: American Airlines eliminating in-seat screens on new 737 jets Southwest has faced obstacles getting the Max into its fleet, first facing a now-settled labor dispute with its pilots over pay on the aircraft and the compatibility of the fourth generation aircraft into its all-Boeing 737 fleet. Southwest is the largest operator of 737 jets in the world, and was the first airline the last time Boeing introduced a new generation of its workhorse airliner in 1997. Boeing holds orders for more than 3,400 737 Max jets, which feature a pair of new engines and aerodynamic updates to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

Think Goldman, Boeing and IBM 10:25 AM Friday Jan 27, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print World NEW YORK (AP) " Dow 20,000 wasn't exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

EVERETT — Boeing just lost 7 percent of its unfilled 747 orders. A Nigerian carrier, Arik Air, swapped its order for two 747-8s for two 787-9 Dreamliners. That drops the number of unfilled orders for the 747-8 passenger version to seven. Boeing also has 19 orders for the more popular 747-8 freighter. The cancelled 747s came as no surprise. Indeed, that Arik Air even ordered the jumbo jets was far more surprising. It’s a small carrier with two long-haul routes: Lagos-London and Lagos-New York. It also flies to Johannesburg, South Africa. Most of its flights are short-haul hops to its West African neighbors or domestic flights in Nigeria. The U.S. Air Force likely will place the next — and last — order for a 747 passenger version when it goes ahead with replacing its aging Air Force One presidential jets, said Scott Hamilton, an aerospace industry analyst based on Bainbridge Island. Boeing’s delivered 41 747-8 Intercontinentals — the name for the passenger version — and has seven unfilled orders. So, there just aren’t many passenger versions in the air. The 747-8 freighter has been far more popular, with 88 orders placed, including 19 unfilled ones. The low numbers make it harder to get spare parts and to service the aircraft, which means higher maintenance and operational costs. Those costs go up for passenger airlines, because freighters and jetliners often fly different routes, Hamilton said. “Anywhere you fly a 737, you can walk across the tarmac and get a spare if you have a good relationship with other airlines,” he said. For 747-8 International operators, it’s a much longer walk for spares. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com; Twitter: @dcatchpole.

Think Goldman, Boeing and IBM By MARLEY JAY January 26, 2017 4:35 pm Share NEW YORK (AP) — Dow 20,000 wasn’t exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They’re so optimistic that they’re buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. Hiring freeze result of Trump team's review of federal agencies The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it’s trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. Advertisement It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company’s stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Being the first to take possession of the new jetliner is a sign of the fast-growing carrier's increasing stature among the world's airlines. "Norwegian will now be the first airline to take delivery of the Boeing 737 Max and we will be the first airline in the world to operate this brand-new aircraft type," an airline spokesman said in an email. Norwegian said it will take delivery of the first of its Max jets in May and "then it will take a little time before it enters operation," the spokesman added. The airline has ordered 100 of the jets. But being the first comes with added challenges, as the first operator typically works out the early kinks of a new design. When Norwegian first took its 787 Dreamliner in 2013, its early operations were repeatedly disrupted by reliability issues with the advanced long-range airliner. Norwegian plans to use the single-aisle 737 Max, with its increased range, to fly between Europe and smaller cities in the U.S. The low-cost airline's long-haul operations from Europe are flown today with larger 787 Dreamliners. The airline has been at the center of a fierce controversy with U.S. airlines and their labor unions over the Department of Transportation's approval of the carrier's ability to fly from Ireland to the U.S.. The unions claim Norwegian will undercut wages for U.S.-based pilots and cabin crews or hire less expensive non-U.S. crews while flying to America. Southwest Airlines was the first carrier to place a firm order for Boeing's updated single-aisle jet back in December 2011 and has long been expected to take the first jet from the plane maker. Southwest said Thursday that it won't take its first Max until July and it will start flying passengers on October 1. Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that the Max, which has been in testing since January 2016, will deliver during the second quarter, but did not say which airline would take the first jet. Southwest has faced obstacles getting the Max into its fleet, first facing a now-settled labor dispute with its pilots over pay on the aircraft and the compatibility of the fourth generation aircraft into its all-Boeing 737 fleet. Southwest is the largest operator of 737 jets in the world, and was the first airline the last time Boeing introduced a new generation of its workhorse airliner in 1997. Boeing holds orders for more than 3,400 737 Max jets, which feature a pair of new engines and aerodynamic updates to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

Playing in background? A really loud tv ad "800-588-2300 EMPIRE! TODAY!" And, the Triavgo guy. pic.twitter.com/ofaUpzEoFK— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) January 26, 2017 President Trump on Thursday praised Air Force One, calling it “beautiful” and a “great plane” in his office aboard the aircraft. “That’s a good one too, but this is a very special plane for a lot of reasons,” he told reporters when asked how Air Force One compares with his personal jet. Trump sat in his on-board office with a navy blue Air Force One jacket slung over his desk chair, pool reports said, before telling assembled journalists he had met the vehicle’s pilot. ADVERTISEMENT The then-president-elect harshly criticized Boeing last month over the cost of a new Air Force One plane, calling for the company’s contract to get canceled. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” he tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016. "Cancel order!” Trump clarified his stance later that morning, accusing Boeing of “doing a little bit of number” with the aircraft’s “ridiculous” price tag. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” he joked in Trump Tower in New York City. Boeing initially won a contract to replace the current Air Force One jets — which have been flying since the early 1990s — from the Pentagon in January 2016. The defense contractor's initial contract was worth $25.8 million, but the Air Force planned on spending as much as $1.65 billion on two new planes. A Government Accountability Office report from March 2016, meanwhile, estimated the cost of the vehicles at roughly $3.2 billion before their scheduled completion in 2023. Boeing’s CEO said last Tuesday his company has made in-roads with Trump on shrinking the cost of the next generation of Air Force One planes. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Dennis Muilenburg told reporters after meeting with Trump Jan. 17. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I’m pleased with the progress there." “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business. We’re all on the same page here. Our objective is to provide the best capability for our country most affordably."

New Delhi: Jet Airways, which plans to enhance its services on the US routes, may ask its strategic investment partner Etihad to return two of its Boeing-777 planes which are currently on lease with the Gulf-based carrier. The private carrier has leased out seven wide-bodied planes to Etihad, which holds 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways, including five Boeing 777-300 ERs which are used for ultra long-haul operations. "Jet Airways may ask Etihad to return two of the five Boeing 777s, which it has leased to the Gulf partner," sources said in New Delhi. Under a commercial cooperation agreement, the two airlines had plans to connect Mumbai to Newark, Bangalore to Chicago and Delhi to New York, through Jet Airways overseas hub at Abu Dhabi. Etihad had announced the launch of its second flight to New York from Abu Dhabi with a Jet Airways' Boeing 777-300ER plane from March last year. As per the original plan, Jet Airways was to operate this flight from May 1, 2014 but the plan failed to take off after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) downgraded India's aviation safety rating. The move disallowed Indian carriers from either expanding their operations to the US or entering into any code share agreement with the airlines there. The FAA restored the aviation safety rating back to Category-I early this month, paving the way for Indian airlines to enhance their presence in the US skies. At present, only two domestic carriers, Air India and Jet Airways operate flights to the US. When contacted, a Jet Airways spokesperson said the airline was exploring all the opportunities and final decision on all such issues would be taken by its board. "We are currently evaluating the opportunities and any final decision will be taken only after discussion and approval by the Board," the spokeperson said in a statement to. Restoration of India's safety rating to Category-I by the FAA allows us to explore opportunities to enhance and optimise our presence in the United State, the statement said, adding any business opportunities will be evaluated with stringent adherence to these objectives. According to FAA annual aviation projections, presented last month, US airlines are expected to transport 1-billion passengers per year by 2029 and a total of 1.5 billion by 2035. In the period between 2014-2035, US carrier passenger will grow by an average 2.2 per cent every year, the forecast had said. Jet Airways currently operates from New Delhi to Newark in the US.

Alexandre de Juniac, chairman and CEO of Air France-KLM, which on June 24 launched a 500 million aircraft upgrade project called BEST AND BEYOND with the inaugural flight of an advanced Boeing 777 on the Paris-New York route, says flyers from India can look forward to top-of-the-line seats by the end of 2016. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with TOI's Surendra Singh: India being one of the largest economies in Asia, what are the new services Air France-KLM is planning to start in the country? Air France-KLM operates 20 weekly flights from India to Paris and 14 weekly flights from India to Amsterdam. We will launch upgraded B777 with top-class seats both for the business and economy classes in India by 2016. Our A330 fleet, which majorly caters to India, will also be upgraded by the end of 2016. Will you extend your business class promotional fares for Europe/UK tours for Indian flyers. Are you going to come up with more such attractive offers? Yes, we will. We will certainly come up with new offers. By the way, we are the only airline in the world to provide free champagne to our customers in all classes. Like the code share pact with Jet Airways, is AF-KLM planning any such partnership with domestic carriers? No plan at the moment. However, the code sharing pact with Jet Airways enabling flyers of both airlines seamless travel across destinations is working very well. Alexandre de Juniac. Will you elaborate on La Premiere segment? When are you going to launch the luxury cabins in Asia, particularly in India? La Premiere, ultra modern cabin with 4 suites in Boeing 777, will provide flyers home comfort in the air. A fully flatted bed, 24-inch high definition TV screen, personal wardrobe, hi-tech entertainment system and cabin with curtains will provide flyers a feel of 'cocoon in the sky'. Top-of-the-line cutlery, woven fabrics, cushions, adjustable curtains have been given a French touch. Flyers will get an escort to and from plane. Initially, 19 Boeing 777s are being equipped with La Premiere and the first aircraft will be launched on the Shanghai route in September. If the demand for the La Premiere increases, we will launch the product in India. Is it justified for AF-KLM Martinair Cargo to drop Delhi, the national capital, as a destination for full freighter operations? We have shrunk full freighter operations as our passenger aircraft are carrying 80% of the cargo load in their belly. Moreover, our new aircraft are coming with bigger bellies and can take extra load. It's cost-effective. How seriously are you taking competition with Gulf and Chinese carriers? Gulf carriers are eating into the Indian aviation market. The upgrade plan is to provide top-class product to our customers and give a tough competition to Gulf airlines. At the same time, we have an agreement with Etihad in order to understand and capture the market in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Seychelles. What target have you set for annual passenger capacity? Our annual passenger capacity is nearly 80 million. We haven't set our target but with better service and upgrade, we expect our annual passenger capacity will only grow. Why have you changed the slogan from 'Making the sky the best place on earth' to 'Air France, France in the air'. We want our customers to get a feel of France in the air. Service with a French touch. Air France-KLM is undergoing transformation. By 2017, we plan to invest 1 billion in our fleet in order to become a global player.

Some day soon, private companies are expected to take over the task of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX and Boeing are leading the pack, with their first crewed flights slated to take off in 2018. Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon will come with their own matching outfits, and Boeing just unveiled its new spacesuit. The "Boeing Blue" suit is intended to keep astronauts safe when they launch to the ISS and return to Earth inside a Boeing capsule. If something goes wrong during launch or re-entry, the pressurized suit can provide a backup life-support system for each astronaut. Astronauts will still use NASA's heavy-duty spacesuit when they go on spacewalks outside of the ISS. NASA Space shuttle astronauts wore a much bulkier suit during launch and re-entry. Boeing's suit and its accessories weigh about 20 pounds, which is almost 10 pounds lighter than NASA's most recent launch suit. To help astronauts stay cool, special layers allow water, but not air, to leave the suit. Zippers around the joints provide more flexibility, while touchscreen-friendly gloves help the astronauts operate the Starliner's control panels. The shoe is specially designed by Reebok, and looks more like a running shoe than NASA's clunky paratrooper-type boots. It certainly looks a lot less bulky than NASA's Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES), which was used from 1994 until the space shuttle was retired in 2011. NASA may use a modified version of the ACES suit to send astronauts to an asteroid in the Orion spacecraft in the 2020s. There's quite a noticeable difference in colors, here, too. NASA's glaring "pumpkin suit" is so-colored to help rescue crews find the astronauts in water if there's an emergency ocean landing. That task may not be so easy in Boeing Blue, although the color is admittedly still very distinct (and a little easier on the eyeballs). SpaceX hasn't yet revealed its own spacesuit design, but we have good reason to believe it will be badass. Boeing Boeing tests their suit inside a Starliner capsule mockup.

X Corporate America divided over import tax reform plan Walmart among US firms claiming tax changes would force up consumer prices Thu, Jan 26, 2017, 18:40 Barney Jopson, Ed Crooks President Donald Trump: rift in business community threatens his pledge to overhaul the tax code by undermining a blueprint House Republicans are drafting for the White House. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst         Dozens of US exporters including GE and Boeing are squaring off against Walmart and other retailers as a radical Republican plan to tax imports divides the giants of corporate America. The rift in the business community threatens President Donald Trump’s pledge to overhaul the tax code for the first time in 30 years by undermining a blueprint that House Republicans are drafting for the White House. GE, Boeing and several dozen manufacturers are in advanced talks over forming a coalition to lobby in favour of the import tax, just as Walmart and other big importers, including the billionaire Koch brothers, mobilise against it. Walmart sent its top tax executives to meetings on Capitol Hill this week to warn officials that the proposal would have a dramatic impact on its business, potentially forcing the retailer to raise prices for shoppers, according to two congressional aides. The “border adjustment” tax regime, which would penalise imports and encourage exports, is central to the plans of House Republicans initiating tax legislation. But visceral divisions over the idea do not bode well for its prospects. US companies have spent years urging policymakers to fix a “broken” tax code only to see previous efforts fail on Capitol Hill. A post-election rally in the US stock market has been driven partly by hopes of a cut in the tax rate, but the outlook has been clouded by the import tax furore. The stakes for both sides in the battle are high. Helping exporters GE is known as one of the sharpest tax planners in US industry and Jeff Immelt, its chief executive, said of border tax adjustments in December that “things that help exporters are a good thing for GE”. GE and Boeing are among the companies negotiating the formation of a coalition to lobby for the proposal by Kevin Brady, the chief tax policymaker on Capitol Hill, according to three people familiar with the talks. ADVERTISEMENT The coalition is likely to be launched in a matter of weeks and one person said 27 businesses had already agreed to join it while dozens more had expressed an interest. The companies are in talks over hiring a political consulting firm called Cavalry to manage the campaign. The firm was founded by two former aides to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, who will help decide whether the import tax survives in the Senate. More crucial to the idea’s fate will be the stance taken by Mr Trump, who has equivocated on it. Lobbyists predict that it will only prevail if he embraces border adjustments as part of his “America first” agenda – and comes up with a better slogan for the tax policy. Border adjustments would work by not letting US companies deduct the cost of foreign inputs from their revenues for tax purposes, while giving a rebate to exporters by allowing them to exclude revenue from foreign sales from their taxable income. Mr Brady, who is writing the tax plan as an ally of House speaker Paul Ryan, says the import tax would make US exporters more competitive overseas. Foreign-made goods Retailers that sell a high proportion of foreign-made goods say the import tax threatens to wipe out a large chunk of their profits. The Walmart officials visiting Capitol Hill said the company estimated conservatively that it would have to raise the prices consumers pay for clothing and electronics by 20 per cent, said one congressional aide. Scot Ciccarelli, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, divided retailers into four groups according to the impact of border adjustment and placed Walmart among those likely to suffer the most, alongside Best Buy and Williams Sonoma. They would experience “sizeable drops in net income and more limited ability to pass through price increases, materially raising future earnings risk”, he wrote this month, citing the price sensitivity of Walmart shoppers as a barrier to asking them to pick up the cost. With 98 per cent of clothes sold in the US made overseas, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, says the import tax could inflate the tax bills of some fashion chains to three to five times their pre-tax profits, jeopardising their solvency. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Donald Trump Doug Holtz Eakin Jeff Immelt Kevin Brady Mitch Mcconnell Paul Ryan Scot Ciccarelli Best Buy Boeing Cavalry Ge WalMart Williams-Sonoma Read More John FitzGerald: Expanding capacity of building sector takes time Mixed signals for Dublin’s economy as consumer morale dips Exporters urged to exploit Asian market after Brexit Consumers drive Britain’s economy, repulsing Brexit hit Central Bank downgrades growth forecast amid Brexit fears Planet Business: alternative facts and a dash of Musk How much did Airbnb hosts in Dublin earn last year?

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Saturday January, 28, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower revenue from defense business By David Koenig, AP  January 27, 2017, 12:06 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ DALLAS -- Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts' forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. The shares rose more than 4 percent in afternoon trading. On a call with analysts and reporters, Boeing executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump's tweets and comments last month about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Boeing and European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitably among major world airlines, and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Both big plane makers have order backlogs that will last for years. However, they are likely to face more competition in the next few years for sales of their workhorse models, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Canada's Bombardier and Russia and China are in various stages of delivering similar-sized, single-aisle jetliners. Boeing will counter by delivering the first of a new, upgraded 737 in a few months. And Boeing's government business could come under increasing cost pressure. Boeing predicted that 2017 revenue from its defense and space business could fall by up to 5 percent, including a drop in sales of military jets, which the company blamed on the timing of some aircraft deliveries. Boeing took another write-down on a key tanker program that has been plagued by design issues including problems with the refueling boom. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Pentagon and congressional support for Boeing's key defense programs remains solid. And he said he welcomed Trump's comments last month about one of the company's most familiar products. Boeing is in the design stage of work on customizing 747 jumbo jets to replace the current Air Force One fleet. Trump tweeted "costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion. Cancel order!" That led to a meeting between Muilenburg and Trump at Trump Tower. "We had some targeted discussions, well-publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft," Muilenburg said. "I think those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we're providing best capability ... at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers. We're exactly on the same page there." 1|2|Next Page>> SHARE CLOSE Blogger Google+ Live Journal Plurk Stumble Upon   Tweet PREVIOUS ARTICLE Court to rule if Nigeria Shell claims can proceed NEXT ARTICLE Rolling robots could soon be making deliveries in Virginia Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Delta Air reportedly will stop serving Taiwan in May 2 Asus unveils ZenFone with Daydream, Google Tango 3 McDonald's sells China operations to consortium for US$2.08 billion 4 Debate resurfaces in wake of assault 5 Japan's Takeda in US$5.2 billion deal for US cancer drugmaker 6 Mobile payment market to reach US$780 bil. in 2017: firm 7 Hon Hai not to withdraw China investments 8 Taiwan sends coffee procurement delegations to Central America 9 Trump's 'America First' could affect Taiwan's exports: MOEA 10 Trump in Asia: Region poised for change as new era dawns Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. Advertisement New York. US aerospace giant Boeing projected higher commercial aircraft deliveries in 2017 compared with last year, and reported a 59 per cent surge in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday. Boeing said it expects commercial deliveries to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. While Boeing has described commercial aircraft as generally robust, in December it announced plans to cut production on the long-range 777 plane due to slackening demand. The company also beat expectations with earnings jumping to $1.6 billion in the final quarter of 2016, compared to the same period a year earlier, due partly to an uptick in commercial aircraft that helped offset lower profits from Boeing’s military division. But the comparison to the prior year was boosted by a large charge in the fourth quarter of 2015. “With solid fourth quarter operating performance and a sharp strategic focus, we extended our aerospace market leadership in our centennial year and positioned Boeing for continued growth and success in our second century,” chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said. For 2017, Boeing projected revenues between $90.5 billion and $90.2 billion, down $94.6 billion last year. The firm reported $23.3 billion in revenues in the latest quarter, down 1.2 percent. Boeing shares rose 0.8 per cent to $161.83 in pre-market trading.

In some cases, the kind of fantasies only dreamed of in science fiction have now become real-life breakthroughs. Take our smartphones, for example, which are now akin to the communicator and tricorder from Star Trek – all in one bundle. Or the fantastic advancements in robotics that resemble the droids from Star Wars. Now, the newest mind-blowing innovation  comes from Boeing (BA). The company has patented an incredible invention that could one day protect our troops from two of the most dangerous threats they face on the battlefield. Combating the Shock(wave) When an explosive device is detonated right on its intended target, the effects are devastating. But even when they don’t hit the bull’s eye, they can still cause untold damage. Explosives in air or water create shockwaves that travel faster than the speed of sound. The force can destroy buildings and overturn vehicles. These shockwaves also carry shrapnel and other debris from the explosion, which can cause serious injury or death, and damage equipment. Paradoxically, the very protective clothing designed to protect soldiers from the initial blast can actually increase the damage from the shockwave. Boeing has a better, ingenious solution for dealing with these shockwaves and shrapnel injuries… May the Force (Field) Be With You! It’s made a force field! Boeing’s patent application proposes the ultimate high tech in order to protect soldiers – using lasers, ionizing pellets, or even projectiles to place a high-energy electric arc between the shockwave and the target – e.g., ground forces, a vehicle carrying troops, or a battleship. How does it work? In its simplest terms, the electric arc superheats the air in the protection area, essentially creating a shockwave that moves in the opposite direction. This “anti-shockwave” deflects and dissipates the incoming shockwave and accompanying shrapnel so that what reaches the intended target is a pale shadow of the previously devastating shockwave. That’s the practical part. But in order for Boeing’s force field to work at all, the company has had to develop a way to detect incoming shockwaves in the first place. The system needs to find out where the wave is coming from… then aim and deploy the lasers and other elements that create the electric arc… and then actually make the arc. Oh, and the whole system needs to work in just a few milliseconds! The Military’s Greatest Weapon Ever With a system this complicated and high tech, it will take time for Boeing to push its force field technology from patent application to deployment. But the fact that it’s working on such a breakthrough means there could come a day when the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to our troops is vastly diminished. The future of this system could hold even greater potential, too. For example, while you think that this IED-fighting system is just another example of the Pentagon (or its contractors, in this case) “fighting the last war” with ground troops, the technology could be expanded. Imagine if every military vehicle had a virtually bulletproof shield installed. Or Navy ships had superheated force fields so large and strong that they could deflect missiles and torpedoes. Boeing’s force field isn’t quite the full-on force field of science fiction – yet. But its patent application could be just the beginning of an entirely new way of protecting our troops in battle. To living and investing in the future, Greg Miller Greg Miller has spent over 20 years in the financial industry, working up from analyst, to portfolio manager, and eventually to an institutional investor, where he managed over $400-million worth of assets in mutual funds and private accounts.

Net earnings for the quarter to end December came in at $1.63 billion on total revenue of $23.3 billion, which was a slight revenue drop of 1 percent from 4Q15. Net earnings for the full year fell 5 percent to $4.89 billion on a revenue drop of 2 percent to $94.57 billion. Boeing delivered three more commercial aircraft in the fourth quarter at 185, but full year deliveries dropped from 762 to 748. That was still enough to easily beat rival Airbus who delivered 688 planes. Revenue from commercial aircraft was $65.1 billion for 2016, one percent lower than the previous year. “We led the industry in commercial airplane deliveries for the fifth consecutive year,” chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said. For 2017, Boeing said revenue should come in between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion, with an expected increase in commercial deliveries to between 760 and 765. In line with 2016’s cost savings, capital expenditure for 2017 is expected to decline by approximately $300 million to $2.3 billion. "Looking forward, our team is intent on accelerating productivity and programme execution to deliver increasing cash and profitability from our large and diverse order backlog of nearly $500 billion…, and capturing an even greater share of the the growing global aerospace market," Muilenburg said in a company release.

Large orders have been placed for the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX. Boeing has announced its design for a further stretch of the MAX and is preparing to see the first of the MAX family enter service this year. Neos and Bombardier CSeries aircraft will continue their in-service momentum. The widebody market, however, has hit the doldrums. Orders have slowed, Airbus and Boeing have both announced production rate cuts and there is talk­—some of it already confirmed—of order deferrals.  But it would be wrong to cast a gloomy outlook for the industry as a whole or for the widebody market in particular. Projections are for another profitable year for the world’s airlines in the order of almost $30 billion. And the trend-line for air passenger growth continues its upward climb. Passenger numbers are expected to reach almost 4 billion this year, which will be a record. Reflecting that appetite to fly, airlines increased the number of unique city-pair connections in 2016 by more than 700 to over 18,000. By 2036, IATA forecasts that 7.2 billion passengers will travel by air annually, almost double the 3.8 billion who flew in 2016.  While narrowbodies—especially in the low-cost sector—will play a crucial role in delivering those billions of new fliers to their destinations, it must not be overlooked that those numbers cannot be met without the indispensable widebody. Airlines that invest in a widebody fleet are playing a long game — it’s an investment in anticipated passenger growth and in new destinations. People don’t just want to travel; they want to go far away places. China’s outbound international market is booming. China and India will both eclipse the US as the world’s largest air traffic markets by 2029. The widebody is the only way to satisfy that demand, particularly on large hub-to-hub routes. And while the new generation of narrowbodies is eminently capable of carrying people farther, there are operational and customer service advantages to the widebody that the narrowbody cannot easily deliver on long-haul flights. Twin aisles are quicker to board and deplane; they offer more bin space and lavatories, larger galleys and greater IFE options, as well as crew rest areas. They also offer more ways for airlines to customize and differentiate their product; that’s important in an increasingly competitive market. Yes, there will be some order deferrals and yes, in some long-haul markets today there are airlines with a lot of capacity chasing the same passengers. But the upward trend in air travel demand is undeniable. The widebody is how that demand will be fulfilled.  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Charlie Wood Staff | @walkingthedot January 26, 2017 —Astronaut is probably the last job anyone could call uncool, but Boeing is trying to make it stylish too. The aerospace company unveiled its vision of astro-fashion this week, a new spacesuit to complement its upcoming Starliner space taxi. Replacing the iconic orange "pumpkin" flight suits of the space shuttle era, the sleeker, lighter "Boeing blue" suits feature a number of upgrades improving safety and convenience. The company hopes to begin bringing Earthlings to the International Space Station in late 2018. Nowhere is the "less is more" design philosophy more true than flight suit development. Astronauts spend hours sitting in the cockpit during and after takeoff, and need to be constantly ready to spring into action in case something goes wrong. Any excess bulk restricts their ability to respond. "The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive," astronaut Eric Boe said in a statement from NASA. "It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it's simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." The new suits facilitate that readiness with a number of simplifications over the last generation pumpkin suits. At 30 to 60 percent lighter, depending on accessories, the sleeker outfit allows astronauts considerably more freedom. Updated shoulder cuffs provide additional flexibility, even when pressurized. Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Developers hope, however, that like a backup parachute such features will never be fully put to the test. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life support systems," said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." Despite being hailed as a space suit, Boeing blue shares more DNA with the flight suits worn by high-altitude pilots than the iconic white extravehicular mobility units used for spacewalks, Wired reports. While those mini-spacecraft have to regularly provide extended life support as well as the ability to get around while shielding astronauts from radiation, the new suits are intended only to get astronauts through a pinch, as revealed by their Apollo-era nickname, the "get me down quick suit." In addition to a simplified design, the new suit sports various technical upgrades as well. Reebok upgraded built-in booties, and the old bowl-shaped helmet has been replaced with a soft hoodie made from the same knitted nylon as the rest of the suit. Tablet and smartphone friendly gloves will allow astronauts to operate the touchscreen controls that have replaced many of the switches and dials of yore. NASA retired the space shuttle program in 2011, after which America has relied exclusively on the Russian Soyuz capsule to access the International Space Station. To end this dependence on foreign toil, NASA has signed contracts with Boeing and SpaceX to develop the capacity to get astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. Like the Starliner, the SpaceX's Dragon development has taken longer than expected, but the aeronautics newcomer hopes to start flights in 2018, two years before the date Russia has threatened to stop shuttling Americans to the ISS. SpaceX's own space suit is also under development and is expected to have a similarly heroic look. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

The Boeing Blue spacesuit is 40% lighter than previous suits and features touchscreen-friendly gloves. The spacesuit is designed for use in missions to and from low-Earth orbit and is equipped to protect astronauts during launch and return. “Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle,” said Boeing director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems Chris Ferguson. Boeing’s new spacesuit will be worn by the crew of its Starliner spacecraft, which can accommodate seven passengers and is designed for missions in low-Earth orbit – including ferrying passengers to and from the International Space Station.

News 3 0 0 January 25, 2017 Dow Jones Industrial Average Hits Stock Market Record High Of 20,000: Why Are People Freaking Out? Amanda Katherine People are freaking out right now because the Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 20,000 points for the first time in stock market history. According to Mic, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is considered to be a snapshot of where the stock market is headed because the index includes a lot of the country’s largest and most profitable companies like McDonald’s, General Electric, and IBM. Finally. #dow20k pic.twitter.com/B0LnxCEX9Z — Sara Eisen (@SaraEisen) January 25, 2017 The index first topped 19,000 on November 22. The past month and a half or so have been the second fastest 1,000 point run in Dow Jones Industrial Average’s history. However, the Dow does only include 30 companies, which is a fairly small sample size. Many of the stocks within the Dow are considered to be predictable and “boring.” [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] The best performing Dow stocks over the last month or two have been Goldman Sachs, Disney, and Boeing. Spikes in Caterpillar, Boeing, JPMorgan, and Travelers helped push the Dow over the 20,000 market on Wednesday. Chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, Jeff Kleintop, said that the election has definitely impacted the Dow. Cramer: To get to the next level, we need Trump’s tax breaks 1 Hour Ago | 01:50 Wall Street’s bull should keep running even after its race to Dow 20,000 from its last thousand-point milestone, but it’s much more likely to slow to a trot before it reaches 21,000. The Dow crossed 19,000 on November 22 and continued to gain, as the Trump trade swept the market higher. The best performing Dow stocks since then are Goldman Sachs, Disney, and Boeing. Gains in Caterpillar,Boeing, JPMorgan, and Travelers helped push the Dow across the 20,000 marker on the opening Wednesday. “Individual investors have started buying again, really since the election. “A psychological number like 20,000 helps to continue that trend, helps to bring in investors that have been sitting in cash and it really helps to keep the money flow coming in. “We see this as a positive year, largely because of the individual investor, and not just corporations buying back stock any more.” People are also at odds because the Dow weighs stocks with a high share price more heavily than its modern competitors like the S&P 500, which is more representative of the broader market and contains 500 stocks. A stock’s share price is pretty meaningless without taking into account the number of outstanding shares. ALERT: Dow Jones Industrial Average comes within 44 points of striking the 20,000 level https://t.co/kmLAoeL2sc pic.twitter.com/NjPIi4FZxf — CNBC (@CNBC) January 6, 2017 The 20,000-point stock market rise has been expected for a while now. Of course, not everyone is excited or obsessed over the five-figure milestone. Investor and financial writer Douglas Kass called the buzz surrounding the stock market points “asinine” on Twitter. In one word – the DJIA 20k watch is … Assinine. Stated simply. — Douglas Kass (@DougKass) January 6, 2017 Some market watchers are becoming concerned that stocks are getting too expensive and that the post-election gains have come way too fast. “Expensive” stocks have a share price that is higher than what you would expect, given the company’s profits, earnings, or whatever else. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio (CAPE) was developed by economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE is beginning to dance around the danger zone. Right now, the CAPE is around 28. The CAPE has only been this high a few times in history: before the 1929 stock market crash, the 2000 internet bubble crash, and the 2007 housing market crash. Other financial skeptics believe that the market is pricing in enthusiasm over some of President Donald Trump’s policies, including business tax breaks. However, other potential risks, like the increased possibility of a trade war or even nuclear war, have been ignored. It is likely that it will be a slow trot before the Dow reaches 21,000 points.

[Photo: Flickr/NASA on The Commons] Recent posts Here Are The 5 Scariest Revelations From Pew’s New Cybersecurity Survey Do We Need An “Unbiased” Cable News Network? Why Other People Wreck Brainstorms (And How To Stop Them) Why A CEO's Success Might Depend On Their Experience Of Board Diversity Neal Ungerleider 01.26.17 9:00 AM Earlier this month, SpaceX delivered 10 new Iridium satellites to orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket in a flawless launch from California, and then landed one of the rocket stages on a ship. It was the company's first flight since its disastrous launchpad accident in Florida this fall, which destroyed a rocket and $200 million in equipment. But the success came just days after a NASA report to Congress that again raised questions about the risks that the company's fueling procedures could pose to astronauts. The new annual report, by NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, raises concerns about SpaceX’s "load-and-go" rocket-fueling process, which calls for the fueling of super-chilled liquid oxygen to be conducted after astronauts have boarded the spacecraft, in order to keep the fuel as cold as possible. The approach is a break from conventional wisdom about space travel—typically rocket fueling occurs before a crew is aboard—and the report indicates possible challenges to that plan within NASA. This isn't the first time the panel has expressed concerns about the fueling method. After the SpaceX explosion in September, which took place during routine fueling procedures, the panel called for renewed attention to the issue, which it had raised at least once before. Even determining the level of risk posed by the rockets is challenging, according to the panel. "Despite testing at the component and subassembly level, systems often display 'emergent' behavior once they are used in the actual operational environment. We are concerned that any determination of risk associated with 'load and go' would have significant uncertainty," it said. In a statement to Fast Company, a SpaceX spokesperson reiterated the company's commitment to making its approach "the safest and most reliable possible" through its NASA-led certification process for upcoming launches, and to incorporate lessons learned through its investigation into the September explosion. The ASAP report does not comment on those lessons because it was completed before the conclusion of SpaceX's accident investigation. According to SpaceX's findings, which were issued two weeks ago and accepted by the Federal Aviation Administration, the explosion was caused by a bad reaction between liquid oxygen in the fuel tank and one of three small vessels containing very cold helium that are used to maintain pressure in the tank. The company also said it had identified "controls" against potential safety hazards and that these had been approved by NASA’s Safety Technical Review Board in July 2016. Fueling Issues SpaceX’s "load-and-go" approach to fueling, which fuels rockets only a half-hour before launch, is risky, critics say. SpaceX’s fueling technique uses a special kind of liquid oxygen; it also requires crews to board Dragon rockets before fueling begins. NASA is particularly sensitive to safety concerns: Both the Columbia and Challenger disasters resulted in the deaths of two Shuttle crews, as well as exhaustive investigations and holds on future space shuttle flights. Given past incidents, some at NASA are worried that incidents at private space travel companies could not only result in tragedy but potentially derail future public-private manned space travel partnerships. The private space contracts demand that the new capsules keep crews safe in 99.6% of missions. By that math, NASA believes that 1 out of every 270 missions could fail. In the past, NASA flew astronauts into space on its own. Since the end of the Shuttle, the U.S. has sent missions to the International Space Station by renting seats aboard Russian-flown Soyuz rockets, at around $80 million apiece. Next year, NASA intends to begin relying on SpaceX and Boeing to deliver astronauts to the ISS at a cheaper price, and to extend its relationship with other space firms like Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. Earlier this month, NASA ordered four additional flights from SpaceX and Boeing, tripling the companies' contracted missions to the ISS. The flipside of NASA’s work with the private sector, however, is less control over the inner workings of private vendors. This shift shows up in NASA's contracts. When NASA had direct control over the Space Shuttle's design specifications, they gave contractors between 10,000 and 12,000 requirements that they had to meet. By comparison, in NASA's Commercial Crew contracts, Boeing and SpaceX only have to meet 280 design requirements. The same contracts also assume a certain risk of things going catastrophically wrong; they demand that the new space capsules keep their crews safe in 99.6% of missions. By that math, NASA believes that 1 of every 270 missions could fail. NASA has to account for everything—even the mathematical likelihood of fatal incidents. NASA’s reports also raised concerns with fault tolerances on Boeing’s new Centaur rockets, which are expected to be used in NASA’s commercial crew program. In an email, Boeing spokesperson William Barksdale told Fast Company that the "ULA [United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin partnership] and Boeing are committed to mission success and flying crews safely aboard the CST-100 Starliner that will launch atop the Atlas V. The Atlas V with a Centaur upper stage has a proven track record of 100% mission success, with 68 single-engine launches. Though not all components are fault tolerant at the individual component level, the Atlas V design is robust, and can compensate for anomalies, should they occur, due to overall system redundancies and margins, to ensure mission success." In the text of the report, NASA’s panel also spoke in unusually tough language about the need to pore over investigations of SpaceX’s 2016 launchpad accident with a fine-toothed comb: "We strongly encourage NASA top management to scrutinize this issue and ensure that any decision to accept additional risk or novel risk controls with large uncertainties is justified by the value that will be gained. The decision should not be unduly influenced by other secondary factors such as schedule and budget concerns." In addition to the safety controls SpaceX is implementing, the company spokesperson also cited the Crew Dragon launch abort system, which is designed to eject astronauts to safety at the instant an anomaly is detected. CEO Elon Musk has said that the system would have been able to save any astronauts had they been aboard the rocket that exploded in September. "SpaceX has designed a reliable fueling and launch process that minimizes the duration and number of personnel exposed to the hazards of launching a rocket," said the spokesperson. "Over the last year and a half, NASA and SpaceX have performed a detailed safety analysis of all potential hazards with this process . . . As needed, any additional controls will be put in place to ensure crew safety, from the moment the astronauts reach the pad, through fueling, launch, and spaceflight, and until they are brought safely home." The company said it also recently met with the International Space Station Advisory Committee, and its chair, Maj. Gen. Thomas Stafford, "to provide them detailed information on our approach and answer a number of questions." The report arrived the same week that the Wall Street Journal published leaked SpaceX financial numbers from 2015, showing a $260-million loss following another incident, the explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket shortly after its launch in 2015, as well as big expectations for its satellite-based internet service. It also came days before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, whose administration has signaled an interest in public-private space collaborations and who has invited SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to be an advisor. On Tuesday, Musk met with Trump and other CEOs for a third time. In an investor note last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described the benefit of the "important line of communication" Musk has with Trump. "We believe this level of coordination with the new administration could actually evolve into greater strategic value than with the prior administration," Jonas wrote. SpaceX's next two launches—a commercial satellite scheduled for January 30th and a resupply mission to the International Space Station in February—will occur at Kennedy Space Center's historic Launch Complex 39A. It will mark the first use of the launch pad that sent humans to the Moon since the days of the Space Shuttle. Never miss a story.

Four years later, Ed White completed the first US spacewalk in a puffy white jumpsuit that made him look like the Michelin Man. In the space shuttle era, astronauts wore bright orange “pumpkin suits.” Effective and protective, but not terribly stylish. Boeing hopes to change that with a cobalt number called Boeing Blue. Astronauts will wear the sleek suit as they rocket to the International Space Station aboard the Boeing Starliner next year. The bright blue onesie does away with the fishbowl helmet in favor of a hoodie secured with a pressurized zipper. The gloves work on touch screens. Even the booties got an upgrade from Reebok. The Boeing Blue is designed for intra-vehicular activity, meaning it’s meant for wearing inside the spacecraft. It offers a measure of protection in the event of a serious problem like sudden depressurization or a fire. Unlike a suit designed for extra-vehicular activity, it can’t shield astronauts from micro meteoroids or keep them from being baked like a potato by solar radiation. They’ll wear it primarily during launches and re-entries, when they face the greatest risk of something going wrong. “The nickname for it in the Apollo era was the ‘get me down quick suit,’ says Nicholas de Monchaux, who wrote Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo, a book about spacesuit design.

Boeing worked with David Clark, the aerospace firm that built pressurized suits for wartime fighter pilots and astronauts in the Gemini, Apollo, and shuttle missions. The goal this time around was the same—create a suit capable of protecting astronauts from fire and sudden changes in pressure—but make it lighter, sleeker, and more comfortable. Besides the hoodie, gloves, and more flexible boots, the 20-pound suit is 10 pounds lighter than the pumpkin suit. It’s less fussy too, with fewer zippers and buckles and such to make it easier to get in and out of. And the material was designed to allow water vapor out while keeping air in, making the suit cooler. Spacesuits have an annoying habit of trying to look like anything other than a spacesuit when pressurized. “It wants to be like a basketball,” de Monchaux says. In the 1950s, David Clark found a solution while knitting on an airplane: link-net, a knitted nylon material acts like a flexible cast, helping the suit retain its shape. Boeing Blue features a similar technology that features extra material at the joints to allow greater range of motion. The suits must face a battery of tests before they’re certified for launch next year, an important reminder that a spacesuit, no matter the material, color, or fit, must do one thing: Make sure astronauts reach space and return home safely.

(Courtesy Boeing) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Space Business January 26, 2017 Athleisure for astronauts? Boeing has unveiled new lightweight spacesuits that could make their launch-pad debut as early as next year, when the aerospace company’s CST-100 Starliner space capsule is scheduled to take its first manned test flight and, eventually, carry astronauts to the International Space Station. CST-100 Starliner Space Suit (Courtesy Boeing) Unlike the bulky, white spacesuits worn on missions past, these suits more are much slimmer. In fact, Boeing says the suits weigh around 12 lbs (5.4kg)–about 40% lighter than previous suits. “We’ve simplified the suit,” said former astronaut Chris Ferguson, who helped design it. The suits come with touchscreen-friendly gloves and a soft hood-like helmet that easily can be zipped off. The fabric is water-resistant and fiber-retardant, and the suit features zippers along the sides to “make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing,” Boeing says. And say goodbye to clunky footwear. Boeing’s uniform designer, a Massachusetts-based company called David Clark, worked with Reebok to come up with a new kind of astronaut shoe that looks remarkably like a running sneaker. That’s by design, so astronauts can quickly exit the capsule if there’s an emergency. “We wanted a hybrid of a runner and a sandal and a wrestling boot and an aviator boot,” said Shane Jacobs, one of the designers at David Clark. These boots have an outer shroud that’s the same material as the spacesuit and the sole is “more like a running shoe.” They run up to the middle of the calf. Perhaps it’s a look we’ll see more often as space tourism becomes more and more of a reality.

Reuters/Benoit Tessier Qantas has planned to add Perth to London flight in March 2018 using Boeing's Dreamliner aeroplane 787, which is expected to be the longest route in operation. Boeing Regional Director of Product Marketing Justin Hale was confident in saying that the Dreamliner could cover 17-hour flight because the airline installed 236 seats instead of the usual 300 seats. The Dreamliners comes with improved cabin features that provide experience to the passengers. Windows become larger and which can be dimmed or brightened electronically. Overhead lockers become bigger that can easily swallow up carry-on luggage. The ride becomes less bumpy due to the smooth ride technology. Vice President and General Manager of Boeing’s 787 program Mark Jenks said that creating faster models are not the priority right now as fuel-efficient aircraft are the focus of the company. He said that their customers are more concern in the amount they spend on fuel as it is a huge part of their operating costs. Jenks said that Dreamliner models helped some routes to be economically viable which made the aeroplane visible in many parts of the world. He said that even in a not-so-big place like San Jose, California, the 787 model was visible flying from San Jose to Narita, Japan. Boeing cater to other airlines including Jetstar and Air New Zealand. Jetstar has been flying 787-8s since 2013, while Air New Zealand is using models of 787-9s since 2014. Boeing and its rival Airbus has been hit by a worldwide downturn in aircraft orders where Boeing sold 100 fewer aircraft in 2016. The sales were down 305 for the Airbus. Although there was a decline in sales, Jenks said that air traffic is increasing and they still feel very good about where the aircraft industry is going. He said that the market's basic dynamics did not change.  Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related British Airways to lower fare by adding 52 seats on Boeing 777 flights beginning 2018 Qantas CEO Alan Joyce shares plans for non-stop flights on Sydney-Paris & Melbourne-Rome routes using Boeing 787 Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Australian Open 2017: Boris Becker predicts Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal final 0 Shares 2 ‘Better Call Saul’ season 3: Return of another ‘Breaking Bad’ character confirmed 0 Shares 3 'Days Of Our Lives' spoilers for Jan. 23: Hope fights for her life; Chloe comes clean to Brady but refuses to give up the baby 0 Shares 4 Dell XPS 15 vs Apple MacBook Pro 2016 0 Shares 5 Golden State Warriors vs Miami Heat live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Mr Willoughby cast 0 Shares 7 'Outlander' season 3 will be like a 'wee treasure hunt' 0 Shares 8 Rafael Nadal vs Grigor Dimitrov live stream: Watch Australian Open 2017 semi-final online, start time, betting odds 0 Shares 9 ‘Vikings’ season 4 episode 19, 20 leaked reportedly 0 Shares 10 ‘The X-Files’ season 11 expected to premiere in 2018 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Optus closes $75 million deal with Flight Centre Dreamworld tragedy: Weak attendance at theme parks affecting Village Roadshow Pumpkin Patch to shutter all stores by mid-February OpenText director reveals user context is key to achieving workplace efficiency Qantas order Boeing 787 Dreamliner for long flights Australia's houses and apartments below $1 million More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance 5-year-old dies from suspected methadone overdose Bourke St tragedy: Friends, family come together to honour the victims Sydney weather: few more warm nights ahead Police officers attacked, taken to hospital while arresting carjackers in Qld Claremont serial killings: Bradley Edwards appears in court for second time One dead, seven injured after bus crashes, rolls over on NSW highway More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Los Angeles Lakers vs Utah Jazz live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time NBA Trade News: Cavaliers rebuff Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Love swap WWE WrestleMania 33: Eight matches already booked, Possible WWE Royal Rumble 2017 winner Roger Federer vs Stan Wawrinka live stream: 2017 Australian Open, where to watch live, start time, preview, betting odds NBA Trade News: Clippers likely to acquire Carmelo Anthony without losing Big 3 Rafael Nadal vs Grigor Dimitrov live stream: Watch Australian Open 2017 semi-final online, start time, betting odds More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'The Last Of Us 2': Politics to reflect Neil Druckmann's views 'Grand Theft Auto 6' update: Map and protagonist possibilities 'Kingdom Hearts 3': Game artist promises high quality for next chapter 2017 Year of the Fire Rooster: Meaning, characteristics of Fire Rooster ‘Pokemon Sun and Moon’ & Nintendo 3DS keep fans busy ‘Pokemon GO’ big update anytime soon More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Days Of Our Lives' spoilers for Jan. 26: Death knocks on a Salemite’s door; things heat up between two couples ‘Neighbours’ spoilers for Jan. 26: On Australia Day, a kidnapping horrifies Ramsay Street; Paige gears up to reveal her baby’s father 'General Hospital' spoilers for Jan. 26, 2017: Liz reveals her suspicions on Tom’s murder; Sonny offers words of wisdom to Nelle 'The Young and the Restless' spoilers for Jan. 26, 2017: Reed opens up to Nikki; Cane and Billy square off; Paul fears the worst for Dylan ‘Westworld’ season 2 to reveal what really happened to Ford ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for Jan. 26: Quinn makes Ridge an offer he can’t resist; Thomas jumps into the fray More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

The blue suits, which were revealed today, combine a retro flare with a modern feel. Image: Boeing In fact, the suits look just like a smoothed out version of the blue spacesuit in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here's still from the movie: Image: MGM And here's former astronaut Chris Ferguson showing off the new Starliner spacesuit: Image: Boeing Pretty close! The major difference is that the 2001 suits had bigger helmets with sloping visors, while the new Starliner suits feature the badass domed glass visor that's reminiscent of the Apollo era. But it's not just about looks. "The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive," astronaut Eric Boe said in a press release. "It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it's simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." Image: Boeing While there's no telling how the suits would hold up against a maniacal robot, they're more than equipped to handle the conditions of the Starliner, which will bring astronauts to the International Space Station in 2018. New features include an upgraded helmet, which is incorporated into the spacesuit, touchscreen-sensitive gloves, and built-in ventilation. Image credit: NASA / Boeing Boeing was fastidious about the suit's details. Astronauts were instructed to do some sort of jazzercise ritual in and out of a Starliner mockup to test comfort and flexibility. Alas, it worked. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life support systems," Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA's Commercial Crew Program said. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." Image: Boeing The new suits won't negate the need for their bulkier older siblings — the launch-and-entry suits — but at least they look cool. Just watch astronauts strut in their new suits to the stylings of Boeing's space age EDM: Comments CaptSiD @mrsid Jan 26, 2017, 11:07pm I've always thought the NASA suits were ridiculously bulky. These ones are more like what you'd expect at this stage of the 21st century. Adam Savage is going to have kittens about these suits too! Also that 2nd image is from the sequel 2010: Odyssey Two. Reply 0 dissapointedfather Guest Jan 27, 2017, 11:41am The only thing they have in common with 2001 suits is the color. And only one of the 2001 suits is close to that color. Evident by the horrible comparison photo you've posted. Come on, Post the two full suits side by side, i dare you. Your click baity title be damned. There were much better ones you could've chosen. "These newly designed space suits are outta this world" "You wont believe how these new suits will save astronauts lives while keeping them mobile" Reply 0 Join the discussion!

But Boeing has already clinched a much more important title: creator of the world’s jazziest spacesuit.  Astronauts riding the firm’s Starliner spaceship will be kitted out with a striking blue suit fitted with some pretty incredible features.  The suit is among the lightest ever developed, despite boasting an incorporated helmet and visor, trainers, touchscreen-sensitive gloves and cooling vents. Boeing The tailor-made clothing, which resembles a high-tech onesie, lets water vapour pass out, but keeps air inside, keeping the astronauts cool and safe. In the unlikely event that the Starliner loses pressure, the vents close up, pressurising the suit immediately. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” NASA The final design is the result of weeks of testing, with astronauts climbing in and out of a mock-up Starliner to ensure the suit is flexible enough to accommodate every possible position and stretch. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Boeing NASA Boe and fellow astronauts Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams are training for flight tests using spacecraft under development for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, slated for launch next year. The astronauts will board both the Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon systems over several flights, but it’s not yet clear which will be first off the launch pad.

Billings slipped by 18% at Boeing Military Aircraft, by 8% at the Network & Space Systems division and by 8% at Global Systems & Support. In all, the three units billed just USD6.9 billion compared to USD7.8 billion during the same period last year. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO, elected to paint a brighter picture in a conference call with analysts on 25 January, during which he focused on the division's performance for the entire year, which he characterised as "solid." Boeing officials highlighted the US State Department's approval of pending international sales of F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait respectively, as well as CH-47 Chinooks and AH-64 Apache helicopters to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Science / Boeing shows off spacesuit of the future Boeing shows off spacesuit of the future Jon Martindale 2 days ago Science Boeing has debuted a new design for spacesuits to be worn by astronauts aboard its planned Starliner crew capsule. They are a fancy blue colour, hence the name, “Boeing Blue,” and are much lighter, whilst also being more flexible and still capable of pressurising in the event of an emergency. The ascent and entry suit is an important part of any ship that’s travelling to or from Low Earth Orbit. It doesn’t need to be as capable or protective as suits designed with spacewalks in mind, but must still provide protection and functionality. Boeing suggests that these new suits are just as capable as older designs, whilst improving their wearer’s ability to operate within the crew capsule. The new Boeing Blue design is said to be 40 per cent lighter than its predecessor, features zips for added flexibility at the waist and makes it much easier for wearers to stand, sit and then stand again (thanks Ars). The visor features a larger field of view to improve peripheral vision and the gloves built into the suit are touch-screen compatible, which will be a necessity in the new Starliner crew capsule. While the suits might be ready to go though, the Starliner itself isn’t. As it stands Boeing plans its first crewed test flight of the capsule towards the tail end of 2018, with first operational flights not slated for any earlier than December that year. Since it has already seen delays, nobody would be surprised if that happened again. However it is competing directly with Elon Musk’s Space X. While that company’s Dragon 2 capsule has also seen delays – and explosions of its Falcon 9 rocket haven’t helped – the fact that it could begin ferrying astronauts to the ISS before Boeing could help encourage the Starliner’s development. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE. KitGuru Says: What do you think of the new spacesuits? They seem much more in keeping with contemporary space travel. Much less so than the overly bulky suits of yesteryear.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Blue suit Boeing Blue news Spacesuit Starliner Previous Facebook Messenger to begin displaying adverts Next Ghost Recon Wildlands beta coming next week Check Also TransPod partners with railway expert IKOS for Hyperloop development TransPod, the startup that plans to become the leading Hyperloop developer in the world, has … Polls Which system memory next?

The suits are customised for every astronaut, use cutting edge materials to make them as light as possible, and have gloves that can be used with modern touchscreen devices. The new spacesuits have convenient zippers to change the configuration, and can be pressurised in an emergency. The suits are improvements on the launch and entry suits worn by Space Shuttle astronauts. The suits designed by Boeing are 4.5 kg lighter than the suits used by Nasa so far, and weigh only 9 kg. The suits are lighter and more flexible because of the use of newer materials and different joint patterns. The materials used in the elbow and knee pads allow for more flexibility. The helmet, visor and boots are integrated into the suit itself, and are not detachable. The old shuttle suits used by Nasa. This is the STS-126 mission by the Endeavor Shuttle. Image: Nasa. There are vents to cool the astronaut, and the water vapour build up within the suit is removed without removing the air. The cooling mechanism keeps the astronauts from overheating, without compromising on their safety. The astronauts have been training in mockups of the Starliner, to ensure that they can perform all the required operations while wearing the suits. As part of the preparations, the astronauts climb in and out of the suit repeatedly and try out different positions. Eric Boe testing the new suit in a cabin mockup of the Boeing Starliner. Image: Nasa. Astronaut Eric Boe said, “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive. It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Eric Boe, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Sunita Williams are the astronauts preparing for commercial missions to man the International Space Station.

The Dragon spacecraft from SpaceX and the Starliner from Boeing are currently part of the Commercial Crew Program. The spacecraft can take up four astronauts at a time to the space station, allowing for a total crew of seven at any single point of time. This will allow more scientific experiments to be conducted. Flight tests for the Starliner with astronauts on board are expected to be begin in 2018.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Space Boeing reveals light and stylish spacesuit for Starliner astronauts David Szondy 6 pictures Former astronaut Chris Ferguson in the Boeing Blue spacesuit (Credit: Boeing)View gallery - 6 images When the Boeing CST-100 Starliner takes to space in 2018, its passengers and crew will be a little more stylish and a little cooler than their NASA predecessors. The company has unveiled its Boeing Blue spacesuit, which will be worn by astronauts flying to and from the International Space Station and features numerous innovations to improve both the comfort and protection of modern space travelers. The Boeing Blue isn't intended for anything as ambitious as going on spacewalks or strutting around on the surface of Mars. Instead, it's an emergency suit similar to the bulky orange suits worn by the Shuttle astronauts to protect them in the event of a sudden cabin depressurization. However, Boeing is keen to point out that its new suit is not only a bit more stylish, but is very much a state-of-the art suit for the 21st century. According to Boeing, the Blue is 40 percent the weight of current NASA suits, coming it at only 12 lb (5.4 kg) as opposed to 30 lb (13.6 kg). Part of these savings is from eliminating the hard helmet and neck ring in favor of a smaller soft version secured by a zipper and sporting a wider polycarbonate visor for better visibility when pressurized. In addition, there is an integrated communications system in the helmet to keep the astronauts in touch with mission control and one another. Under the blue outer covering is a new layered fabric that includes a more breathable design for the suit and boots to keep astronauts cool without the need for external cooling systems under normal conditions. There are also zips in the torso to allow the wearer to move from sitting to standing comfortably. Since this is the digital age, the lighter gloves of the Boeing Blue also include touchscreen-friendly surfaces to allow the astronauts to use their devices and touch displays in space. "Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle," says Chris Ferguson, Boeing director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems and a former NASA astronaut.

Poseidon Agreement Strengthens U.S., U.K. Maritime Aviation Cooperation - Irish Sun Issue 028/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Poseidon Agreement Strengthens U.S., U.K. Maritime Aviation Cooperation U.S. Defense Department Thursday 26th January, 2017 WASHINGTON, Jan. 25, 2017 - Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work today signed a P-8A maritime patrol aircraft declaration with British Defense Minister for Procurement Harriett Baldwin to further strengthen the uniquely close defense relationship between the U.S. and the U.K., according to a Defense Department news release. The British Royal Air Force is purchasing nine Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to be based in RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland. Pictured here, a P-8A Poseidon aircraft departs Boeing Field in Seattle, heading to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla., Nov. 20, 2014. The aircraft joined other Poseidon aircraft as part of the War Eagles of Patrol Squadron 16, the Navy's first operational P-8A squadron. This flight marked the delivery of the 19th long-range maritime patrol aircraft to the Navy. The multi-mission aircraft, based on the next-generation Boeing 737-800 platform, provides anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and will replace the Navy P-3 Orion fleet.

U.S. Navy photo Download Image Image details page Delivering on the commitment of the 2015 Strategic Defense and Security Review, the U.K. is purchasing nine Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to be based in Royal Air Force Lossiemouth, Scotland, the release said. The aircraft will add to the U.K.'s surveillance capabilities, including conducting anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, search and rescue and intelligence gathering. In 2019, the U.K. will receive delivery of its first P-8A Poseidon aircraft and both nations have committed to deepen their defense cooperation when operating in the North Atlantic region, according to the release. U.S.-U.K. Security Partnership Work said in the release, "Today's signing of the declaration on P-8A Poseidon bilateral cooperation exemplifies the importance and strength of the U.S.-U.K. partnership. This cooperation agreement ensures and deepens our interoperability and maritime patrol capabilities. Together, the U.S. and U.K. will continue to deter regional threats and maintain a robust military posture." Through seeking opportunities to share logistics and support bases and optimize the use of P-8A aircraft, particularly in Europe, the declaration should ensure increased value for money and operational effectiveness, the release said. Baldwin said, "The United States is our pre-eminent ally in global defense and collective security. This declaration is further evidence of how our two countries continue to cooperate and build mutual security, particularly in the North Atlantic region. Backed by a rising defense budget and a [$224 billion] equipment plan, the P-8A program will provide us with enhanced surveillance capabilities." NATO Alliance As leading members of NATO, the U.K. and U.S. are committed to the collective defense of each other and their allies, the release said. The two nations also have pledged to deepen defense cooperation, bilaterally and within the alliance, to further improve the ability to operate together in exercises and operations. The declaration provides a new opportunity to maximize value for money for the taxpayer and continue to strengthen U.S.-U.K. interoperability, and to pursue efficiencies in operations and support, including at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, where the P-8A will bring some 400-plus jobs. The Defense Department and the U.K. Ministry of Defense plan to cooperate closely on operation of their P-8A aircraft in the North Atlantic to ensure a coherent approach to maritime partrol aircraft activity, the release said. The RAF has ensured that the U.K. has maintained the skills needed to operate the P-8As through the 'seed-corn' program, which has embedded former RAF military patrol aircraft operators within the maritime patrol aircraft squadrons of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S, the release said. Air Commodore Ian Gale, the senior responsible owner for the U.K.'s Poseidon P-8A program, said, "This agreement will enhance the U.K.'s maritime patrol capability and further strengthen U.K.-U.S. defense relations. The arrival of the Poseidon P-8A in 2019 will provide the U.K. with significantly increased capabilities and bring hi-tech employment to Scotland and the wider U.K." This agreement follows British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon's recent visit to Norway, where he also committed to cooperate on maritime patrol aircraft operations, ensuring that the U.K. will continue to play a key role in delivering collective maritime security across the globe, according to the release.

Featured Story Brexit dampens predictions of Irish growth DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Bank has cut down the growth forecast for this year despite the country showing resilience to Brexit. This is due to the fact that risks lie ahead as hard Brexit deal looms large.  Moreover, Irish-owned manufacturing industries had witnessed a slackening of demand even before the sharp slump in the Sterling. According to the Central Bank, it has received 100 inquiries from U.K.-based banks and investment funds that were considering relocation to somewhere else in the EU. It has been revealed that Barclays Bank had decided that Dublin will be its main hub inside the EU after Brexit.  The bank also plans on adding about 150 staff to its operations here, in case U.K.-based finance companies lose easy access to the EU market.  This however, could lead to a rise in house prices, as foreign employees seek homes in Ireland. Chief economist at the Central Bank has noted that an influx of foreign bank personnel could affect house prices because there is a shortage of supply.  Ireland would need more than 25,000 new homes a year to meet demand. The Chief Economist said that the outlook for the Irish economy was a “mixed bag” as more jobs and wage increases would raise domestic demands, despite risks from a hard Brexit deal. The bank cut its GDP forecast to 3.3 percent from 3.6 percent because of the effect of slower global growth on Irish exports.  The bank further predicts growth to slow to 3 percent in 2018. The chief economist noted that it was “implausible” for the Irish economy to fare worse than U.K. under a hard Brexit.  Meanwhile, Barclays is making its contingency plans so it can continue serving EU clients in the case that Theresa May fails to strike a deal preserving London’s access to EU’s markets. Barclays has hired staff for positions of senior managers, derivatives specialists, currency traders, compliance and human resources staff in Dublin. Additionally, Merrion Capital reported that it is more cautious of stocks overall because of the huge rally by stock markets after the election of Donald Trump.  According to the company, U.S. tax cuts could lead to a rise in earnings of U.S. companies, however, Trump’s ‘America First’ policy may lead to higher tariffs.

King Salman and his son, Defence Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, watched the spectacle as graduates of the King Faisal Air College performed military marches and fighter jets swooped overhead. The Obama administration approved the $60 billion deal in 2010 amid mounting U.S. and Saudi tensions with Iran. The deal dwarfed previous multibillion-dollar sales to Saudi Arabia, which for years has been the biggest U.S. arms buyer. In addition to the 84 Boeing F-15SA fighters, the deal included orders for upgrades to Saudi Arabia's 70 older F-15s, HARM AGM-88 Anti-Radiation Missiles, Laser JDAM and Enhanced Paveway munitions and related equipment and services. The sale was a major win for Boeing, which has faced competition from Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter. Boeing also clinched weapons sales to Qatar and Kuwait last year. "The F-35 was displacing all other players. But fourth generation production models, especially Boeing F-15s, are going to have a longer life than predicted," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group. Riyadh placed its order for the fighter jets to support its chief foreign policy goal of rolling back Iranian influence around the region, according to statements by U.S. officials at the time. Six years later, questions linger about how such expensive hardware will help the kingdom win wars in places like Yemen, where it has struggled to confront what it sees as Iranian expansion since intervening in the civil war in March 2015. Riyadh accuses Iran of backing Yemen's Shi'ite Houthi rebels, who ousted the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital over two years ago. Despite a near-daily campaign of air strikes, Saudi Arabia has yet to impose its will on its southern neighbour. The Houthis and allied forces continue to control Sanaa and much of the rest of Yemen's north. The rebels regularly attack Saudi soldiers at border checkpoints and fire missiles that sometimes reach deep into Saudi territory. "There's no question that impressive equipment has been a boon to the Saudi-led coalition," said Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "But ultimately, state of the art weaponry is one thing and the situation on the ground is another."

Its innovative layers will keep astronauts cooler as well. The touchscreen-friendly gloves allow astronauts to interact with the capsule's tablets while the boots are breathable and slip resistant".   "Zippers in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing. In addition to protecting astronauts during launch and the return to Earth, the suit also helps connect astronauts to ground and space crews through the communications headset within the helmet", they continued. Adding: "The suit's hood-like soft helmet sports a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space".   NEWS SOURCES:Boingboing.net Recommended for You Your smartphone could soon detect cancer, thanks to...

With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, they will gradually be introduced on a number of routes from the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub beginning March 1. The 299-seat Dreamliners will be deployed on daily year-round scheduled services to Amman and Beirut, as well as to Beijing, Shanghai and Seoul. In addition, the 787-9 will operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months. Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 10 Boeing 787-9s to nine destinations – Düsseldorf, Zurich, Perth, Brisbane, Tokyo, Singapore, Riyadh, Johannesburg and Washington – from Abu Dhabi. With a further 61 Dreamliners due to be delivered over the next few years, the 787s will become Etihad Airways’ flagship long-haul aircraft. Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways Chief Executive Officer, said: “Since introducing our first 787 into commercial service almost two years ago, we have enjoyed excellent feedback from guests on our ground-breaking cabin interiors that have set a benchmark for high service levels in the region and across the world. “With the additional cities joining our 787 network during 2017, we are giving more guests the opportunity to fly on our next generation aircraft.” He added: “Today’s travellers are increasingly looking for greater comfort, higher standards, more choice and better convenience as priorities in their decision-making and we, at Etihad Airways, are striving to meet their high expectations through innovations such as introducing new planes to the fleet and continuing to upgrade our routes.” Etihad Airways’ Boeing 787-9s include highly-acclaimed interiors featuring 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats, offering superior levels of comfort, entertainment and in-flight connectivity. On-board décor and lighting have been inspired by contemporary modern Arabian design, complementing the signature ‘Facets of Abu Dhabi’ identity introduced by the airline during its livery relaunch in 2014.

PHOTO: REUTERS RIYADH: Saudi Arabia flaunted its new F-15SA fighter jet at an airshow in Riyadh on Wednesday, demonstrating that it has begun receiving items purchased six years ago in the priciest-ever US arms sale to a foreign country. King Salman and his son, Defence Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, watched the spectacle as graduates of the King Faisal Air College performed military marches and fighter jets swooped overhead. The Obama administration approved the $60 billion deal in 2010 amid mounting US and Saudi tensions with Iran. The deal dwarfed previous multibillion-dollar sales to Saudi Arabia, which for years has been the biggest US arms buyer. In addition to the 84 Boeing F-15SA fighters, the deal included orders for upgrades to Saudi Arabia’s 70 older F-15s, HARM AGM-88 Anti-Radiation Missiles, Laser JDAM and Enhanced Paveway munitions and related equipment and services. The sale was a major win for Boeing, which has faced competition from Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter. Boeing also clinched weapons sales to Qatar and Kuwait last year. Saudi Arabia unveils next-generation F-15 warplane “The F-35 was displacing all other players. But fourth generation production models, especially Boeing F-15s, are going to have a longer life than predicted,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group. Riyadh placed its order for the fighter jets to support its chief foreign policy goal of rolling back Iranian influence around the region, according to statements by US officials at the time. Six years later, questions linger about how such expensive hardware will help the kingdom win wars in places like Yemen, where it has struggled to confront what it sees as Iranian expansion since intervening in the civil war in March 2015. Riyadh accuses Iran of backing Yemen’s Shia Houthi rebels, who ousted the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital over two years ago. Despite a near-daily campaign of air strikes, Saudi Arabia has yet to impose its will on its southern neighbour. The Houthis and allied forces continue to control Sanaa and much of the rest of Yemen’s north. The rebels regularly attack Saudi soldiers at border checkpoints and fire missiles that sometimes reach deep into Saudi territory. “There’s no question that impressive equipment has been a boon to the Saudi-led coalition,” said Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “But ultimately, state of the art weaponry is one thing and the situation on the ground is another.” Read more: Boeing , F-15SA fighter jet , Saudi Arabia Read full story Recommended Stories Saudi Arabia unveils next-generation F-15 warplane A missile was attached to the belly of the plane displayed against the backdrop of a giant Saudi flag IS ties : 13 Pakistanis among 16 held in Saudi Arabia In late October, Saudi authorities said they had arrested eight extremists Saudi finance ministry says no fees on remittances Shura Council was considering a proposal to impose a 6% levy on expat remittances Facebook Conversations Reader Comments (4) All Comments Reader's Recommendations Munir Akram Jan 26, 2017 - 11:56AM Reply Buying bomber to kill poor Yemeni children and women and not protecting Palestinians against Israeli aggressions from time to time raises a question as to who Saudi regime belongs to !Recommend Salman Jan 26, 2017 - 1:18PM Reply Time for Iran to get a 100 Su-35 fighters from Russia.Recommend curious2 Jan 26, 2017 - 1:47PM Reply Seems like overkill against Iran which is still flying planes from the 70’s.Recommend FAZ Jan 26, 2017 - 5:34PM Reply Professionalism in any armed force, cannot be bought.

They went from riding horses to flying aeroplanes. But the sky is no longer the limit for Boeing Article Photos By Thomas Shambler Thursday, 26 January 2017 9:34 AM The Wright brothers helped popularize barnstorming, stunt flights that showcased both pilot skills and aircraft strength. In 1914, William Boeing took his first plane ride in one of these barnstormers. 1917 When the US entered World War I, Boeing shipped modified Model C's to the US Navy. It was the start of a relationship with the military that continues today. 1927 The Boeing Model 40A – which was specifically designed for the purpose of mail– began delivering post between San Francisco and Chicago. 1936 The Douglas DC-3 became the first aeroplane that turned a profit purely through passenger transport. When it was delivered, it set a standard of luxury for both United and American Airlines. 1939 Boeing was a critical asset for US forces during World War II. the P-51 Mustang was known for escorting bombers that damaged the Axis infrastructure, as did the B-29 Superfortress – which carried multiple remotely operable weapons systems. 1957 For the first time, air travel exceeded travel by rail and sea for the first time. This was helped by the introduction of the Boeing 707, a large reliable and safe passenger and cargo aircraft. 1970 A crew of 50,000 employees designed and constructed the first Boeing 747 in less than 16 months. When it went into service, it became the largest civilian aircraft in the world. 1981 The Space Shuttle Orbiter – the world's first reusable spacecraft – made its debut, and was fundamental to the construction of the ISS. 2009 After its first flight, the 787 Dreamliner reached 1,000 orders faster than any aeroplane in history, by offering more space to customers while consuming 20 percent less fuel than comparably sized planes.

Zippered helmets? Boeing reboots the spacesuit for Starliner by Alan Boyle on January 25, 2017 at 5:24 pmJanuary 25, 2017 at 5:33 pm Comments  5 Share  144 Tweet Share  12 Reddit Email Read GeekWire's weekly sports newsletter! Boeing’s Chris Ferguson, a former astronaut, models the Starliner spacesuit. (Boeing via YouTube) The spacesuit designed for astronauts riding Boeing’s Starliner space taxi makes a fashion statement for the 21st century, from its touchscreen-sensitive gloves to its color-coordinated shoes. And all of it in Boeing blue. The spacesuit made its public debut today during a media extravaganza at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson as one of the emcees. “I was essentially the model for this as they built the suit around me,” said Ferguson, who commanded the final space shuttle mission in 2011 and now serves as Boeing’s director of crew and mission systems. The CST-100 Starliner is being developed as a transport vehicle for NASA crews heading to and from the International Space Station. There’s a chance that Ferguson could take a ride as a Boeing test pilot, but for now, the composition of the initial crews is up in the air. NASA has tapped four current astronauts – Eric Boe, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams – to train for the first round of commercial flights on the Starliner as well as on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. All four of those astronauts have been involved in testing the Starliner suit, which is designed for use inside the spacecraft during launch and entry. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” Boe said in a NASA report on the unveiling. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” At less than 20 pounds, the suit weighs about 10 pounds less than the traditional orange launch-and-entry suit used during the shuttle era. The material lets water vapor pass through to keep astronauts from getting drenched in sweat, while retaining the air inside the suit. NASA’s graphic highlights design features of the Starliner spacesuit. The launch-and-entry suit can’t be used during spacewalks. Extravehicular activity requires a much bulkier suit that weighs about 280 pounds. “This is really something used internally, in the spacecraft only,” Ferguson explained. The suit, designed by David Clark Company for Boeing, is meant to be pressurized in the event of an in-flight emergency. “The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft’s redundant life support systems,” said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don’t need a spacesuit. It’s like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed.” ICYMI: Watch #Boeing–@WashingtonPost Facebook live reveal of #Starliner Spacesuit + go inside mock-up: https://t.co/VWWf8PJ2Io pic.twitter.com/Ri4qGIQlUB — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) January 25, 2017 A lightweight helmet and visor are incorporated into the suit, and hang back like a hood when not in use. When the helmet’s needed, the wearer pulls it down over his or her face and simply zips it up. The suit comes with twist-on, twist-off gloves, with fingertips that are touchscreen-sensitive so that astronauts can operate the Starliner’s streamlined displays. The integrated shoes look like cross-trainers, and come in a stylish color scheme that fades from deep blue to white. Boeing and NASA will continue putting the adjustable blue suits to the test over the months of training to come. The current schedule calls for the first Starliner test flight to the space station to take place during the summer of 2018. Boeing’s Chris Ferguson stands tall in the Starliner suit.

F-15SA fighter jets are seen during a graduation ceremony and air show marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of King Faisal Air College in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser Reuters/Faisal Al Nasser By Katie Paul RIYADH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia flaunted its new F-15SA fighter jet at an airshow in Riyadh on Wednesday, demonstrating that it has begun receiving items purchased six years ago in the priciest-ever U.S. arms sale to a foreign country. King Salman and his son, Defence Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, watched the spectacle as graduates of the King Faisal Air College performed military marches and fighter jets swooped overhead. The Obama administration approved the $60 billion deal in 2010 amid mounting U.S. and Saudi tensions with Iran. The deal dwarfed previous multibillion-dollar sales to Saudi Arabia, which for years has been the biggest U.S. arms buyer. In addition to the 84 Boeing F-15SA fighters, the deal included orders for upgrades to Saudi Arabia's 70 older F-15s, HARM AGM-88 Anti-Radiation Missiles, Laser JDAM and Enhanced Paveway munitions and related equipment and services. Advertisement The sale was a major win for Boeing, which has faced competition from Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter. Boeing also clinched weapons sales to Qatar and Kuwait last year. "The F-35 was displacing all other players. But fourth generation production models, especially Boeing F-15s, are going to have a longer life than predicted," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group. Riyadh placed its order for the fighter jets to support its chief foreign policy goal of rolling back Iranian influence around the region, according to statements by U.S. officials at the time. Six years later, questions linger about how such expensive hardware will help the kingdom win wars in places like Yemen, where it has struggled to confront what it sees as Iranian expansion since intervening in the civil war in March 2015. Riyadh accuses Iran of backing Yemen's Shi'ite Houthi rebels, who ousted the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital over two years ago. Despite a near-daily campaign of air strikes, Saudi Arabia has yet to impose its will on its southern neighbour. The Houthis and allied forces continue to control Sanaa and much of the rest of Yemen's north. The rebels regularly attack Saudi soldiers at border checkpoints and fire missiles that sometimes reach deep into Saudi territory. "There's no question that impressive equipment has been a boon to the Saudi-led coalition," said Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "But ultimately, state of the art weaponry is one thing and the situation on the ground is another."

Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. Company executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump’s recent comments about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Hyundai Motor’s Profit Tumbles 39 Percent on Weak Car Sales SEOUL, South Korea (AP) – Hyundai Motor Co. reported Wednesday a 39 percent drop in its fourth-quarter income, hit by weak demand in South Korea and the United States and higher costs from strikes and sales incentives. The South Korean automaker said its net profit was 1 trillion won ($859 million) for the period, compared with 1.6 trillion won a year earlier.

White House, Trump Organization Name Ethics Advisers NEW YORK (AP) – President Donald Trump and his hotel and real estate business on Wednesday separately named ethics counselors, the latest attempt to address conflicts-of-interest concerns that arise from his decision to maintain financial ties to his company. President Trump selected Washington attorney Stefan Passantino as his White House ethics adviser. Trump’s company tapped a former George H.W. Bush campaign lawyer and a longtime company executive as in-house ethics monitors. But ethics experts, including the head of the Office of Government Ethics, have criticized the plan, saying it doesn’t do enough to ensure that Trump won’t make decisions as president that personally benefit himself, his family or his company. Contractor Says Trump Refusing To Pay for Work at D.C. Hotel WASHINGTON (AP) – An electrical subcontractor who worked on the Trump International Hotel in Washington has sued a company owned by President Donald Trump for more than $2 million, alleging it was not fully paid. AES Electrical filed its lawsuit in the District of Columbia Superior Court, the latest in a string of lawsuits involving Trump’s renovation of the historic Old Post Office building a few blocks from the White House. AES alleges that it bore increased expenses last year because of change orders and other demands from Trump’s staff. It also said it was told to accelerate the pace of work so Trump could hold a “soft opening” prior to the election.

January 25, 2017, 4:52 PM A   A Boeing shares reached an all-time high as the 787 Dreamliner emerged from a decade of losses to help the company post rising profit and weather a turbulent market for wide-body jetliners. The world’s largest planemaker is counting on the marquee carbon-fiber jet and higher output of its single-aisle 737, a workhorse with discount airlines, to bolster results this year. Boeing forecast higher cash and earnings on Wednesday, while predicting a sales decline as it makes fewer 777 aircraft. Investors, focused on Boeing’s potential cash bounty, responded favorably. The stock was the top performer among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the index climbed past 20,000 for the first time. The shares closed up 4.24 percent, or $6.81, at $167.36. The quarter’s results also were a relief compared with last year, when the company caught investors off-guard with a forecast of fewer 737 deliveries. “We think this release is pretty boring — and boring is good,” Robert Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients. Boeing has pledged to return all of its cash flow to investors, repurchasing shares and bolstering its dividend as a near-record order backlog shelters the manufacturer from market shocks. The Chicago-based company is counting on improving Dreamliner profitability, resurgent defense spending and a new family of 737 narrow-body jets to counteract rising trade tensions with China and a glut of older twin-aisle planes. Boeing’s record share price also reflects a stock buyback binge last year, as the company repurchased 7 percent of its shares, said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. While the manufacturer generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations, it spent $7 billion on stock, $4.6 billion on research, $2.8 billion on dividends and $2.6 billion on property, plants and equipment. “They can’t keep spending this way and not continue to dwindle cash balances,” Ferguson said. Still, revenue will fall to a range of $90.5 billion to $92.5 billion this year, Boeing said, as the company slows production of the 777 this month and in the third quarter because of an order shortfall. Analysts had expected annual sales of $93 billion. While the cuts will mean fewer deliveries of one of Boeing’s main profit drivers, total shipments will rise as Boeing cranks up production of the 737, its main source of profit. Boeing expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial airplanes, an increase from last year’s 748. Operating cash flow will be about $10.8 billion, up from the $10.5 billion generated in 2016. Earnings adjusted for pension expenses will probably be $9.10 to $9.30 a share this year, compared with the $9.24 predicted by analysts. To keep its cash machine humming, Boeing is counting on a smooth debut for the upgraded 737 Max while it speeds output by 12 percent at its factory in Renton to a record 47 jets a month. Boeing also benefited as deferred production costs for the 787 Dreamliner fell $215 million to $27.3 billion, according to the company’s website. The planemaker reached the crossover point last year where unit costs for the cutting-edge jetliner finally fell below its sales price. Since then, the balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing’s factories. The jetliner is the first built of spun carbon-fiber composites rather than aluminum and entered commercial service in 2011, more than three years late. Fourth-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.47 a share, despite an $312 million accounting loss for an aerial tanker program, the company said. That was 15 cents more than analyst had expected. Revenue fell 1.2 percent to $23.3 billion, compared with analysts’ projection of $23.1 billion. Free cash flow was $2.23 billion, while analysts had expected $2.02 billion.

U.S. stocks closed solidly higher, lifting the Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs of their own for the second day in a row. Banks and other financial companies led the gainers, which included technology and industrials. Real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks lagged the broader market as bond yields rose. ___ Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower defence revenue DALLAS (AP) — Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defence business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts' forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. Company executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defence spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump's recent comments about the high price of new Air Force One planes. ___ Hyundai Motor's profit tumbles 39 per cent on weak car sales SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Co. reported Wednesday a 39 per cent drop in its fourth-quarter income, hit by weak demand in South Korea and the United States and higher costs from strikes and sales incentives. The South Korean automaker said its net profit was 1 trillion won ($859 million) for the period, compared with 1.6 trillion won a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were anticipating 1.5 trillion won of net income.

Kaspersky Lab on Wednesday confirmed reports in Russia's respected Kommersant newspaper that Ruslan Stoyanov, head of its computer incidents investigations unit, was arrested in December. Kommersant said that Stoyanov was arrested along with a senior Russian FSB intelligence officer and that they both face charges of treason. A spokeswoman for Stoyanov said his arrest "has nothing to do with Kaspersky Lab and its operations." ___ White House, Trump Organization name ethics advisers NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump and his hotel and real estate business on Wednesday separately named ethics counsellors, the latest attempt to address conflicts-of-interest concerns that arise from his decision to maintain financial ties to his company.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 25, 2017 at 5:18PM Image source: Getty Images Strong earnings results pushed stocks higher on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) crossed the 20,000-point mark for the first time. It and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) index both finished higher by more than 0.75%. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow 0.78% 155.80 S&P 500 0.80% 18.30 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Financial stocks were among the biggest gainers, which helped the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) rise 1.6%. In the losing column, a tick down in the price of gold sent the leveraged Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) lower by 5%. A few individual stocks did significantly better than the market on its record-notching day, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). Seagate's stabilizing business Seagate shares spiked 15% following the hard drive specialist's strong quarterly results. Revenue ticked down slightly to $2.8 billion. Earnings, on the other hand, came in well above expectations at $1.38 per share. Consensus estimates had been targeting closer to $1.08 per share. Image source: Getty Images. The business benefited from several positive trends, including declining expenses and a shift toward higher-margin high-capacity drives. As a result, Seagate managed sharply improved profitability despite lower overall demand and weakening average selling prices. "The company's product execution, operational performance, and financial results improved every quarter throughout 2016," CEO Steve Luczo said in a press release. In an accompanying presentation to investors, the company cited quarter-to-quarter gains in operating margin, from 1% in the first quarter, to 4%, 8%, and then 13% in the fourth quarter, as evidence of the stabilization of its business. Cash flow also rose to a near-record $656 million. The surging profits are making Seagate's dividend safer. The payout now represents 81% of earnings over the last six months, compared to nearly 180% in the prior-year period. That ratio should continue falling now that the company expects to earn $4.50 per share in 2017 -- up from its $2.50-per-share forecast issued in early August. Boeing's profit boost Boeing was the Dow's biggest winner, rising 5% after its quarterly earnings announcement. Revenue fell 1% for the quarter and by 2% for the full year as its defense, space, and security segments declined. Profitability jumped, though, as operating margin nearly doubled to 9.4% of sales. That improvement was the biggest factor behind the industrial giant's 64% spike in operating earnings. Image source: Boeing. Management highlighted the improved operating and financial results that allowed Boeing to plow cash back into its business while increasing dividend payments and stock buyback spending. "We led the industry in commercial airplane deliveries for the fifth consecutive year," CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a prepared statement, "and produced record operating cash flow, which fueled investment in innovation and our people and generated significant return to shareholders." Looking ahead, Boeing expects to deliver as many as 765 commercial aircraft for $63 billion of revenue at a near-10% operating margin. A further $28 billion from its defense, space, and security segment should bring total sales to about $91 billion, or 4% below 2016's result. Yet Boeing should produce far greater profits from that lower sales base. Executives are projecting earnings of $9.20 per share, up 27% from this past year's figure. Investors cheered that surprisingly high outlook by pushing the stock to a new record on Wednesday. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks lagged the broader market as bond yields rose. ___ Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower defense revenue DALLAS (AP) — Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year.

Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies helped push the Dow past the threshold early on. U.S. stocks closed solidly higher, lifting the Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs of their own for the second day in a row. Banks and other financial companies led the gainers, which included technology and industrials. Real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks lagged the broader market as bond yields rose. ___ Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower defense revenue DALLAS (AP) — Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts' forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. Company executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump's recent comments about the high price of new Air Force One planes. ___ Hyundai Motor's profit tumbles 39 percent on weak car sales SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Co. reported Wednesday a 39 percent drop in its fourth-quarter income, hit by weak demand in South Korea and the United States and higher costs from strikes and sales incentives. The South Korean automaker said its net profit was 1 trillion won ($859 million) for the period, compared with 1.6 trillion won a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were anticipating 1.5 trillion won of net income. Sales fell 1 percent to 24.5 trillion won ($21 billion). ___ Bob Evans selling its restaurants to firm for $565 million NEW ALBANY, Ohio (AP) — Bob Evans is selling its restaurants to a private equity firm for $565 million, splitting that part of the company from the food division that makes sausage, refrigerated side dishes and other convenience foods. New Albany, Ohio-based Bob Evans Farms Inc. says it's selling the restaurants to Golden Gate Capital to focus on growing the food division. It has over 500 restaurants in 18 states. It also announced it is buying Pineland Farms Potato Company, based in Mars Hill, Maine, for at least $115 million. ___ Senior manager at cybersecurity firm arrested in Moscow MOSCOW (AP) — A manager in charge of investigating hacking attacks at Russia's biggest cybersecurity firm has been arrested. Kaspersky Lab on Wednesday confirmed reports in Russia's respected Kommersant newspaper that Ruslan Stoyanov, head of its computer incidents investigations unit, was arrested in December. Kommersant said that Stoyanov was arrested along with a senior Russian FSB intelligence officer and that they both face charges of treason. A spokeswoman for Stoyanov said his arrest "has nothing to do with Kaspersky Lab and its operations." ___ White House, Trump Organization name ethics advisers NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump and his hotel and real estate business on Wednesday separately named ethics counselors, the latest attempt to address conflicts-of-interest concerns that arise from his decision to maintain financial ties to his company. Trump selected Washington attorney Stefan Passantino as his White House ethics adviser. Trump's company tapped a former George H.W. Bush campaign lawyer and a longtime company executive as in-house ethics monitors. But ethics experts, including the head of the Office of Government Ethics, have criticized the plan, saying it doesn't do enough to ensure that Trump won't make decisions as president that personally benefit himself, his family or his company. ___ Contractor says Trump refusing to pay for work at DC hotel WASHINGTON (AP) — An electrical subcontractor who worked on the Trump International Hotel in Washington has sued a company owned by President Donald Trump for more than $2 million, alleging it was not fully paid. AES Electrical filed its lawsuit in the District of Columbia Superior Court, the latest in a string of lawsuits involving Trump's renovation of the historic Old Post Office building a few blocks from the White House. AES alleges that it bore increased expenses last year because of change orders and other demands from Trump's staff. It also said it was told to accelerate the pace of work so Trump could hold a "soft opening" prior to the election. ___ Japan sees 1st trade surplus on cheaper oil, China rebound TOKYO (AP) — Japan posted its first trade surplus in six years in 2016 thanks to a rebound in exports and persisting low oil prices, though uncertainties over U.S. policy and global growth are overshadowing the recovery. The 4.1 trillion yen ($35.8 billion) surplus in 2016 compared with a 2.8 trillion yen deficit in 2015, the government reported Wednesday. Exports fell 7.4 percent from a year earlier to 70.04 trillion yen ($617 billion) while imports dropped 16 percent to 66 trillion yen ($581 billion), the report showed. ___ McDonald's to give away 10,000 bottles of special sauce SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — McDonald's is giving away 10,000 bottles of its trademark special sauce as an enticement to buy new versions of its Big Mac. The company is introducing the Mac Jr. and the Grand Mac, two different-sized variations of the classic sandwich. The bottles will be available Thursday at participating locations nationwide. McDonald's introduced the Big Mac in 1968.

Bonds sold off with oil. Boeing Co’s best rally in three months lifted the index for American blue chips past the round-number milestone after a handful of rallies fell short in the past month. Financial and technology shares surged as investors piled into stocks that benefit from economic growth. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes topped 2.50 per cent. The US dollar slipped, raising concern that the reflation trade in currencies may have run its course. The Mexican peso surged the most in 11 months even as Donald Trump ordered construction of a border wall. Oil fell on increased US stockpiles. “With a swift move towards signing executive orders, coupled with underlying positive economic data, clarity has begun to hit the headlines, and all the US indexes are celebrating,” Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc. said. “Clarity is the markets’ oxygen.” Corporate earnings bolstered the bullish sentiment toward equities, with Boeing the latest company to post results that topped expectations. The Dow is up 1.7 per cent since Trump’s inauguration as he took steps to fulfill pro-growth campaign promises, including identifying possible infrastructure projects, approving two oil pipelines and cajoling American carmakers to build plants in the US Other global-growth signals such as rising bond yields are feeding higher bank lending margins, and re-invigorated spending is boosting consumer cyclicals. Stocks The Dow rose 155.12 points to 20,067.83 at 4pm in New York, the first close above the round number. The rise from 19,000 was the second-fastest 1,000-point run in the measure’s history. It’s up 9.5 per cent since Trump’s election. Boeing led gains in the index, rising 4.2 per cent to an all-time high after reporting a profit. The S&P 500 Index jumped 0.7 per cent to a record 2,295.95. Industrial, technology and financial shares led gains. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 1.3 per cent, while Germany’s DAX rose to the highest level since May. Personal computer maker Logitech International SA led Europe’s stock gains after beating quarterly profit estimates, surging 16 per cent. Banco Santander SA rose 3.4 per cent on better-than-expected quarterly profits. Bonds The yield on the 10-year Treasury added five basis points to 2.52 per cent, the highest level of the year. Yields reached session highs after a US$34 billion (RM150.3 billion) five-year note auction stopped at 1.988 per cent, about 1.2 basis points above where the note was quoted in when-issued trading at the 1pm New York time bidding deadline. The yield on the benchmark Bund due in a decade rose six basis points to 0.46 percent, the highest level in a year. Currencies The greenback weakened against all its Group of 10 peers except the Australian dollar, as the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index resumed its slide. It fell 0.3 per cent and is poised for a fifth straight weekly decline. Losses were steepest against the Canadian dollar and the British pound. The positive correlation between the dollar and Treasury yields, which touched 93 per cent on Nov 1, the highest in three years, has now declined to less than 54 per cent. That in turn has helped spur gains in high-yielding, commodity currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars. The Mexican peso gained more than one per cent even as Trump took action to advance a border wall. Commodities The Bloomberg Commodity Index, which measures returns on raw materials, fell 0.4 per cent. Gold futures tumbled one per cent to US$1,201.90, for a second day of declines as optimism around corporate earnings fueled risk appetite. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 0.8 per cent to drop below US$53 a barrel. It settled at US$52.75 a barrel after a US government report showed crude and fuel inventories increased. Opec and other oil producers are likely to comply fully with a deal to reduce supply, bringing global crude markets into balance early this year, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouk said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Stocks slip on earnings, data; dollar advances Wall Street slips after soft GDP data, earnings Zeti: Sale of 1MDB’s assets to China firm has no impact on market Microsoft’s market value tops US$500b again after 17 years Ringgit ends lower against US dollar Trump pulls US out of Pacific trade deal, loosening Asia ties (VIDEO) US dollar slides near seven-week lows on fading Trump trade Saudi Aramco shelves plans for RAPID venture with Petronas, source says Ringgit to trade softer against US dollar next week At some Singapore suburban malls, retailers confront the sound of silence Most Watched Now Week See this new clip for ‘John Wick: Chapter 2’ Reuters Video: Arsenal's Wenger receives four match touchline ban Reuters Video: Iranian actress boycotts Oscars over Trump policy Reuters Video: Mexicans build makeshift wall around US embassy in Trump protest Reuters Video: President Trump, Melania share 'first dance' Reuters Video: Marketing experts on how best to spend money, time, energy in 2017 Related Articles KL shares open higher Asian stocks extend rally after Dow tops 20,000 US stocks slip with dollar as commodities rally Oil up 3pc as Brexit chances dim, US gasoline surges too Asian shares up, US dollar down after jobs report Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2USj00a ALSO READ Wall Street rises, Dow inches closer to 20,000 Banks, telecoms lead Wall Street up; another Dow record Banks lead Wall Street higher; Dow brushes against 20,000 Wall Street rises, led by banks; Dow brushes against 20,000 Earnings in focus as Apple weighs; Boeing lifts Dow Boeing reported solid fourth-quarter earnings today and forecast higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2017, while its chief dismissed fears US President Donald Trump could start a trade war. The US aerospace giant saw a 59 percent surge in earnings to USD 1.6 billion compared with final quarter of the prior year, beating expectations. The jump was due to higher commercial aircraft deliveries and a one-time charge in late 2015 that made the comparison more favorable. Boeing also said it expects commercial deliveries in 2017 to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. The report sparked a 5.0 per cent rise in Boeing shares to USD 168.43 at midday, helping to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 20,000-point milestone for the first time. Investors shrugged off some negative aspects of the Boeing results, including USD 312 million in new unexpected costs for KC-46 military tanker program, another in what has been a recurring theme in recent the company's earnings reports. The report came as the new Trump administration puts its stamp on US policies and openly pressures companies in its "America First" agenda that has sparked worries of protectionism. Boeing felt the sting of his Twitter attack in December, when Trump lambasted the company for what he said were runaway costs of the next generation presidential plane, to serve as the famed Air Force One. Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg, who met with Trump twice prior to his inauguration and pledged to work to control costs on Air Force One, said he was confident the new president's agenda would be good for Boeing and that the US would avoid a trade war. "This is all about helping business being successful," Muilenburg said in a call with reporters and analysts, adding that he was "very confident" the new administration understands the importance of not alienating China, an important Boeing market. Muilenburg endorsed pro-growth policies such as lower taxes and "fair trade" for the United States, and said higher US defense spending could boost Boeing's business.

Boeing shrugs off Trump trade fears, reports solid earnings Boeing reported solid fourth-quarter earnings today and forecast higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2017, while its chief dismissed fears US President Donald Trump could start a trade war. The US aerospace giant saw a 59 percent surge in earnings to USD 1.6 billion compared with final quarter of the prior year, beating expectations. The jump was due to higher commercial aircraft deliveries and a one-time charge in late 2015 that made the comparison more favorable. Boeing also said it expects commercial deliveries in 2017 to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. The report sparked a 5.0 per cent rise in Boeing shares to USD 168.43 at midday, helping to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 20,000-point milestone for the first time.

Muilenburg endorsed pro-growth policies such as lower taxes and "fair trade" for the United States, and said higher US defense spending could boost Boeing's business.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it January 25 AEROSPACE Boeing net income rises 59 percent Boeing beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and the company forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. On a call with analysts and reporters, Boeing executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Trump’s tweets and comments last month about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Boeing and European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitability among major world airlines, and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Pentagon and congressional support for Boeing’s key defense programs remains solid. And he said he welcomed Trump’s comments last month about one of the company’s most familiar products. Boeing said Wednesday that net income in the fourth quarter was $1.63 billion, up 59 percent from a year earlier. Excluding some pension expenses, the company said it earned $2.47 per share from its core businesses. That surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by FactSet and 10 by Zacks Investment Research was $2.34 per share. Revenue fell 1 percent to $23.29 billion, which was better than the FactSet forecast of $23.13 billion but below the Zacks average of $23.45 billion. For 2017, Boeing predicted earnings between $9.10 and $9.30 per share, compared with the FactSet survey average of $9.25 per share. The company pegged revenue at between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion with declines expected in both commercial and defense sides of the business. The FactSet analysts expect $92.96 billion. — Associated Press TECHNOLOGY AT&T income drops to $2.44 billion AT&T Inc, the No. 2 wireless carrier, reported quarterly revenue below analysts’ estimates as it struggles to cope with intense competition in the wireless market. AT&T said last week that it added more than 200,000 paying subscribers to its video streaming service DirecTV Now and about 900,000 branded wireless subscribers in the latest quarter. Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.44 billion, or 39 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $4.01 billion, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue fell marginally to $41.84 billion, missing the average estimate of $42.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. — Reuters Also in Business ● Qualcomm reported a 3.9 percent rise in quarterly revenue, boosted by strong demand for its chips used in smartphones, at a time when the company is facing multiple legal challenges over its alleged “anticompetitive” tactics. Net income attributable to the company more than halved, to $682 million, or 46 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 25, from $1.50 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. ● Norfolk Southern on Wednesday reported a higher fourth-quarter net profit on cost savings and said strong pricing and an expected rebound in coal volumes should help the railroad’s business grow in 2017. The Virginia company reported fourth-quarter net income of $416 million, or $1.42 per share, up 18 percent from $361 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $2.49 billion from $2.52 billion, but expenses declined to $1.73 billion from $1.88 billon. ● Hyundai Motor recorded its lowest quarterly profit in about five years, hurt by the cost of steep discounts on small sedans, and cautioned that it expected more uncertainty ahead as competition and protectionism increase. The company reported a fourth-quarter net profit of 1 trillion won ($858.07 million), down 39 percent from a year ago and the lowest since the first quarter of 2012. — From news services Coming Today ● 8:30 a.m.: Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims. ● 10 a.m.: Freddie Mac releases weekly mortgage rates. ● 10 a.m.: Commerce Department releases new-home sales for December. ● Earnings: Alphabet, Caterpillar, Comcast, Ford Motor, Microsoft, Starbucks and Southwest Airlines. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Roston - Jan 25, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Boeing has taken the wraps off its new Starliner spacesuit for the first time, giving the public its first look at the suit that astronauts will wear on their way to the International Space Station. The spacesuit will be worn by travelers hitching rides to and from low-Earth orbit destinations (like the ISS) via the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. Unlike traditional spacesuits, Boeing’s creation is rather minimalist and very blue. Traditionally, spacesuits have been bulky and heavy, weighing somewhere around 30lbs with a large neck ring and other things. In contrast, Boeing’s suit weighs about 12lbs — or, more accurately, it is about 40-percent lighter than usual. As well, these spacesuits are highly saturated blue rather than white or bright orange. Despite being simplified, the Starliner spacesuit is airtight and generally considered an improvement over past spacesuits — and, Boeing says, it is ‘cooler’ in comparison. There’s no external cooling needed due to the specialized design, and the helmet is smaller, with a zipper controlling the opening and closing. The air hoses, meanwhile, are on the torso portion of the suit. The gloves are also highlighted as unique with advanced materials for interacting with tablets and other devices with touch screens. These are joined by the sleek-looking boots, which are both slip-resistant and breathable. Finally, there’s a communication headset within the helmet, which is itself made from polycarbonate with a wide angle visor.

Executive Mosaic POC Executive Biz GovCon Executive Executive Gov GovConExec GovConIndex GovConVideo GovCon Wire Your Direct Source for Government Contracting News Home Contract Awards Executive Moves Financial Report M&A Activity Press Releases Weekly Roundup Advertise About GovConIndex Home / Financial Report / January 25 Market Close: GovCon Index Higher on Boeing Earnings Beat, Textron Miss Weighs January 25 Market Close: GovCon Index Higher on Boeing Earnings Beat, Textron Miss Weighs Ross Wilkers January 25, 2017 Financial Report, News 25 Views Executive Mosaic’s GovCon Index held onto its gain Wednesday with help from Boeing (NYSE: BA) on the airplane maker’s fourth quarter results above analyst forecasts to offset the decline by Textron (NYSE: TXT) after its October-December figures disappointed Wall Street. U.S. stocks by comparison hit all-time highs again in comparison as the S&P 500 composite index set a new record close with financials the top performers and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended above 20,000 for the first time ever on contributions from Boeing, Goldman Sachs and IBM. GovCon Index gainers slightly edged decliners 16-to-14 and three of its 11 S&P 500 companies advanced with co-listed Boeing the top net performer and fellow GCI-S&P stock Textron the largest laggard. Boeing posted fourth quarter earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street’s expectations and said it expects to increase commercial aircraft deliveries this year to 760-765 from the 748 recorded in 2016. A $201 million aftertax charge on the U.S. Air Force KC-46A aerial refueling tanker program and full-year guidance below analysts’ forecast did not deter the stock’s climb. Defense and industrial conglomerate Textron’s fourth quarter top- and bottom-line results both missed Wall Street’s expectations and fell from the prior year period.

The British Royal Air Force is purchasing nine Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to be based in RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland. Pictured here, a P-8A Poseidon aircraft departs Boeing Field in Seattle, heading to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla., Nov. 20, 2014. The aircraft joined other Poseidon aircraft as part of the War Eagles of Patrol Squadron 16, the Navy's first operational P-8A squadron. This flight marked the delivery of the 19th long-range maritime patrol aircraft to the Navy. The multi-mission aircraft, based on the next-generation Boeing 737-800 platform, provides anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and will replace the Navy P-3 Orion fleet.

U.S. Navy photo Download Image Image details page Delivering on the commitment of the 2015 Strategic Defense and Security Review, the U.K. is purchasing nine Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to be based in Royal Air Force Lossiemouth, Scotland, the release said. The aircraft will add to the U.K.’s surveillance capabilities, including conducting anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, search and rescue and intelligence gathering. In 2019, the U.K. will receive delivery of its first P-8A Poseidon aircraft and both nations have committed to deepen their defense cooperation when operating in the North Atlantic region, according to the release. U.S.-U.K. Security Partnership Work said in the release, “Today's signing of the declaration on P-8A Poseidon bilateral cooperation exemplifies the importance and strength of the U.S.-U.K. partnership. This cooperation agreement ensures and deepens our interoperability and maritime patrol capabilities. Together, the U.S. and U.K. will continue to deter regional threats and maintain a robust military posture.” Through seeking opportunities to share logistics and support bases and optimize the use of P-8A aircraft, particularly in Europe, the declaration should ensure increased value for money and operational effectiveness, the release said. Baldwin said, “The United States is our pre-eminent ally in global defense and collective security. This declaration is further evidence of how our two countries continue to cooperate and build mutual security, particularly in the North Atlantic region. Backed by a rising defense budget and a [$224 billion] equipment plan, the P-8A program will provide us with enhanced surveillance capabilities.” NATO Alliance As leading members of NATO, the U.K. and U.S. are committed to the collective defense of each other and their allies, the release said. The two nations also have pledged to deepen defense cooperation, bilaterally and within the alliance, to further improve the ability to operate together in exercises and operations. The declaration provides a new opportunity to maximize value for money for the taxpayer and continue to strengthen U.S.-U.K. interoperability, and to pursue efficiencies in operations and support, including at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, where the P-8A will bring some 400-plus jobs. The Defense Department and the U.K. Ministry of Defense plan to cooperate closely on operation of their P-8A aircraft in the North Atlantic to ensure a coherent approach to maritime partrol aircraft activity, the release said. The RAF has ensured that the U.K. has maintained the skills needed to operate the P-8As through the ‘seed-corn’ program, which has embedded former RAF military patrol aircraft operators within the maritime patrol aircraft squadrons of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S, the release said. Air Commodore Ian Gale, the senior responsible owner for the U.K.’s Poseidon P-8A program, said, “This agreement will enhance the U.K.’s maritime patrol capability and further strengthen U.K.-U.S. defense relations. The arrival of the Poseidon P-8A in 2019 will provide the U.K. with significantly increased capabilities and bring hi-tech employment to Scotland and the wider U.K.” This agreement follows British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon’s recent visit to Norway, where he also committed to cooperate on maritime patrol aircraft operations, ensuring that the U.K. will continue to play a key role in delivering collective maritime security across the globe, according to the release.

It is designed to be comfortable while still providing functionality, with the helmet attached to the suit itself, touchscreen-sensitive gloves, and vents to keep the astronauts cooler. The 20 pound spacesuit is far lighter than other launch-and-entry suits, and its material allows water vapour to escape while keeping air inside. Scroll down for video  Boeing has unveiled the bright blue spacesuit that astronauts will wear aboard the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. It is designed to be comfortable while still providing functionality, with the helmet attached to the suit itself and touchscreen-sensitive gloves SPACESUITS TODAY The main spacesuits worn for spacewalks are called Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or EMU. But astronauts have a range of other suits they wear for different activities. The Advanced Crew Escape Suit is the orange suit that astronauts wear during launch and landing of the space shuttle. This suit cannot be worn during spacewalks. Sometimes, Nasa astronauts will wear the Russian Orlan spacesuit. This suit is the Russian version of the EMU and is used for spacewalks. Another Russian suit is the Sokol. Like the Advanced Crew Escape Suit, the Sokol is designed only to be used inside a spacecraft. It is used on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. According to Boeing, the Starliner spacesuit is roughly 40 percent lighter than other suits. But, the trim design still meets NASA’s safety and functionality requirements. ‘The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,’ astronaut Eric Boe said. ‘It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing.  'Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.’ The new Starliner suit has zippers in the torso and materials in the elbows and knees that will give the astronauts a greater range of movement, and allow them to transition from standing to sitting more easily. It also has a communications headset inside of the helmet, along with a wide visor for better peripheral vision. Astronauts have been testing the suit to ensure that it meets all of their needs, climbing in and out and trying out different positions to simulate work inside of the spacecraft.

Astronauts have been testing the suit to ensure that it meets all of their needs ‘The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft’s redundant life support systems,’ said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. ‘If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don’t need a spacesuit. It’s like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed.’ According to NASA, four astronauts are now training for flight tests with the Commercial Crew Program, including Boeing’s Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. The manned tests are set to begin in 2018. The Starliner will be launched from a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, and is part of NASA’s operational Commercial Crew mission to bring astronauts to the International Space Station, allowing it to grow to seven residents ELON MUSK'S 'IRON MAN' SUIT  Mars astronauts could look more like superheroes - at least, that’s if Elon Musk gets his way. The billionaire recently hired Marvel and DC movie legend Jose Fernandez to design a spacesuit for his firm, SpaceX. Fernandez is better known for designing costumes for superheroes in films such as ‘Batman vs. Superman’ and ‘Captain America: Civil War’. Elon Musk has hired Jose Fernandez to design a spacesuit for his firm, SpaceX. Fernandez took inspiration from Musk himself, when creating the costume for Iron Man, as Tony Stark is modeled on the billionaire Fernandez took inspiration from Musk himself, when creating the costume for Iron Man, as Tony Stark is modeled on the billionaire.  A Tested video and a Bleep interview recently revealed the Fernandez is designing a ‘stylish’ and ‘heroic’ alternative to Nasa’s Z-2, spacesuit design. The Starliner will be launched from a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, and is part of NASA’s operational Commercial Crew mission to bring astronauts to the International Space Station, allowing it to grow to seven residents. The missions will be able to take up to four astronauts at a time, with Eric Boe, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Sunni Williams now in training. ‘We slogged through some of the real engineering challenges and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it’s time to get on to the rubber meeting the road,’ said former astronaut Chris Ferguson, who is now director of Crew and Mission Systems for Boeing. ‘To me, it’s a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we’ve been. ‘The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft.’ Share or comment on this article e-mail 51 shares Most watched News videos Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

Ethan Miller, Getty Images Tech Culture by Katie Collins January 25, 2017 11:44 AM PST @katiecollins Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) When I was a kid, most of those my age were glued to the TV, watching cartoons or kicking a ball around in the garden. My activity of choice was plane spotting -- a geeky spectator sport I still partake in to this day. Growing up in the English suburbs in the pre-digital era, entertainment options were limited. But I did have Manchester Airport close by and parents with a passion for planes. Together we spent many hours with our noses pushed up against the great glass windows in departures -- ah, the days before security -- to watch aircraft speed down the runway on their way to or from exotic locations across the globe. Batteries Not Included The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech is cool. Most impressive of all the beasts dipping in and out of the airport were the Boeing 747s with their bulbous double-decker front ends. Somehow these beluga humps were not ungainly, but instead gave the aircraft a proud and noble look -- think the Roman emperor effect. It was only in the past few years that I discovered a cult following for the 747. This plane, which debuted at the tail end of the 1960s, is a favorite among many aviation enthusiasts, who refer to the model as the Queen of the Skies. And so it was a real treat for this aviation geek when I had a chance to book a seat on the upper level of a 747 -- known to us enthusiasts as the "bubble" -- for my flight to the CES 2017 tech extravaganza. I was doubly excited that I would have a chance to ride on Boeing's flagship Dreamliner on the return leg. The 747, which is facing retirement at many airlines, and the shiny 787 Dreamliner, which still feels brand-new, gave me a good sense of perspective on the differences between the classic experience and the high-tech ride in the skies. Flying high on the Queen of the Skies As I walked up the stairs to get to the second level of the Virgin Atlantic 747 flight out to CES in Las Vegas, I couldn't help but feel jazzed. It's silly that something so mundane can affect me, but it did, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. It turns out, it may have been my only chance. United Airlines said last week that it would retire its 747 fleet much earlier than expected. With the exception of British Airways, which is retrofitting the interiors of its 747s for more years of service, many airlines are following in United's footsteps. The 747-8, the newest version of the airliner, introduced in 2011, hasn't been a commercial success. When I reached my window seat, I was pleased to find that the curvature of the fuselage treated me to my own storage compartment between me and the window. My row, instead of being split into three, was just six seats across with one central aisle. The quiet upper-deck economy cabin seats just 18 people, compared to the 360 or so economy passengers sitting downstairs. It felt like a much smaller, more intimate aircraft without sacrificing any of the size and stability of a high-flying jumbo. With two dedicated cabin crew, we weren't left wanting when it came to service. But when it came to tech, the 747 doesn't offer the most advanced options. My seatback touchscreen was fiddly to navigate, and over the course of 11 hours I was forced to develop a special finger waggle to make it do my bidding. In truth, I spent much of the flight on my iPad. Most airlines want to fly newer and more efficient planes, and Boeing knows it, which is why it created the Dreamliner. Dreamy tech for a peaceful flight I have one word for my experience on Virgin's Dreamliner: wow. The first thing that struck me as I boarded the plane was the roominess of the cabin and its high ceilings. The Dreamliner is all fancy mood lighting and lofty ceilings. Katie Collins/CNET With the eight-hour Newark to Heathrow hop being a night flight, I was able to experience the full force of Virgin's mood lighting on board the 787. The warm ambient colors change throughout a flight to help you sleep and wake at the right times. Admittedly, I didn't fall asleep as the lights changed, as I was too engrossed in watching "Kubo and the Two Strings," but when I finally did pass out I found that I slept peacefully and came to with more ease than I am used to. On waking up after long-haul night flights, I typically feel groggy, disorientated and dehydrated, like a shriveled bean. The view I woke up to. Katie Collins/CNET On this journey, these symptoms were notable only by their absence -- and I had tech to thank. As well as the lighting, the higher air pressure in the cabin allows for the circulation of denser air with more oxygen designed to reduce the usual dehydrating effects of air travel. The aircraft's modern twin engines were extremely quiet, which lessened the ambient noise. I set aside my iPad and embraced the in-flight entertainment, not because the options were any different from the outbound leg, but because of the tech itself. The Dreamliner replaced the 747's clunky resistive touchscreen with a shiny capacitive display that did my bidding with no objections. I charged my phone from the built-in USB port and even got a little taste of home in advance of touching down, thanks to the Dreamliner's ability to pick up a live feed of the BBC. Torn between the future and the past Dreamliner: the future of air travel. Kent German/CNET With its cavernous cabin, mood lighting and huge, dimmable picture windows, the Dreamliner delivers an elegant experience that comes closer to the way flying looks in the ads than any other aircraft I've traveled on. In the same breath, life in the 747 bubble with its personal service and intimate setting feels more akin to my preconceptions about the experience of golden-age travel. So if I had to choose to fly one or the other? In truth, my loyalty still lies with the Queen of the Skies, but knowing that Boeing 747s are not long for this world does enhance my emotional attachment to this aircraft. If, however, the Dreamliner is the future, as Boeing hopes it will be, it's a future I'm more than happy to embrace.

After posting annual results that beat analyst expectations, the Seattle-based business shares climbed almost 5pc to $167.85, fuelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s rise that saw the US benchmark index smash through the 20,000 level. Investors shrugged off worries about Boeing taking yet another pre-tax charge on the costs of its KC-46 military air-to-air tanker, this time for  $243m as design and technical issues pushed the scheme off track. The 787 is made out of advanced composite materials The share surge came as the business announced annual revenue of $94.6bn, down $1.5bn on last time round, and earnings per share of $7.24, versus the previous year’s level of $7.72. However, the final quarter performance saw core earnings leap to $2.47 per share in the from $1.60 last time. The results also confirmed that the Dreamliner, which uses advanced composite materials instead of aluminium, was finally being manufactured for less than its sales price. Airliner deliveries this year are expected to be between 760 and 765, up from 2016’s level of 748, though more of these will be the small, workhorse 737 jet, than more expensive larger aircraft. Revenues from Boeing’s defence business are expected to help offset the decline in commercial jets, with President Donald Trump widely expected to lift military spending. Donald Trump has raised the prospect of Boeing's F/A-18 jet replacing some of the fleet of F-35 jets Credit: US Navy Mr Trump has asked Boeing to price an updated version of its F/A-18 fighter, having raised concerns about “out of control costs” on the rival F-35 jet made by Lockheed-Martin. Boeing has forecast 2017 revenues of between $90.5bn and $92.5bn, delivering earnings of between $9.10 and $9.30 a share. "We think this release is pretty boring – and boring is good," said Robert Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners.

Boeing Co. (BA) on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.63 billion. (Brad Nettles/The Post And Courier via AP, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Dallas • Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts' forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. The shares rose more than 4 percent in afternoon trading. On a call with analysts and reporters, Boeing executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump's tweets and comments last month about the high price of new Air Force One planes. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Boeing and European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitably among major world airlines, and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Both big plane makers have order backlogs that will last for years. However, they are likely to face more competition in the next few years for sales of their workhorse models, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Canada's Bombardier and Russia and China are in various stages of delivering similar-sized, single-aisle jetliners. Boeing will counter by delivering the first of a new, upgraded 737 in a few months. And Boeing's government business could come under increasing cost pressure. Boeing predicted that 2017 revenue from its defense and space business could fall by up to 5 percent, including a drop in sales of military jets, which the company blamed on the timing of some aircraft deliveries. Boeing took another write-down on a key tanker program that has been plagued by design issues including problems with the refueling boom. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Pentagon and congressional support for Boeing's key defense programs remains solid. And he said he welcomed Trump's comments last month about one of the company's most familiar products. Boeing is in the design stage of work on customizing 747 jumbo jets to replace the current Air Force One fleet. Trump tweeted "costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" That led to a meeting between Muilenburg and Trump at Trump Tower. "We had some targeted discussions, well-publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft," Muilenburg said. "I think those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we're providing best capability ... at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers. We're exactly on the same page there." Jeff Windau, an analyst for Edward Jones, said there could be a push and pull under Trump — more defense spending but also pressure to cut prices. "While we're positive on defense spending improving, if there is more focus on those costs and trying to drive down the prices, it could pressure some of the profitability of the defense contractors," Windau said in an interview. He rates Boeing shares at "hold." Boeing said Wednesday that net income in the fourth quarter was $1.63 billion, up 59 percent from a year earlier. Excluding certain pension expenses, the company said it earned $2.47 per share from its core businesses. That surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by FactSet and 10 by Zacks Investment Research was $2.34 per share. Revenue fell 1 percent to $23.29 billion, which was better than the FactSet forecast of $23.13 billion but below the Zacks average of $23.45 billion. For 2017, Boeing predicted earnings between $9.10 and $9.30 per share, compared with the FactSet survey average of $9.25 per share. The company pegged revenue at between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion with declines expected in both the commercial and defense sides of the business. The FactSet analysts expect $92.96 billion. Boeing expects to deliver 760 to 765 commercial aircraft, which would be an increase over the 748 delivered in 2016. Boeing said it has a backlog of more than 5,700 aircraft with a sticker value of $416 billion, although airlines routinely get discounts. Shares of Boeing were up $7.67, or 4.8 percent, to $168.22 in afternoon trading.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES The battle over MormonLeaks -- two websites with one name and one goal: target the LDS Church ROTC may move from BYU to UVU after colonel bristles at Honor Code Garrison Keillor: Help us, GOP, you're our only hope SLC shirks Trump, refuses to enforce his immigration edict Dana Milbank: Don't get distracted by Trump's 'dead cats' ELEVATE H&R Block Announces Two New Offers: Refund Advance of Up to $1,250 and Free Federal 1040EZ   Professional-in-Residence Jim Mortensen Prepares Students to Become Top Advisors   3 Unforgettable Date Night Ideas   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

By AnoraMahmudova Reporter WallaceWitkowski Reporter The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday both crossed and closed above the 20,000 level for the first time, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also cruised to records after upbeat earnings releases from heavyweights such as Boeing Co. and optimism over the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04%  surged 155.80 points, or 0.8%, to close at 20,068.51, with Boeing Co. BA, -0.84%  and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.82%  contributing heavily to gains. “Clarity is the markets’ oxygen. The more President Trump provides, the more Dow 20,000 moves to the rear view mirror — Dow 21,000 will soon become the next media obsession,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, in emailed comments. The new president has said he wants to cut corporate taxes and loosen regulations in moves that could potentially help corporate earnings. Since the Dow first crossed 19,000 on Nov. 22, the biggest contributors to the blue-chip average’s quick 1,000-point rise were Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -1.10%  (154.6 points), International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.76%  (90.6 points), Boeing (75.5 points), Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.15%  (69.8 points), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +0.15%  and Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.01%   tied at 56 points a piece, according to Dow Jones data. Don’t expect, or hope for, 21,000 too soon however, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, in an interview. That would raise red flags of a top about to blow off. Plus, the February after an election has traditionally been the weakest month for the S&P 500 since 1950, he said. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.09%  gained 18.30 points, or 0.8%, to close at a record 2,298.37, with eight of the main 11 sectors trading higher. Financial and industrials shares were leading gains, while telecoms and real estate lagged behind. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.10% finished up 55.38 points, or 1%, at 5,656.34. The tech-heavy index has outperformed other indexes so far this year, gaining 5.1% year to date. “What’s happening with earnings is driving gains, not just in the U.S., this is a global rally,” Detrick said. Plus, resumed leadership from financial stocks and small-caps point to more positives than negatives, he added. The small-cap Russell 2000 index RUT, -0.36%  rallied 1%, while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, -0.38%  jumped 1.7%. Another cautionary signal would also be another big surge in the dollar, he said. “The actual drive upward, and I don’t mean the unimportant level of 20,000 on the Dow, is being driven by a combination of better-than-expected earnings and especially outlooks from companies that suggest that economies in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Asia are in a better shape than we previously thought,” said Kim Forrest, senior analyst and portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group.

Home Industry Boeing shrugs off Donald Trump trade fears, reports solid earnings Boeing shrugs off Donald Trump trade fears, reports solid earnings Boeing reported solid fourth-quarter earnings today and forecast higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2017, while its chief dismissed fears US President Donald Trump could start a trade war. By: AFP | New York | Published: January 26, 2017 1:45 AM Boeing also said it expects commercial deliveries in 2017 to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. (Reuters) Boeing reported solid fourth-quarter earnings today and forecast higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2017, while its chief dismissed fears US President Donald Trump could start a trade war. The US aerospace giant saw a 59 percent surge in earnings to USD 1.6 billion compared with final quarter of the prior year, beating expectations. The jump was due to higher commercial aircraft deliveries and a one-time charge in late 2015 that made the comparison more favorable. Boeing also said it expects commercial deliveries in 2017 to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. The report sparked a 5.0 per cent rise in Boeing shares to USD 168.43 at midday, helping to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 20,000-point milestone for the first time. Investors shrugged off some negative aspects of the Boeing results, including USD 312 million in new unexpected costs for KC-46 military tanker program, another in what has been a recurring theme in recent the company’s earnings reports. The report came as the new Trump administration puts its stamp on US policies and openly pressures companies in its “America First” agenda that has sparked worries of protectionism. You May Also Want To Watch: Boeing felt the sting of his Twitter attack in December, when Trump lambasted the company for what he said were runaway costs of the next generation presidential plane, to serve as the famed Air Force One. Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg, who met with Trump twice prior to his inauguration and pledged to work to control costs on Air Force One, said he was confident the new president’s agenda would be good for Boeing and that the US would avoid a trade war. “This is all about helping business being successful,” Muilenburg said in a call with reporters and analysts, adding that he was “very confident” the new administration understands the importance of not alienating China, an important Boeing market. Muilenburg endorsed pro-growth policies such as lower taxes and “fair trade” for the United States, and said higher US defense spending could boost Boeing’s business.

King Salman and his son, Defence Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, watched the spectacle as graduates of the King Faisal Air College performed military marches and fighter jets swooped overhead. The Obama administration approved the $60 billion deal in 2010 amid mounting U.S. and Saudi tensions with Iran. The deal dwarfed previous multibillion-dollar sales to Saudi Arabia, which for years has been the biggest U.S. arms buyer. In addition to the 84 Boeing F-15SA fighters, the deal included orders for upgrades to Saudi Arabia's 70 older F-15s, HARM AGM-88 Anti-Radiation Missiles, Laser JDAM and Enhanced Paveway munitions and related equipment and services. The sale was a major win for Boeing, which has faced competition from Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter. Boeing also clinched weapons sales to Qatar and Kuwait last year. "The F-35 was displacing all other players. But fourth generation production models, especially Boeing F-15s, are going to have a longer life than predicted," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group. Riyadh placed its order for the fighter jets to support its chief foreign policy goal of rolling back Iranian influence around the region, according to statements by U.S. officials at the time. Six years later, questions linger about how such expensive hardware will help the kingdom win wars in places like Yemen, where it has struggled to confront what it sees as Iranian expansion since intervening in the civil war in March 2015. Riyadh accuses Iran of backing Yemen's Shi'ite Houthi rebels, who ousted the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital over two years ago. Despite a near-daily campaign of air strikes, Saudi Arabia has yet to impose its will on its southern neighbour. The Houthis and allied forces continue to control Sanaa and much of the rest of Yemen's north. The rebels regularly attack Saudi soldiers at border checkpoints and fire missiles that sometimes reach deep into Saudi territory. "There's no question that impressive equipment has been a boon to the Saudi-led coalition," said Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "But ultimately, state of the art weaponry is one thing and the situation on the ground is another."

(Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP) Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that he was encouraged by President Trump’s personal engagement on business issues, despite his criticism that slammed the manufacturer during the campaign. After winning the election, Trump tweeted criticism of the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One and Lockheed’s F-35 fighters. But Muilenburg said he appreciated Trump meeting with business leaders and pushing business interests. “I’m very encouraged by President Trump’s engagement,” Muilenburg told reporters during an earnings call. “This is all about providing best capability for our government and our war fighters, at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers. We’re exactly on the same page there.” Since his inauguration Friday, Trump met Tuesday with chief executives of the largest three U.S. carmakers. Muilenburg also met with Trump in New York during the transition. “I give a lot of credit here to reaching out and directly engaging. President Trump has had business leaders at the table. He’s listening, he’s engaging and making decisions that will help us grow the economy and ultimately U.S. manufacturing jobs,” Muilenburg said. “I’m encouraged by that dialogue. I think having direct, open dialogue is productive and very good for the future.” USA TODAY Trump slams Boeing deal for new Air Force One USA TODAY China inks big deals with Boeing, Cisco Systems During the presidential campaign, Trump slammed Boeing in September 2015 for plans to create a finishing center for 737 aircraft in China. The facility in Zhoushan, south of Shanghai, will install cabin interiors and paint the outside of planes that are built in the U.S. Boeing estimates the global marketplace will need 39,000 planes during the next 20 years, including 6,800 in China. “It’s really important for all of us to understand that healthy trade relationships between the U.S. and China are important," Muilenburg said. "I’m very confident the incoming administration understands that." Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter, with 90% of its workforce in the U.S. and 75% of its sales abroad, Muilenburg said. Expanding sales in China will build manufacturing jobs in the U.S., he said. “Every airplane that goes to that finishing center is being built in the U.S. That’s a great example by making the right targeted investments in China with our partners there, we are able to add volume, increase sales in China,” Muilenburg said. “As we increase sales in China, we increase building planes here in the U.S. That’s U.S. manufacturing jobs. It’s a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.” Muilenburg said Trump’s goals in a tax reform, regulatory reform and trade policy should all spur the economy and benefit manufacturing. “Those are all things that are going to allow us to grow economically and ultimately allow us to grow and add manufacturing capacity in the U.S.,” Muilenburg said. “We’re very supportive of those actions, very confident that those are headed in the right direction and being done with the right tone and tenor.” Trump proclaimed at his inauguration Friday that his priority was “America first,” with a preference for buying U.S. products and hiring U.S. workers. Muilenburg doesn’t anticipate a foreign backlash against potential protectionism. “This is all about helping business be successful, growing the economy. We know in the global business that we operate in, as we grow our business here in the U.S., it provides lift around the world as well,” Muilenburg said. “As we deliver airplanes and we enable global travel and global cargo delivery, it provides overall economic growth around the world as well." Muilenburg said he was encouraged by Trump's pro-business agenda. “We’re going to continue to engage and work very closely with the administration," Muilenburg said. "We’re encouraged by the pro-business agenda. We think it’s going to be good for jobs growth, it’s going to be good for the economy, and in the end good for the aerospace sector and for Boeing." 33 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ktIK51 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Posted 25 Jan 2017 20:50 Updated 26 Jan 2017 03:10 Boeing Co's logo is seen above the front doors of its largest jetliner factory in Everett, Washington, U.S. January 13, 2017. REUTERS/Alwyn Scott Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Boeing Co posted quarterly profit and operating cash that beat analysts' estimates, and promised an even better performance in 2017, thanks to "relentless" cost cutting, rising productivity and U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda. Boeing stock jumped nearly 5 percent to US$168.50 on Wednesday after the company said it expects to generate a record US$10.75 billion in operating cash this year. The sum is up from a record US$10.5 billion in 2016 and well above the US$10.4 billion that analysts had forecast for 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Chicago-based aerospace and defense company forecast 2017 core earnings of US$9.10 to US$9.30 a share, which exclude some pension and other costs, up from US$7.24 in 2016. Cost-cutting and productivity gains fueled Boeing's strong performance and forecast, and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he sees no signs of a slowdown on that front. "This will be a relentless effort going forward," he said on a conference call, referring to Boeing's efficiency drive. "While we've made some strong strides over the last couple of years, and you see it reflected in the performance, we have much more ahead of us than what's behind us." Orders for new jetliners have slowed sharply after peaking in 2014. Boeing and rival Airbus have focused on streamlining factories to lower costs and drive profits. Boeing has also benefited from lower costs for parts for its 787 as the plane reaches key production milestones. It delivered its 500th 787 in December. Boeing expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial aircraft in 2017, topping 748 deliveries in 2016, likely enough to keep the title of world's biggest plane maker. Boeing said its outlook showed confidence in its ability to continue smooth operating performance and cost-cutting while raising plane output. Some analysts questioned whether the cash performance will last into 2018, after Boeing cuts production of its 777 by 40 percent this year, begins assembly of the successor 777X model and goes into full production of the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker. Boeing said it took an aftertax tanker-related charge of US$201 million in the fourth quarter due to initial production problems. "And that's not assuming any change in end-market demand, where trends have arguably been weakening," Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a note to clients. Boeing said deliveries of its smaller 737 and 737 MAX models will make up for the decline in 777 production. And it suggested the upward trend in performance won't falter. "Over the remainder of the decade, we continue to expect to see revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth," Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the call. The forecast includes a planned increase in the 787 production rate, which has been in question as sales have slowed. Muilenburg said recent meetings with President Donald Trump's show a pro-business attitude that should help Boeing. "I give a lot of credit here," he said. "President Trump has had business leaders at the table. He's listening, he's engaging and is making decisions that will help us grow the economy and ultimately grow U.S. manufacturing jobs."

The world's largest planemaker is counting on the marquee carbon-fiber jet and higher output of its single-aisle 737, a workhorse with discount airlines, to bolster results this year. Boeing forecast higher cash and earnings overnight, while predicting a sales decline as it makes fewer 777 wide-body aircraft.

The stock was the top performer among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the index climbed past 20,000 for the first time. The shares rose 4.9 per cent to $168.35 at 1.25pm on Wednesday in New York. The quarter's results also were a relief compared with last year, when the company caught investors off-guard with a forecast of fewer 737 deliveries. "We think this release is pretty boring - and boring is good," Robert Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients. Boeing has pledged to return all of its cash flow to investors, repurchasing shares and bolstering its dividend as a near-record order backlog shelters the manufacturer from market shocks. The Chicago-based company is counting on improving Dreamliner profitability, resurgent defense spending and a new family of 737 narrow-body jets to counteract rising trade tensions with China and a glut of older twin-aisle planes. Boeing's record share price also reflects a stock buyback binge last year, as the company repurchased 7 per cent of its shares, said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. While the manufacturer generated $US10.5 billion in cash from operations, it spent $US7 billion on stock, $US4.6 billion on research, $US2.8 billion on dividends and $US2.6 billion on property, plants and equipment. Advertisement "They can't keep spending this way and not continue to dwindle cash balances," Ferguson said. Higher aircraft deliveries forecast Still, revenue will fall to a range of $US90.5 billion to $US92.5 billion this year, Boeing said, as the company slows production of the 777 this month and in the third quarter because of an order shortfall. Analysts had expected annual sales of $US93 billion. While the cuts will mean fewer deliveries of one of Boeing's main profit drivers, total shipments will rise as Boeing cranks up production of the 737, its main source of profit. Boeing expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial airplanes, an increase from last year's 748. Operating cash flow will be about $US10.8 billion, up from the $US10.5 billion generated in 2016. Earnings adjusted for pension expenses will probably be $US9.10 to $US9.30 a share this year, compared with the $US9.24 predicted by analysts. To keep its cash machine humming, Boeing is counting on a smooth debut for the upgraded 737 Max while it speeds output by 12 per cent at its narrow-body factory in Renton, Washington, to a record 47 jets a month. Boeing also benefited as deferred production costs for the 787 Dreamliner fell $US215 million to $US27.3 billion, according to the company's website. The plane maker reached the crossover point last year where unit costs for the cutting-edge jetliner finally fell below its sales price. Since then, the balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing's factories. The jetliner is the first built of spun carbon-fiber composites rather than aluminium and entered commercial service in 2011, more than three years late. Margin rises, but short of target Fourth-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $US2.47 a share, despite an $US312 million accounting loss for an aerial tanker program, the company said. That was 15 cents more than analyst had expected. Revenue fell 1.2 per cent to $US23.3 billion, compared with analysts' projection of $US23.1 billion. Free cash flow was $US2.23 billion, while analysts had expected $US2.02 billion. Boeing's commercial airplane business posted an operating profit of $US1.47 billion, more than double its result from a year earlier. Results were weighed down by a $US243 million pretax accounting charge for the KC-46 aerial tanker, which is based on a commercial 767 jetliner frame and was knocked off schedule by technical and design issues. The airplane division's operating margin rose to 9.1 per cent from 3.5 per cent, but fell short of the double-digit margin goal set by Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg. The result would have been closer to 11 per cent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's Ferguson, if not for the accounting cost as Boeing retrofits the first tankers built for delivery to the US Air Force this year. Boeing's defense business earned $US809 million from operations, compared with $US963 million a year earlier, as it absorbed $US69 million of the tanker-related charge. The division's operating margin declined to 11.8 per cent from 12.4 per cent. "It's not surprising," Ken Herbert, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said of the latest in a series of tanker charges. "We knew it was going to be a difficult program." Bloomberg Advertisement HuffPost Australia This Man Took Out A Bank Loan To Pay ... Contains: External link Here's What Australian Companies Are ...

Finance Search Boeing shrugs off Trump trade fears, reports solid earningsAFP – Wed, Jan 25, 2017 7:59 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo Boeing said it expects commercial deliveries to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016 Boeing reported solid fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday and forecast higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2017, while its chief dismissed fears US President Donald Trump could start a trade war. The US aerospace giant saw a 59 percent surge in earnings to $1.6 billion compared with final quarter of the prior year, beating expectations. The jump was due to higher commercial aircraft deliveries and a one-time charge in late 2015 that made the comparison more favorable. Boeing also said it expects commercial deliveries in 2017 to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. The report sparked a 5.0 percent rise in Boeing shares to $168.43 at midday, helping to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 20,000-point milestone for the first time. Investors shrugged off some negative aspects of the Boeing results, including $312 million in new unexpected costs for KC-46 military tanker program, another in what has been a recurring theme in recent the company's earnings reports. The report came as the new Trump administration puts its stamp on US policies and openly pressures companies in its "America First" agenda that has sparked worries of protectionism. Boeing felt the sting of his Twitter attack in December, when Trump lambasted the company for what he said were runaway costs of the next generation presidential plane, to serve as the famed Air Force One. Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg, who met with Trump twice prior to his inauguration and pledged to work to control costs on Air Force One, said he was confident the new president's agenda would be good for Boeing and that the US would avoid a trade war. "This is all about helping business being successful," Muilenburg said in a call with reporters and analysts, adding that he was "very confident" the new administration understands the importance of not alienating China, an important Boeing market. Muilenburg endorsed pro-growth policies such as lower taxes and "fair trade" for the United States, and said higher US defense spending could boost Boeing's business. The aerospace giant also is "standing by" to provide technology to support Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, which could mean increased contracts for the sales of unmanned aircraft for surveillance, he said. "And we are standing by to support where we can any US government decisions that are made along that path," Muilenburg said. Trump was expected later Wednesday to announce the first steps in building a massive wall on the Mexican border.

Boeing just unveiled its slick new 'Starliner' spacesuit to protect a new generation of NASA astronauts Dave Mosher Jan. 25, 2017, 1:26 PM 70,156 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing NASA isn't thrilled about having to pay Russia billions of dollars to launch US astronauts on Russian rockets inside of Russian spacesuits. But that's the current spaceflight pickle the space agency finds itself in; there's really no other option unless you're China. However, two aerospace companies — SpaceX and Boeing — are working hard to fulfill contracts for NASA to build and launch astronauts to low-Earth orbit as soon as 2018 (a delay of about 3 years). SpaceX is working on its Dragon spacecraft while Boeing is developing and testing its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. To that end on Wednesday, Boeing for the first time publicly unveiled a crucial new piece of its Starliner system: A spacesuit to protect the next generation of astronauts as they launch toward the International Space Station, and eventually more exotic destinations like an asteroid or even Mars. Behind the new suit is former astronaut Chris Ferguson, director of Boeing's Starliner Crew and Mission Systems program, and lead designer Shane Jacobs. "Astronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn't need that," Ferguson said in a Boeing promotional video. "We've simplified the suit. It's lightweight." Typical space shuttle suits weighed about 33 lbs (15 kilograms), while Boeing's new suit weighs about 12 lbs (5.4 kilograms) — roughly a few Macbook laptops' worth of mass. The suit, according to Boeing, is also much cooler than typical spacesuits. Below the shoulder material, for example, is a mesh that allows passive airflow to the suit. "You can pretty much lay there without any external cooling. It's that comfortable," Ferguson said. The suit also features a helmet that comes on and off with a large zipper, and smaller and less bulky gloves (which, yes, are made with material that allows them to interact with touchscreens). Here are some of the first public views of Boeing's new spacesuit. View As: One Page Slides This is the new CST-100 Starliner spacesuit that was designed and built by Boeing.

However, the investment plans of US defence majors Lockheed Martin and Boeing in India may get derailed under President Donald Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” policy. “India may come under pressure from the US to sign the remaining two pacts. The new administration may like to have things in order with which it wants to do serious business. If India is serious about boosting defence ties with US, it has to follow the prescribed rules,” a top US diplomat told BusinessLine requesting anonymity. US signs these pacts only with those countries which it considers to be their “major defence partner”. The remaining two pacts are Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). Talks yet to start Although India has agreed to sign the pacts, the negotiations have not yet started, as India needs to keep the sensitivities of Russia and China in mind, according to sources. CISMOA allows US to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems and BECA would enable setting up a framework through which the US could share sensitive data on targeting and navigation with India. India signed a tweaked version of US’ Logistics Services Agreement (LSA) in 2016 and renamed it as Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA). The pact stipulates exchange of logistics support and supplies. It facilitates the provision of services and support that either party may need when in an out-of-country situation. It also ensures that the financial transactions and billing are correct and punctual. During Trump’s phone call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the new US President stressed on strengthening defence and economic ties, according to a White House press statement. Signing of the foundational pacts was also one of the main issues discussed during Harry B. Harris’s, Commander, Pacific Command, US, visit to India earlier this month just days before Trump’s inauguration. President Trump has already made it clear that his governance will be based on “Buy American, Hire American.” According to sources, this might derail some of the long-term investment plans of American defence firms Lockheed Martin and Boeing which are keen on setting up manufacturing plants in India to produce fighter jets. While Lockheed Martin said it has plans to shift its production line of F-16 to India, Boeing has stressed that it will build F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets in India. Trump has already criticised both these firms on their investment plans and soaring cost of operations. Both Boeing and Lockheed Martin are facing tough competition from Swedish SAAB and French Rafale on bagging the billion-dollar fighter jet programme from the Ministry of Defence.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript More work for Boeing workers. The world's largest aerospace manufacturer forecast it'll deliver more planes this year. Strong orders for its small body 737 and 737 MAX planes will make up for the planned production cut of its widebody 777s. It also forecast record cash flow. In its latest quarter, Boeing's profit soared 58 percent. Revenue inched lower, but that decline was less than expected. While commercial aircraft sold well, revenue fell sharply for military aircraft. And Boeing said it would take a further charge on its KC-46 Pegasus aerial tanker, a program that is already behind schedule and over budget due partly to design issues. Buckingham Research Group analyst Richard Safran said, "The central focus for investors will be on the 2017 operating cash flow guide - $10.75 billion. We expect Boeing shares to trade higher today, largely due to Boeing's 2017 cash flow guide coming in $550 million above consensus expectations." Boeing shares, up 3 percent this year, added on to those gains at the start of trading.

Earnings: A Solid End to a Turbulent Year Boeing is facing a slowdown in orders and modest revenue declines, but the company continues to churn out strong earnings and rising free cash flow. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Jan 25, 2017 at 10:01AM 2016 wasn't a great year for Boeing (NYSE:BA). The company had to take special charges in several different lines of business. Moreover, sinking demand for the Boeing 777 forced Boeing to renege on a commitment to keep that production line rolling at a rate of seven aircraft per month through the transition to the next-generation 777X. Nevertheless, Boeing ended the year on a high note. On Wednesday morning, the company reported strong Q4 earnings results and offered a relatively favorable outlook for 2017. Q4 by the numbers Boeing's revenue declined modestly on a year-over-year basis last quarter, due to lower activity in its defense and space segment. Still, earnings per share grew relative to Q4 2015.  Metric Q4 2016 Q4 2015 Growth (YOY) Revenue $23.3 billion $23.6 billion (1.2%) Commercial airplanes deliveries 185 182 1.6% Core operating margin 8.9% 5.3% N/A Free cash flow $2.2 billion $2.5 billion (10.5%) Core EPS (adjusted) $2.47 $2.44 1.2% Total order backlog $473 billion $489 billion (3.3%) Data source: Boeing Q4 earnings releases. In fact, EPS would have been roughly $0.30-$0.35 higher but for a $312 million charge related to the KC-46 Pegasus military tanker. The KC-46 has been a frequent source of special charges for Boeing in recent years, so it's not sensible to exclude this charge as a one-time occurrence. Even so, Boeing remains on track to deliver the first one to the U.S. Air Force later this year, after which the various earnings charges may come to an end. One aspect of Boeing's Q4 performance that may look subpar is its free cash flow, which declined 10.5% year over year. However, this was driven by the timing of receipts versus expenditures. Thanks to strong cash performance during the first three quarters of 2016, Boeing's full-year free cash flow surged by 14.1%, or nearly $1 billion. Boeing 787 profitability continues to rise To meet its cash flow goals in the coming years, it's critical that Boeing continue to improve the profitability of 787 Dreamliner production. Boeing incurred tens of billions of dollars of losses building the first several hundred Dreamliners. However, production turned profitable last year, which is driving declines in the 787 deferred production balance (essentially, a cumulative tally of 787 production losses). Last quarter, deferred production declined by $215 million sequentially. That's an improvement from a $150 million decline during Q3 and a $141 million increase in Q4 2015. This means that over the past year the Dreamliner program's cash profitability has improved by more than $1.4 billion on an annualized basis. 787 production is steadily becoming more profitable for Boeing. Image source: The Motley Fool. The deferred production balance nonetheless remains massive, at $27.3 billion. To recoup those losses, Boeing will need to drive its cash profit margin for 787 deliveries much higher in the next few years. 2017 guidance is fairly good Looking ahead to 2017, Boeing expects revenue to fall by about $3 billion. Most of the decline will come in the commercial airplanes segment. Boeing actually expects to deliver more aircraft this year, but this will be more than offset by a mix shift away from the large and pricey 777 and 747 families toward the smaller and cheaper 737. Military aircraft sales are also expected to decline by about $1 billion year over year. On the other hand, Boeing expects core earnings per share to reach $9.10-$9.30 in 2017, representing solid growth (excluding Boeing's various earnings charges of the past year). This indicates that the company's cost cuts are more than offsetting the weak demand environment -- at least for now. Most importantly, Boeing projects that free cash flow will rise by about $550 million year over year in 2017. That will allow the company to continue rewarding investors with high dividends and share buybacks in the coming year. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Aaron Blake By Aaron Blake January 27 at 10:08 AM Follow @aaronblake Update No. 2: For the fourth time in four days, Trump has pretty clearly responded to something he saw on the news by taking to Twitter. Here's Stelter, once again, with the eagle eye: 7:25am, CNN has Gregg Phillips on, @ChrisCuomo challenges Phillips' lack of voter fraud evidence. 8:12am, Trump tweets about Gregg Phillips. pic.twitter.com/gQAvSAMXlB — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 27, 2017 Update Thursday: Trump has now done it again, tweeting that Chelsea Manning is an "ungrateful traitor" 14 minutes after Fox News ran that phrase on its screen, as CNN's Brian Stelter notes. Trump also said it suggested Obama was a "weak leader," as Fox had. 14 minutes apart: Fox says "ungrateful traitor," Trump says "ungrateful traitor," Fox says "weak leader," Trump says "weak leader." pic.twitter.com/f7urTOUG1L — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 26, 2017 The original post, from Wednesday morning, is below. Over the past 12 or so hours, President Trump has made two major policy pronouncements via Twitter. On Tuesday night, he said he may “send the Feds!” to combat the “carnage” in Chicago, and on Wednesday morning, he said he planned to launch a “major investigation” of voter fraud. Both of these things can pretty easily be traced back to one source: Trump's television. As the Huffington Post's Michael Calderone noted late Tuesday night, Trump's tweet about Chicago came shortly after Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly ran a segment using the exact same statistics. Here's the graphic O'Reilly showed: Here was the graphic on The O'Reilly Factor just over an hour before Trump started tweeting Chicago crime statistics https://t.co/KMYxDiRHOa pic.twitter.com/NwPXeIT3G2 — Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) January 25, 2017 And here's Trump's tweet: If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 228. 42. 24 percent. All were in the graphic on O'Reilly's show, which is a Trump favorite. Earlier Tuesday afternoon, the idea of a voter-fraud investigation was a major, contentious theme of White House press secretary Sean Spicer's daily briefing. Three journalists pressed Spicer on a very logical question: If Trump truly believed that 3 million to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential race, why hadn't he called for an investigation of this seemingly major scandal? During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that widespread voter fraud is a belief President Trump has "maintained for a while." (Reuters) As I wrote Tuesday, he's the president now, and he has professed severe concerns about election integrity and illegal immigrants. So his lack of a call for an investigation after more than two months of pushing this falsehood was conspicuous and suggested that he wasn't terribly serious about it. Well, now he has called for one. Apparently in response to the heated back-and-forths at the televised briefing and the ensuing coverage of those exchanges, Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he will indeed push for an investigation. The Washington Post's Robert Costa reports that an unnamed Trump aide insists that this has been discussed for a while, but Spicer sure seemed to be slow-rolling the possibility on Tuesday. Update: It's been brought to my attention that NBC's "Today" show ran a fact-check segment featuring chief legal correspondent Ari Melber just minutes before Trump's tweets, in which Melber said the lack of an investigation was "an inconsistency that is very hard to square.” The segment ran starting at 7:07 a.m. Eastern time and featured a discussion of the lack of an investigation as the clock struck 7:10 a.m.; Trump tweeted about the investigation at 7:10. So here we are again, in a situation in which Trump seems to be reacting in significant ways to what he sees on TV and in the media. Last month, Trump tweeted about canceling Boeing's contract for the new Air Force One shortly after a Chicago Tribune article was posted that quoted Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenberg making comments critical of increasing opposition to free trade — in other words, the position central to Trump's presidential bid. (Trump insisted that he hadn't seen the article.) Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 This story in which Boeing CEO expressed concerns about Trump's views on trade posted just before Trump tweet --https://t.co/aBvK87GzzW — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) December 6, 2016 In November, Trump tweeted about how he'd like to punish flag-burners with loss of citizenship of jail time. About half an hour before, Fox News had aired a segment about students at a Massachusetts-based Hampshire College reportedly burning the flag in protest of Trump's election. Timing of Trump's tweet lines up w/ Fox segment at 6:25AM on students burning the flag https://t.co/W7G4Hlw1O6 https://t.co/8M0AC4EfQy — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) November 29, 2016 And that's to say nothing of his regular skewering of journalists and news media outlets whose stories and segments he hasn't approved of. Trump himself has basically copped to this behavior. During the campaign, NBC's Chuck Todd asked him where he got his military advice, and his response was, “I watch the shows.” Hillary Clinton's campaign put it in an ad. The difference now, though, is that he's in a position to actually make major policy decisions on it — such as opening a large investigation and sending federal resources to urban areas. Trump has made many bold Twitter pronouncements that appear to have fallen by the wayside — statements about his political views and preferred policies that may reflect momentary whims that will never find their way into official White House action. (Trump hasn't even really talked about flag-burning and Air Force One since his tweets in November and December.) And given the sheer volume of these proclamations, his supporters and even the media will probably forget many of them were ever made. But when something happens like it did Tuesday at the White House news briefing, and Trump responds with a promise for a “major investigation,” it's impossible to ignore the fact that he's now in the position to make that happen quickly — and to be held accountable if he doesn't. We'll see if he actually follows through on either of the things he promised since Tuesday night or if they'll fade into Trump's news-making vortex. But if he does go forward with them, we'll know what set it in motion. politics the-fix Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

(The Washington Post) Do spacesuits always have to be so bulky? Do astronauts have to lumber around like the Michelin man? Or is there a way to design something a bit sleeker, more fashionable? Boeing is set to unveil its new spacesuit on Wednesday, giving a look at a suit designed not by NASA but a commercial company. Boeing is under contract by the space agency to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station next year. The suit would be worn by passengers in the new spacecraft Boeing is designing, the Starliner. NASA has hired both Boeing and Elon Musk’s SpaceX to fly crews to the space station. Since the space shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has not had the ability to fly human passengers, relying instead on Russia. It’s not yet clear whether SpaceX or Boeing would fly first, but whoever does would earn the honor of restoring the country’s ability to fly humans from American soil. This week, Boeing teased out images of its new suit. And it plans to model it on Wednesday, when it also plans to show off a mockup of the Starliner and the launchpad it is renovating on Cape Canaveral.  business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Full-year 2016 revenue fell 2% year-over-year to $94.6 billion, and Boeing projected revenue will drop again in 2017 to $90.5-$92.5 billion. Boeing’s 2015 revenue of $96.1 billion was a company record. Boeing’s earnings continue to be negatively affected by charges from the 787, 747-8 and KC-46 aerial refueler programs. Boeing is forecasting commercial aircraft deliveries in the 760-765 range in 2017, a rebound from 2016’s fall to 748 deliveries and in line with 2015’s 762 deliveries, which was a company record. Boeing Commercial Airplanes posted a $3.1 billion operating profit in 2016, down 39% from an operating profit of $5.2 billion in 2015. The unit’s 2016 revenue decreased 1% year-over-year to $66.1 billion and full-year operating margin fell three percentage points to 4.8%. Commercial Airplanes revenue is projected to drop again in 2017 to $62.5-$63.5 billion, but the unit’s operating margin is expected to rebound to 9.5%-10%. Boeing took revenue hits in 2016 in both its military aircraft and network & space systems businesses, which reported year-over-year revenue declines of 7% and 9%, respectively.

Boeing’s revenues in the final quarter of 2016 fell by 1.2% to US $23.29bn, but that still beat consensus Aerospace giant Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) saw its fourth quarter 2016 sales and earnings beat forecasts, but its 2017 sales guidance was lower than expected. The world's biggest maker of jetliners said its fourth-quarter earnings rose to US$1.63bn, or US$2.59 a share, up from US$1.03bn, or US $1.51 a share at the same stage a year earlier. Boeing’s revenues in the final quarter of 2016 fell by 1.2% to US $23.29bn, but that still beat the US$23.13bn consensus forecast. For 2017, the aircraft maker said it expects adjusted EPS of US$9.10 to US$9.30, in-line with consensus of US$9.25, but its revenue guidance of US$90.5bn to US$92.5bn was below expectations for US$$92.96bn. Boeing said it expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial aircraft in 2017, higher than the 748 deliveries it made in 2016. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chairman, president and chief executive officer , said: “We led the industry in commercial airplane deliveries for the fifth consecutive year, achieved healthy sales in our defense, space and services segments, and produced record operating cash flow, which fueled investment in innovation and our people and generated significant returns to shareholders" The group said commercial aerospace sales in the fourth-quarter rose by 1% to US$16.24bn, slightly below forecasts. Military aircraft sales dropped 18% to US$2.62bn, although that beat expectations, and network and space systems sales fell 8% to US$1.80bn, also above forecasts. Boeing shares, which  have soared 29% higher over the past 12 months, were up around 1% in pre-market trading in New York.

The company forecast Wednesday that deliveries of commercial airplanes will rise slightly ths year after slipping last year. Boeing expects full-year earnings in 2017 to range between Us$9.10 and $9.30 per share, about in line with analysts’ forecast of $9.25 per share. The company’s revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets, however. Boeing and its European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitably among major world airlines and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Both big plane makers have order backlogs that will last for years. However, they are likely to face more competition in the next few years for sales of their workhorse models, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Canada’s Bombardier and Russia, Japan and China are in various stages of delivering similar-sized, single-aisle jetliners. Boeing’s government business could also come under increasing cost pressure. Boeing predicted that 2017 revenue from its defence and space business could fall by up to 5 per cent, including a drop in sales of military jets. Boeing said on Wednesday that net income in the fourth quarter was $1.63 billion, up 59 per cent from a year earlier. Excluding certain pension expenses, the company said it earned $2.47 per share from its core businesses. That surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by FactSet and 10 by Zacks Investment Research was $2.34 per share. Revenue fell 1 per cent to $23.29bn, which was better than the FactSet forecast of $23.13bn but below the Zacks average of $23.45bn. For 2017, Boeing predicted that revenue will be between $90.5bn and $92.5bn with declines expected in both the commercial and defense sides of the business. The FactSet analysts expect $92.96bn. Boeing expects to deliver 760 to 765 commercial aircraft, which would be an increase over the 748 delivered in 2016. Boeing said it has a backlog of more than 5,700 aircraft with a sticker value of $416bn, although airlines routinely get discounts. Shares of Boeing have increased 3 per cent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has climbed about 2 per cent. The stock has climbed 29 per cent in the past 12 months. * AP business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Southwest Airlines beats profit forecasts on fare price hike Raytheon hit as F-35 missile maker’s sales slow Ryanair targets Lufthansa’s Frankfurt hub to increase services Qantas relaunches Beijing route after eight-year gap MOST VIEWED Business | All Ipic and Mubadala name board for $125 billion mega merger Owning cars, watches or art – directly or via a fund – is an investing option UAE military contingent participates in India’s Republic Day parade Abu Dhabi Investment Council’s stake in ADCB rises after lender’s capital reduction UAE and India pledge to boost bilateral trade by 60% Money & Me: The education company marketing manager who has been taught a lesson in finance UAE signs first strategic oil deal with India Etihad Airways to deploy new Dreamliners on Levant and Far East routes Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed arrives in India for state visit Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet More Most Viewed UAE and India offer much to each other Trump bans Syrian refugees and suspends visas for 7 Muslim countries Top Gear cast in Dubai for two-day shoot Burj Khalifa and Adnoc tower light up in colours of Indian flag Life lessons: ‘My mother is British ... but I am 100 per cent Emirati’ Etisalat services back on after glitch Crowds cheer on Ironman 70.3 Dubai competitors and Ironkids Matchmaking advertising billboards taken down in Dubai NFL: Futures of Ben Roethlisberger, Tony Romo and other quarterbacks in flux Around Europe: High-scoring Monaco playing with style worthy of Monte Carlo More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Trump and Iraq’s oil Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent Municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Uncertain times in UAE football as China flexes its financial muscle Christo cancels Arkansas project and will now focus on Abu Dhabi’s The Mastaba About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

(Brad Nettles/The Post And Courier via AP, File) Posted: Wednesday, January 25, 2017 12:14 pm | Updated: 12:45 pm, Wed Jan 25, 2017. Boeing sees more airliner deliveries, lower defense revenue Associated Press | DALLAS (AP) — Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts' forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. The shares rose more than 4 percent in afternoon trading. On a call with analysts and reporters, Boeing executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump's tweets and comments last month about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Boeing and European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitably among major world airlines, and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Both big plane makers have order backlogs that will last for years. However, they are likely to face more competition in the next few years for sales of their workhorse models, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Canada's Bombardier and Russia and China are in various stages of delivering similar-sized, single-aisle jetliners. Boeing will counter by delivering the first of a new, upgraded 737 in a few months. And Boeing's government business could come under increasing cost pressure. Boeing predicted that 2017 revenue from its defense and space business could fall by up to 5 percent, including a drop in sales of military jets, which the company blamed on the timing of some aircraft deliveries. Boeing took another write-down on a key tanker program that has been plagued by design issues including problems with the refueling boom. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Pentagon and congressional support for Boeing's key defense programs remains solid. And he said he welcomed Trump's comments last month about one of the company's most familiar products. Boeing is in the design stage of work on customizing 747 jumbo jets to replace the current Air Force One fleet. Trump tweeted "costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" That led to a meeting between Muilenburg and Trump at Trump Tower. "We had some targeted discussions, well-publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft," Muilenburg said. "I think those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we're providing best capability ... at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers. We're exactly on the same page there." Jeff Windau, an analyst for Edward Jones, said there could be a push and pull under Trump — more defense spending but also pressure to cut prices. "While we're positive on defense spending improving, if there is more focus on those costs and trying to drive down the prices, it could pressure some of the profitability of the defense contractors," Windau said in an interview. He rates Boeing shares at "hold." Boeing said Wednesday that net income in the fourth quarter was $1.63 billion, up 59 percent from a year earlier. Excluding certain pension expenses, the company said it earned $2.47 per share from its core businesses. That surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by FactSet and 10 by Zacks Investment Research was $2.34 per share. Revenue fell 1 percent to $23.29 billion, which was better than the FactSet forecast of $23.13 billion but below the Zacks average of $23.45 billion. For 2017, Boeing predicted earnings between $9.10 and $9.30 per share, compared with the FactSet survey average of $9.25 per share. The company pegged revenue at between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion with declines expected in both the commercial and defense sides of the business. The FactSet analysts expect $92.96 billion. Boeing expects to deliver 760 to 765 commercial aircraft, which would be an increase over the 748 delivered in 2016. Boeing said it has a backlog of more than 5,700 aircraft with a sticker value of $416 billion, although airlines routinely get discounts. Shares of Boeing were up $7.67, or 4.8 percent, to $168.22 in afternoon trading. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In addition, the 787-9 will operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months.   Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 10 Boeing 787-9s to nine destinations – Düsseldorf, Zurich, Perth, Brisbane, Tokyo, Singapore, Riyadh, Johannesburg and Washington – from Abu Dhabi. With a further 61 Dreamliners due to be delivered over the next few years, the 787s will become Etihad Airways’ flagship long-haul aircraft. Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways chief executive officer, said: “Since introducing our first 787 into commercial service almost two years ago, we have enjoyed excellent feedback from guests on our ground-breaking cabin interiors that have set a benchmark for high service levels in the region and across the world. “With the additional cities joining our 787 network during 2017, we are giving more guests the opportunity to fly on our next generation aircraft.” He added: “Today’s travellers are increasingly looking for greater comfort, higher standards, more choice and better convenience as priorities in their decision-making and we, at Etihad Airways, are striving to meet their high expectations through innovations such as introducing new planes to the fleet and continuing to upgrade our routes.” Etihad Airways’ Boeing 787-9s include highly-acclaimed interiors featuring 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats, offering superior levels of comfort, entertainment and in-flight connectivity. On-board décor and lighting have been inspired by contemporary modern Arabian design, complementing the signature ‘Facets of Abu Dhabi’ identity introduced by the airline during its livery relaunch in 2014. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Etihad | Dreamliner | Levant | Network | far | East | B787 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Egyptian group Abu Soma plans Red Sea resort HLG Contracting wins Dubai mixed-use tower deal Desert Adventures Tourism eyes German-speaking tourist markets Boeing Q4 revenues down 1pc to $23.3bn Farhat Tours celebrates successful 10 years Fun-filled shopping experience awaits Bahrain's mall visitors Farhat International promotes two team members Kempinski Palm Jumeirah to host Kempinski Avenues 2017 Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel scoops 20 awards at Horeca Ascott appoints new director of sales in Muscat 'Google Search' top choice for travel inspiration Autumn Fair opens in Bahrain Connections Events gets top recognition at Eventex Awards Enjoy a romantic getaway at Al Wadi Desert, Ras Al Khaimah Mövenpick Hotels accelerates expansion plans Abu Dhabi records 4.4m tourists in 2016 New Muscat airport terminal to open by 2017 end RJ booth at Madrid tourism fair attracts large visitor numbers Abu Dhabi airport traffic tops 24.5m in 2016 Oman Air opens new grooming centre Stratajet partners with Mr and Mrs Smith Turkish Airlines, PIA expand code share deal Spain Tourism launches new website for GCC customers Seventh Boeing 787 joins RJ fleet Copperchase wins $500m Iraq airport contract Dubai 'popular timeshare destination for Africans' Hyatt Regency debuts in Riyadh Carlson Rezidor to open 17 hotels across ME Dubai's First Central Hotel Suites receives Green Key certification Central Park to be main attraction of new Cityland Mall Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The Dow crossed 19,000 on Nov. 22 and continued to gain, as the Trump trade swept the market higher. The best performing Dow stocks since then are Goldman Sachs, Disney and Boeing. Gains in Caterpillar, Boeing, JPMorgan and Travelers helped push the Dow across the 20,000 marker on the opening Wednesday. "Individual investors have started buying again, really since the election," said Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. "A psychological number like 20,000 helps to continue that trend, helps to bring in investors that have been sitting in cash and it really helps to keep the money flow coming in. We see this as a positive year, largely because of the individual investor, and not just corporations buying back stock any more." Kleintop added that he sees modest gains for the market. The move higher was not a straight line. Stocks lost some momentum in the last several weeks while the market consolidated gains. "We do think bigger picture, this bull market, out into next year should continue," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. "It took a little bit longer than I expected to get to 20,000, and the recent consolidation was nice to work off the overbought conditions coming into this year." Detrick said while 20,000 is getting the attention, the action under the surface is encouraging and in some ways more important. He said the rally in small caps Tuesday and Wednesday signals that they may regain leadership which would be a plus for the overall market. Detrick said the previous record for a 1,000-point gain was 24 days from the time the Dow first crossed 10,000 to 11,000, in 1999. "Normally it takes 24 months to go from each thousand-point level. We did it in two months," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The Dow has closed at record highs 17 times since Election Day. It came within 0.037 point — 19,999.63 — during the Jan. 6 trading day. The first trip to to a five-digit number was a big event for the stock market, when the Dow reached 10,000 in 1999, the height of the tech bubble. But it was a failed start, and the Dow crashed back to the 6,547 in the depths of the financial crisis in March 2009 before returning to 10,000 later that year. "It took 17 years. That's a long time to double in value," said Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel. "We were at the top of the biggest bubble at the end of 1999 that we've ever been in. This is nowhere like the bubble we had before. I think the market is much more reasonably valued than when we hit 10,000." Siegel expects the market to keep moving higher on the back of promises from President Donald Trump to cut taxes and regulations, but it will have to see action to keep moving. "I don't think we're going to get to 21,000 as fast as we went from 19,000 to 20,000. It's going to take a quarter," said Siegel. Trump has suggested tariffs for companies that move out of the U.S. and has said he wants to change trade deals. Those things concerned investors during the election, and traders are eyeing his moves on trade. "That is a risk out there. Probably if we knew for sure he wasn't going that way, the market would be even higher than it is," said Siegel. Analysts say the market could consolidate after it hits 20,000 and while it waits to see more signs that the economy is stronger and will support improving earnings. Reaching 21,000 too quickly would be a negative. "I would really get scared if that were the case. We're already in the beginning of a 'FOMO' environment — fear of missing out," said Stovall. Stovall said on average, the market rose another 4 percent over the next 2½ months after the Dow reached a new 1,000-point milestone. Then it would decline by 5 percent or more. There were two times when it did not digest gains before reaching the next 1,000 threshold. Once was the move to 11,000 in 1999, and then again in 2007. "The longer we go, it's more borrowed time," said Stovall. "I would say that we would experience a pullback, or a correction but definitely not a correction." Stovall points out the bull market is set to enter its eighth year on March 9. "Bull markets go out with a bang, not a whimper. It makes me feel confident that we're not coming to the end of a bull market," he said. Detrick said he expects to see Dow 21,000 in 2017. "You don't want it to make 21,000 too fast. That could be some sort of blow off equity top." Stovall said big numbers don't really mean much but they can excite investors. "It's like a gigantic magnet that pulls investors towards it, and sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The question is what happens once we eclipse it?" He said the millennium levels are like rusty doors, requiring several pushes before they break open. "Usually that honeymoon period lasts for 100 days, and interesting that the honeymoon ends in April, the traditional sell-in-May period," he said. It's a positive that financial stocks are leading the Dow's gains, but it's because there are expectations of higher rates and that some banking regulations will be lifted. "The financials is much more of a Trump situation because of the expected lifting of regulatory pressures, combined with the Fed's effort which would steepen the yield curve and improve their net interest income prospects," said Stovall. Stovall said the financials are an early-cycle mover. "They're sort of like the Dow Transports, from a Dow theory perspective. They have to confirm upward moves," he said. Since just before the election on Nov. 1, the financial sector was up 18 percent, followed by materials, up 12.5 percent and industrials, up 11 percent. Consumer discretionary is up 8.6 percent. Those sectors could continue to gain. "Since 1990, the cyclical sectors, materials and discretionary and tech have traditionally outperformed the S&P 77 percent of the time in the November through April period," he said.

Boeing said it expects commercial deliveries to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. While Boeing has described commercial aircraft as generally robust, in December it announced plans to cut production on the long-range 777 plane due to slackening demand. The company also beat expectations with earnings jumping to US$1.6 billion (RM7.08 billion) in the final quarter of 2016, compared to the same period a year earlier, due partly to an uptick in commercial aircraft that helped offset lower profits from Boeing’s military division. But the comparison to the prior year was boosted by a large charge in the fourth quarter of 2015. “With solid fourth quarter operating performance and a sharp strategic focus, we extended our aerospace market leadership in our centennial year and positioned Boeing for continued growth and success in our second century,” chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said. For 2017, Boeing projected revenues between US$90.5 billion and US$90.2 billion, down US$94.6 billion last year. The firm reported US$23.3 billion in revenues in the latest quarter, down 1.2 per cent. Boeing shares rose 0.8 per cent to US$161.83 in pre-market trading. ― AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Stocks slip on earnings, data; dollar advances Wall Street slips after soft GDP data, earnings Zeti: Sale of 1MDB’s assets to China firm has no impact on market Microsoft’s market value tops US$500b again after 17 years Ringgit ends lower against US dollar Trump pulls US out of Pacific trade deal, loosening Asia ties (VIDEO) US dollar slides near seven-week lows on fading Trump trade Saudi Aramco shelves plans for RAPID venture with Petronas, source says Ringgit to trade softer against US dollar next week At some Singapore suburban malls, retailers confront the sound of silence Most Watched Now Week See this new clip for ‘John Wick: Chapter 2’ Reuters Video: Arsenal's Wenger receives four match touchline ban Reuters Video: Iranian actress boycotts Oscars over Trump policy Reuters Video: Mexicans build makeshift wall around US embassy in Trump protest Reuters Video: President Trump, Melania share 'first dance' Reuters Video: Marketing experts on how best to spend money, time, energy in 2017 Related Articles Boeing studies bigger 737 for midrange market Boeing sees US$2.1b cost on 787 dreamliners, air tanker Iran, Boeing reach deal on purchase of 100 planes, Tehran says Boeing plans to further speed up 767 aircraft production Boeing’s US$18b jet haul tops Airbus at Paris Air Show Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, the jetliners will gradually be introduced on a number of routes from the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub beginning March 1, Etihad said. The 299-seat Dreamliners will be deployed on daily year-round scheduled services to Jordan and Lebanon, as well as to Beijing, Shanghai and South Korea.

Etihad’s Boeing 787-9s include 28 business studios and 271 economy seats. The 787-9 is proving popular with Chinese airlines, too. China’s Juneyao Airlines has announced an order for 10 Boeing 787-9s, comprising five firm orders and five options. At a list price of between US$189 million and $200m each, that would equate to an investment of up to $2 billion. The aircraft will facilitate the Shanghai-based carrier’s rapid international expansion, it said. According to the airline’s filing released by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday, Juneyao is scheduled to take delivery of three 787s in 2018 and two in 2019, which will increase capacity by 9.2 per cent in 2018 and 4.4 per cent per cent in 2019. If the five options are converted into firm orders, the carrier will introduce one 787 in 2019 and four in 2020, which will increase capacity by 6.6 per ent in 2019 and 8.9 per cent in 2020. Etihad’s new service times are as follows: From March 1, the daily flight EY 862 to Shanghai departs Abu Dhabi at 22:10 and arrives in the Chinese city at 10:10am +1.

The new aircraft landed at Queen Alia International Airport straight from Boeing manufactures in Seattle and is the seventh Dreamliner to become part of the airline fleet. RJ president/CEO Captain Suleiman Obeidat expressed satisfaction with the addition of this new 787 to the currently operating six aircraft of the same type, which RJ started to receive at the end of 2014. He said that this aircraft along with the sixth aircraft which joined the fleet in November 2016 are on capital lease, while the first five are operationally leased. The Dreamliners replace the Airbus 340s and 330s the company previously had. Obeidat said that the 787s paved the way for RJ to step into a significant new era, a step that pushes the national carrier of Jordan forward in terms of inflight services and route network, enhancing its regional and international competitiveness. He added that all new 787-8 aircraft, together with the operating A320 family and Embraer jets, help RJ meet its operational needs and leverage passengers’ experience. Today RJ’s fleet age does not exceed five years, a young, and modern, fleet when compared regionally and internationally. Obeidat pointed out that the wide-body, revolutionary aircraft is capable to fly long distances with full load non stop, making it a suitable choice for RJ to run it to North America, the Far East and Europe. The state-of-the-art features and high specifications of the 787s offer higher levels of comfort and luxury to the RJ clients. The Dreamliners have improved ventilation and humidity levels onboard, taking the travel experience to a new level, offering passengers more comfort and significantly reducing jetlag. It is also designed to be able to monitor safety and inform the ground systems about the need of maintenance. Customers in all classes experience cabin environment improvements, such as LED mood lighting, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, lower cabin altitude and enhanced ventilation systems, among other features. The aircraft is built of carbon-fiber composite materials and has a powerful electrical system to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. It consumes 20 per cent less fuel than today’s similarly sized airplanes, enabling it to offer an exclusive eco-friendly performance. The new planes also enable airlines to increase their cargo revenues by providing about 20 to 30 per cent more cargo capacity than the current airplanes of the same size. - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Boeing | Dreamliner | fleet | 787 | RJ | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Egyptian group Abu Soma plans Red Sea resort HLG Contracting wins Dubai mixed-use tower deal Desert Adventures Tourism eyes German-speaking tourist markets Boeing Q4 revenues down 1pc to $23.3bn Farhat Tours celebrates successful 10 years Fun-filled shopping experience awaits Bahrain's mall visitors Farhat International promotes two team members Kempinski Palm Jumeirah to host Kempinski Avenues 2017 Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel scoops 20 awards at Horeca Ascott appoints new director of sales in Muscat 'Google Search' top choice for travel inspiration Autumn Fair opens in Bahrain Connections Events gets top recognition at Eventex Awards Enjoy a romantic getaway at Al Wadi Desert, Ras Al Khaimah Mövenpick Hotels accelerates expansion plans Abu Dhabi records 4.4m tourists in 2016 New Muscat airport terminal to open by 2017 end RJ booth at Madrid tourism fair attracts large visitor numbers Abu Dhabi airport traffic tops 24.5m in 2016 Oman Air opens new grooming centre Stratajet partners with Mr and Mrs Smith Turkish Airlines, PIA expand code share deal Etihad expands B787 network in the Levant, Far East Spain Tourism launches new website for GCC customers Copperchase wins $500m Iraq airport contract Dubai 'popular timeshare destination for Africans' Hyatt Regency debuts in Riyadh Carlson Rezidor to open 17 hotels across ME Dubai's First Central Hotel Suites receives Green Key certification Central Park to be main attraction of new Cityland Mall Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Finance Search Boeing sees higher 2017 plane deliveries as earnings jumpAFP – Wed, Jan 25, 2017 2:45 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo Boeing said it expects commercial deliveries to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016 US aerospace giant Boeing projected higher commercial aircraft deliveries in 2017 compared with last year, and reported a 59 percent surge in fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Boeing said it expects commercial deliveries to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. While Boeing has described commercial aircraft as generally robust, in December it announced plans to cut production on the long-range 777 plane due to slackening demand. The company also beat expectations with earnings jumping to $1.6 billion in the final quarter of 2016, compared to the same period a year earlier, due partly to an uptick in commercial aircraft that helped offset lower profits from Boeing's military division. But the comparison to the prior year was boosted by a large charge in the fourth quarter of 2015. "With solid fourth quarter operating performance and a sharp strategic focus, we extended our aerospace market leadership in our centennial year and positioned Boeing for continued growth and success in our second century," chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said. For 2017, Boeing projected revenues between $90.5 billion and $90.2 billion, down $94.6 billion last year. The firm reported $23.3 billion in revenues in the latest quarter, down 1.2 percent. Boeing shares rose 0.8 percent to $161.83 in pre-market trading.

The US aerospace giant saw a 59 percent surge in earnings to $1.6 billion compared with final quarter of the prior year, beating expectations. The jump was due to higher commercial aircraft deliveries and a one-time charge in late 2015 that made the comparison more favorable. Boeing said it expects commercial deliveries to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016 ©SAUL LOEB (AFP/File) Boeing also said it expects commercial deliveries in 2017 to rise to between 760 and 765 aircraft this year, up from 748 in 2016, as the firm works through a backlog of orders. Deliveries are tied to revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. The report sparked a 5.0 percent rise in Boeing shares to $168.43 at midday, helping to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 20,000-point milestone for the first time. Investors shrugged off some negative aspects of the Boeing results, including $312 million in new unexpected costs for KC-46 military tanker program, another in what has been a recurring theme in recent the company's earnings reports. The report came as the new Trump administration puts its stamp on US policies and openly pressures companies in its "America First" agenda that has sparked worries of protectionism. Boeing felt the sting of his Twitter attack in December, when Trump lambasted the company for what he said were runaway costs of the next generation presidential plane, to serve as the famed Air Force One. Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg, who met with Trump twice prior to his inauguration and pledged to work to control costs on Air Force One, said he was confident the new president's agenda would be good for Boeing and that the US would avoid a trade war. "This is all about helping business being successful," Muilenburg said in a call with reporters and analysts, adding that he was "very confident" the new administration understands the importance of not alienating China, an important Boeing market. Muilenburg endorsed pro-growth policies such as lower taxes and "fair trade" for the United States, and said higher US defense spending could boost Boeing's business. The aerospace giant also is "standing by" to provide technology to support Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, which could mean increased contracts for the sales of unmanned aircraft for surveillance, he said. "And we are standing by to support where we can any US government decisions that are made along that path," Muilenburg said. Trump was expected later Wednesday to announce the first steps in building a massive wall on the Mexican border.

Revenue also exceeded forecasts. The company's full-year outlook fell short of Street estimates, however. Boeing also expects to deliver 760 to 765 jets this year, compared to 748 last year. United Technologies — United Technologies matched estimates, with quarterly profit of $1.56 per share. Revenue was also in line with expectations. The results were improved over a year ago, helped by better sales at the Pratt & Whitney engine unit. Textron — The maker of Bell Helicopters and Cessna aircraft reported adjusted quarterly profit of 80 cents per share, missing estimates by 7 cents a share. Its full-year outlook also fell short of Street forecasts. Separately, Textron announced a deal to buy recreational vehicle maker Arctic Cat for $247 million, or $18.50 per share in cash. Apple — Apple is close to striking a tax and incentives deal with Indian government officials to manufacture products in India, according to The Wall Street Journal. Gap Inc. — The apparel retailer announced the departure of Banana Republic unit president Andi Owen late next month. The apparel retailer's CEO, Art Peck, will oversee Banana Republic while the company searches for a successor. JetBlue — JPMorgan Chase upgraded the airline's stock to "overweight" from "neutral," while downgrading Southwest to "neutral" from "overweight," based on current valuations and near term passenger revenue figures. Alcoa — Alcoa reported adjusted quarterly profit of 14 cents per share, 10 cents a share below estimates. The aluminum producer's revenue was above estimates on higher prices.

Michaels Cos. — Michaels gave weaker-than-expected guidance, as well as announcing a secondary stock offering of 18 million shares. The shares are currently held by company stockholders, with the arts and crafts retailer intending to repurchase eight million of those shares. Texas Instruments — Texas Instruments beat estimates by 6 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 88 cents per share. The chipmaker's revenue also exceeded Street forecasts. Texas Instruments was helped by particularly strong results in its automotive and industrial markets. Capital One Financial — Capital One fell 15 cents a share shy of consensus estimates, with quarterly profit of $1.45 per share. The credit card company also saw revenue fall short. The shortfall was due in part to a 27 percent jump in the company's provision for credit losses. Discover Financial — Discover reported quarterly profit of $1.40 per share, 2 cents a share above estimates. The credit card issuer's revenue was slightly higher than forecasts. Discover saw strong loan growth, although its customer delinquency rate also rose. Intuitive Surgical — The company exceeded Street forecasts by 10 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $6.09 per share. The surgical products maker's revenue beat consensus, as well. Revenue rose by double digits, although the company is also accelerating its spending. Stryker — Stryker beat estimates by 2 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.78 per share. Revenue was very slightly above forecasts, however the medical device maker said sales and profits would improve at a slower pace in 2017. Cree — Cree doubled estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 20 cents per share. The LED lighting products maker also saw revenue exceeding estimates. Seagate Technology — Seagate reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.38 per share, 30 cents a share higher than forecasts. The hard disk maker's revenue came in above estimates, as well.

AppDynamics was in the process of planning an initial public offering and had been expected to price tonight. Cisco made the deal with an eye toward boosting its enterprise software product lineup. Wells Fargo — The bank's branch managers were warned at least 24 hours in advance when internal inspections were about to take place, according to The Wall Street Journal. The story focused on how the improper sales practices that recently came to light could have gone on for as long as they did. Bob Evans Farms — Bob Evans is selling its restaurant business to private-equity firm Golden Gate Capital for $565 million. Bob Evans will now focus on its packaged food business. Plains All American Pipeline — Plains is buying a crude oil gathering system in the Permian Basin from Concho Resources for about $1.22 billion.

Boeing stock jumped nearly 5 percent to $168.50 on Wednesday after the company said it expects to generate a record $10.75 billion in operating cash this year. The sum is up from a record $10.5 billion in 2016 and well above the $10.4 billion that analysts had forecast for 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Chicago-based aerospace and defense company forecast 2017 core earnings of $9.10 to $9.30 a share, which exclude some pension and other costs, up from $7.24 in 2016. Cost-cutting and productivity gains fueled Boeing's strong performance and forecast, and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he sees no signs of a slowdown on that front. "This will be a relentless effort going forward," he said on a conference call, referring to Boeing's efficiency drive. "While we've made some strong strides over the last couple of years, and you see it reflected in the performance, we have much more ahead of us than what's behind us." Orders for new jetliners have slowed sharply after peaking in 2014. Boeing and rival Airbus have focused on streamlining factories to lower costs and drive profits. Boeing has also benefited from lower costs for parts for its 787 as the plane reaches key production milestones. It delivered its 500th 787 in December. Boeing expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial aircraft in 2017, topping 748 deliveries in 2016, likely enough to keep the title of world's biggest plane maker. Boeing said its outlook showed confidence in its ability to continue smooth operating performance and cost-cutting while raising plane output. Some analysts questioned whether the cash performance will last into 2018, after Boeing cuts production of its 777 by 40 percent this year, begins assembly of the successor 777X model and goes into full production of the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker. Boeing said it took an aftertax tanker-related charge of $201 million in the fourth quarter due to initial production problems. "And that's not assuming any change in end-market demand, where trends have arguably been weakening," Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a note to clients. Boeing said deliveries of its smaller 737 and 737 MAX models will make up for the decline in 777 production. And it suggested the upward trend in performance won't falter. "Over the remainder of the decade, we continue to expect to see revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth," Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the call. The forecast includes a planned increase in the 787 production rate, which has been in question as sales have slowed. Muilenburg said recent meetings with President Donald Trump's show a pro-business attitude that should help Boeing. "I give a lot of credit here," he said. "President Trump has had business leaders at the table. He's listening, he's engaging and is making decisions that will help us grow the economy and ultimately grow U.S. manufacturing jobs."

Coren Obsession "America First" January 25, 2017 Incoming. (David Goldman / AP Photo) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession "America First" January 25, 2017 Say what you will about his hands, but Donald Trump now has the most powerful thumbs in the world. Even before he was sworn in as president, Trump tapping out tirades on Twitter regularly spooked investors and sent CEOs scurrying to save their stock price. No company appears to be safe (and woe to those closing US factories). Trump tweets have wiped billions of dollars off public companies’ share values, and ignited national boycotts by irate customers. Victims of Trump’s attention form a roll call of blue-chip stocks: Lockheed Martin, Toyota, Carrier, Ford, General Motors, and Boeing have all been in Trump’s crosshairs, directly or indirectly. A new industry is emerging in response. Consulting, communications, and public affairs firms in Washington DC have been inundated with calls to help insulate clients from Trump’s attacks via social media. They’re offering strategic advice to protect against the nightmare scenario: a direct assault by the president of the United States. The new playbook for firms bracing for the impact of a Trump presidency involves risk assessments, cultivating Congressional allies, recording testimonials, and rapid response teams for Twitter and Facebook. Of the eight DC firms Quartz spoke to this month, all were discussing crisis plans with clients to deal with a negative Trump tweet. Several were in the midst of formalizing packages as a kind of insurance plan. One global strategy firm told Quartz it had issued a company-wide directive saying that Trump’s tweets should be treated the same way as an earthquake or flood. “We are putting them in the same class as a natural disaster: a random event, out of the blue, with a really massive cleanup,” said a senior consultant. For Boeing, that cleanup involved the airplane company’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, making a pilgrimage to Trump Tower to undo the damage caused by Trump’s (somewhat inaccurate) Twitter thrashing: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 After a meeting in which he promised to find savings, Muilenburg praised Trump for “doing a great job of engaging with business.” Trump’s typing has also roiled international currency markets: Mexican traders have joked the country should just buy Twitter for $12 billion and shut it down, rather than spend billions defending its currency every time Trump tweets about trade and immigration, reports Bloomberg. For some, including the outdoor apparel company L.L.Bean, even Trump’s praise can be catastrophic. After a supportive tweet from Trump, the Maine company faced a customer backlash by those vowing to toss their backpacks and clothing: Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Meanwhile, the sneaker brand New Balance is battling its own boycott after its CEO supported Trump’s policy on international trade agreements and a neo-Nazi blogger declared New Balance the “official shoes of white people.” (New Balance, one of the few shoe companies that does most of its manufacturing in the US, said it rejects bigotry or hate in any form.) “It’s simply a risk of being pulled into his orbit,” says Andrew Paven of the media and government relations firm O’Neill and Associates. To cope, experts are counseling proactive defense, says Andrew Shore of the DC law firm Jochum, Shore & Trossevin PC. “‘Duck and cover’ isn’t a strategy,” said Shore, a lobbyist and former Republican congressional staffer. First, said the firm’s communications specialist Erica Richardson, companies should assess their vulnerabilities based on their industry, labor practices, pending legislation, employees’ political activity and other factors. She suggests bolstering existing relationships with allies in the Trump administration or Congress, as well as forging new ones, to guard against politicians preparing to copy Trump’s tactics. “It wouldn’t surprise me if this approach opens the door to members of Congress following his lead on social media,” she said. Companies should also prepare for a crisis with rapid response teams armed with fact-sheets, customer testimonials and pre-approved content for Twitter, Facebook and other channels—to forcefully challenge the narrative within hours, if not minutes. Some firms are not waiting to tout their American investments and jobs (many planned long before the election). Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos declared the company was creating 100,000 full-time US jobs over the next 18 months, many of them warehouse and call center positions that analysts said were already in the works. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced that it was investing $1 billion creating 2,000 US jobs (but denied that Trump’s tweets affected the investment decision). Expect more of this. The rhetorical weight of Trump’s 140 characters is growing. Trump’s Twitter following, already 20 million or so strong at inauguration, has now added another 14.5 million followers via the @POTUS handle (although many may overlap). With this megaphone, Trump can direct public attention where he wants it, in an instant. Trump lied regularly as a candidate, and has continued to do so as president (most recently telling lawmakers that millions of unauthorized immigrants robbed him of the popular vote). Twitter allows Trump to bypass the media and its fact-checking, and it amplifies his messages, many of which are taken up at obliging outlets such as Fox and Brietbart News. Each tweet sets off an automated process as well. Every time @realdonaldtrump tweets, thousands of computer algorithms spring into action, reports MarketWatch, triggering stocks being bought and sold, and alerts sent to investors. “Trump’s ability to dominate the information flow is unlike anything we had ever seen,” says Alex Conant of Firehouse Strategies, a former communications director for Florida congressman Marco Rubio’s failed presidential campaign. “He has a huge microphone and he’s using to shape the national conversation.” As the President has forged an alternative reality for millions of Americans, some of his Republican colleagues are promoting Trump’s Twitter feed as the sole source of truth—over independent sources and media: House Science Chair Smith: "Better to get your news directly from the president. In fact, it might be the only way to get unvarnished truth" — Cristina Marcos (@cimarcos) January 24, 2017 So far most experts have advised companies that the best strategy is to appease Trump and his team. But it’s only a matter of time before some companies strike back, says Richard Levick, who runs his eponymous communications firm. “I think in the not-too-distant future that there will be a company, probably a tech company, that will do the calculus just as Trump does and say, ‘There’s more to be gained by standing up and fighting back,'” he says. “Once that happens, every other company will follow suit. At that point, he’ll be seen as the king without any clothing.” Julie Hootkin, an executive at the public affairs agency GlobalStrategyGroup, argues that actively opposing Trump is going to be a winning strategy. “The assumption is [Trump] can really do damage to your reputation,” says Hootkin, whose firm works with Democratic-leaning clients. “Many brands’ corporate values are aligned with diversity, inclusion and environmental stewardship. For those companies, getting called out by Trump may not be that bad. He may be a really good foil for doubling down on your reputation.” For this strategy, a template already exists: media companies. So far, news outlets have thrived whenever Trump has singled them out. The New York Times says it saw record-breaking subscription growth in 2016, even as Trump unloaded on the newspaper: Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 And a scathing review of Trump Grill by Vanity Fair—calling it possibly the worst restaurant in America—prompted a swift retort from Trump: Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016 The day of that tweet, reports Folio, Vanity Fair saw an unprecedented surge in new subscriptions.

Since then, the aircraft has carried more than 1.8 billion people and over 1500 of these jets have rolled off the assembly lines. Her future is not so certain, however, as airlines are quickly doing away with fuel-hungry four-engine jets and moving towards thriftier twin-engine airplanes. With United Airlines’ announcement of accelerated retirement of their 747 fleet, I felt it was necessary to highlight some of the more unique aspects of the iconic “Queen of the Skies.” The “answer” (the story of the 747, pictured below) The first Boeing 747 Military/cargo heritage The genesis of the 747 came about in the early 1960s from a military request for a very large cargo aircraft. Boeing’s proposal was for an enormous airlifter with the cockpit situated above the main deck of the airplane. This configuration allowed easy loading of bulky cargo through a large swinging nose. Their offering was ultimately not selected by the Air Force (Lockheed won the contract with a jet that would become the massive C-5 Galaxy). However, in the mid 1960s, the company was approached by Juan Trippe, president of Pan American World Airways, to build an aircraft twice as large as his current fleet of 707s. While the aircraft was an all-new design, Boeing incorporated innovative technology that had been designed for their military proposal. This includes the flight deck location above the main deck of the aircraft, giving the 747 its iconic fuselage hump. High-Bypass Turbofan Of course an aircraft of such immense scale needed to be powered by an equally immense engine. However, in the 1960s, there simply was no engine large enough to power the proposed 700,000-pound behemoth. Boeing turned to engine-maker Pratt & Whitney for help. Their answer was the innovative JT9D, a High-Bypass Turbofan. Rather than using pure jet thrust to propel the airplane through the sky, these engines use some of that jet thrust’s energy to spin a large fan in the front. The air from this fan is blown, or bypassed, around the core and out the back of the engine (a more in depth explanation can be found here). The JT9D engine Boeing selected produced nearly 45,000 pounds of thrust, making it more than twice as powerful as other engines of the day. The benefits of this configuration were huge and immediate. More thrust could be generated while burning significantly less fuel. To this day, engines of this variety power nearly all commercial aircraft. Boeing’s big gamble The project was an enormous undertaking for the Boeing Company, both financially and technologically. No commercial aircraft had ever been designed to be this large before. And while Pan Am placed a $525 million order in 1966 for 25 airplanes, technical and financial success were still not assured. Boeing would have to build an entirely new plant to construct the new jet and the new large engines would still have to prove their reliability. Boeing invested over $2 billion in the new undertaking. New Everett plant To construct such a large aircraft, you need an equally large factory. Upon securing the contract from Pan Am, Boeing purchased nearly 800 acres of land at Paine Field in Everett, Washington. On this land, they proceeded to construct the world’s largest building (by volume), containing 472 million cubic feet of total volume within its walls. While the plant was still under construction in 1968, a team of Boeing employees dubbed “The Incredibles” were already assembling the first 747. Massive proportions The public got its first glimpse of the new jumbo jet on September 30, 1968, as the plane was rolled out of its hangar for the first time. It was a sight to behold. It was 225-feet long and her 195-foot wingspan was greater than the distance of the Wright Brothers’ first flight. The tail of the airplane rose an astounding six stories, and the flight deck sat 29 feet above the ground. Wide-body innovation The Boeing 747 was the first aircraft to be dubbed a wide-body. At 21-feet wide, her cabin proportions allowed configurations for 10 seats per row with two aisles. All this interior area allowed airlines to experiment with some luxurious amenities and configurations. American Airlines had perhaps the most notable 747 cabin, which included an aft lounge for coach passengers and piano bar! Tires and landing gear To evenly distribute the massive weight of the airplane, Boeing engineers designed the aircraft with sixteen main landing gear tires and two nose gear tires. Each of these main-gear tires are 4 feet tall and inflated with nitrogen. To aid pilots in maneuvering the behemoth around tight airport taxiways, Boeing designed a system called “body-gear steering.” This system actually turns the inner two main landing gear in response to steering inputs by the pilots. Think of a hook-and-ladder fire truck with a firefighter steering the rear axel. This way the airplane can maneuver around tight corners despite its size. To sum up The Boeing 747 has been an aviation icon since its rollout in 1968. Since then, countless travelers have lauded its size and comfort. But it was more than just an airplane. The 747 connected continents, people and ideas like no other airplane before. That is why the mighty “Queen of the Skies” stands as one of the most important technological achievements of all time.

This is the second of the pair of all-electric satellite Boeing has delivered to ABS. ABS, one of the globe's fastest growing global satellite operators, offers a complete range of tailored solutions including broadcasting, data and telecommunication services to broadcasters, service providers, enterprises and government organisations. It operates a fleet of satellites; ABS-2, ABS-2A, ABS-3A, ABS-4/Mobisat-1, ABS-6 and ABS-7. The satellite fleet covers 93 per cent of the population across the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, CIS and Russia. ABS-2A was launched in June 2016 aboard SpaceX Falcon 9 and will provide enhanced satellite communications services, including direct-to-home television services. Equipped with 48 Ku-band transponders, the satellite will serve ABS’ customers in Africa, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Russia, South Asia and South East Asia regions at 74.725 degrees east. “We have completed our three satellite build investment in launching as many satellites in as many consecutive years (ABS-2 in 2014, ABS-3A in 2015 and ABS-2A in 2016). ABS-2A is the latest high-capacity satellite providing expansion capacity and continuity of satellite services at our prime gateway over the Indian Ocean region. It is located with ABS-2 at our premium neighborhood at 75°E, optimized for video services for growing CATV and DTH businesses,” said ABS CEO Tom Choi. “Boeing is the first satellite manufacturer to build and deliver all-electric propulsion satellites, and this latest delivery reaffirms our leadership with all-electric propulsion,” said Boeing Satellite Systems International president Mark Spiwak. “The scalable 702 satellite, coupled with the efficiency of all-electric propulsion, allows two satellites to launch inside one rocket. This ability to stack and join the satellites using our patented design enables our customers to minimize the costs associated with launching a single satellite.” Headquartered in Bermuda, ABS, with offices in the U.S, the UAE, South Africa and Asia, is majority-owned by funds managed by PE Permira.

The centre will focus on technology-driven work to support diverse projects spreading across Information Technology and Data Analytics, Engineering, Research & Technology, and Test.  For instance, some of the areas of work would include data analytics for next generation airplane health management tools, software tools for airlines and airports to improve their operations and reduce costs, automation for more efficient next-generation manufacturing, systems, infrastructure and analytics, said an official release. Boeing already has an engineering facility in the city on Old Madras Road. Representatives from Boeing told Express that it had started scaling up its engineering presence over the past 18 months in India and, as a result, capacity in the old centre was unable to support the growth. “We have taken a floor in the building and it is 42,000 sq ft. This is to support the scaling up plans. In the same building, we’ll take up another 42,000 sq ft by this year,” said a Boeing representative. Currently, the centre has 300-350 engineers and Boeing is looking at increasing this number to 800 by the end of the year. The old facility would also be retained. “The team working here will be working as part of the global team,” the representative added. Speaking after the launch, Pratyush Kumar, president, Boeing India, said, “In India, we see a true path towards a mutual partnership for success, and the launch of BIETC is a major step in that direction. When we look for regions of competitiveness for the company around the world, we look at building cost, capability and market access advantages.” Boeing IT has been working in India with Tier-1 suppliers for many years and the new centre was instrumental in promoting the digital transformation of Boeing by utilising India’s talent seamlessly with Boeing’s US teams, added Ted Colbert, Boeing chief information officer and senior vice-president, information & analytics,  Boeing has been active in the country for the past 75 years primarily with commercial plane. Its military aircraft and services business are also playing an important role in the defence forces.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney American Airlines eliminating in-seat screens on new jets by Jon Ostrower   @jonostrower January 25, 2017: 3:23 PM ET Delta has healthier food. But does it taste good? American Airlines says it dropping seat-back screens from its in-flight entertainment on its 100 new Boeing 737 Max jets because most passengers carry their own screens. In a statement Tuesday, American Airlines (AAL) said 90% of its passengers bring their own devices aboard. American contends that smartphones, tablets or laptops do a better job than the airline's individual screens. The new single aisle 737 Max will debut on American Airlines routes later in 2017. As the new planes start arriving, the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is adding satellite-based high-speed internet connectivity to its planes from Gogo (GOGO) and Via Sat (VSAT), a major upgrade from its existing sluggish air-to-ground cellular network. The broadband connection will enable video streaming from services like Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30). "It makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years," the company said in a statement. Related: American introduces basic economy fare United Airlines (UAL) is also skipping the screens on its single-aisle jets in favor of a wi-fi connection. While American will charge for streaming and internet surfing, it will move its live TV channels and stored TV episode and movie libraries from the seat back screen to an on-board streaming server to access much of the same content to your device. American uses the workhorse 737 on routes all over the U.S. The 737 Max promises 14% better fuel efficiency over Boeing's jets today and removing the screens, wiring and power boxes from around 160 seats means less weight and lower fuel consumption. American plans to keep the screens on its current-generation 737s which are still streaming out of Boeing's factory and the Airbus A321s it uses on the competitive routes connecting New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The airline will also keep the screens for its twin-aisle Boeing 777s, 787s, Airbus A330s, and A350s, its biggest and longest-range airplanes that operate the vast majority of its international flights. Related: Top exec out at American Airlines is new president at United The move by American is the latest in the ascent of high-speed internet as an on-board amenity as airlines race to duplicate the living room experience in the sky. JetBlue Airways (JBLU) said earlier this month its entire fleet was outfitted for free high-speed internet access for flights over the continental U.S., and Alaska Airlines (ALK) said it now offers free access to its wi-fi for Apple iMessage, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users. Delta Air Lines (DAL), too, is adding high-speed internet connections on board, but has kept its seat back screens on its new deliveries of single-aisle aircraft like its 737 and Airbus A321s and other aircraft that fly longer domestic routes.

See Offers Business Posted January 26 Updated January 26 increase font size How did Dow get to 20K? Three stocks led rally Think financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing and consulting company IBM. By MARLEY JAYAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — Dow 20,000 wasn’t exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. A screen at a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is juxtaposed with the Goldman Sachs booth. The Dow climbed to the 20,000 mark because of three stocks. Associated Press/Richard Drew Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They’re so optimistic that they’re buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it’s trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company’s stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: While a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Ignore them. Repeat.Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or 0.5 percent, that counts as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, a more than 3 percent gain. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the Dow industrials index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points between Nov. 22 and Thursday, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: While a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Boeing developed the Starliner spacesuit for use aboard the company’s CST-100 spacecraft, NASA’s eagerly awaited replacement for the Space Shuttle. It was officially unveiled at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday. The full suit weighs about 20 pounds (about 9 kilograms), some 10 pounds lighter than the suits worn by the shuttle crews. Its material allows water vapor to pass through but retains air, making the suits cooler and more comfortable. Materials used for the elbows and knees allow for a wider range of movement, while astronauts can adapt the shape of the spacesuit when seated or standing by using “strategically located” zippers, NASA said. “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Four current NASA astronauts – Boe, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams – have been training with the new suit, which also features gloves that allow the wearer to interface with touchscreen displays and controls inside the CST-100. “I was essentially the model for this as they built the suit around me,” said former astronaut Chris Ferguson, who commanded the final Space Shuttle mission in 2011 and now works for Boeing as the director of crew and missions systems. © NASA Visually, the outfit is strikingly similar to spacesuits featured in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the 1968 science fiction film by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. The CST-100 was designed to carry up to seven passengers into low-Earth orbit, and be reusable up to 10 times with a six-month turnaround, according to Boeing. NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract for the Starliner in 2014, as part of its Commercial Crew Transportation Capability program. The spacecraft is scheduled for unmanned testing in June 2018, with a crewed test following in August. If all goes well, the CST-100 will deliver two astronauts to the International Space Station in December 2018. Currently the only spaceship capable of transporting crew to the ISS is the Soyuz, a modernized Soviet design operated by the Russian space agency Roscosmos. In addition to Boeing’s CST-100, NASA is hoping to use SpaceX’s Dragon 2 ship, due for a crewed orbital test in May 2018.

It’s not clear if her office will allow the search of the presidential Blue House. If her impeachment is upheld, she will become the first democratically elected leader to be removed from office in South Korea. Park, 64, is still protected from prosecution as she remains in office although she has been stripped of power. Boeing 2016 net profit down 5%; revenue to decline again in 2017 For the quarter, the aerospace company posted adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.47 on revenues of $23.29 billion. Reilly Financial Advisors LLC increased its stake in shares of Boeing Company (The) by 22.9% in the third quarter. Millions of people took to the streets of Seoul and other cities late a year ago to protest against corruption and also what they say was poor leadership during the sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014, which left more than 300 dead or missing.MS Choi has also been alleged for making corruption and gaining favors from country’s big firms including electronics giant Samsung. “Do you think she should be treated well while being investigated?” the woman shouted.”Not unless she wants to reveal something in favor of her criminal trials, it is most likely that she will keep her mouth shut or refuse to answer during the interrogation”, a lawyer with knowledge of the state probe told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity because the case is still on going. Jose Mourinho talks up Man Utd prospect Axel Tuanzebe United could play as many as 32 more matches, excluding replays, this season given their involvement in four competitions, including the Europa League. The interview marks a fightback by Ms Park, daughter of the late dictator Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated in 1979, and his wife Yook Young-soo, who was assassinated in 1974.The list had almost 10,000 people on it, including Park Chan-wook, director of the well known mystery thriller Oldboy.Ms Park denies involvement in the blacklist. The independent counsel looking into an influence-peddling scandal revolving around the president and Choi executed an arrest warrant issued against Choi, who is at the center of the scandal. Cavs not interested in Kevin Love-for-Carmelo Anthony swap, sources say Team president Phil Jackson already has been credited with helping turn the Cavaliers into a championship team by dealing J.R. I’m in a different situation than him. “I don’t think I’m the only playmaker in the National Basketball Association “. The political turmoil that erupted in October has brought huge numbers onto South Korea’s streets for weekly protests to demand Park’s immediate departure from office.

The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Freed is president of the Center for Political Accountability. Charles E.M. Kolb is a member of the CPA board. Kolb was president of the Committee for Economic Development from 1997 to 2012 and served as deputy assistant for domestic policy to President George H.W. Bush from 1990 to 1992.) By Bruce F. Freed and Charles E.M. Kolb Jan 26 In a meeting with automakers on the fourth day of his presidency, Donald Trump appeared eager to cooperate with executives. But that tone was in stark contrast to his messaging on Twitter and at a pre-presidential news conference, where he targeted some businesses for attack and embraced others. Trump assailed the pharmaceutical industry at his Jan. 11 news conference, saying drug companies "are getting away with murder." Key drug stocks immediately plummeted. The following day, Trump tweeted that Americans should "Buy L.L. Bean," after thanking an L.L. Bean board and family member for her political support. With his tweet, he put an iconic Yankee company in the crosshairs of a polarized national discourse. Whether Trump has been testing messages to use as president or launching a regular practice, he has used his own "bully pulpit" to put some businesses on notice and to commend others. This approach is raising questions about what some economists call "crony capitalism" and also about quid-pro-quo politics, and it's shaking up company executives who might otherwise be optimistic about pledges of economic growth. Seven years ago, the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision freed companies to engage in political spending. The cost of elections keeps surging with the 2016 presidential cycle nearing $7 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2012. Today, how will U.S. companies respond to rising concerns about bullying or favoritism in federal government intervention, and will Trump's L.L. Bean endorsement provide a greater incentive to engage politically? U.S. corporate leaders from Carrier (HVAC manufacturing) to Boeing (aircraft manufacturing) and Ford (auto manufacturing) have been among those targeted by Trump as he presses his job-growth agenda. On Jan. 11, the nine top pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 by market cap lost a staggering $24.6 billion in 20 minutes during Trump's press conference, according to one analysis. Trump said the drug companies charge the government too much for medicines. On Jan. 12, Trump tweeted about L.L. Bean, which an anti-Trump group called Grab Your Wallet had added to its list of companies targeted for boycotting. An L.L. Bean official quickly reminded inquiring news media that the company makes "no political endorsements or contributions," despite the fact that board member Linda Bean donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported Trump. A dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system requires a level playing field in which companies focus on how best to compete in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. A number of economists believe crony capitalism brings harmful uncertainty to U.S. companies. And there is academic research suggesting an association between government-induced risk and companies' increased political donations. How, then, would U.S. companies respond to a new president's bully pulpit? When he urges millions of Twitter followers to buy a company's products in the wake of its board member's political contributions, will business leaders see it as a quid-pro-quo endorsement? Or will they listen instead to the skeptical Trump who boasted on the campaign trail of giving money to politicians to get them to "do whatever the hell you want them to do," while calling the existing campaign finance system "broken"? These aren't idle questions, given what we're seeing in company contributions to the Trump inauguration. According to news reports, Trump-target Boeing pledged $1 million. Chevron, which has a deep stake in the incoming administration's energy and regulatory policies, gave $500,000. And AT&T, which is seeking to merge with Time Warner, has acknowledged that it contributed. It's too early to tell what factors the new president and new Congress will take into account in making decisions about businesses. In the meantime, in the interest of promoting economic growth along with their own protection, businesses can take concrete steps to protect themselves, shareholders and our democracy. Being transparent about when they give political money and adopting clear policies for this spending are two of the most significant safeguards companies can adopt at a time when one of Citizens United's central promises has not been fulfilled. In his Citizens United opinion for the court's majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy unshackled companies to engage in almost unfettered political spending while asserting that modern technology has the potential to make "disclosures rapid and informative." The latter promise has not been met. In large part due to Citizens United and other court rulings, the U.S. election cycle in 2016 broke spending records. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups not formally connected to either political party, including organizations not required under U.S. law to disclose their donors. These latter groups' secretive political funds often are called "dark money." Because these organizations may keep their donors anonymous, they are particularly attractive to like-thinking corporations and others who want to keep their donations under the radar. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, a powerful business trade association, is allowed under U.S. law to keep the sources of its political spending hidden. It spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races. So-called "social welfare" groups run ads about hot issues, sometimes attacking candidates, and they are also permitted to hide donor identities. All told, political dark money was projected to add up to at least $132 million in 2016. Unfortunately, the promise of broad, effective disclosure that the Supreme Court embraced in Citizens United still seems remote. It is impossible to measure the total largesse of rivers of corporate political giving intended to influence elections. It is possible, however, by looking at disclosed spending, to get a sense of scale of corporate political engagement at another level: in the states, where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups spent $137 million. When companies are transparent about their political contributions, they can protect against payments that might cause a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate, or an ill-considered payment that can damage their reputation. A clear policy on political spending can protect them against public or private pressure from a political candidate, allowing them to cite company policy in order to say "no." These steps are getting mainstream traction from companies acting on their own. According to a recent nonpartisan report examining the S&P 500, 305 of these companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 had placed some level of restriction on their political spending. It looks like Trump will continue to use his bully pulpit to shame and blame companies, and concerns about crony capitalism will keep growing. If this happens, companies can protect themselves and their integrity by following guidance from Business Roundtable, which encourages company boards to oversee political spending and consider adopting a policy on disclosure. It's modest advice, but it may help companies in the eye of Trump's next storm. (By Bruce F. Freed and Charles E.M.

Chris Christie in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandalMore >    By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Dow 20,000 wasn't exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They're so optimistic that they're buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it's trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It's worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company's stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq don't work that way. They're weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren't doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven't moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they're also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.

Being the first to take possession of the new jetliner is a sign of the fast-growing carrier’s increasing stature among the world’s airlines. “Norwegian will now be the first airline to take delivery of the Boeing 737 Max and we will be the first airline in the world to operate this brand-new aircraft type,” an airline spokesman said in an email. Norwegian said it will take delivery of the first of its Max jets in May and “then it will take a little time before it enters operation,” the spokesman added. The airline has ordered 100 of the jets. But being the first comes with added challenges, as the first operator typically works out the early kinks of a new design. When Norwegian first took its 787 Dreamliner in 2013, its early operations were repeatedly disrupted by reliability issues with the advanced long-range airliner. Norwegian plans to use the single-aisle 737 Max, with its increased range, to fly between Europe and smaller cities in the U.S. The low-cost airline’s long-haul operations from Europe are flown today with larger 787 Dreamliners. The airline has been at the center of a fierce controversy with U.S. airlines and their labor unions over the Department of Transportation’s approval of the carrier’s ability to fly from Ireland to the U.S.. The unions claim Norwegian will undercut wages for U.S.-based pilots and cabin crews or hire less expensive non-U.S. crews while flying to America. Southwest Airlines was the first carrier to place a firm order for Boeing’s updated single-aisle jet back in December 2011 and has long been expected to take the first jet from the plane maker. Southwest said Thursday that it won’t take its first Max until July and it will start flying passengers on October 1. Boeing’s chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday that the Max, which has been in testing since January 2016, will deliver during the second quarter, but did not say which airline would take the first jet. Southwest has faced obstacles getting the Max into its fleet, first facing a now-settled labor dispute with its pilots over pay on the aircraft and the compatibility of the fourth generation aircraft into its all-Boeing 737 fleet. Southwest is the largest operator of 737 jets in the world, and was the first airline the last time Boeing introduced a new generation of its workhorse airliner in 1997. Boeing holds orders for more than 3,400 737 Max jets, which feature a pair of new engines and aerodynamic updates to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

New Delhi: Budget carrier SpiceJet has made a part payment of its dues to the state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI) and also signed an agreement with aircraft leasing firm BBAM to settle out of court the dispute over Boeing rentals. "SpiceJet has paid a part payment of Rs 25 crore to the Airports Authority of India towards the dues it had accumulated due to the cash crunch last year," sources said on Wednesday. The AAI received the part payment of around Rs 300 crore dues on Tuesday, they said. Meanwhile, the airline said that aircraft leasing firm BBAM has agreed in-principle to settle out of court the dispute over aircraft rentals. "SpiceJet has entered into an in-principle understanding with its five lessors managed by BBAM Aircraft Leasing and Finance with regard to five aircraft operated by the company," SpiceJet said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. Under the understanding, the lessors have agreed to suspend court proceedings, including winding these up, and the de-registration process of aircraft, subject to SpiceJet satisfying the terms of settlement and parties executing definitive agreements, the airline said. SpiceJet was dragged to court by several aircraft leasing firms including BBAM after it had failed to pay rentals for some of its Boeing 737 aircraft due to financial crunch last year. A single judge bench of the high court had on March 19 directed the DGCA to de-register six Boeing 737 aircraft given to the carrier. But on March 23, another of its lessors Wilmington Trust SP Services (Dublin) Ltd decided to withdraw the court proceedings and de-registration process of aircraft after the parties reached an agreement on the issue. Currently, the budget carrier has a fleet of 32 aircraft, of which 27 are Boeing 737 and the rest Bombardier Q400s. The airline plans to add seven more such planes between this month and May.

Incidentally, they’re also icy-blue. Image credits Boeing. The suits were designed to be lighter, more comfortable, and less cumbersome than their earlier counterparts. The agency reports that the whole shebang weighs in at about 20 pounds (9 kg) with all accessories. That’s a full 33% lighter than the orange launch-and-entry suits you see astronauts wear on TV. Another feature bound to make crewmembers really happy is that the Starliner suits allow water vapor to pass through, away from the astronauts, while remaining airtight. No more stuffy suits! A new architecture and material composition for the knee and elbow sections as well as re-vamped joint patterns throughout the suit makes them much more flexible too. The helmet and visor are now part of the suit so you don’t have to worry about misplacing them. Several zippers can be pulled up or down to make the suit more form-fitting during sitting or walking. Finally, touchscreen-sensitive fingertips tie it all together. Image credits Boeing. But there’s only one thing you really need your space suit to do, and these blue babies definitely deliver: Advertisement “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” Astronauts have already had the chance to get a feel for their new threads inside a Starliner mock-up, to learn how best to use both. They repeatedly climbed in and out of the mock-up, interacted with all the buttons, screens, or knobs around, and of course tested the suits at that all important space-going activity — sitting. Houston, we have a-comfortable. Image credits Boeing. “The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft’s redundant life support systems,” said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don’t need a spacesuit. It’s like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed.” These suits will keep the crew safe and comfy inside the spaceship, and on the ISS in case of emergency. The heavy duty outer-space suits (called extravehicular mobility units, or EMUs) are already on board the station. So between the cool new wearables, the awesome postables, and the ridiculously cool Mars recruitment campaign NASA has been spoiling us with lately, you’re probably dreaming of becoming an astronaut yourself.

By Larry Light MoneyWatch January 26, 2017, 2:05 PM How much credit does Donald Trump deserve for Dow rally? Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email President Donald Trump’s election coincided with a big rally in the stock market, culminating in the Dow Jones industrial average topping the 20,000 mark on Wednesday. But is the entire surge attributable to Mr. Trump? Maybe half of it, but not the entire thing. For sure, the post-election run-up has been solid. The Dow, from Election Day on Nov. 8 through Wednesday, gained 9.5 percent, and from the election to last Friday’s inauguration, 8.6 percent. Before that, the rise was less robust: for 2016 up to Election Day, 5.2 percent. And to deliver that much, the Dow had to struggle through a first half beset by worries about China’s lagging growth, low prices for oil and other commodities and Great Britain’s surprise voted to leave the European Union.  Play Video CBS This Morning What Dow's 20,000 milestone means for U.S. economy On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will open above 20,000 points for the first time in history. It marks a major milestone since a ... The “Trump bump,” as it’s known, actually has had three phases. From the election to mid-December was the bulk of the advance, about six weeks. The Dow crept up close to 20K -- but then the rally stalled. Only in recent days, since Mr. Trump took the oath of office, has the market revived again. The Dow crossed the 20,000 line, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite touched new records.  At the same time, other influences were at work that had little or nothing to do with the new president: Corporate earnings, negative since 2015, turned positive again. Oil prices, which tumbled from $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to $26 in early 2016, rebounded to over $50 by fall -- good news for battered energy companies and their stocks. The Federal Reserve served notice that it would raise interest rates, a boon for financial companies, which saw shares ascend. Meanwhile, numerous economic indicators perked up.  Let’s sketch out the dynamics of the post-election rally, to see which stemmed from Mr. Trump and which from other factors: Trump euphoria. Pre-election, numerous analyst projections held that a Trump victory would spell stock market catastrophe, because they feared he would start a trade war against China and other nations, balloon the national debt with his massive tax cuts and infrastructure build-out and further polarize the U.S.  The opposite happened in the market. Investors greeted Mr. Trump’s win as a near-guarantee that his proposals -- which they viewed as “pro-growth” -- would be enacted. Gus Faucher, PNC deputy chief economist, wrote in a research note: “The improvement in the stock market is based on expectations for stronger economic growth under the Trump administration, which would boost corporate profits, and expected lower taxes on those profits.”  Lower corporate and individual taxes, lighter regulation and presumably business-friendly policies will lead to an economic boom, the reasoning went. “Trump’s message is clear,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank. “America is open for business. And if you sell it here, you better make it here.”  Many of the Dow components began rising. While post-election rallies are not that remarkable, this one had a special oomph. Financial services stocks, held in low regard since the 2008-09 crisis, benefited from talk that Mr. Trump would revoke or at least diminish the Dodd-Frank law, which placed regulatory burdens on many of them following the widespread economic carnage from the financial crisis. A big beneficiary was Goldman Sachs (GS), the largest stock in the Dow at an 8 percent weighting. Unlike many other indexes that use market valuation in their weightings, the Dow measures its 30 members by stock price alone. So Goldman, as its only stock over $200, has the most heft. Goldman is up 30 percent since the election. Another winner was the defense sector, because Mr. Trump has vowed to bolster military spending. Take Boeing (BA), which has enjoyed a 17 percent lift since the election. Boeing’s climb came despite a brief drop in early December, when Mr. Trump criticized the aerospace company for profligate spending on construction of two new presidential aircraft. Indeed, according to Bespoke Investment Group, Mr. Trump’s transition period had the second largest Dow increase in history, behind Herbert Hoover’s. Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and George H.W. Bush weren’t too far behind Mr. Trump. The pause, and the uptick. In mid-December, though, the rapid tempo slowed to a plod. Partly, that was due to fatigue; even the most rampaging bull run needs a pause. And some of the initial market surge was plain old relief that “the uncertainty of who would be in charge was lifted,” said Nicholas Atkeson, a managing director at US Capital Wealth Management, an asset manager in San Francisco. That emotion can last only so long, he said. In addition, Mr. Trump seemed to be spending much of his time during the transition as a national scold, which likely helped slow market momentum. He kept up his campaign on Twitter and in person to slam his perceived foes. For New Year’s, for instance, he tweeted these wishes: “Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. Love!” A CBS News poll in December showed that 53 percent of Americans were either concerned or scared about his plans as president.  “His personal style became distracting,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark, a financial consulting firm in Concord, Calif. “People began asking: Where is he going to get that $1 trillion” for infrastructure.  Great! #Dow20K https://t.co/wXFhXBLgag— President Trump (@POTUS) January 25, 2017 But it’s significant that the Dow, which had been flirting with the 20,000 mark from December into January, finally got there just a few days after Mr. Trump’s swearing in. That’s because, once he assumed power, he had the ability to turn talk into action, said Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles private equity firm. “This is the Dow Trump index,” he said. Mr. Trump himself did not give much analysis to the Dow’s milestone, other than to tweet it was “Great!” Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci, a financier, tweeted: “Stock market performance in 6 weeks following President Trump’s victory is best among all elections since 1900,” using Bloomberg numbers. Using that six-week measure, of course, cuts off the market doldrums period that began in mid-December.  In his first week in office, Mr. Trump froze new or pending regulations, removed Obama administration-imposed roadblocks to two oil pipelines, formally withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (which he says would lead to more American job losses) and signed an order streamlining federal approvals for infrastructure projects. Those steps, in addition to several on the conservative wish list -- like starting to roll back Obamacare and saying he would announce his right-leaning pick for the Supreme Court next week -- signaled to the market that Mr. Trump was getting things done. Before his inauguration, it was “hypothetical,” Schiffer said. “Now he is showing not telling, and firing on all cylinders.”  The other factors. Corporate earnings, a key driver of market performance, have been doing well lately. “This has really encouraged investors,” asset manager Atkeson said, adding that better profits have nothing to do with the president and his program, at least at the moment.  Earnings had been declining since 2015, owing to problems ranging from weak global growth to a strong dollar (which makes U.S. overseas sales worth less to American multinationals) to a collapse in oil prices, which slammed the energy industry badly. Lately, however, many of those headwinds have ebbed.  Then came the profits turnaround. In 2016’s third quarter, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, earnings grew 5.2 percent. Companies are just now starting to report their results for last year’s final quarter, and FactSet researchers project they will come in at 3.6 percent.  Play Video CBS Evening News Federal Reserve announces interest rate hike The Federal Reserve voted unanimously Wed. to raise interest rates one quarter of one percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen cited falling unemployment ... The economy is doing fairly well. something that started during Barack Obama’s presidency. The expansion isn’t spectacular, to be sure -- gross domestic product growth has averaged around 2 percent yearly since the Great Recession, and numerous forecasts say it will stay at that tepid pace over the next two years. But GDP and other economic measurements are  progressing well enough to stir optimism among investors and uncleash what legendary economist John Maynard Keynes called “animal spirits.”  The Federal Reserve, which has been holding off on raising interest rates out of fear that would squelch growth, felt positive enough about the economy’s prospects to boost them last month -- and plans for three more hikes in 2017. Numerous economic indicators, though hardly all, show a brighter picture nowadays. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index posted strong increases in November and December. Similarly, the Institute for Supply Management’s tally of manufacturing orders jumped in December.  Amid strong wage growth, the unemployment rate in December was 4.7 percent, a level that the Federal Reserve terms “full employment.” Last month, hourly pay rose 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the largest increase in more than seven years. Also last month, wages rose a further 10 cents to $26 after sliding 2 cents in November.     Should Mr. Trump get his economic program through Congress, then the market may well continue to take heart and climb higher. None of that, however, is a sure thing. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Minister for Defence Procurement Harriett Baldwin discussed the MOD's joint initiative with Boeing International President Marc Allen. Crown Copyright The MOD and Boeing are working together to build UK prosperity, growth, and exports across the country. As part of their commitment to the UK, Boeing signed the UK aerospace industry’s Supply Chain Competitiveness Charter, which is designed to strengthen relationships between companies and their suppliers, so that they work together more effectively to raise UK productivity and competitiveness. Highlights of the joint initiative so far include: A new commercial airline hangar to be constructed at Gatwick airport, supporting more than 100 jobs Collaboration on a new £100m P-8A operational support and training base at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, creating more than 100 new jobs Boeing facilitated a visit to Seattle for 37 UK suppliers to deepen their relationships with Boeing driving enhanced prosperity in the UK Training courses for UK suppliers on how to win additional business with the company, further enhancing the competitiveness of the UK supply chain Education partnerships with the Royal Academy of Engineering and the RAF Air Training Corps in Northern Ireland, which reached more than 5,000 young people in the UK last year Minister Harriett Baldwin said: Britain’s defence industry plays a key role delivering an economy that works for everyone. Across the UK, Britain’s defence companies provide highly skilled, well-paid jobs with world class manufacturing exports. Boeing expects to increase their UK workforce by 50% by 2020. This joint initiative is a prime example of the cutting edge, high-skilled, job-creating investment that our industrial strategy seeks to harness to make Britain one of the most competitive places in the world to innovate, build businesses and deliver secure, long-term prosperity for all. The government’s Industrial Strategy will seek to make fresh choices about how the UK shapes its economy and presents an opportunity to deliver a bold, long term Industrial Strategy that builds on strengths and prepares for the years ahead. Following a period of consultation, the government intends to publish an Industrial Strategy white paper in 2017 that will set out the plan for full and long term delivery.  Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, said: Boeing’s partnership with the UK, which dates back to the 1930s, goes from strength to strength today. Boeing values the UK’s aerospace and defence capabilities. In both 2015 and 2016 Boeing in the UK hired, on average, a new employee per day and our relationship with the UK supply chain today has more than doubled in value since 2011. This growth continues in 2017 and beyond, with further significant announcements to follow in the future, building on our initiative’s achievements already in place. There is much more to come from the strategic prosperity initiative. During their meeting Minister Harriett Baldwin and Marc Allen looked ahead to the next six months of collaboration: Boeing will increase bid opportunities for UK suppliers and work with the government to enhance UK competitiveness. The aim is for UK companies to double their supply work with Boeing and win higher proportions of content on future Boeing aircraft. Boeing will make the UK its European base for training, maintenance, repair and overhaul across its defence fixed-wing and rotary platforms. Boeing will make the UK a base for defence exports to Europe and the Middle East, increasing UK employment and investment.

Israel entered a new era in air defense today. After years of research and development, the Ministry of Defense Homa Administration (Israel Missile Organization), part of the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure, and the US Missile Defense Agency delivered the first new Arrow 3 advanced air defense system interceptors to Israel air force air defense units. 17 years after the Arrow system was first made operational, the Arrow 3 is extending and upgrading Israel's air defense. It provides Israel with new capabilities in intercepting ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads while these are still far away from us in outer space. In other words, Arrow 3 interception is not the Iron Dome interception of a Grad missile. Regardless of how much you gaze skyward, you will hear no boom and see no smoke. Today's ceremony at the Palmachim air force base means that if someone in Iran or any distant country presses the button tomorrow, the interception office on duty in the air defense system can launch the Arrow 3 at the missile threat. The advantage of the Arrow 3 is not merely its ability to intercept missiles bearing evil payloads far away from Israel's borders, while preventing complications caused by poisonous and hazardous fallout liable to be emitted following the explosion. Operationally, these missiles are designed to significantly increase the interception opportunities available to Israel when needed. If the first Arrow 3 interceptor fired misses its target missile, and that can happen, the interception officer at one of the Arrow 3 batteries will have enough time to launch another Arrow 3 interceptor at the missile threat. RELATED ARTICLES Israel's US missile defense grant could rise to $600m Israel's Arrow 3 aces test by striking missile in space Even if interception does not take place, Arrow 2 interceptors, which have undergone a series of upgrades, revisions, and adaptations since being made operational by the air force, will also be directed at the target missile. The Arrow 2 Block 4 missiles currently possessed by the air force are extremely advanced and up-to-date. They are capable of intercepting all the missiles and heavy rockets in the arsenal of Israel's enemies when the day of decision comes. Even though Arrow 3 missiles have smaller dimensions than Arrow 2 missiles, and there is a significant difference in their interception method, compared with the older Arrow missiles, they can be launched against enemy missiles using the existing infrastructure. A senior Homa source says that declaration of the new missiles as operational requires no substantial changes in the deployment of the missile batteries. These batteries operate from two sites, Palmachim and Ein Shemer, and are connected to the Oren Adir (Magnificent Pine) radar system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. (IAI) (TASE: ARSP.B1) subsidiary Elta Systems. "The entire Arrow system is able to work together, and speaks the same language," the source stated. "New and important capabilities have been added to the command and control center and to the radar detection system, whose capabilities against the future threats expected in this area have been upgraded." IAI is the chief contractor in the Arrow 3 program, and US company Boeing is the senior partner. Components linked to the new missiles system are produced in Boeing's US plants, imported to Israel, and assembled in Israel at IAI's Malam factory. With the delivery of the new missile interceptors to the air force, other defense companies can also pat themselves on the back for this achievement and take part in the celebratory occasion by opening several bottles of pink champagne. One of these is Elbit Systems Ltd. (Nasdaq: ESLT; TASE: ESLT), which, together with its Elisra Group subsidiary, developed the missile's firing management system, called Golden Citron. Another is Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI), which produced the engine. A significant milestone Although the Arrow 3's operational status is an accomplished fact, and constitutes a real milestone on the way to completion of Israel's multi-layer defense system against missiles and rockets, more trials of the weapons system are expected in the future. The Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 array can now provide a complete solution to any threat to Israel posed, and possibly that will be posed in the future, but it needs updates and adjustments from time to time. While Israel is further tightening its defense capabilities, senior missile industry figures, in Iran for example, are burning the midnight oil in an attempt to devise a way of challenging Israel, despite all its missile interceptors. "We're looking many years ahead, and this is definitely a project of predicting the future. Yes, there's a lot of work ahead of us, because we're building our capabilities according to the development of the threats," says a senior Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure source. That source, incidentally, does not completely rule out the idea that someone will one day also celebrate the air force's procurement of missile interceptors called Arrow 4. "At our Administration, there are always ideas and thoughts, and we're constantly examining technologies of various types that will be suitable in another 10 or 15 years," he says, without elaborating. IAI VP and Program Director for Air & Missile Defense Systems Boaz Levy adds, "The Arrow 3 system, a product of a development effort lasting many years, based on a multi-atmosphere solution invented by IAI, is today becoming a reality. This is a milestone for the defense establishment and the defense industry in Israel. The air force is receiving an additional air defense layer for high-altitude interception in outer space. Together with the Arrow 2, it is creating the best anti-ballistic missile defense solution. Many industries participated in the development by taking part in key building blocks in the project. These included IAI subsidiary Elta, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., IMI, and Elisra." On a personal note, Levy added, "Today's delivery of the system to the air force constitutes the closing of a circle and the completion of a dream for me as the person who accompanied and led the development and planning of the system for many years."

"Clarity is the markets' oxygen." Advances in shares of Boeing and those of Caterpillar, up 4.8 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively, led the gains in the Dow. Shares of Boeing rose to a record high after the plane maker offered a better-than-expected outlook on earnings. It forecast operating cash flow to rise to about US$10.75 billion in 2017, up from US$10.5 billion the previous year. "With solid fourth quarter operating performance and a sharp strategic focus, we extended our aerospace market leadership in our centennial year and positioned Boeing for continued growth and success in our second century," Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. Of the 104 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, nearly 70 per cent have surpassed earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Continued below.

Among the companies reporting Thursday were Ford and Dow component Caterpillar. Ford matched earnings estimates while topping sales expectations. Caterpillar beat earnings estimates but fell short of revenue expectations. Alphabet, Intel, Microsoft, Paypal and Starbucks are among companies due to report after the bell. "Companies are still able to beat on the bottom line, but are having a tougher time doing that on the top" line, said Jack Ablin, a chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "That could be a trend in cost cutting." Thirty percent of S&P 500 companies had reported quarterly earnings as of Thursday morning, with 70 percent exceeding analyst expectations on the bottom line and 56 percent beating sales estimates, according to data from The Earnings Scout. "We have reached the heart of the Q4 earnings season. The deluge of releases from the next two weeks will confirm whether the final three months of 2016 marked a disappointment for companies on a relative basis," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. "To be sure, the bar for this period was a bit higher than in previous quarters. The hurdle only gets more difficult for corporate executives to clear over the next year as extremely sanguine bottom line forecasts have hardly budged," Klein said. The Dow gained 32 points, with UnitedHealth Group and Home Depot contributing the most gains, hitting a record high. The S&P 500 broke above 2,300 for the first time before falling 0.07 percent, with health care falling 0.6 percent to lead decliners. The Nasdaq ended 0.02 percent lower, having hit an all-time high earlier in the session. The S&P 500 "confirmed a breakout from its consolidation phase yesterday, supporting short-term upside follow-through and minimizing the likelihood of a significant pullback in the near term," said Katie Stockton, chief technical analyst at BTIG. "We believe the breakout overrules the bearish takeaways we can derive from the low level of the VIX and weak seasonal influences in February, for now at least," Stockton said. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, hit its lowest levels in more than two years on Wednesday. It held around 10.9 on Thursday. The three major U.S. indexes closed at all-time highs on Wednesday, with the Dow breaking above 20,000 for the first time, an important psychological barrier. "If you look at it from a technical perspective, [stocks] finally broke from that six-week range," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "The market is giving the Trump administration more than the benefit of the doubt." Dow since US electionSource: FactSet One of the principal catalysts in sending stocks to record levels were a series of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump, including two that facilitate the construction of the Keystone XL and North Dakota Access pipelines. "Until we get to the Fed meeting in March, I don't see anything that could push us lower," Schwab's Frederick said. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its first meeting of the year Jan. 30 through Feb. 1, though Frederick does not expect the central bank to move monetary policy then. In economic news, initial jobless claims jumped 22,000 to 259,000, but have remained below 300,000 for 99 weeks straight, their longest stretch since 1970. The U.S. IHS Markit services PMI showed the sector expanded at its fastest pace since 2015, hitting 55.1 from 53.9. "Anecdotal evidence suggested that stronger domestic demand and improving business confidence had led to a robust rise in service sector activity at the start of 2017," IHS Markit said. New home sales fell 10.4 percent in December. U.S. Treasury yields fell slightly, with the benchmark 10-year note yield hovering around 2.50 percent, while the short-term two-year note yield traded at 1.22 percent. The dollar regained some ground against a basket of currencies, having broken below 100 earlier this week. It traded 0.5 percent higher in afternoon ET, with the euro around $1.069 percent and the yen near 114.4. Overseas, European and Asian equities rose broadly, following Wednesday's bullish run on Wall Street. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index advanced 0.25 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225 gained 1.81 percent. The iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (EWW) fell more than 2 percent after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said he would not attend a previously scheduled meeting with Trump. The Mexican peso hit a session low following the announcement. Gold futures for February delivery settled $8 lower at $1,191 per ounce. U.S. oil futures for March delivery advanced 1.95 percent to settle at $53.78 per barrel. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

(NYSE: BA) has set new 52-week highs on consecutive days, thanks to a better-than-expected earnings report, several analysts have weighed in on the company’s performance for the coming year. Analysts are split, with some seeing the stock as a Buy and others maintaining a Sell rating, though all seem to agree that a higher price target is called for. In Boeing’s favor is the firm’s boost to its cash flow forecast for 2017. The company forecast 2017 cash flow at $10.75 billion, up $500 million compared with 2016’s total. Boeing has been quite successful in focusing attention on cash flow as a primary metric for measuring its performance and that effort is paying off. The downside case is based on declining orders and a concomitant decline in deliveries. Boeing delivered 748 commercial jets in 2016 and forecasts deliveries of 760 to 765 for 2017, roughly equal to the 762 planes it delivered in 2015. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is also upbeat on the company’s military sales, likely the result of conversations he’s had with President Donald Trump, who appears to be committed to increasing spending on the U.S. Air Force. Trump had complained about the high cost of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (NYSE: LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and suggested that Boeing’s F/A-18 may be a suitable and cheaper replacement. Based on what we’ve seen, the Air Force is likely to push back on that plan. Analysts at Jefferies noted the $200 million charge to the KC-46A tanker program in its note on Boeing’s results: Despite a $0.32 charge for further cost growth on the KC-46, BA delivered good overall operating performance in Q4:2016. EPS was $2.47 vs. our $2.39 estimate. Full year-results were $7.24. Our Core EPS estimate is unchanged at $9.25 for 2017 and $10.00 for 2018. Operating Cash Flow grew to $10.5bb from $9.4bb and is projected to reach $10.75bb in 2017, with an increase likely in 2018. FCF could be in the range of $14 per share in 2017. Jefferies raised its price target from $185 to $200 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. Merrill Lynch likes the company’s cash flow story but maintained its Sell rating and $135 price objective, based on the downturn in commercial jet orders: Boeing is changing the face of commercial aerospace with the 787. We firmly believe that the use of composites as the primary structure on the 787 marks a fundamental shift in the industry. We expect the stock to be pressured in the medium term as Boeing grapples with industry concerns regarding overproduction as well as development and production risks on programs like the 787, 777X, and 737MAX. Other analysts also weighed in on the company: Cowen raised its price target from $180 to $185 with an Outperform rating. Deutsche Bank raised its price target from $180 to $192. Goldman Sachs raised its price target from $121 to $124 with a Sell rating. JPMorgan raised its target price from $172 to $185 with a Neutral rating. Boeing shares recently traded at $169.13, up about 1.1%, after posting a new 52-week high of $170.00 this morning. The 52-week low is $102.10 and the consensus price target is $161.70, not including these recent changes.

American Airlines will not install seat-back TVs in its 100 new Boeing 737 Max planes, according to a company statement released Tuesday. Instead, passengers will be able to stream free movies, TV shows and live TV to their phones, tablets and laptops.  “More than 90 percent of our passengers already bring a device or screen with them when they fly,” read the statement posted to American’s internal website. The airline will invest in faster internet service and focus on streaming “rather than installing seat-back monitors that will be obsolete within a few years.” The decision also helps airlines cut weight and fuel consumption, and Conde Nast Traveler points out that scrapping in-flight entertainment boxes also gives passengers a little more room under the seat.  American’s new, TV-less Boeing 737 Max jets are slated to debut on routes in North America later this year. Analysts at Skift called the change a “sign of the times,” noting that United Airlines has for several years skipped seat-back TVs in favor of streaming and Wi-Fi.  But don’t cry just yet: Your seat-back TV is sticking around, at least on some flights. JetBlue is keeping TVs, Skift notes, as will American’s current-generation Boeing 737s. And Delta’s incoming order of new planes will have seat-back screens as usual, Delta spokesman Anthony Black told HuffPost. “By now, passengers are used to using three or four screens at a time, and that’s not going to change,” Black said. “So our aircraft will continue to have seat-back entertainment.” TVs also seem to be essential on long-haul flights: American’s international flights will continue to feature seat-back screens, the carrier’s statement said. For the movie-loving traveler, that’s a relief.  Also on HuffPost More: American Airlines United Airlines Suggest a correction Comments Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW LIFESTYLE HuffPost Lifestyle is a daily newsletter that will make you happier and healthier — one email at a time.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the plan, first announced in 2015, is an important tool to fill the fleets of China's fast growing airlines with Boeing-made jets. "Every airplane that goes to that finishing center is being built here in the U.S.," Muilenburg said Wednesday. He called it a "targeted investment in China." "We're able to add volume and increase sales in China, because as we increase sales to China we increase building airplanes here in the U.S., and that's U.S. manufacturing jobs," he said. Critics of the plan say it shifts work done today by U.S.-based workers and gives the Chinese industry valuable insight into the minute details of preparing a jetliner. But Muilenburg framed the Chinese production facility as being in line with President Trump's policy aims of increasing manufacturing jobs for Americans. Related: Trump & Boeing: It's not about Air Force One, it's about China Boeing anticipates delivering between 760 and 765 airliners in 2017, roughly matching its 2015 record of 762 planes. That year around one-quarter of Boeing's nearly 500 737s went to Chinese airlines, a pace that is expected to continue as China rapidly builds its airline industry. Boeing leaders are concerned a significant shift in trade policy toward China could have catastrophic effects on the company's plans to sustain and increase production of its lucrative 737 planes. Boeing builds 42 single-aisle 737s jets each month at its factory in Renton, Washington, and has plans to increase to 57 monthly by 2019. Currently, each 737 has its seats and other cabin equipment installed by Boeing workers before delivery. Under Muilenburg's plan, the airplanes that would eventually go to Chinese airlines would be flown to China and outfitted and delivered at the new finishing center. Related: Boeing: 150,000 American aviation jobs depend on China Boeing hasn't announced a date for the facility's opening, but last year said it would be located near Shanghai. Airbus has a facility in Tianjin where it assembles A320 airliners. It also plans a finishing center for bigger long-range twin-aisle A330s. U.S. trade policy towards China has been upended with the arrival of the Trump administration, and Boeing jetliner deliveries are widely viewed as vulnerable if China retaliates. Boeing, in particular, has been buffeted by Trump and his use of Twitter. Trump has warned the company against cost overruns on the replacement 747s for Air Force One.

Trump has tweeted he may do a deal with Boeing for older-generation F/A-18 Super Hornets if the F-35 price tag doesn't fall. Muilenburg and Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson have met with Trump several times to discuss the aircraft purchases, among other issues. "I'm encouraged by his engagement," Muilenburg said. He said Trump's efforts to grow U.S. manufacturing jobs "are all very positive. We've got a voice at the table" on key policy issues ranging from trade posture to defense spending.

Christopher Bouchard | BDN Astronaut Dr. Jessica Meir answers media questions in the Caribou High School library, following a motivational speech given to students on Jan. 26, 2016. By Kathryn Olmstead, Special to the BDN Posted Jan. 26, 2017, at 10:59 a.m. Last modified Jan. 26, 2017, at 6:11 p.m. It is very likely that some time in the next few years a woman from Caribou will be orbiting 249 miles above the earth looking down on “everything I have ever known and done” from the International Space Station. “We never really know when it’s going to happen until it happens,” said Jessica Meir, 39, of the possible date of her first assignment. “Hopefully it will come within the next one to three years.” Valedictorian of Caribou High School’s Class of 1995, Meir is one of eight men and women selected from more than 6,100 applicants in 2013 for NASA’s 21st class of astronauts. Since she was featured in this column in February 2015, she has completed the two-year training program required to advance from “astronaut candidate” to a full-fledged astronaut. Once assigned to a mission destined for the International Space Station (ISS), she may spend another two years training. In the meantime, Meir is preparing at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston for the trip she has dreamed of since childhood. “The cool thing about this job is every day is different,” she said in a phone conversation. When I caught up with her Monday, she had spent the day underwater in a space suit practicing tasks she would perform on the space station. Tuesday was devoted to Russian language study and other classes. Wednesday she flew a T-38 jet in the morning and led a tour of the space center in the afternoon. Thursday and Friday she was talking to astronauts on the International Space Station as a capsule communicator, or Capcom, from the mission control center on the ground in Houston. Meir has served as lead Capcom for several missions, and is excited about her upcoming role as the person communicating with astronauts during a spacewalk. When launch day finally arrives, Meir might fly to the space station on a new vehicle being developed in the U.S. “We currently fly to the space station with the Russians on their Soyuz rocket,” she explained. “In the next few years, with the development of the new Space-X and Boeing vehicles, we will also fly to the space station launching from the U.S. again. So, this means I could potentially fly to the ISS on either a Russian Soyuz, or one of the future Space-X and Boeing vehicles.” She expects to be one of a six-member international team on the station, with other crewmembers typically representing Russia, Canada, Japan and Europe. Currently aboard the station are two astronauts from the U.S., one from France and three Russian cosmonauts. Crewmembers currently rotate in and out on the Soyuz in groups of three. Once aloft for their four-to-six-month mission, crewmembers conduct a host of experiments, many assessing the various physiological effects of weightlessness (microgravity) on the human body. “Every type of science is represented up there,” she said, naming biological experiments, DNA sequencing and studies of combustion, propulsion and fluids as a few examples. As a biologist who has studied the physiology of animals in extreme environments — from emperor penguins in Antarctica to bar-headed geese in British Columbia — Meir muses that soon she will be the subject of such biological experiments. Spacewalk training in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) at the Johnson Space Center gives her a preview. Wearing a 350-pound pressurized space suit, she is lowered into a 40-foot-deep pool to work on a life-sized replica of a part of the space station. Even with six million gallons of water, the 200-foot-by-100-foot pool is not large enough for a scale model of the entire station, (which is the size of a football field), so some parts are laid out separately underwater. “It’s definitely the most challenging thing we do, but it is also the most rewarding,” she said of her monthly sessions at the NBL. “We practice in the pool for things we might later do on the space station.” Unable to walk in the space suit on land, she floats, neutrally buoyant, in the water. Working for six hours at a time, she practices tasks, such as routing cables, testing equipment and making repairs, using tools attached to the front of her space suit. In addition to performing scientific experiments, astronauts need to know plumbing, electronics, mechanics, first-aid and other skills to keep the station operating day to day. “Everything we are doing is helping our journey to eventually get to Mars,” Meir said. Although the U.S. currently has no funded program to send people to Mars, Meir said she personally hopes humans will return to the moon first. To learn what it is like to live in an otherworldly environment with a small team pursuing scientific objectives, Meir spent six days in a network of caves in Sardinia, Italy, last July with fellow astronauts from the U.S., Japan, Russia, China and Spain. The team made daily excursions into extraordinary spaces, belaying each other over rock faces, navigating channels of water, photographing, mapping the caves, collecting specimens, conducting experiments and setting up tents for the night. “Real exploration” she called the experience, part of the European Space Agency’s CAVES mission. “Fascinating. Jaw-dropping. We were like characters in a science fiction illustration — something like Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth. I was in my element. I didn’t want to come out.” When Meir was in elementary school in Caribou, her class was instructed to draw what they wanted to be when they grew up. She drew a person in a spacesuit on the moon holding a flag. As her dream gradually becomes reality, she remembers the images of earth taken from the moon during the Apollo space mission, looking forward to the day when she can see for herself “that fragile blue ball below,” preferably on a space walk “out there alone in a spacesuit.” Kathryn Olmstead is a former University of Maine associate dean and associate professor of journalism living in Aroostook County, where she publishes the quarterly magazine Echoes.
