(Credit: CNN) Russia’s first large airliner since the fall of the Soviet Union made its maiden flight Sunday. The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The prototype took flight Sunday morning from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant airfield in Siberia, about 2,600 miles east of Moscow. During the 30-minute flight, the plane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters (roughly 3,300 feet). Oleg Kononenko, the flight’s lead test pilot, reported that the aircraft operated normally. The MC-21’s maiden flight was notably shorter than that of its Chinese competitor and other similar aircraft, which have typically flown for an hour or longer and at a higher altitude. The flight comes ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts June 18. Irkut hasn’t yet said whether the jet will be ready in time to make its international debut at the event. The Russian aircraft’s debut is the latest in a series of aviation firsts in 2017. The unusually busy year has featured a parade of maiden flights by new models from airplane makers around the world. China’s new challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the Comac C919, made its first flight on May 5. But while Russia is pushing the MC-21 with airlines around the world as a way to increase its non-military aerospace exports, Comac has shown less interest in selling the C919 overseas. Russia’s commercial aerospace industry has struggled over the past quarter century to regain the strength it had during the Soviet era. Through projects backed by President Vladimir Putin, it has sought to shed its reputation for advanced, but unreliable, passenger aircraft. The country last week formalized a partnership with China to made a long-range twin-aisle airliner to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The MC-21 is expected to start flying passengers in 2019 after it completes testing. Russian airline Aeroflot will be the first to fly the new jetliner. The state-run carrier has relied heavily on Airbus and Boeing jets as part of its modernization, but Russian policy has encouraged the introduction of homegrown models, like the MC-21. Irkut says the MC-21, which seats 163 passengers in two classes, will be 12% to 15% less expensive to operate than its Western counterparts. The manufacturer has taken 175 orders for the jet, which has a range of about 3,500 nautical miles or 6,400 kilometers. Irkut is an arm of the Russian state-owned aerospace conglomerate United Aircraft Corporation, which supplies the country’s airborne military hardware. Like the Chinese C919, the MC-21 has used many Western aerospace suppliers. The jet took the sky on Sunday powered by two U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which are also used by Airbus, Canada’s Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer. Russia is developing a new engine of its own for the MC-21. While the Russian aerospace industry has lagged U.S. and European companies, Airbus and Boeing are closely watching the new jet’s progress. The MC-21 is packed with advanced carbon fiber technology and flight controls that haven’t yet made their way to Boeing and Airbus aircraft. 61.524010 105.318756 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Irkut MC-21, russia, soviet union Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Instagram Popular Texas Man, 31, Dies After Contracting Infection While Swimming With New Tattoo Kathy Griffin Says She Is Being Bullied by First Family, Was Contacted by Secret Service Over Gory Trump Pictorial California Lawmakers Move One Step Closer Toward Ending Daylight Saving Time Baby Dies After Pregnant Woman Immediately Gives Birth Following Head-on Crash Near Valley Glen; Suspected DUI Driver Arrested Latest News L.A.

(TSX:BBD.B). Aerospace, rail equipment. Up eight cents, or 3.56 per cent, at $2.33 on 6.7 million shares. Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to produce a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the trade dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. Sandvine Corp. (TSX:SVC). Telecommunications. Up 71 cents, or 22.54 per cent, to $3.86 on 5.8 million shares. The Waterloo-based company announced Friday it was being acquired by Vector Capital for $483 million. Encana Corp.

Companies reporting major news: The Boyd Group income fund (TSX:BYD.UN). Up $8.79, or 9.79 per cent, to $98.56 on 89,513 shares. The Winnipeg-based income fund will more than double its presence in Canada by acquiring 68 collision repair centres in Ontario operated by Assured Automotive Inc. for $193.6 million. Boyd says its North American network of collision repair shops will grow to 474 locations when the deal closes, including 110 in Canada. Assured Automotive CEO Desmond D'Silva and president Tony Canade will join the Boyd management team and continue to lead the Assured operation under its own brand name. Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR). Transportation. Down 32 cents, or 0.31 per cent, to $103.38 on 301,139 shares. The union representing approximately 3,000 employees at Canadian National Railway says it has reached a verbal agreement with the company, hours before the workers were in a legal strike position. Husky Energy (TSX:HSE). Oil and gas. Up 31 cents, or 1.92 per cent, to $16.46 on 389,804 shares. Newfoundland and Labrador government was exultant Monday as Husky Energy announced it will finally proceed with the multimillion-dollar West White Rose project, with first oil five years away. The company said it will use a fixed wellhead platform tied to the SeaRose floating production, storage and offloading vessel, known as an FPSO. First oil is expected in 2022 and could reach a gross peak production rate of approximately 75,000 barrels per day by 2025.

Boeing says a trade fight it has launched against Bombardier is meant to prevent the construction of a larger aircraft that would compete against its 737 aircraft. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) Related Stories In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent Ottawa reconsiders Boeing purchases amid accusations against Bombardier Boeing seeks duties at hearing against Bombardier CSeries Cross-border aircraft rivals Bombardier, Boeing clash in trade hearing Bombardier faces lengthy legal battle with Boeing that could hurt CSeries sales Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent Ottawa reconsiders Boeing purchases amid accusations against Bombardier "The U.S. industry has been the victim of this exact strategy before, as subsidies to Airbus enabled it to push McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed from the market, and capture 50 per cent global market share, destroying countless high-paying, skilled U.S. jobs in the process," Boeing said. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company said its CSeries commercial jet isn't an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won't be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn't sell a comparable product and Boeing's 737 production is sold out for about eight years with a backlog valued at about $190 billion US, Bombardier said. "Using this case as an Airbus 'do-over' is a misuse of the statutory threat provision," Bombardier said. Boeing seeks duties at hearing against Bombardier CSeries Cross-border aircraft rivals Bombardier, Boeing clash in trade hearing Bombardier also rejected Boeing's claim that it is suffering present material injury as a result of Delta Air Lines' CSeries order. "If Boeing were correct that Delta established momentum for Bombardier, and caused harm to Boeing, one would expect to see additional CSeries orders in the U.S. market, but not one has occurred in the 13 months since the Delta purchase of CS100s," Bombardier said. Boeing's 737 fleet is expected to generate $26 billion US in free cash flow over the next four years, but the Chicago-based firm said it would be wrong to assume that it is not vulnerable to the threat subsidies pose, as the history with Airbus shows. The dispute has become politically charged, with Ottawa recently announcing that it was reviewing current military procurement projects with Boeing — a thinly veiled threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the company. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost.

McIntyre May 29, 2017 7:51 am EDT Print Email Tweet Russia has built its own commercial airplane. This is a potential long-term threat to Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) and Airbus which between them own the commercial aircraft business worldwide. Russia’s Irkut Corporation reported it had cleared a major milestone with a test flight during which its MC-21-300 “flew 30 minutes at the altitude of 1000 meters, at the speed of 300 km/hour.” While this does not compare to the flight duration and altitude levels which are routine to Airbus and Boeing planes, it is a reasonable start on the path which would allow Irkut to sell planes within several years. The company said it has reached several milestones in the recent test: The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant. According to the program, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft. The MC-21-300 will eventually carry 163 to 211 passengers, which Irkut describes as the largest segment of the airline market. It also said the MC-21-300 will compete well with existing planes because of polymer composite materials. This lightens the aircraft, which Irkut says will reduce operating costs by between 12% and 15% in contrast to its direct competitors. And, its most director competitor is one of the most successful plane in the world, the Boeing 737 MAX 8, which is sometimes called the 737-8. The first 737 went into service in 1968. Boeing has made almost 9,500 planes across the entire model line which has been updates several times. The new 737 MAX 8 began production 2014, had its firsts flight in January 2016, and its first delivery, to Malindo Air, this month. Boeing says it has over 700 orders for the new plane. While there is a chance the MC-21-300 will sell it Russia, it has a very long and hard climb to replace one of the most popular commercial aircraft in the world, made by one of the world’s largest and most well-funded companies, which has a history of delivering tens of thousands of planes.

So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet.Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon.Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help.Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel, Solvay of Belgium and Toray of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing.At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale."It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fibre already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves. Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminium.Under the new technology, instead of using fibre that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fibre engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum.The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear.Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing.The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs."This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind.Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark.Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites.Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes."Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

The complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based company from using subsidies to produce a larger version of the CSeries plane, pictured, that would compete with Boeing’s 737 aircraft.   (CLEMENT SABOURIN / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Ross MarowitsThe Canadian Press Mon., May 29, 2017 MONTREAL—Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Read more: Bombardier and Boeing clash in trade dispute over CSeries Article Continued Below Bombardier accused of dumping CSeries jets at ‘absurdly low’ prices in trade spat “The U.S. industry has been the victim of this exact strategy before, as subsidies to Airbus enabled it to push McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed from the market, and capture 50 per cent global market share, destroying countless high-paying, skilled U.S. jobs in the process,” Boeing said. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing’s effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is “misguided,” adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company said its CSeries commercial jet isn’t an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won’t be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn’t sell a comparable product and Boeing’s 737 production is sold out for about eight years with a backlog valued at about $190 billion (U.S.), Bombardier said. “Using this case as an Airbus ‘do-over’ is a misuse of the statutory threat provision,” Bombardier said. Bombardier also rejected Boeing’s claim that it is suffering present material injury as a result of Delta Air Lines’ CSeries order. “If Boeing were correct that Delta established momentum for Bombardier, and caused harm to Boeing, one would expect to see additional CSeries orders in the U.S. market, but not one has occurred in the 13 months since the Delta purchase of CS100s,” Bombardier said. Boeing’s 737 fleet is expected to generate $26 billion in free cash flow over the next four years, but the Chicago-based firm said it would be wrong to assume that it is not vulnerable to the threat subsidies pose, as the history with Airbus shows. The dispute has become politically charged, with Ottawa recently announcing that it was reviewing current military procurement projects with Boeing — a thinly veiled threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the company. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. A preliminary determination on the petition is expected by June 12.

Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the trade dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing says Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. A Bombardier CS300 airplane on display ahead of the opening of the 51st Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, June 13, 2015. Bombardier says in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided,'' adding that Boeing's complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company says its CSeries commercial jet isn't an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won't be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn't sell a comparable product and Boeing's production is sold out for about eight years. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. A preliminary determination on the petition is expected by June 12.

(AFP) Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his "beloved" Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the "Saturday Night Fever" heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia's national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. "It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS)," Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. "The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again," Travolta said. "I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia." HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia's east coast. "We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it," De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. "When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we've been in detailed discussions and negotiations since." Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

The American giants are in the cross-hairs of an Israeli lawyer with a track record of humbling huge corporations and winning multi-million-dollar settlements for her clients. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner has spent the past decade filing lawsuits for the victims of terror attacks against the governments, banks and corporations that enabled or financed the violence. As a result of her efforts, more than $200 million has been collected for terror victims and their families (including out of court settlements), and some $600 million in assets has been frozen. Darshan-Leitner has also used the courts to fight against what she considers to be unfair lawsuits against Israeli military commanders. In one notable case, she stopped a Spanish lawsuit against Israel’s Chief of Staff Dan Halutz over a bombing raid in Gaza by filing a similar suit against Javier Solana, a top Spanish politician who had overseen NATO’s bombing of Kosovo. Spain changed the law. The Bar-Ilan University-educated mother of six will speak about her work in a live interview in Jerusalem on Sunday, June 4 in our next Times of Israel Presents event, produced in association with Nefesh B’Nefesh. (Book tickets HERE). Last year, she won an unprecedented $655 million verdict against the Palestinian Authority and PLO on behalf of 11 American families whose loved ones had been killed or injured in attacks in Israel. That decision was overturned by the US Court of Appeal, but Darshan-Leitner says she is not deterred. Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, with the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center and representing those affected by attacks in Israel in the early 2000s, walks from a federal courthouse in New York on February 23, 2015. (photo credit: AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Darshan-Leitner and Shurat Hadin, the non-profit law center she heads, are self-funding and do not receive backing from any government, including that of Israel. Sometimes she can be more effective even than the Israeli army: In 2011, she prevented a Gaza-bound activists’ flotilla from leaving Greece after challenging the seaworthiness of the vessels in a local court. Now she has discovered that Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah is using Western Union to channel funds, and Iran is planning to use Boeing aircraft to deliver missiles to Syria. She plans to sue them both. “Hezbollah is launching a fundraising campaign and using Western Union to accept the donations, so one of the moves that we are planning is to go after Western Union,” says Darshan-Leitner. “In addition, we learned that Boeing not only signed a horrible deal with Iran providing them with 80 aircraft with a special waiver for the sanctions, Iran actually is using these aircraft to deliver missiles into Syria and let Hezbollah drive them to South Lebanon to shoot them over Israel. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner: ‘Hezbollah is launching a fundraising campaign and using Western Union to accept the donations.’ (courtesy) “We are suing Boeing now to stop the deal, and we are launching a campaign to put pressure on the administration not to let Boeing continue,” she says. Darshan-Leitner is also suing Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants for their alleged role in “facilitating” terror activity. “Facebook, Twitter and Google provide material support in the form of social media network services to Hamas, to ISIS. This is unacceptable. It’s also a violation of American law. So we’ve filed lawsuits against them as well,” she says. Are the courts the right battleground to fight terrorism? Does her work encourage Israel’s enemies to resort to their own “lawfare” against Israeli targets? We’ll be asking those questions and more when we interview Darshan-Leitner on June 4. Join us for what promises to be a fascinating conversation and the chance to meet one of Israel’s most dynamic lawyers.

    * Unannounced, Russia stages test flight of new passenger
plane
    * MS-21 seen competing against Airbus, Boeing best-sellers
    * Officials hope cheaper running costs will win sales

    By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack StubbsMOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - Russia carried out the maiden
flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday,
its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline
commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its
Western competitors.
    In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation
<IRKT.MM> and its state-controlled parent company United
Aircraft Corporation (UAC) <UNAC.MM> said an MS-21-300 model had
successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000
metres and travelling at 300 km an hour.
    Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine
crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial
production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms.
    The test flight, which was not announced to media
beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden
flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing
competition to industry heavyweights Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus
<AIR.PA>.
    Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its
Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped
up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts
say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the
transatlantic airplane duopoly. [nL8N19052L]
    "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine,
there were no observations which will prevent further testing,"
test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying.
    Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the
flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with
recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models.
    "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have
had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western
flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight".
    A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test
everything that needed checking in the air.
    Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation
for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews.
    Flag carrier Aeroflot <AFLT.MM> last year earned its fourth
star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it
alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and
ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.

    FIRM ORDERS
    President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg
Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the
Kremlin called "a significant event".
    The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the
MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200
which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as
the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters.
    Production is expected to start in the next two years and
state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and
foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far
had "firm orders" for 175 planes.
    America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of
their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and
more advanced technical know-how.
    But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern
European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers
attracted by its lower running costs.
    Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to
15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.
    With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be
competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which
currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both
companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable
15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions.
    State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close
Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85
aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec
said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body
Airbus models, including 70 A320s.
    UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand
for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next
20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new
aircraft," he said.

Jamie Burgess, Vice-President and Program Manager for Boeing Military Aircraft Mobility Surveillance and Engagement division "The size of the 737 is about right for a [command and control] C2 mission crew that would be spending upwards of 12 hours on an aircraft. It also offers tremendous growth potential in terms of power, size, weight, cooling, and aircraft performance." said Jamie Burgess, Vice-President and Program Manager for Boeing Military Aircraft Mobility Surveillance and Engagement division, told IHS Janes. "We think the 737-700 is the right solution for the air force's [C2 and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] C2ISR recapitalization." The current fleet of 16 Air Force Northrop Grumman E-8C JSTARS dates back to the early 1990's. The E-8C is based off the 707 airframe, which suffers from high operating costs at as much as $200,000 an hour. There is also a lack of spare parts and airframes available. Multiple companies are bidding for the program. The JSTARS features a radar system that can cover a theater-sized battlefield region. It is meant to provide ground and area commanders with long-range ground surveillance.

The US government awarded Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, $1.48 billion for the development of a "Redesigned Kill Vehicle", the Pentagon said in a statement last week. The extra money brings the total publicly known value of the US government contract with Boeing to a whopping $7.78 billion. The White House wants to upgrade the system before Kim Jong-un develops the capabilities to strike the continental US. So what is a kill vehicle? Simply put, kill vehicles intercept and destroy long-range ballistic missiles. Launched atop missiles of their own, they use sensors, lenses and rocket thrusters to pick out ballistic warheads and steer into their path. When it comes to shooting down ballistic missiles "there is a fundamental difference in the technology - whether you want it to do that inside the atmosphere or in space," says Dr Stephan Fruehling from the ANU's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre. In the case of medium and long range missiles coming from North Korea, an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) which intercepts the missile in space would be the technology of choice. If a threat is detected by a system of sensors based on land or on warships at sea, then a Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) will be launched into space using a rocket booster. Once outside the Earth's atmosphere, operating at the edge of space at hypersonic speeds, the kill vehicle is deployed. It seeks out the target using sensors, a sophisticated on-board computer and a rocket motor used for steering in space. It hones in on the missile and destroys it using nothing more than the force of a massive collision. Continued below.

MULTIPLE FAILURES Leader Kim Jong Un at what was said to be a missile test site. Photo / AP The technology has been around for more than two decades but it hasn't always worked as intended. In fact it's been hugely problematic. In 2010 a meticulously controlled test of its missile defence technology at a site in Alaska ended in embarrassment for the US military. Despite knowing the exact speed and coordinates of the target, the intercepting kill vehicle completely missed the fake warhead. Eleven months later, when the US Missile Defense Agency staged a repeat of the test, it again failed. During a test in July 2013 success once again proved elusive, raising serious questions over missile defence system the Pentagon had poured more than $US40 billion ($A53 billion) dollars into. A test conducted last year was announced as a success but it was later revealed that one of the thrusters malfunctioned, causing the interceptor to fly offcourse. Dr Stephan Fruehling is a Chief Investigator on the Australian Research Council's project on nuclear deterrence and was a member of the Australian Government's external panel of experts on the 2016 Defence White Paper. He says the latest contract awarded to Boeing by the US military is about reinventing a kill vehicle that isn't wedded to ageing technology. The United States deployed an operational GBI system in California and Alaska which was rushed into the field after September 11 under the George W. Bush administration. Essentially the system is situated to intercept missiles from rogue states like North Korean or Iran during their trajectory to the continental United States. But much of the system was based on technology from the previous decade, which has been plagued with issued since testing began in 1999. "It has a lot of limitations," Dr Fruehling told news.com.au. "And essentially what the US is stuck with is evolutions of a kill vehicle that remains based on this technology from the 1990s ... and that's caused a lot of problems that they've had with that system." WHY ARE THEY INVESTING IN NEW TECHNOLOGY NOW? May 22, 2017: Photo distributed by the North Korean government shows a missile lifting off during its launch test at an undisclosed location in North Korea. Photo / AP With North Korea continuing to test nuclear warheads at a feverish pace, the Pentagon is racing to improve its kill vehicle technology. "What this is about now is taking a step back and developing a interceptor that addresses those issues," Dr Fruehling said. CALLS FOR AUSTRALIA TO DEVELOP MISSILE SHIELD A woman watches a TV screen showing a file footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at Seoul Train Station in Seoul, South Korea. Photo / AP Advances in missile technology made by North Korea - as well as China - in the past few years have taken some western analysts by surprise. And the situation has led to growing calls for Australia to develop its own missile shield. Defence specialist Andrew Shearer who previously worked as a national security adviser to Prime Ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott is among those who believe Australia needs to invest in this area. He wants the government to examine systems "to defend the continent against the new and growing threat posed by long-range ballistic missiles that could be used to strike or intimidate future Australian governments". "The cumulative effective of these capabilities is to increase the missile threat to ADF forces deployed forward in the (Asia) region, whether independently or as part of an allied coalition," he told Fairfax Media last month. He also warned that over time such weapons could be used to "reduce Australia's strategic depth and put Australian and allied forces operating from rear bases on the mainland at greater risk. "The latter is a new threat but one that will become very real over the next decade," he said. According to Dr Fruehling "there has been an ongoing debate about whether Australia should actually acquire interceptors. But so far that's not been done." Largely because it's not really a threat Australia could thwart on its own with current technology. "If you look at the threat to Australia from intercontinental ballistic missile, there's little that Australia could do to address that on its own," he said. "If you look at North Korean missiles, for example, you'd have to have a ship with SM3 (a ship-based missile interception system) off the North Korean coast. Or you would have to base ground based interceptors in northern Australia but you would be looking at sensor infrastructure and an investment cost that runs into the dozens of billions, so it's not really feasible." But that certainly doesn't mean Australia isn't engaged in aspects of missile defence systems on the research and development side of things. "There's been some technology co-operation, even going back to the 1990s" with our US ally but these experiments have been "largely in the sensor space in terms of looking at the overall horizon radar and how that could be to detect missiles," Dr Fruehling said. "There is some scope for integrating some Australian sensors into missile defence systems," he said. - news.com.au By Nick Whigham Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Thrilling Lions match lights up city Fans on both sides of the match were unified in their enjoyment of the match.

The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing (BA) 737 and Airbus (EADSF) A320. By Jon Ostrower SEATTLE (CNNMoney) -- Russia's first large airliner since the fall of the Soviet Union made its maiden flight Sunday. The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The prototype took flight Sunday morning from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant airfield in Siberia, about 2,600 miles west of Moscow. During the 30-minute flight, the plane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters (roughly 3,300 feet). Oleg Kononenko, the flight's lead test pilot, reported that the aircraft operated normally. The MC-21's maiden flight was notably shorter than that of its Chinese competitor and other similar aircraft, which have typically flown for an hour or longer and at a higher altitude. The flight comes ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts June 18. Irkut hasn't yet said whether the jet will be ready in time to make its international debut at the event. The Russian aircraft's debut is the latest in a series of aviation firsts in 2017. The unusually busy year has featured a parade of maiden flights by new models from airplane makers around the world. China's new challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the Comac C919, made its first flight on May 5. But while Russia is pushing the MC-21 with airlines around the world as a way to increase its non-military aerospace exports, Comac has shown less interest in selling the C919 overseas. Russia's commercial aerospace industry has struggled over the past quarter century to regain the strength it had during the Soviet era. Through projects backed by President Vladimir Putin, it has sought to shed its reputation for advanced, but unreliable, passenger aircraft. The country last week formalized a partnership with China to made a long-range twin-aisle airliner to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The MC-21 is expected to start flying passengers in 2019 after it completes testing. Russian airline Aeroflot will be the first to fly the new jetliner. The state-run carrier has relied heavily on Airbus and Boeing jets as part of its modernization, but Russian policy has encouraged the introduction of homegrown models, like the MC-21. Irkut says the MC-21, which seats 163 passengers in two classes, will be 12% to 15% less expensive to operate than its Western counterparts. The manufacturer has taken 175 orders for the jet, which has a range of about 3,500 nautical miles or 6,400 kilometers. Irkut is an arm of the Russian state-owned aerospace conglomerate United Aircraft Corporation, which supplies the country's airborne military hardware. Like the Chinese C919, the MC-21 has used many Western aerospace suppliers. The jet took the sky on Sunday powered by two U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which are also used by Airbus, Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer. Russia is developing a new engine of its own for the MC-21. While the Russian aerospace industry has lagged U.S. and European companies, Airbus and Boeing are closely watching the new jet's progress. The MC-21 is packed with advanced carbon fiber technology and flight controls that haven't yet made their way to Boeing and Airbus aircraft.

Canales lashes out over killed bill By PAUL COBLER | Special To The Herald Brownsville Herald AUSTIN — McAllen’s payment to Enrique Iglesias for a 2015 holiday performance may never become public information, and state Rep. Terry Canales is not happy about it. On Wednesday night, Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, removed House Bill 349, Canales’ bill, from the Texas Senate’s Local and Consent Calendar. This effectively killed the bill by preventing it from being read on the Senate floor before the end of the legislative session next Monday. “He did it because it’s a chink in the armor and takes a piece of the Boeing ruling away,” Canales said. “They don’t want the sweater to unravel, and he wants to keep the public in the dark.” The bill reversed a very narrow portion of the Texas Supreme Court’s Boeing Ruling, which was cited when the City of McAllen refused to disclose the price tag for the Iglesias concert. If the bill had passed, it would have wiped out the contract between McAllen and Iglesias, forcing the city to disclose the payment. In a personal privilege speech on the House floor, Canales, D-Edinburg, ripped into Schwertner for his decision to kill HB 349, calling him a “villain” who “dwells in the shadows of corporate greed.” Prior to the speech, Canales approached Schwertner on the Senate floor, poked him in the shoulder and said next session he would block every piece of legislation Schwertner authored that was sent to the House. Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, who was carrying HB 349 in the Senate, said Schwertner told him he removed the bill from the calendar as retribution for Canales calling a point of order on one of his bills, Senate Bill 11. A point of order is a request to the House Parliamentarian to review that the bill is not breaking any House rules, but commonly can be used as a legislative delay tactic. “ Sometimes, at this point in the session, people get overly emotional and retaliate,” Hinojosa said. “I was not notified he was going to pull the bill from the calendar, which is usually the protocol here. I was disappointed Sen. Schwertner didn’t notify me, because I could have talked to him and probably persuaded him not to do that.” Canales said he believes Schwertner killed the bill because of its intention to expand government transparency in Texas. “(Schwertner) says the bill was killed because of a point of order, but no point of order was ever sustained on one of his bills,” Canales said. “The reason for him to kill the bill was protecting corporate industry.” Schwertner did not respond to a request for comment. The death of HB 349 leaves no legislation supporting open government in Texas left standing, according to Kelley Shannon, the executive director of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. “Legislators should definitely not be playing games with open government,” Shannon said. “It’s a basic right of the people of Texas to know how their government operates and to know how their government uses their taxpayer dollars. When they play games with open-government, they are playing games with the voters of Texas.” In his personal privilege speech, Canales called on legislators to do better when it comes to open-government legislation. “If you don’t have the spine to stand for transparency, you don’t have the right to stand for Texas,” Canales said in his speech. “To my understanding, Sen. Schwertner is an orthopedic surgeon, which I find ironic because he doesn’t have a spine.”  Discuss Print Posted in Valley on Sunday, May 28, 2017 10:38 pm.

Based in Adelaide, the office will create around 250 new highly skilled technical and advanced research positions as it undertakes programs spanning C3I, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and advanced experimentation and prototyping. ‘These skilled roles will offer significant sustainable employment opportunities to young South Australian graduates, with the added benefit of creating jobs with defence contractors and significant numbers of indirect jobs,’ says Jay Weatheril, Premier of South Australia, in a Boeing media release. Boeing Defence Australia employs more than 2,000 employees at 14 locations throughout Australia and three international sites. In South Australia, its support programs include the E-7A Wedgetail, P-8A Poseidon and Collins Class submarine. ‘Boeing Defence Australia is committed to building local capability in South Australia,’ says Darren Edwards, Boeing Defence Australia vice president and managing director. ‘One way we are doing this is by investing A$500,000 over five years in the Techstars Adelaide global accelerator program to support South Australia’s entrepreneurial startups. ‘We also know that partnerships with higher education institutions are critical for preparing today’s students with tomorrow’s skills for defence industry capability and advancing innovation. To that end, this year we have invested A$7,000 with the 2017 Defence Honours Scholarship Program and look forward to expanding our education partnerships with South Australian universities.’ Boeing’s presence in Australia is its largest outside the US. The company has been in Australia for more than 90 years and has invested more than A$1 billion in its Australian operations over that time. It employs more than 3,000 people in 27 locations across Australia.

DARPA  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By JUSTIN BACHMAN | Bloomberg | Published: May 28, 2017 In the future, military dominance will depend partly on how fast you can fly and how quickly you can get into space. That's one of the guiding principles behind an advanced Pentagon project to build a spacecraft able to launch smaller payloads into low-earth orbit on short notice, and at lower cost. Boeing Co.'s XS-1 (Experimental Spaceplane), which the company dubs "Phantom Express," got a green light this week by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. The XS-1 is designed to quickly lift satellites as heavy as 3,000 pounds into orbit for $5 million or less, launching from the ground, deploying a small upper-stage module, and then landing like a traditional airplane-the key to reuse and lower operating expense. Darpa also has a separate program aimed at launching 100-pound satellites for less than $1 million per launch, using conventional aircraft. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," Jess Spoonable, a Darpa program manager, said in a May 24 statement. The Phantom Express will be powered with an Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. AR-22 engine, a newer version of the main engine trio that served on NASA's Space Shuttle. Boeing will design and build the aircraft through 2019, including 10 engine ground firings over 10 days, followed by 12-15 flight tests in 2020. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the project's cost. Beyond the military's desire for a spaceplane, such a craft would likely carry immense appeal for commercial companies, many of which are planning to launch constellations of small satellites. These companies don't need the weight capability, or large expense, associated with traditional payload launches sold by United Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp. joint venture, Arianespace, or Elon Musk's SpaceX. The XS-1 is also envisioned as a means to further engineering work on advanced airframe designs capable of hypersonic flight, generally five to 10 times above Mach 1, the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 767 miles-per-hour). Historically, these designs have been challenged due to the intense friction and heat generated by higher Mach speeds. Beyond a quick pop into space, a craft with hypersonic speed offers the Pentagon a new capability-an aircraft deployable anywhere in the world in less than three hours. "When most people think about hypersonic aircraft, many believe they would have to be large, expensive, and exotic," Lockheed Martin says. "It's time we change that perception." One way the defense contractor is trying to do that is with the next generation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the Cold War-era speed demon able to fly at Mach 3, which provided critical reconnaissance for the Air Force until the late 1990s, when it was retired. The SR-71 still holds numerous speed and altitude records. The new Lockheed Skunk Works project, called the SR-72, is a proposal envisioning an unmanned aircraft that cruises at Mach 6 - roughly twice as fast as the 2,300-mile-per-hour SR-71 - meaning "an adversary would have no time to react or hide," Lockheed Martin says in its promotional materials. A Skunk Works spokeswoman declined to comment on hypersonic projects. The SR-72 could be operational by 2030, for less than $1 billion, according to the company, which has been touting the aircraft for several years. Boeing has previously experimented with hypersonic flight with its X-51 WaveRider, a small scramjet platform, dropped from a B-52 bomber, which flew its last test mission in 2013 over the Pacific. The X-51 topped Mach 5, or about 4,000 mph. In the 1960s, NASA experimented with the manned X-15, a high-altitude, hypersonic flight program to inform future space missions. In 1967, the X-15 achieved a record Mach 6.7 (4,520 mph) at more than 102,000 feet. DARPA has selected The Boeing Company to complete advanced design work for the Agency’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program.

Known as the XS-1, the goal of the spaceplane is to get costs down to $5 million per launch, as well as flying at least 10 times per year. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager in a press release. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF OUTER SPACE?   Sponable added that DARPA is "very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight.” Below is a concept video of the plane: Boeing, which beat out Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems to build the XS-1, should be able to get the craft up to speeds of Mach 10 and "deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit." The second portion of the design process runs through 2019, when the design will be finalized and a propulsion system will be tested for flights. The third phase includes 12 to 15 test flights, scheduled for 2020, as well as having 10 flights on 10 consecutive days. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Advertisement Trending in Tech In an unexplored abyss, faceless fish swim Parents denied access to dead teen's Facebook account Two gigantic black holes spotted merging into one terrifying monster 5 ways to test your computer's security How to do a free online background check Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

(File Photo) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has approved the registration of three formal cases pertaining to the affairs of the civil aviation ministry under the previous Congress-led government. The First Information Reports (FIRs) relate to the purchase of 50 Boeing aircraft for the erstwhile Air India, the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, and handing over of lucrative international airline routes to private airlines, a source in the CBI told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former finance minister P Chidamabram’s son Karti. The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process, which experts believe led to the national air carrier bleeding financially. In January 2017, the Supreme Court had also asked the CBI to complete the probe on the same matter by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the Boeing purchase. “The Supreme Court had asked the Attorney General to look into the allegations in a time-bound manner. We examined the evidence and decided to register three separate cases. We will finish the investigation soon,” said a senior CBI official privy to the development. According to the CBI official who spoke to HT, the CBI director sanctioned the registration of a case on Saturday after it remained under the scanner since 2014. The other two cases—the merger and surrendering of routes—are part of a larger probe into the mismanagement of the national air carrier whose losses increased from Rs 63 crore to over Rs 7,000 crore in the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014 coinciding with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance rule. The FIR only mentions “unnamed official of civil aviation ministry”. The auditor, which covered the 2002-2010 period in its review, had said in its 121-page report that Air India was forced to buy aircraft from Boeing in a hurry. It also detailed events that led to the company’s ambitious $11-billion purchase on a paltry equity base of $34 million. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Former civil aviation minister Praful Patel told HT: “I am not aware of this. But if it is indeed true, I am happy. They should investigate and the truth must come out.” The first two decisions—purchase of aircraft and the merger—were decided by an empowered group of ministers headed by P Chidambaram, the then finance minister, and Pranab Mukherjee, the then external affairs minister. Patel was part of the group as civil aviation minister. The CAG report, however, pinned the responsibility on Patel’s ministry, “The erstwhile Air India was advised to revisit its proposal by “the aviation ministry” into expanding its requirement of aircraft. Whilst their earlier proposal for 28 aircraft had taken two years to prepare and submit, the revised long-term fleet for 50 aircraft plan was completed in four months,” the auditor had said. more from india Beneath an increasing green cover, a story of depleting forests Jun 05, 2017 07:18 IST J-K: Four militants killed by security forces as they attack CRPF camp in Bandipora Jun 05, 2017 07:38 IST Nurturing Recruitment-Ready Students Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Notice to Boeing Photo: TASS Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of Boeing and Airbus. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. “I’m sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he said.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus . Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said.

Besides, Air India-Indian Airlines merger is also under CBI lens CBI registers enquiry to probe Air India-Indian Airlines merger The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday instituted The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday instituted a preliminary enquiry to probe into issues related to the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines.. 2017-05-29T22:49+00:00 Related Videos CBI registers enquiry to probe... NEW DELHI: The CBI has registered three FIRs against unknown officials of the civil aviation ministry and private persons for alleged irregularities in UPA government's purchase of 111 aircraft for Air India and Indian Airlines at a cost of Rs 70,000 crore, leasing of a large number of aircraft by AI without due consideration, and surrendering of the debt-ridden carrier's profit-making routes and schedules to benefit private players. In addition, the agency has launched a preliminary enquiry (PE) into the 2007 merger of the two public carriers, IA and AI, to ascertain whether the matter needs to be probed further by registering an FIR. The merger followed the decision to place huge orders with Boeing and Airbus, a decision which the agency alleged cost the exchequer "tens of thousands of crores". CBI had been directed by Supreme Court to probe the decisions based on a PIL filed by activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan. It said that in its three FIRs and one PE, it has booked unknown officials of the civil aviation ministry, Air India and unknown private persons for criminal conspiracy, cheating and under the prevention of corruption Act. About the purchase of 111 planes, CBI officials said the original proposal was to buy a total of 28 planes for Air India and Indian Airlines. But the government finally decided to buy 68 for Air India from Boeing, and another 43 for Indian Airlines from Airbus. The twin decisions triggered a controversy, with the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) terming the decision to purchase planes through debt a "recipe for disaster", noting that the decision was taken when the airlines were "in a crisis". The federal auditor also criticised the decision to lease planes, saying they were leased from private operators even while the process to acquire new planes was underway. The CAG criticised the merger as ill-timed and said that the financial case for merger was not "adequately validated". CBI said the FIRs were based on the preliminary inquiries it conducted in the light of the SC's directive and the findings of the CAG and Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, which was also critical of the decisions. "The acquisition was done to benefit private companies," CBI alleged in its FIR into the acquisition of planes. "The entire acquisition (for both Air India and Indian Airlines) was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for Indian Airlines. This was a recipe for disaster and should have raised alarm signals in ministry of civil aviation, Public Investment Board and the Planning Commission", the CAG report had stated. It further said: "This increase in numbers does not withstand audit scrutiny, considering the market requirements obtaining then or forecast for the future, as also the commercial viability projected to justify the acquisition. The acquisition appears to be supply-driven." CBI's second FIR has been registered to probe what it called "irregular leasing of large number of aircraft by Air India without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy". The decision benefited private carriers, the CBI alleged The third FIR has been lodged to investigate AI for giving up profit making routes and timings in favour of national and international private airlines, which again led to a huge loss to the national carrier but came as a boon to private operators. Sources said the PE into the decision to merge the two airlines - the process for which started on March 16, 2006 - would focus on those who were running the civil aviation ministry at the time. Subsequently, a presentation was made to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on March 22, 2006, in which the chairman and managing directors of Indian Airlines and Air India, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and the civil aviation secretary were also present. The move to merge AI and IA was initiated in 2006 by the civil aviation ministry under Praful Patel and was cleared by a group of ministers which included Pranab Mukherjee and P Chidambaram, before being formally approved by the Manmohan Singh Cabinet.

The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process which caused to the national air carrier to face a financial crunch, a CBI official said. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former Finance Minister P. Chidamabram's son Karti in a money laundering case. The agency took the step on Supreme Court's January 5 order pertaining to the affairs of the Civil Aviation ministry under the previous United Progressive Alliance government. The court has reportedly asked the CBI to complete the probe by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the purchase of the Boeing aircraft. The first FIR related to purchase of 111 aircraft for Air India costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufactures while the second mentions leasing of large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy. A CBI official said the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on. The official said the agency in its third FIR will probe the cause of giving up profit making routes and profit making timings of Air India in favour of national and international private airlines causing a huge loss to the national carrier. The agency also registered a preliminary enquiry to enquire into the allegations relating to the issue of merger of two national carriers - Air India and Indian Airlines - causing loss to the national exchequer, the official said. --IANS rak/vd (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, May 30, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Russia launches maiden jet flight Reuters, MOSCOW Russia on Sunday carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corp and its state-controlled parent company, United Aircraft Corp (UAC), said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000m and traveling at 300kph. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and would be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. However, Western aviation sources expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent three-to-four-hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight.” A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Irkut director-general Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees on what the Kremlin called “a significant event.” The twin-engine MS-21 is to be built in two variants: the MS-21-300, which is to have 160 to 211 seats, and the later MS-21-200, which is to have 130 to 165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and Russian state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. The US’ Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. However, the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts said, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane would be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000km, the MS-21 would be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies have upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared with previous versions. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1399 times.

This new method enables the integration of electrical, optical and structural component during the build process. A component 3D printed using the THREAD process. Photo courtesy of AMRC. Based out of the University of Sheffield and working with aircraft manufacturing company Boeing, AMRC says this new patent-pending process will allow for parts to be additively manufactured with built-in, continuous connectivity and functionalities. Currently, the fully automated THREAD processes has been successfully demonstrated on polymer 3D printing machines. However, AMRC believes THREAD can be applied to a wide range of AM platforms. “THREAD has scope to simultaneously add multiple industry-recognised threads of differing materials into one component, giving the component additional functions,” explains AMRC Development Engineer and AM specialist Mark Cocking. “This will open AM up to a greater variety of uses.” Cocking adds that this development is significant in the fact that is crosses into so many different industries and has the ability to revolutionize the medical, aerospace and automotive sectors. THREAD will be an advantage in the manufacture of components requiring encapsulated electronics. This new 3D printing process can be developed as an add-on technology for existing AM platforms and also incorporated into next generation AM technologies. “We see THREAD transforming the functionality of additively manufactured components,” says Chris Iveson, who is driving the commercialisation of the technology. “Feedback from our contacts in various industries indicates a real need for this capability, with new potential applications being discussed daily. This is a great example of the AMRC using its unique expertise to solve real industry problems.” The AMRC with Boeing is continually developing THREAD technology for various markets. www.amrc.co.uk Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags 3D printing AMRC Boeing THREAD Related 3M develops new technology for 3D printing polymers Boeing awards OPM with 3D printing contract for Starliner spacecraft Researchers develop the world’s largest solid 3D printed tool for aircraft manufacturing Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

BOX — Airbus Helicopters starts construction of assembly line in China PARIS: Airbus Helicopters, the world’s largest supplier of commercial helicopters, has started building an assembly line in China in what Europe’s largest aerospace group said was a key step in its plans to tap into the Chinese market. The company’s final assembly line will be located in Qingdao, eastern China, with construction expected to be completed by 2018. An Airbus framework agreement signed in 2016 called for 100 H135 helicopters to be assembled over the next 10 years, and the first aircraft roll-out from Qingdao is planned for mid-2019. Guillaume Faury, chief executive of Airbus Helicopters, said in a statement that the start of construction demonstrated the company’s “commitment to further enhancing our industrial cooperation with China’s rapidly growing aviation industry”. -Reuters More from Aviation Iata AGM to discuss electronics ban ADAFZ grants 200th licence Barcelona moves to low-cost, long-haul flights Boeing delays Norwegian’s order a second time Know the rules for taking pics on a plane Etihad Airways deploys A380 on all JFK flights Canada’s defence minister threat against Boeing Get Dubai discounts with this boarding pass filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation Also In AviationIata AGM to discuss electronics ban Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Know the rules for taking pics on a plane 02Barcelona moves to low-cost, long-haul flights 03ADAFZ grants 200th licence 04Boeing delays Norwegian’s order a second time 05Iata AGM to discuss electronics ban 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 2Images China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet takes off May 05, 2017 15Images First ‘Silk Road’ train leaves UK for China Apr 11, 2017 8Images Dubai’s next big mall gets into project mode Mar 16, 2017 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Woman killed minutes before ending fast UK PM says enough is enough after attack Woman arrested for stealing Dh11 million Over 50,000 private sector firms fined Palm residents caught in beach dispute Double tragedy as son, mum die days apart Shah Rukh Khan slams Ramez after prank In Pictures: London Bridge terror attack ‘Forests’ under bridges to beautify Dubai Close Recommended For You Sisters die trapped inside father's car PUBLISHED ON Jun 04, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the “Saturday Night Fever” heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. (FILES) A file photo taken on July 12, 2002, shows Hollywood star and Qantas “Ambassador-at-Large” John Travolta, standing in front of his Boeing 707 at Sydney Airport./ AFP PHOTO / Greg Wood Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Lt. Col. Robert Vaucher and Joe Wing both served on B-29s during the war. The airplane will land at noon accompanied by other World War II airplanes, including a C-45 Expeditor, T-6 Texan and a collection of World War II aircraft from the local Commemorative Air Force Delaware Valley Wing based at Princeton Airport. Vaucher, a decorated World War II veteran, was a B-29 aircraft commander. He piloted the first B-29 Superfortress accepted from Boeing by the U.S. Army Air Corp, delivering it to the U.S. Air Corp 40th Bomb Group in Pratt, Kansas. He also flew the first B-29 strategic combat mission over mainland Japan on June 15, 1944, and also the longest B-29 mission - 4,030 miles round trip - from India to Sumatra on Aug. 10, 1944. Wing served as a gunner and back up flight engineer on B-29s during World War II flying over 30 missions from Tinian to Japan. One of his last missions was flying with the Enola Gay the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The B-29, Fifi, is one of only two remaining airworthy B-29s in the world and is the only one that is flown regularly. The aircraft will remain at the airport on Tuesday and Wednesday, and tours of the aircraft are available for $10 for adults and $5 for children ages 11 to 17. Those under 11 can see inside the aircraft at no charge. Fees for flights range from $80 to $1,595 and reservations may be made at online.

According to Izvestia, Moscow hopes that the talks will open a new page in bilateral relations, which hit the skids during Francois Hollande’s term as president. French experts told the newspaper that Macron is also interested in contacting the Russian leader, since this will allow him to demonstrate that his foreign policy is independent. Read also French minister comments on Macron-Putin talks Putin to discuss with Macron how to improve bilateral relations Poll shows 25% of Russians expect headway in ties with France during Macron’s presidency Kremlin unveils Putin-Macron talks agenda Putin to meet with Macron in Paris on May 29 Putin and Macron stress importance of Normandy format cooperation Macron says EU needs deep reforms Macron severely criticized Russia and its leader during his presidential campaign. Despite all that sharp rhetoric, the new French president invariably stressed that dialogue with Moscow is essential. Macron’s headquarters refrained from commenting on the upcoming talks to Izvestia, preferring "to wait for the results." According to French experts, the meeting with Putin will help Macron prove himself as an independent head of state. "The upcoming meeting is more important for Macron than for Putin. The new French leader has a crucial aim - to show that he is a strong president, and he really has the opportunity to demonstrate that he is not a puppet of Angela Merkel," French analyst, one of the founders of Stratpol analytical portal Xavier Moreau told Izvestia. An expert of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) told Izvestia "The anti-Russian and pro-NATO lobby is extremely strong in the French establishment," noting that by welcoming Putin, Macron will be displaying political willpower and courage. The Russian Ambassador to France Alexander Orlov was optimistic about the possibility of a warming in the countries’ bilateral relations. He noted that with the rise of a bright and competent president to power in France, Moscow and Paris have hopes for friendlier ties. In addition, expectations are in the air that the new leader of France will show more independence than former President Hollande.   Kommersant: Top Russian officials take off for Egypt to bolster strategic alliance Russia’s top diplomat and defense chief are heading to Egypt to meet their counterparts in a 2+2 format meeting set to be held in Cairo. The event will focus on bilateral issues, such as new weapons deals and the restoration of air travel, as well as the numerous regional problems, namely terrorist attacks against Christians in Egypt, chaos plaguing neighboring Libya, the ongoing wars in Syria and Yemen, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Kommersant wrote. This is the third meeting between the ministers in the 2+2 format. According to Kommersant’s diplomatic source in Moscow, the parties will discuss "the possibility of prolonging or re-signing the agreement for a strategic partnership between Russia and Egypt, which was signed in 2009 (for 10 years) by then-presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Hosni Mubarak." Read also Putin highlights Russia’s solid ties with Egypt According to a source from the Russian Ministry of Defense, another topic on the agenda is implementing a package of contracts for around $3.5 bln, signed in 2014, which include deliveries of Russian air defense systems to Cairo, as well as artillery, small arms, and aviation. The issue can be considered settled, the newspaper’s source in the military-technical cooperation project said, adding that all that is left is to "agree on the price." According to Kommersant's diplomatic source in Moscow, during the talks "the ministers will certainly discuss the deadlocked topic of resuming air travel between the two countries, although this is not an essential matter for Lavrov and Shoigu." The situation in Libya will also be a major topic for discussion. "In the international arena, Moscow and Cairo are increasingly acting as partners, and in some cases as situational allies," the newspaper wrote, so talks on the conflict in Yemen, the Palestinian-Israeli settlement and the war in Syria are also to be expected. According to a Kommersant source in the Russian Defense Ministry, Sergey Shoigu is going to talk in detail about the four zones of de-escalation created in Syria with the help of Russia, Iran and Turkey. Earlier, Moscow believed that the Egyptian military could participate in protecting these zones. The Russian diplomatic source told Kommersant that this issue is still relevant.   Vedomosti: Russia’s MC-21 to challenge Boeing, Airbus as maiden flight is major success Russia’s MC-21-300 aircraft completed a successful maiden flight on May 28, after the event had been postponed several times. According to Vedomosti, the MC-21 will have to compete not only with Airbus and Boeing, but also with China’s C919 aircraft. The MC-21 is an airliner in the most popular segment of narrow-body civilian aircraft, dominated by Airbus and Boeing. According to its developer, Irkut (part of United Aircraft Corporation), deliveries of the MC-21 will begin once it receives its certificate in 2019. A federal official told the newspaper, it was planned to roll out 900-1,000 aircraft in total, with up to two-thirds earmarked for export. Read also Russia gets hundreds of orders for MC-21 new medium-haul airliner Overall, the price tag for developing the MC-21 will come to about 245 bln rubles ($4.31 bln), two federal officials told Vedomosti. Orders for 312 aircraft have already been received. "The first flight is a beginning for flight tests, which will demonstrate whether the announced characteristics live up to expectations. If it fails, then the program will have problems. However, a composite wing and good aerodynamics offer reasons to expect success,” Infomost Consulting CEO Boris Rybak told Vedomosti. According to the newspaper, the MC-21 will have to compete not only with Airbus and Boeing, but also with Chinese C919. Both countries are targeting roughly the same export markets, vying for third after Airbus and Boeing in developing countries due to state support of sales and political arrangements, a source close to United Aircraft Corporation told the newspaper, adding that China might have more political weight and money. Fyodor Borisov from Institute for Transport Economics at the Higher School of Economics told Vedomosti, that China still lags significantly behind Russia in the aircraft industry, although the gap is rapidly narrowing. According to the expert, the C919 will be widely popular outside of China and its satellite countries. Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Labor shortage fears being stoked to raise retirement age The latest concern topping President Putin’s economic agenda is the country’s labor shortage. The team of Alexey Kudrin, Head of the Center for Strategic Research, and ex-Finance Minister, will present his economic strategy to the president before the end of May. While the supporters of raising the retirement age are currently in the majority, in reality the labor shortage problem can transpire only if labor policy does not boost productivity, upgrade production or improve economic efficiency, the newspaper wrote. According to a new forecast by the Economic Development Ministry, from 2016 to 2020, the number of the working-age Russians (men aged 16-59, women - 16-54) will diminish by about 3 mln people. According to the newspaper, this is not the first time the ministry has warned about a negative demographic trend. However, right now “this topic is becoming crucial to the country’s strategy that faces the task of modernizing production, introducing new technologies, and increasing efficiency.” Read also Russia may increase retirement age in 6-18 years — ex-finance minister Russian government has not made decision on retirement age hike — minister IMF recommends to reexamine retirement age in Russia to keep pension payments strong Russia's economy ministry: raising retirement age is global trend Russian Economic Development Ministry supports raising retirement age to 63-65 “Demographic ‘fearmongering’ help justify unpopular economic decisions. The population in Russia is aging, the number of employees is decreasing, so people need to tighten their belts, and pension payouts to the older generation need to be put off - this logic can be found in a new strategy put together by Alexey Kudrin’s team. The Ministry of Finance tends to agree with it,” Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote. The experts interviewed by the newspaper believe that the impending labor shortage is overblown. Official unemployment in Russia is slowly declining. And given the current pace, the number of jobless in Russia will drop from 4.2 mln people (on average per month) in 2016, to 3.7 mln people by 2020, Professor of Labor and Social Policy Department of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration Alexander Shcherbakov told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "Unemployment is the classic, foremost reserve of manpower," he told the newspaper. "I think that as far as Russia's labor market is concerned, with proper regulation, the shortage of workers will not be a significant threat by 2020," the expert added. Talks about a dearth in the working-age population is another ploy to justify raising the retirement age, Solid Management analyst Sergei Zvenigorodsky told the newspaper, adding that raising the retirement age might be dangerous as it could lead to a decrease in the overall level of wages, and in unemployment.   Izvestia: IT watchdog to outline restrictions on video content for websites with Russian audience Russia’s Internet watchdog is laying out a set of rules for thwarting viewers for online theaters. Those who have more than 100,000 visitors from Russia per day will have to introduce additional restrictions on video content and ensure age-related rating of the content, Izvestia wrote citing the draft law. The law on online cinemas will come into force in Russia on July 1. It will concern audiovisual services, visited by more than 100,000 users per day in Russia and prohibits screening videos that justify extremism, contain pornography, obscene language, and the like, without the age-restricting ratings. Read also Presidential aide says Russia’s law on online movie theaters won’t affect YouTube Until recently, the watchdog did not set out any guidelines to count website traffic - now, a user would have to watch a video for at least 15 seconds or just stay on a webpage to be considered a “visitor”. According to Tvzavr CEO, Marina Surigina, online cinemas have many different ‘counters’ that enable it to analyze users’ behavior and to tally them up. “We do not care what counter we will be asked to use, it only needs to be free and easy to install,” she added. “Of course, I would like the watchdog to choose one that has already been installed by almost everybody (for example, Mediascope) or some kind of free analogue. We do not want to pay for additional counters, which we do not really need,” she told the newspaper. According to J'son & Partners Consulting, in 2016 the volume of the Russian market for legitimate video services reached 11.18 bln rubles ($196.76 mln), which is 32% more than in 2015. According to the company's estimates, by 2020 the revenues of legal video services in Russia will increase to about 20 bln rubles ($352.01 mln).   TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in the press reviews {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News June 04, 17:34 In connection with terrorist acts in London police arrest 12 people June 04, 17:34 June 05, 3:49 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference June 05, 3:49 June 04, 14:09 Death toll from London terrorist attacks rises to seven June 04, 14:09 June 04, 8:51 Putin's annual televised Q&A session due on June 15 June 04, 8:51 In other media Реклама Photo 9 Results of Vladimir Putin's visit to Serbia 11 38th mission to the International Space Station over, cosmonauts back to earth 15 This week in photos: Cannes awards, Moscow storm and supermodel's charity marathon Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference 2 Putin recommends US not to teach Russia how to live 3 Lives of those who turned Trump’s alleged ties with Russia into sensation boring - Putin 4 Russia’s economic policy no longer depends on oil prices - Economic Development Minister 5 Russian cruise missiles hit terrorist targets near Palmyra 6 Over 2,000 servicemen take part in final stage of Russian-Tajik anti-terror drills 7 British military intelligence doc calls Russian T-14 Armata tank ‘most revolutionary tank’ 1 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 2 Russia’s economic policy no longer depends on oil prices - Economic Development Minister 3 More than 380 agreements were signed at SPIEF-2017 for 2 trillion rubles ($35.32 bln) 4 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference 5 Six people died in terrorist acts in London - police 6 Trump following London attacks calls for stopping being politically correct 7 Chairman of Saudi Aramco on meeting with Putin, travelling to Arctic and OPEC deal 1 Moscow concerned over US threats against Syria’s armed forces 2 Russia’s cutting-edge fighter jet to enter service this year 3 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane 'unprecedented' 4 Russian cruise missiles hit terrorist targets near Palmyra 5 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 6 Russian anti-submarine destroyer enters English Channel 7 Putin jokes about climate change, US hegemony at St. Petersburg forum TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

SYDNEY: Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his “beloved” Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the “Saturday Night Fever” heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Irkut Corporation is a Russian aircraft manufacturer and member of the United Aircraft Corporation. The duration of the flight was 30 minutes at the altitude of 1000 m, at the speed of 300 km/hour, said a statement from the company. The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant, it said. According to the programme, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft, it added. The new aircraft is Russia's first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors usch as Boeing and Airbus. The test flight comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus, said a Reuters report. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly, Reuters added. The MC-21-300 aircraft was piloted by the crew commander Oleg Kononenko and copilot Roman Taskayev. Kononenko said: “Flight mission is accomplished. The flight went in the normal mode. There are no obstacles revealed preventing the tests continuation.” Roman Taskayev said: “Characteristics and operational modes of the power plant are confirmed, all aircraft systems operated without glitches.” Oleg Demchenko, president of Irkut Corporation, said: “Today is the historic day for our personnel and the whole big team, which works on creation of MC-21 aircraft.” “We put the most advanced technical solutions in our aircraft, to provide enhanced comfort for passengers and attractive economic characteristics for air carriers,” he said. “I am happy to declare the maiden flight of the MC-21 aircraft has been successfully accomplished. I congratulate all project participants on our common holiday,” he added. Yury Slyusar, president of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), said: “MC-21 is created in a wide cooperation, where together with Irkut, other enterprises of the UAC are actively participating, namely Aerocomposite company, Ulyanovsk and Voronezh aircraft plants, UAC Integration Centre in Moscow.” “This is an important stage in the formation of the new UAC industrial model. According to our estimates, the global demand in the MC-21 segment will be about 15,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years. I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he added. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: | Russia | aircraft | flight | maiden | Irkut | More Industry, Logistics & Shipping Stories Le Beck wins approval to operate in Saudi Arabia Alba appoints director of global export markets Saudi delegation visits Dafza to discuss cooperation Siemens makes key appointment Canon Middle East launches two new DSLR cameras Michelin holds tyre safety campaign Iran’s Mapna builds two mobile power plants Evonik to focus on innovation for growth Iran firm, Gazprom plan compressed gas plant V-Line sets up new unit in Saudi Arabia AkzoNobel backs Ocean Cleanup's landmark effort Baidu partners with German firms on Autonomous driving Sabic backs Madinah education academy Saudi 'plans to build major aircraft facility' Sharp slowdown in ME air freight growth Australia’s Victoria state, Mena trade sees steady growth Russian firm plans showcase new jet at Dubai Air Show Aramco signs landmark JV agreement for maritime yard The Fjords to build 'all electric' ship Sadara launches region’s first PMDI facility Saudi Electricity Company seals Al Safwa Cement deal SWCC, DuPont join hands to improve desal facilities GE, Saudi Arabia deals to focus on mining, energy, healthcare Emerson releases new Syncade MES version Thales makes senior appointments in Middle East Hyundai high-performance prototypes prove their strength Rockwell Automation develops 3-step industrial security programme Sejel Technology selects HPE platform DMCC chief joins trade delegation to Canada Ooredoo supports SMEs forum in Oman Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the Saturday Night Fever heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 145 kilometres from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen firsthand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Silicon Valley’ star Thomas Middleditch hops aboard ‘Godzilla’ cast Music stars unite in Manchester as fans face down fears 'Wonder Woman' muscles in on the men, dominating US box office Big Bang’s TOP tests positive for marijuana during military service Tight security at benefit concert for Manchester bomb victims ‘Silicon Valley’ star Thomas Middleditch hops aboard ‘Godzilla’ cast Comedian Kathy Griffin says her career is over after gory Trump photo (VIDEO) The Wanted’s Nathan Sykes set for solo gigs in Malaysia Big Bang’s TOP tests positive for marijuana during military service Netflix shows are all worldwide hits... until they’re not Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles You could be dancing ... on ‘Saturday Night Fever’ disco floor (VIDEO) Passenger plane overshoots runway in eastern Indonesia Olivia Newton-John reveals new cancer 25 years later (VIDEO) Boeing said scrambling to save big Canada fighter jet deal Afghan woman seeks to be youngest to make solo round-the-world flight Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Right now it’s only a press release and a few concept images, but it looks like this is an air-launched system kind of like a Tristar/Pegasus, only much higher and completely unmanned. It’s a ton and a half to low earth orbit, with a goal of 10 flights in 10 days. Up in Albany? There’s a new hacker con happening in a few weeks. Anycon is a hacking, infosec, and cyber security conference happening June 16 & 17th in Albany, NY. The organizers of this con ([Chris], and his company Leet Cybersecurity) are loosely modeling this con after Derbycon. [Dave Kennedy] of TrustedSec will be attending as the keynote speaker. GOOD NEWS! [Casey Neistat] is under investigation by the FAA. [Casey Neistat] is the YouTuber that flies drones right in the middle of the Hudson River corridor, and is a menace to general aviation around NYC. This is neat. The Supplyframe Design Lab is the Hackaday Mothership right in the middle of Pasadena where we host our designers in residence, host a few meetups, and slowly fill every cubic inch of space with either dust or tools. The Design Lab just won a design award. You can check out the ‘design’ part of the Design Lab here, but keep in mind it will never be that clean ever again. Here’s an interesting Twitter to follow. Alitronik is a curator of the weird and wonderful cheap crap that can be found on AliExpress. Need an Altera Cyclone dev board? Here you go. A desk-mountable OLED inspection microscope? Done. A seven dollar Tesla coil? Dude, you can totally fit this inside a hat. [Drygol] had a nice old Commodore C16 with a broken TED chip. A shame, really. He did what anyone would do: put a C64 motherboard in the case for a fancy stealth upgrade. Is the great crowdfunded 3D printer boom over? Some would say that ship sailed after dozens of 3D printer crowdfunding projects failed to deliver, or delivered very low-quality machines. These people were wrong. This Polaroid-branded 3D printing pen might not get funding. A year ago, this project would have been funded on day one. There would have been writeups in The Verge on how Polaroid is turning the corner after decades of wasted opportunities. Now, the Crowdfunded 3D printer boom is finally over. The Hackaday crew was at the Bay Area Maker Faire last weekend and holy crap did we have a blast. Everyone came to the meetup on Saturday except for the fire marshall. The secret OSHPark bringahack on Sunday was even more impressive. We also saw a Donkey Car capable of driving around a track autonomously, but the team behind it didn’t have their work up on the Internet at the time.

Report comment Reply mkomarinski says: May 28, 2017 at 4:24 pm He mentions it at 1:38 Report comment Reply Rusty says: May 28, 2017 at 4:22 pm Curious why you would say good news on the investigation of Casey? Do you even have a valid point? The included chart you post shows it is legal. Sounds more to me like you are a jealous piece of crap and have already lost.

Risk of an incident is non-zero, hence that no incident has happened yet is entirely moot, all we have to do is wait, he’s using airspace that is rich with potential incidents. Even if you never get your feet off the ground, the ground is where a disaster ends up, and a major city is a crowded place. Want that on your head? Complaining to “Dude” is the wrong place… it’s Neistat that’s taken possession of the risk that threatens to end with much more strict regulations imposed on us. If you wish to dispute still… simply prove the risk is actually zero. Report comment Reply Brian Benchoff says: May 29, 2017 at 6:12 pm ^ This shit right here. Fly right over an airport in the middle of Idaho when there are no planes for miles? I don’t care. Fly over the Hudson at 1000 feet during VFR conditions? Execution by Boosted Board. Report comment Reply Biomed says: May 30, 2017 at 2:21 am Actually Brian, I care very much in both cases, but the author of this article seemed to restrict it to Neistat as the issue. Small airport operators are typically quite cooperative. I set up one AMA flying field right across the freeway from an active small airport on the other side of the city, light aircraft and ultralights, but asked permission rather than simply informing them in writing as required because our runway was right in line with their runway. Excessively cooperative, even offered that we just use his runway instead! Tried hard to get us. Went further and offered to pour a 50/50 mix of dirt and concrete over one stretch for us so it would be smooth for the small wheels. But, the county was providing us the land for modelling and already had the work release crew from county jail there for me to oversee and build the runway for us, so we stuck with the county plan which included moving us on top of a nearby hill a couple years down the road, plus they were providing liability insurance in addition to the insurance an AMA club enjoys. I’d worked that all out with them a couple years earlier. Next example, there is an airport in the northern half of the state has two paved runways for small jet aviation. Tuesday and Thursday evenings, and weekends alternating Saturday and Sunday, one runway is closed for the modellers to use. It works out nice. Pavement is fun to master landings on! I served as president of the AMA club here at home for something like 10 yrs. Not mentioned in proper sequence, but the County gave us the land for the very first runway at a local park just 3 miles away from the runway, and half a mile to the side of the local County Regional Airport approach. Again, I worked with the airport to not only inform them in writing, but to have them define all the flight restrictions they wished the club to use. It was easy… I just stepped out of the house and walked 3/4 block to the airport, knocked on the control tower door. They already knew me, took care of business for the club plus as Scout Leader arranged for the Scouts to get a guided tour of the control tower and air traffic control. Lotta people misunderstand RC Modelling…. but airport operators don’t. They know those models are a gateway drug addicting you into getting a pilot’s license. They see the money tied up in the models. They’re most accommodating! Report comment Reply Greenaum says: May 29, 2017 at 8:12 am The risk is a drone getting sucked into a jet intake, or smashing a smaller plane’s windscreen, or some other important part, possibly causing a crash. Of course birds can do the same, but we can’t actually do anything to legislate against birds. They just don’t pay any attention, the avian scofflaws. Perhaps if sentences were harsher… Anyway… Drones contain harder parts than birds, and they don’t test engines for drone-strike. Since drones are man-made things, it’s better to keep them out of the way altogether. It would be stupid to wait for an accident to happen, when prevention is easy, and all that we’re losing is a bit of airspace for hobbyists. When human lives are one the line, it’s a fair trade.

Report comment Reply Erin says: May 29, 2017 at 12:33 pm The Tristar/Pegasus comparison for XS-1 and its payload seems wrong. The XS-1 is intended to be a proper first stage, doing proper first stage work, just like Falcon 9’s first stage. Get S2 up above the atmosphere and moving reasonably quickly so it can insert into orbit. Also like the Falcon 9 first stage, the XS-1 is intended to be reusable. It just makes an aerodynamic landing instead of a propulsive one. I don’t think this is picking nits. Launcher aircraft have their place–even though I don’t think we’ve practically applied it yet (it’s not a huge energy/drag gain, but it does let you move the noise/violence of launch to a less-contested space)–but a first stage is more than a launcher aircraft, and a reusable first stage even more so. A combination of the two would be quite something, as well, and I think that’s what the Brits are after with Skylon…if they can ever pull it off… Report comment Reply Chris says: May 30, 2017 at 10:39 am ***COUPON CODE*** for the ANYCon hacker conference mentioned above is HACKADAY.

Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor has said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The planning commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which alleged caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal before. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Previous Next Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets with Pope Francis for a private audience at the Vatican on Monday, May 29, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Highlights from the news file for Monday, May 29 ——— POPE OPEN TO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS APOLOGY, PM SAYS: Canadians are anxious to reconcile with Indigenous Peoples, Justin Trudeau described telling Pope Francis on Monday as he asked the pontiff to apologize for the role the Catholic Church played in the tragedy of residential schools. The Pope — himself no stranger to the cause of social justice, he noted to Trudeau — seemed open to the idea, the prime minister said as he related the broad strokes of their private conversation at the Vatican. "He reminded me that his entire life has been dedicated to supporting marginalized people in the world," Trudeau said after he arrived back in Rome. Pope Francis also expressed his enthusiasm for working with the prime minister and the Canadian bishops on finding a way forward on the issue of an apology, as recommended by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission included the demand for a papal apology — to survivors, their families and communities — as one of the 94 recommendations in its report on the dark 120-year history and tragic legacy of residential schools. ——— SCHEER GETS HERO'S WELCOME FROM TORY CAUCUS: New Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is basking in a hero's welcome on Parliament Hill. The Saskatchewan member of Parliament was feted by his fellow MPs and leadership rivals alike as he arrived Monday to address the Tory caucus, fresh off a thrilling final-ballot win in the party's leadership contest on the weekend. He called the role a great honour, but an even greater responsibility. Scheer touched on all of the same themes he delivered following Saturday night's win, hailing the efforts of the other 12 candidates who sought the job and singling out Quebec MP Maxime Bernier in particular. Bernier was the presumptive front-runner throughout the race and the leader throughout Saturday night's nail-biting process of elimination, right up until the last ballot. He did not stop to speak to reporters prior to Monday's meeting. Scheer did have significant support among other elected MPs going into the campaign, about two dozen by the end of it. Many of the rest had backed fellow MP Erin O'Toole. ——— NDP LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE PREGNANT: NDP leadership candidate Niki Ashton says she is expecting a baby in November. Ashton, a Manitoba MP, is one of six candidates seeking the party's top job. The leadership race is scheduled to wrap up in October, when rank-and-file members pick a successor to Tom Mulcair. Ashton says she plans to carry on her work, adding she will continue to reach out to party members, activists and progressives across Canada. She says she intends to visit B.C. and the Atlantic provinces in the next two weeks. Ashton's rivals in the race include Quebec MP Guy Caron, Ontario legislature member Jagmeet Singh, Ontario MP Charlie Angus, former veterans ombudsman Pat Stogran and B.C. MP Peter Julian. ——— SACRED FIRE LIT TO LAUNCH MISSING WOMEN INQUIRY: A sacred fire ceremony in Whitehorse has marked the first family hearings of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. About 30 people gathered in a circle at sunrise for traditional prayers and songs as the fire was lit this morning. It will burn until the hearings conclude in Whitehorse later this week. Forty families are registered to testify before the commissioners in both public and private hearings between Tuesday and Thursday. Commissioners will be examining and reporting on the causes of violence against indigenous females by scrutinizing practices, policies and institutions, including policing and child welfare. Yukon minister responsible for the women's directorate, Jeanie Dendys, says 41 indigenous women have disappeared or been killed in the territory over several decades. Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston says he's pleased the families of missing and murdered women in the territory finally have a chance to present their stories and share their challenges. ——— CANADIANS WEIGH IN ON PLANNED ACCESSIBILITY LAW: Public consultations on Canada's first national law for disabled people have identified high unemployment rates, inaccessible buildings and barriers in transportation as some of the key issues that need to be addressed. The priorities were laid out in a report, released by the federal government Monday, summarizing eight months of consultations held with Canadians from coast to coast. It says participants wanted to see laws that would help lower stubbornly high unemployment rates for those with disabilities, reduce the number of buildings inaccessible to those with physical and intellectual disabilities, and remove accessibility barriers for the country's air, rail, ferry and bus transportation systems. The report also says Canadians have voiced a strong preference for the government to set up an independent body to oversee compliance with the new laws, which are expected to come before the House of Commons in early 2018. ——— GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES FAMINE RELIEF FUND: Aid agencies are urging Canadians to respond generously to the federal government's matching fund for famine relief in Africa and the Middle East, calling it a response to the worst humanitarian crisis in decades. The Liberal government said Monday it would match donations made by Canadians to registered charities to create a famine relief fund for more than 20 million men, women and children who are at risk of starvation. International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said the fund would support Canadian and international organizations working to provide assistance in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen and neighbouring regions. Bibeau said the government's window to match donations is from March 17 to June 30. Millions of people in the four affected countries and neighbouring regions are in need of necessities including water, sanitation services, shelter and urgent food assistance, Bibeau added. ——— JUDGE BANS ABORTION PROTESTS AT NEW BRUNSWICK HOSPITAL: As provinces across Canada move to establish protest-free "buffer zones" around abortion providers, a judge has banned anti-abortion activists from demonstrating outside a hospital in northern New Brunswick. Court of Queen's Bench Judge Reginald Leger granted a permanent injunction against protesters outside the Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. The anti-abortion picketers, affiliated with the 40 Days for Life campaign, put the safety of patients and employees at risk, Leger said in his recent decision. The ruling comes amid efforts across the country to strike a balance between the constitutional right to free expression and ensuring safe access to health-care services without harassment or intimidation. Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said Monday he plans to introduce legislation that would create safe zones outside abortion clinics in that province, citing reports of harassment at an Ottawa clinic. The Newfoundland and Labrador government introduced a law last November, modelled after British Columbia's Access to Abortion Services Act, to keep protesters at least 50 metres away from an abortion clinic. ——— FILINGS SHED LIGHT ON BOMBARDIER-BOEING DISPUTE: Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. ——— QUEBEC TABLES BACK-TO-WORK CONSTRUCTION BILL: The Quebec government tabled a bill Monday forcing the province's striking construction workers back on the job by Wednesday. In response, a coalition of construction unions promised to contest the bill in court, saying the legislation favours construction companies. Thousands of workers gathered in front of Quebec's legislature earlier Monday to voice their disapproval of the government's decision to end their strike after five days. The back-to-work bill maintains current working conditions for the province's 175,000 construction workers and grants them a pay raise of 1.8 per cent. It also opens an immediate five-month mediation period after which the unions and construction companies will be required to enter into arbitration. Members of the legislature are expected to debate the bill late into the night but the Liberal majority in the legislature will ensure it passes. Quebec Labour Minister Dominique Vien said before tabling her bill that both sides had months to negotiate a new agreement and added that every strike day costs the Quebec economy $45 million. ——— ONTARIO TAXPAYERS FOOT $120K BILL FOR GIANT DUCK: An Ontario government grant of about $120,000 that is going toward a giant rubber duck for Canada 150 celebrations is ruffling some feathers. The 18.6-metre, 13,600-kilogram yellow duck is being brought to Toronto by the Redpath Waterfront Festival, reportedly at a total cost of $200,000, combining other funding. It's being billed as a tourist attraction — with particular Instagram and selfie appeal — and will also be taken to other communities in Ontario. Ontario's Progressive Conservatives say they're unclear on the giant duck's connection to Canada's heritage celebrations and call it a waste of taxpayer money. Tourism, Culture and Sport Minister Eleanor McMahon says the province has been funding the waterfront festival for the past three years and it does a good job promoting tourism. She cautions against focusing too much on the duck, adding she thinks it is much ado about nothing. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. ——— QUEBEC TABLES BACK-TO-WORK CONSTRUCTION BILL: The Quebec government tabled a bill Monday forcing the province's striking construction workers back on the job by Wednesday. In response, a coalition of construction unions promised to contest the bill in court, saying the legislation favours construction companies. Thousands of workers gathered in front of Quebec's legislature earlier Monday to voice their disapproval of the government's decision to end their strike after five days. The back-to-work bill maintains current working conditions for the province's 175,000 construction workers and grants them a pay raise of 1.8 per cent. It also opens an immediate five-month mediation period after which the unions and construction companies will be required to enter into arbitration. Members of the legislature are expected to debate the bill late into the night but the Liberal majority in the legislature will ensure it passes. Quebec Labour Minister Dominique Vien said before tabling her bill that both sides had months to negotiate a new agreement and added that every strike day costs the Quebec economy $45 million. ——— ONTARIO TAXPAYERS FOOT $120K BILL FOR GIANT DUCK: An Ontario government grant of about $120,000 that is going toward a giant rubber duck for Canada 150 celebrations is ruffling some feathers. The 18.6-metre, 13,600-kilogram yellow duck is being brought to Toronto by the Redpath Waterfront Festival, reportedly at a total cost of $200,000, combining other funding. It's being billed as a tourist attraction — with particular Instagram and selfie appeal — and will also be taken to other communities in Ontario. Ontario's Progressive Conservatives say they're unclear on the giant duck's connection to Canada's heritage celebrations and call it a waste of taxpayer money. Tourism, Culture and Sport Minister Eleanor McMahon says the province has been funding the waterfront festival for the past three years and it does a good job promoting tourism. She cautions against focusing too much on the duck, adding she thinks it is much ado about nothing.

Watch video Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE cut ties with Qatar; say it supports 'terrorism' The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three FIRs and launched a preliminary enquiry to probe alleged irregularities in Indian Airlines-Air India merger and purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of planes and giving-up of profit-making routes by Air India. These decisions, according to the CBI, caused a loss to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees to the exchequer. The Union Cabinet had cleared the Indian Airlines-Air India merger proposal in March 2007. NCP leader Praful Patel was the civil aviation minister when both the merger and acquisition of Boeing aircraft to expand fleet took place. CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said the FIRs have been registered for offences of criminal conspiracy and corruption against unidentified officials of the ministry and Air India. The cases relate to decisions taken by the ministry during the tenure of the UPA government causing a loss of “tens of thousands of crore” of rupees to the exchequer, he said. A preliminary enquiry has been registered to probe the merger, while 3 FIRs have been lodged to probe alleged irregularities in the purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of planes while acquisition process was still on, and giving-up of profitable routes in favour of national and international airlines by Air India, Gaur said. In a report tabled in Parliament in January 2012, CAG had flagged these irregularities and called the decision to acquire 111 planes by Air India “a recipe for disaster”, which should have raised alarm in the government. It said the aircraft acquisition through debt had “contributed predominantly” to the airline’s massive debt liability. CAG had also called the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines “ill-timed” and pointed out that “the financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger”. “The entire acquisition (for both Air India and Indian Airlines) was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for Indian Airlines. This was a recipe for disaster and should have raised alarm signals in Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and the Planning Commission,” the report said. The CAG also flagged the “speed” at which the acquisition process for 68 aircraft was dealt with and observed that it was based on “flawed” assumptions. Given that the initial proposal was made in December 1996, CAG had said that acquisition process took an “unduly long time” and only in January 2004 a plan was made to buy 28 planes, which was revisited and later increased to 68 aircraft. “This increase in numbers does not withstand audit scrutiny, considering the market requirements obtaining then or forecast for the future, as also the commercial viability projected to justify the acquisition. The acquisition appears to be supply-driven”, the report had said. Terming the merger “ill-timed”, the report had said this exercise was undertaken “strangely from the top (rather than by the perceived needs of both these airlines), with inadequate validation of the financial benefits”.

Reply P Pradip Naik May 31, 2017 at 12:34 am Air-India was once a profitable airline. During 53 out of 67 years of Congress rule in India, ru party was corrupt & the govt officials don't know how to run the cos & they have no forsight. Ordering 787 dreamliners was a disaster. You have to order wide-body a/c like A380, 747-8 & 777-300/300ER for the future growth. AI most profitable routes were Nairobi & Gulf Sectors so as Malaysia & Singapore sectors. AI withdrew NON-STOP flight between JFK & Mumbai. That was a big mistake. If you operate NON-STOP 747-8 daily & round the year, the flight will go full. Reply C Citizen May 30, 2017 at 5:19 pm Air India is a white elephant apart from all these things their staff should know to serve/treat all the customers properly I emphasize once again ALL the customers. They should change their mind set then only it can improve their coffers nothing else. One mis behaved with the staff and escaped with apology that only can happen on this air line that shows how they discriminate customers on the basis of color,power,gender etc. Jaihind Reply A ashok May 30, 2017 at 11:53 am Corrupt ministers n officials in UPA regime got together to improve their conditions at the expense of the country exchequer. Middle East air lines like Emirates, Air Arabia, Etihad, Qatar airway, etc. Each operate more than 2 flights daily before 2010 to Indian cities but AI was significantly absent. These corrupt people for selfish gains caused immense damage to the country. I request Mr. Modi government to take appropriate steps to eliminate corruption in the country.

The CBI will probe the controversial merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, besides alleged irregularities in purchase and lease of aircraft by the two state-run carriers under the UPA government which caused "huge" losses to the exchequer. The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing-- for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

New Delhi:  The Central Bureau of Investigation or CBI will probe the controversial merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, besides alleged irregularities in purchase and lease of aircraft by the two state-run carriers under the Congress-led UPA coalition government which it said has caused "huge" losses to the taxpayer.

X Russia squares up to Boeing and Airbus with maiden flight of jet Medium-range aircraft capable of seating more than 200 completes 30-minute flight Mon, May 29, 2017, 20:26 The MC-21-300 passenger airliner during its maiden flight in Irkutsk, Russia. Photograph: Irkut Corporation/EPA         Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger aircraft on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000m and travelling at 300km/h. Squeezed by western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to the media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic aircraft duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Flight’s brevity Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent three- to four-hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A western aircraft-making source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed to be checked in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut general director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engined MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300, which will have 160-211 seats; and the later MS-21-200, which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media has said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 aircraft. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new aircraft could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. With a range of up to 6,000km, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 per cent operational savings compared to previous versions. – (Reuters)       Topics: Oleg Demchenko Oleg Kononenko Aeroflot Airbus Boeing Irkut United Aircraft China East Aimak Europe Russia Ukraine United States Read More Eight British Airways flights from Dublin cancelled over IT failure Knock Airport leads the way in Irish passenger growth BA chief says he will not resign over IT problems Road Warrior: Alitalia bid deadline ICG sells 21-year-old vessel for €45m Steering parts shortage stalls BMW car production What now for DAA as Toland checks out three years early?

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary MC-21-300 new Russian airliner maiden flight completed MC-21-300 new Russian airliner maiden flight completed May 29, 2017, 7:32 PM BST | Written by Christian Nordqvist | MC-21-300, the new Russian commercial airliner, has completed its maiden flight at an airfield of the Irkutsk Aviation Plant, Irkut Corporation announced today. Irkut Corporation, part of the United Aircraft Corporation, is a Moscow-based aircraft manufacturer. The maiden flight lasted thirty minutes, during which the new airplane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters and a speed of 300 km/h. Squeezed by economic sanctions by the United States, much of Europe, and other allies, Russia is attempting to revive domestic industrial production to make the country more economically self-sufficient. This Russian airplane’s test flight, which had not been announced to the media in advance, comes just three weeks after the maiden flight of China’s new C919 passenger jet. According to Irkut Corporation: “The airliner is offered to the customers with two options of power plant – PW1400G of Pratt & Whitney Company (USA) or PD-14 of United Engine Corporation (Russia). New-generation engines feature reduced fuel consumption, low noise and hazardous emissions. MC-21 aircraft meets prospective environmental requirements.” (Image: adapted from eng.irkut.com) Suddenly, the global market is looking much more precarious for the two commercial aviation giants, America’s Boeing and and Europe’s Airbus. In a Reuters article, Gleb Stolyarov and Jack Stubbs wrote that Western aviation experts expressed surprise at how short the maiden flight was, as well as its low altitude. Most American and European maiden flights last from three to four hours. Reuters quoted an ‘anonymous’ Western flight test engineer, who said: “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back.” The test pilots Oleg Kononenko (far left) and Roman Taskayev, talking to Oleg Demchenko, President of Irkut Corporation. The new MC-21-300 airplane is in the background. (Image: eng.irkut.com) MC-21-300 flight successful – Irkut claims The company said that during the MC-21-300 maiden flight, a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and then turning. This is a common technique for a new aircraft’s maiden flight. MC-21-300 was piloted by Oleg Kononenko, crew commander, and Roman Taskayev, copilot. Mr. Kononenko said: “Flight mission is accomplished. The flight went in the normal mode. There are no obstacles revealed preventing the tests continuation.” Mr. Taskayev added: “Characteristics and operational modes of the power plant are confirmed, all aircraft systems operated without glitches.” President of Irkut Corporation, Oleg Demchenko, said: “Today is the historic day for our personnel and the whole big team, which works on creation of MC-21 aircraft. We put the most advanced technical solutions in our aircraft, to provide enhanced comfort for passengers and attractive economic characteristics for air carriers.” MC-21-300 team members at Irkutsk Aviation Plant on the day of the maiden flight. (Image: eng.irkut.com) “I am happy to declare the maiden flight of the MC-21 aircraft has been successfully accomplished. I congratulate all project participants on our common holiday!” MC-21-300 New Russian Aircraft MC-21-300 is a next-generation commercial airplane with a capacity of between 163 and 211 passengers. Irkut Corporation says that the aircraft has the largest fuselage diameter in the category of narrow-body aircraft, which provides passengers with a qualitatively new level of comfort. According to a press release by Irkut Corporation: “This design decision significantly widens private space of each passenger, ensures free passage of passenger and service trolley over the aisle, and shortens airport turnover time. ” “Natural lighting of the passenger cabin is enhanced due to big windows. Comfortable air pressure and advanced microclimate will be maintained in the aircraft.” Western experts wondered why the maiden flight was so short – just 30 minutes. Test flights in Europe and North America generally last from three to four hours. (Image: eng.irkut.com) The manufacturer says its new commercial aircraft has an innovative ergonomic pilot cabin, and is superior to any similarly-sized plane that is currently out there in terms of efficiency and flight-technical characteristics. MC-21-300 features: – Dense layout capacity: 211 seats – Two-class layout capacity: 163 seats (147 economy plus 16 business) – Maximum takeoff weight: 79,250 kg – Maximum payload: 22,600 kg – Maximum flight range: 6,000 km – Height: 11.5 meters – Length: 42.2 meters – Wing span: 35.9 meters Video – MC-21-300 maiden flight This Sputnik video of the MC-21-300’s maiden flight starts with a view of inside the cockpit as the new aircraft takes off.

The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. “The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer,” he said. “The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers,” Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government’s decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines — 48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing — for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a “recipe for disaster”, the government auditor had said it should have raised “alarm” in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. “It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on,” he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a “huge” loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it “ill-timed”. Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,”The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger.” The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet’s approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI’s action follows the Supreme Court’s January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said “all stakeholders” were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India’s “downfall“. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline’s market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

The investigative agency on Monday registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines.

Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the ministry of civil aviation, public investment board and the Planning Commission.

The agency has also registered a preliminary enquiry to look into the merger of Air India and erstwhile Indian Airlines which the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had called "ill-timed". The cases have bee registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of "tens of thousands of crore of rupees" to the exchequer, he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor has said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The planning commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which alleged caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal before. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline s market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, produced by Irkut Corporation, takes off in Irkutsk, Russia, May 28, 2017. (Reuters Photo) Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependent on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jet making source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Tourism A special ceremony involving 1,453 trucks was arranged Monday near...

Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15% cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15% operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. “I’m sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he said. more from business Wipro chief Azim Premji’s salary drops 63% to Rs 79 lakh in a year Jun 04, 2017 23:55 IST No downturn in IT sector, reports are wrong, jobs will come: Ravi Shankar Prasad Jun 04, 2017 23:38 IST Nurturing Recruitment-Ready Students Promotional Feature Recommended for you Read more Who will buy Air India?

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour.

European plane makers who import US-made parts fear this will endanger the multi-billion dollar deals they have done there. By Thomas Jahn and Jens Koenen Published on 29. May 2017, 12:06 Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Deal in danger: An Airbus A330-200 in service for Iran Air. Source: Airbus It was only a couple of sentences but they were enough to cause a major amount of concern in the aerospace industry. In a hearing, US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin announced his intention to impose additional sanctions not only on Syria and North Korea, but also on Iran. Then he added, “both in the case of Boeing and Airbus, there are licenses that will be required and they are under review.” A lot of money is at stake. Airbus has an order from Iran Air for 32 A320neo-s, six A320ceo-s, eight A321ceo-s, eight A330—200s, 28 A330—900neo-s and 16 A350—1000s. And a lot of money will continue to be at stake: As one Airbus press release put it, on the delivery of the first of the Airbus A321s to Iran in January this year: “Iran is forecast to require some 400 to 500 new aircraft to modernize as well as to grow its existing passenger fleet to catch up with years of pent up demand on domestic as well as international routes.” Want to keep reading?

New jet quietly makes maiden flight in bid to rival Airbus and Boeing The passenger jet's test flight on Sunday was not announced to the media. By India Ashok May 29, 2017 07:07 BST The MS-21 successfully completed a 300minute flight, flying at 300km an hour at an altitude of 1,000mIrkut Corporation Russia quietly launched a new medium-range passenger jet, the MS-21, on Sunday (28 May), which it hopes will boost its aviation industry. The jet, which is Russia's first attempt into the production of a commercial jet since the Soviet era, carries the hopes of the nation in rivalling aviation giants like Boeing and Airbus. The aircraft made its first flight from the Siberian city of Irkutsk, the base of the jet's manufacturer the Irkut Corporation. Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin took to Twitter to announce the maiden flight, writing "Our swallow learned to fly." Irkut said in a statement that the MS-21 successfully completed a 30-minute flight, flying at 300km an hour at an altitude of 1,000m. Russian president Vladimir Putin's press secretary told state media Tass that Rogozin informed Putin of the aircraft's successful flight over the phone. The jet's test flight was not announced to the media and comes on the heels of China testing its new passenger jet C919, indicating the growing competition in the aviation industry. According to the aircraft's manufacturers, the MS-21 can carry up to 211 passengers and travel for up to 6,000km. Irkut said that the twin-engine aircraft will come in two versions, one which can seat around 211 passengers and another which will hold up to 165 passengers. Putin reportedly reached out to Irkut's director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him on the "momentous occasion". Although the jet's manufacturer claimed that the aircraft was "superior to existing counterparts in terms of flight-technical characteristics and efficiency," Western aviation experts were surprised at the parameters of the test flight, in terms of the low altitude and the brief duration of the flight. Reuters cited an unspecified jet maker as deeming the MS-21 as a "genteel flight".

The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus.   Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly.   "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying.   Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity.   A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air.   Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.   President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event".   The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters.   Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes.   America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs.   Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.   With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions.   State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s.

Elmer Haight Website Staff May 28, 2017, 1:38 p.m. Send to Kindle Buy this photo Photo provided Rev. Elmer Haight December 7, 1919 - May 18, 2017 Rev. Elmer Haight, 97, moved to heaven on May 18, 2017, while at home with his wife at his side. He was born December 7, 1919, to Elmer S. and Zetta (Dayley) Haight in Seattle, WA. Elmer started school in a little one-room rural school near Bend, OR. His family came to Wenatchee, WA, in August, 1928, to work in the fruit industry. For the next eight years they were migratory fruit workers, going from Wenatchee, after the apple harvest in the fall, to California, working their way back north until spring and the cherry harvest. They managed to save enough during the depression years to buy 200 acres of bare land on Stemilt Hill in 1936. In a few years, they were able to plant 30 acres of cherries. Elmer’s brother, Bruce, joined the local Navy Reserve unit and was called to active duty in 1940. In June of 1944, he and his flying crew disappeared, in their Navy PBY Catalina airplane, somewhere in the Alaska area. Elmer worked at Boeing Aircraft in Seattle from September, 1941 to April, 1942. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps Aviator Cadet program in June, 1942, and was called to active duty in December of that year. He was eliminated from the Cadet program after physical examinations, and was then sent to a new base in Marfa, TX, where he remained for two years. He was then moved around for a year, being discharged at Camp Beale, CA, in February, 1946. In August, 1947, he began working at the Grange Supply in Wenatchee, remaining there until July, 1956. He sold real estate for a year, then was employed by California Chemical Company at their office and plant in Wenatchee. He came to know the Lord Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior through a blind date (later his wife) and her family and the people organizing Faith Lutheran Church in East Wenatchee in 1955. Elmer married Dorothy Battermann on November 2, 1952. They were blessed with four children. In 1962, Elmer felt the call to serve his Lord as a pastor. He and Dorothy took their four young children and enrolled in Concordia Theological Seminary in Springfield, IL, in September, 1964. Elmer was ordained as a pastor in the LCMS Lutheran Church in September, 1968, and called to Vernal, UT, and Rangely, CO, where he served until moving to Othello, WA, in 1978.

(Photo courtesy of PR Department of Irkut Corporation/Handout via Reuters) Moscow: Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. [nL8N19052L] "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.

According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Putin called Irkut Corporation President and Chief Designer of Yakovlev Design Bureau Oleg Demchenko and congratulated him, as well as the team of the enterprise and all employees of the industry on this significant event. The overall volume of sales of Russia's new MC-21 passenger plane is expected to amount to 1,000 pieces till 2037, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Sunday. "The fulfillment of the declared technical and economic characteristics, the creation of an effective modern system of integrated logistic support and after-sales service, and the formation of profitable financial sales models will allow the total volume of MC-21 deliveries to exceed 1,000 pieces in the period until 2037," Manturov was quoted as saying in the ministry's press release. The project will continue to receive systematic support for the promotion on potential markets, Manturov added. Manufacturers According to Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), the duration of the first MC-21 flight was 30 minutes at the altitude of 3,280 feet and at the speed of 186 miles per hour. "The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant. According to the program, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft," the UAC said in a press release. UAC President Yuri Slyusar said that the MC-21 aircraft was created in wide and active cooperation of Irkut with other UAC enterprises. "This is an important stage in the formation of the new UAC industrial model. According to our estimates, the global demand in the MC-21 segment will be about 15,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years. I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," Slyusar said as quoted in the UAC press release. High Export Potential Russia's state corporation Rostec, which is the integrator of numerous systems of the aircraft, considers that the export potential of MC-21 is big. "We have become the first and the largest customer to procure MC-21 aircraft, and we have signed a firm contract on 85 planes. Our subsidiary Aviacapital-Service has already signed an agreement to purchase 50 MC-21 aircraft for Aeroflot. Moreover, we consider that the export potential of the new jet is great, primarily among dynamically developing aviation markets — Southeast Asia, Latin America, India, the Middle East," Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov said. According to Chemezov, the creation of MC-21 is one of the key milestones, achieved by Russia's civil aircraft construction industry in the 21st century. Russia's state development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) Chairman Sergei Gorkov said Sunday that the bank had invested $90 million in the creation of the first copy of the MC-21 aircraft. "Part of this money will serve as the prepayment for the next planes," Gorkov said in a press release published on VEB's website. According to Gorkov, VEB's subsidiary VEB-leasing has ordered 30 MC-21 planes. ...

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News World News Russia squares up to Boeing, Airbus with maiden jet flight Shares0 Sun, 28 May 2017-08:45pm , Reuters Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

"The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.

Laura Thomson and Sam Sciortino's dream Greek island wedding was due to take place on Sunday on idyllic Santorini, but due to IT problems British Airways faced over the weekend , their guests were stuck at the airport. The couple, from Woking, Surrey, flew out to the island earlier in the week but their family were forced to wait 13 hours on Saturday to catch a flight without their luggage, containing wedding suits and bridesmaid dresses. Writing on Facebook , heartbroken Laura said: "Well what can I say... I am just a shell of myself right now, my head is vacant, we are absolutely shattered. Thanks to all the suppliers out here we have managed to swap dates, without too much loss. "I have been in tears with our dream of how it should of been slowly fading away, knowing I can't share the day with my family the way I imagined, my sister in law and nieces no longer able to be bridesmaids, my brother no longer with his suit". Luckily the couple have managed to rearrange so they can wed on Monday, but the stress of re-planning the wedding at short notice has been exhausting, they said.

"I'm so sorry they have been through such hell at terminal 5 and all the worry and fear. "I just hope you all can enjoy Monday once it finally arrives and hopefully the topic of conversation on our special day isn't BA." The bride-to-be told the BBC she felt "so let down" by British Airways. The family have made it to the island but without their luggage (Photo: Facebook / Laura Thomson) She said: "We've been planning our big day for two years only to be forced to rush around and change everything to take place a day later. "My brother is one of the groomsmen, and my nieces and sister-in-law are my bridesmaids, so naturally I wanted them to share the day with us. "They booked with British Airways because they thought it was a reliable company. We feel so let down." British Airways says it is aiming to resume most flights by today after the crippling global IT crash . Luckily the wedding can go ahead but the couple had to change the date (Photo: Facebook / Laura Thomson) Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now The airline said its engineers were "continuing to work hard" to restore services hopes to operate a "near normal schedule" at Gatwick and the "majority" of flights from Heathrow.

The test is set for Tuesday, according to the announcement by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Reuters reported Saturday. Advertisement An interceptor from California’s Vandenburg Air Force Base will be used to neutralize an ICBM-like target over the Pacific Ocean, according to the Missile Defense Agency. There are 36 such bases in California and Alaska. If successful, it will be the first time the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system has been used to intercept an ICBM. In the past, the system, managed by Boeing, has been used to intercept other types of missiles. The test is being carried out because North Korea is continuing its drive toward developing an ICBM capable of reaching the continental United States. Last Tuesday, the head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Vincent Stewart, said at a Senate hearing that Pyongyang is still “years away” from being able to master such a goal, but that if left unchecked North Korea would nevertheless indeed be able to obtain a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching United States territory. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised the test of a new anti-aircraft guided weapon system on Sunday, according to a statement by the nation’s KCNA news agency. “Kim Jong Un … watched the test of a new type of anti-aircraft guided weapon system organized by the Academy of National Defense Science,” the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in its release Sunday. “This weapon system, whose operation capability has been thoroughly verified, should be mass-produced to deploy all over the country … so as to completely spoil the enemy’s wild dream to command the air, boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty,” the statement continued. Kim Jong Un was accompanied by Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of the Academy of National Defense Science, a weapons development and procurement center. Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman has warned that Israel could find itself in the line of fire between the United States and North Korea if the two engage in a military confrontation. North Korea has also continued to collaborate with Iran on weapons and nuclear technology, while Iran meanwhile continues to arm its proxy terrorist groups in the Middle East, all of which have vowed to annihilate the State of Israel, as has Iran itself.

Tai told a small group of reporters at a Foxconn-owned shopping mall in Taipei that "These panels will not only be used on smartphones. It is possible they will be used in aeronautics as Boeing now uses Sharp's panels in its aircraft. Our panels can service governments and the defense sector, too   The Nikkei further reports that Tai did not say whether the panels would be offered to Apple, a key customer for both Sharp and its parent company, Hon Hai Precision Industry, better known as Foxconn Technology Group.   Further, Tai said Sharp have not decided on a location for the facility, though he wants construction to begin as soon as possible.   Tai's comments come one month after he and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou met U.S. President Donald Trump.   Further, Tai confirmed that Sharp, together with Foxconn, might inject more than 800 billion yen (US$7.2 billion) into new projects in the U.S.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane may not be as sexy as an F-35 stealth fighter, but in some ways it is far closer to the forefront of international flashpoints in the Pacific Ocean. Maritime patrol planes are essential for tracking the movement of ships and especially submarines across vast oceanic waters—and potentially sinking them in the event of hostilities. Hunting submarines from the air, however, is an airpower-intensive job that requires numerous airframes spending thousands of flight hours flying long-distance patrol patterns over the ocean. Since 1962, the U.S. Navy has operated the P-3 Orion patrol plane, based on the four-engine L-88 Electra airliner. The turboprop-powered aircraft could spend a dozen hours flying low over the ocean to drop sonar buoys, scan the water for metallic hulls of submarines with its Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) and potentially launch torpedoes. After fifty-five years of able service, however, the P-3s have accumulated thousands of service hours and their hulls are growing fatigued. In 2004 the U.S. Navy selected the jet-powered Boeing P-8 Poseidon to succeed the aging P-3. Development proceeded relatively smoothly, in part due to the use of a preexisting airframe and the decision to phase in the P-8’s advanced systems in a series of increments rather than delivering them all at once. This led the P-8 unit costs to actually come in under budget, at $150 million per aircraft. The P-8 is based on the 737-800ERX short-to-medium-range airliner. It typically has a flight crew of three and boosts stronger power generators for its onboard electronics. The Poseidon reportedly offers a much smoother ride than the Orion, thanks to its broader-swept wings and flight computers. Orion crews were often nauseated by the strong turbulence their low-altitude flight operations required. While the P-8 does have a strengthened hull to operate at low altitude—though at reduced fuel efficiency compared to the P-3—it’s designed to perform most of its operation from high altitude, where the thinner atmosphere allows for greater fuel efficiency and a better vantage for some of its sensors. A Poseidon can loiter overhead at speeds as low as two hundred miles per hour, and can stay on station for extended times due to its in-flight refueling capability. However, with a maximum speed of 564 miles per hour, it can also dash two hundred miles per hour faster than the P-3 aircraft it is replacing. The Poseidon’s primary payload is its diverse array of sensors. These include an APY-10 multi-mode synthetic aperture radar, which not only can track the position of ships over hundreds of miles away, but possesses a high-resolution mode which can spot submarine periscopes poking above the waves and even identify different classes of ships. An MX-20 electro-optical/infrared turret provides a shorter-range search option, while an ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measure (ESM) derived from a system onboard the EA-18G Growler functions as an electromagnetic sensor, particularly useful in tracking the positions of radar emitters. A recent addition is the Advanced Airborne Sensor, a dual-sided AESA radar that can offer 360-degree scanning on targets on land or coastal areas, and which has potential applications as a jamming or even cyberwarfare platform. A number of key systems on the P-8 are designed to track submerged submarines. A rotary launcher system in the rear of the P-8 can dispense sonar buoys into the water. A recent upgrade allows P-8s to employ new Multistatic Active Coherent buoys that generate multiple sonar pulses over time, allowing for greater endurance and search range. The P-8 also has its own acoustic sensor, and even a new hydrocarbon sensor that can “sniff” for fuel vapor from submarines. However, the P-8 lacks the tail-mounted MAD sensor of the P-3 Orion, useful for detecting the metallic hulls of submarines while flying at low altitude. Various reasons have been offered for its removal: the MAD weighed too much at 3,500 pounds, it did not fit with the high-altitude search profile of the P-8, or the new sensors on the P-8 rendered it unnecessary. However, the U.S. Navy is reportedly developing a variant of the an air launched drone, called the High-Altitude Unmanned Targeting Air System, which can carry a MAD sensor and transmit its findings back up to the P-8. Five operator stations on the port side of the plane carry multifunction displays that can be configured to display whatever sensors and controls are most useful under the circumstances. The P-8’s computers are designed to fuse the data into a single coherent picture for the operators—and can then “push” that data to friendly ships and airplanes. This is a capability the U.S. Air Force has been struggling to integrate into its new E-3G radar planes. The P-3 is also designed to be especially compatible with Navy RQ-4N drones. In the event of hostilities, the Poseidon can carry five missiles, depth charges or torpedoes in a rotary launcher in the rear hull, and six more on underwing racks. While the P-3 had to fly low to deploy its torpedoes, the P-8 can use a special High Altitude Air Launch Accessory to transform its Mark 54 324-millimeter lightweight torpedoes into GPS-guided glide bombs that can be dropped from altitudes as high as thirty thousand feet. These shed their wings upon hitting the water and hone in on targets using onboard sonar. Poseidons can also carry Harpoon AGM-184H/K antiship missiles with a range of 150 miles.

EVERETT — Kevin Beavers’ title defense at the Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament didn’t get off to the start he was hoping for. But he more than made up for it as the round progressed. The two-time defending champion grabbed the first-round lead by shooting a 2-under par 70 Saturday at Legion Memorial Golf Course on the first day of the Snohomish County Amateur. Beavers was sitting at 4-over after four holes, but seven birdies over the final 14 holes gave him a two-shot lead over a crowd of players tied for second at even-par 72. “The first four holes were very ugly,” said Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer from Seattle. “But I ended up bringing it back.” The second round is Sunday at Harbour Pointe Golf Club in Mukilteo. The final round is Monday at Snohomish Golf Course. Beavers has known nothing but success at the County Am. He won the tournament each of the past two years, the only times he’s entered. But he found himself dealing with adversity early on as he struggled with mechanical issues in his swing. Yet he got himself back on track by making three birdies before making the turn. “It was sort of just kicking myself in the backside,” Beavers said about the source of his turnaround. “It was just never giving up. If I go out and shoot 85, so be it, but I’m going to try to at least shoot a good number. I’m working on some things in my swing, and when you’re coming out here and people expect you to play well because you‘ve done well in this event in the past, I was a little nervous on the first few holes. Then I just kind of put all that aside and was able to kind of calm myself back down.” Putting played a large role in the turnaround. “I putted really well today, I made a lot of putts,” Beavers said. “But I also hit a lot of good shots. I was 4-over after four and the three birdies I had on the front side were all kick-ins, they were all within four feet, so that helps. I made a few coming in on 15, 17 and 18 that were about 10-15 feet each. I didn’t make any bombs, but I made the ones that if you set up to it and like the look, you can make them.” The opening-round 70 puts Beavers in position to become just the second player to ever win three straight County Ams. The only other to accomplish the feat was Bob Burton from 1973-75. There was a logjam for second place, with six players shooting even-par 72. That included all three members of the Western Washington University men’s team — Chris Hatch, Cody Roth and Ethan Casto — who were last-minute additions to the tournament. Western qualified for the NCAA Division II men’s golf championships in Kissimmee, Florida, and ideally the trio would have been playing Friday. However, the Vikings didn’t qualify for the final eight in the team competition, meaning their tournament ended Thursday, thus freeing them up for playing at the County Am. “I called them from Dallas (during an airport stopover) and was like, ‘Hey, do you have room, think we can squeeze in there?’” Hatch said. “They were like, ‘Yeah, if you can get three guys to make it a threesome,’ and it worked out perfectly.” The group at even par also included 16-year-old Alvin Kwak, a sophomore at Kamiak High School who’s coming off finishing tied for 10th at the 4A state boys golf tournament earlier this week; Jacob Rohde, who finished tied for second at the County Am last year; and Ty Cannon. “I played really well today,” said Kwak, last year’s junior champion. “I was struggling out there, but I was able to keep calm, which is something I developed today. So it’s a new skill.” Said Rohde: “I had a lot of really good chances that I just didn’t capitalize on. The greens weren’t as good as I was expecting them to be, so it was really kind of rough to be aggressive with your putts because you didn’t know which way it was going to go. I think I could have been four or five shots better if I just could have trusted where the ball was going to go on the green.” Alex Stamey, seeking to become the first six-time winner of the County Am, sits three strokes off the pace after shooting a 73. He and David Hansen were tied for eighth. 2017 Snohomish County Amateur Saturday at Legion Memorial GC Flight 1 (+4.0 to 4.9) Gross scores, Par 72 (6,627 yards) Kevin Beavers, HP 70 Alvin Kwak, EGCC 72 Chris Hatch, HP 72 Cody Roth, HP 72 Ethan Casto, Sno 72 Jacob Rohde, LM 72 Ty Cannon, LM 72 Alex Stamey, EGCC 73 David Hansen, PGD 73 Chris Bae, LM 74 Sean Fitzpatrick, PGD 74 Stephen Lee, SR 74 Mick Stocker, EGCC 75 TJ Lewis, LM 75 Jerry Slind, Sno 76 Kale Reynolds, SR 76 Rowan Foxley, EGCC 76 Andrew Martin, EGCC 77 Connor Bayha, SR 77 Lance Kilbride, HP 77 Mark Strickland, HP 77 Michael Burlison, Sno 77 Tyler Spalti, EGCC 77 Andrew Kaemingk, Glen 78 Jason Calamaro, LM 78 Dominic VanDaveer, Sno 79 Patrick Boag, EGCC 79 Todd Tibke, Sno 79 Duane Diede, EGCC 80 Jordan Brajcich, MC 80 Drew Preston, Ced 81 Josef Koznek, LM 81 Ace Younggren, EF 82 Alex Raynor, BC 82 Ben Thacker, LM 82 Ken Harris, SR 82 Mark White, HP 83 Chris Giesker, WH 84 Mark Johnson, Jor 84 Tyler Stocker, EGCC 87 Matthew Kornegay, HP 90 Austin Duffy, LM WD Flight 2 (5.0 to 8.9) Net scores, Par 72 (6,111 yards) Brian Wimer, LM 66 Dan Frost, Jor 66 Martin Seguin, WH 68 Steve Laue, Lynn 68 Ethan Merritt, Sno 69 Nick Rothrock, Glen 69 Steve Maldonado, WH 69 Larry Montgomery, LM 71 Andrew Kephart, WH 72 Doug Barlow, EF 72 Eric Haechrel, Sno 72 Harrison Jewell, SR 72 Ian Johnson, WH 73 Nick Dammann, Sno 73 Ben Headland, LM 74 Brett Engstrom, WH 74 James Iazeolla, EGCC 75 Mike Nikolas, LM 77 Brandon Dale, WH 78 Steven Howell, Sno 78 Josh O’Connor, BC 86 Scott Chambard, SR DNF Flight 3 (9.0 to 19.0) Net scores, Par 72 (6,111 yards) Darrell Stubblefield, Sno 68 Christian Kim, EGCC 70 Paul Lill, LM 70 Silas Puetz, HP 70 Brendan Doheny, WH 71 Jerry Wabey, Jor 71 James McGuire, WH 72 Van Luu, LM 72 Greg Guest, WH 73 Bob Wallin, BC 75 David Forhan, LM 75 Jerry Browning, LM 75 Stephen Reed, Jor 76 Tom Desmarais, LM 78 Roman Catli, HP 79 Tom Douglas, EGCC 80 Floyd Gale, Sno 81 Key: BC—Battle Creek; EF—Echo Falls; EGCC—Everett Golf & Country Club; Glen—Gleneagle; HP—Harbour Pointe; Jor—Jorgensen; LM—Legion Memorial; Lynn—Lynnwood; MC—Mill Creek Golf & Country Club; PGD—Pro Golf Discount (Lynnwood); Sno—Snohomish; SR—SuperRange; WH—Walter Hall   Most Read Neighbors worried about development next to former Everett dump EVERETT — Two groups of homeowners are asking the Snohomish County hearing… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Noah Haglund 2 charged after scuffle over stolen meat and a stab in the eye MARYSVILLE — A Snohomish woman was indignant that a grocery store manager… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Diana Hefley Anchor Pub hosts nontraditional church services once a month EVERETT — Their beliefs are traditional, but not much else.

First Name Last Name Email Postal Code Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print By the time Air Force One started down the runaway at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, to bring President Trump home, the Atlantic had grown markedly wider than it was when he flew to Riyadh. In a Munich beer hall Sunday, Angela Merkel confirmed it. Europe must begin to look out for itself, she said, “take our fate into our own hands. … The times in which we could rely fully on others, they are somewhat over.” Merkel’s apprehensions are understandable. A divorce could be in the cards. During his visit to NATO in Brussels and the G-7 in Sicily, Trump, with both his words and body language, revealed his thinking on who are friends and who are freeloaders. Long before arriving, Trump had cheered Brexit, the British decision to quit the EU, and shown a preference for nationalist Marine Le Pen in the French election won handily by Emmanuel Macron. But when it comes to leaders, Trump seems to prefer Deke House to student council types. He has hailed Vladimir Putin as a “strong ruler” and “very smart.” In Riyadh, Trump declared King Salman a “wise man.” He calls China’s Xi Jinping “a great guy” and welcomed Turkish autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the Oval Office: “It is a great honor to have you with us.” When Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has imprisoned and killed thousands of the Muslim Brotherhood, came to visit, Trump said, “He’s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation.” Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America’s independent news network. In a phone call, Trump also praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has had narcotics dealers gunned down in the streets, for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” Trump has even found merit in Kim Jong-un, the 33-year-old dictator of North Korea, describing him as a “a pretty smart cookie.” And where Trump was photographed by the Russians grinning broadly with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, his confab with Merkel was marked by a seeming reluctance to shake hands. But the disagreements with Europe are deeper than matters of style. Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have indicated that in dealing with foreign nations, U.S. support for democratic norms and human rights will now take a back seat to strategic interests. In Riyadh, Trump signaled the Sunni king of Bahrain we will no longer be giving him instructions on how to treat his Shiite majority. We’re not “here to lecture,” Trump assured the Arab royals. After the conclave, the king’s police killed five and wounded dozens of demonstrators outside the home of a Shiite cleric, and arrested 286 of his supporters. Of greater concern to Trump and Tillerson is the retention of the Persian Gulf naval base of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain. Trump also tilts toward GOP skepticism of the threat of global warming and is considering pulling out of the Paris climate accord that is the altarpiece of the environmentalist international. In Brussels, Trump praised NATO’s decision to back the U.S. war in Afghanistan after 9/11, but did not specifically recommit to Article 5, requiring all NATO nations to treat an attack on one as an attack on all, which our nervous NATO allies had wanted to hear. Instead, they got an earful of pure Trump about how they owed back pay for NATO and that only five NATO nations were meeting their obligation to allocate 2 percent of GDP to defense. Merkel seemed to take this as an implied threat that the U.S commitment to defend Europe from a Russia with one-tenth of NATO-Europe’s GDP may be contingent and may have a time limit on it. Moreover, France, Britain and Germany appear far more solidly committed to the Iran nuclear deal than are Trump and Congress. A U.S.-NATO collision could come here, and soon. The Iranians have signed on to purchase 100 Airbus aircraft and 80 commercial airliners from Boeing. If the Republicans impose new sanctions on Iran, or scupper the Boeing deal, Europe would have to decide whether to abandon the Airbus sales, or deliver the planes and perhaps take over the Boeing contract. That could bring a crisis. And any U.S. confrontation with Iran, pressed upon us by Saudis, Israelis and Sunni Arabs could find Europeans bailing out wholesale on the next U.S. war in the Middle East. Trump also seems less committed to the sanctions on Russia for its reannexation of Ukraine and support of pro-Russian rebels in the Donbass than does NATO Europe or Congress. From his rough remarks, Trump sees the Europeans as freeloaders on U.S. defense, laggards on their NATO contributions and mercantilists who craft policies to run endless trade surpluses at our expense, especially the Germans who are “bad, very bad.” The European half of Trump’s trip should be taken as a fire-bell-in-the-night warning: Shape up, Europe, or you may find yourselves on your own when it comes to the defense of your continent. For we Americans have had about enough.

Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 29 May, 2017, 17:30 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Aircraft Tire Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global aircraft tire market to grow at a CAGR of 4.75% during the period 2017-2021. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global aircraft tire market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated in the overall market from the procurement of new tires (for new aircraft) as well as the retreading or replacement of existing tires. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is emergence of green aircraft taxiing systems. Aircraft taxiing involves the movement of aircraft on the ground under its own engine power, which burns a significant amount of fuel. An Airbus A320 aircraft uses approximately 600 liters of fuel while taxiing for an average of 3.5 hours a day. This has necessitated the adoption of alternative approaches for taxiing an aircraft. A number of stakeholders have directed their efforts in developing alternative hybrid or electrically driven approaches to mitigate the excessive fuel consumption and emission impact during taxiing aircraft. According to the report, one driver in market is rise in aircraft retrofitting. There are many aircraft that have been in service for a long time across the globe. These aircraft require periodic component retrofitting for optimal functioning. Landing gear components, including tires and braking systems, need periodical replacements to keep an aircraft in optimum working condition, as well as to enhance the operational efficiency of aircraft landing gear systems. Retrofitting of landing gears would play greater importance in the growth of the global aircraft tire market, especially for the radial tires segment. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is dominance of OEMs and landing gear suppliers in dictating contract conditions. The high bargaining power of any single stakeholder is not a positive sign for any industry. Boeing and Airbus being the two major streamlined aircraft OEMs retain supremacy on finalizing the prices of aircraft tires for their respective aircraft. Also, major landing gear suppliers, such as General Electric (GE) and United Technologies Corporation (UTC), exercise control over structuring the overall features and prices of landing gear systems, which include tires along with other components.  Key vendors Bridgestone Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Michelin Aircraft Tyre Key Topics Covered: Part 01: Executive summary Part 02: Scope of the report Part 03: Market research methodology Part 04: Introduction Part 05: Market landscape Part 06: Market segmentation by tire type Part 07: Market segmentation by end-user Part 08: Geographical segmentation Part 09: Market drivers Part 10: Impact of drivers Part 11: Market challenges Part 12: Impact of drivers and challenges Part 13: Market trends Part 14: Vendor landscape Part 15: Appendix For more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/z3qx8v/global_aircraft Media Contact: Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716   SOURCE Research and Markets Related Links http://www.researchandmarkets.com 29 May, 2017, 17:40 BST Preview: Research and Markets - Global Western Blotting (Gel Electrophoresis, Blotting Systems, Imagers, Consumables) Market 2014-2017 & 2025: Focus on Biomedical & Biochemical Research & Disease Diagnostics 29 May, 2017, 17:20 BST Preview: Research and Markets - Renal Cluster Drug Development Pipeline Review 2017 - Key Companies are Angion Biomedica, Apceth Biopharma, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Evotec, Novartis, Sarfez Pharmaceuticals & Vidasym My News Release contains wide tables.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Lockheed Wins $44M Navy Deal for Trident II Support Services Shutterstock photo Lockheed Martin Corp. ‚s LMT business unit, Space Systems Co., has won a modification contract from the U.S. Navy to offer support services for the production of Trident II (D5) missile and D5 deployed systems. Contract Details The contract is valued at $43.9 million. It was awarded by Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Work is scheduled to be complete by Sep 30, 2017. The majority of the work will be performed in Sunnyvale, CA, while the rest will be executed in Cape Canaveral, FL and other locations across the U.S. The contract will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds. A Brief Note on Trident II (D5) Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of the Navy’s submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines. These missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) and armed with thermonuclear warheads. What’s Favoring Lockheed? Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems Co. is the prime contractor of the Navy’s Trident missile. The company also supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed. In Sep 2016, the Navy had launched an unarmed Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, following which the company announced that it is building on a 60-year partnership with the Navy. The declaration was made to ensure that the missile system remains capable for decades ahead through the company’s shared robust flight test plan. Naturally, the latest contract is expected to boost the company’s business substantially.  It may even attract more of such contracts in the future, given that Trident II (D5) has one of the top priorities in the U.S. Navy’s missile system. Price Movement Lockheed Martin’s stock was up about 17.5% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace/Defense industry’s gain of 25.7%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. We believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. Furthermore, the stock’s performance lagged compared with that of Boeing Co. BA , General Dynamics Corp. GD and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. HII , which surpassed the industry mark. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside? Today’s investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator. In addition, I invite you to consider our long-term opportunities.

Pence, joined by his wife, Second Lady Karen Pence, and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, hosted Project Hero at the Vice President’s residence before the bikers began their route from Washington D.C. to Virginia Beach. “It’s written if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect,” Pence said behind a vice presidential podium. “This is a day we remember those who serve and did not come home — and to be able to welcome you heroes here, all of you, who have worn the uniform of the United States, and some law enforcement, and have borne the burdens that come with that service.” Pence added: “To be able to welcome you here on the most hallow of days is profoundly humbling to Karen and I.” Project Hero is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to helping veterans and first responders affected by posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and injury achieve rehabilitation, recovery and resilience in their daily lives. The organization’s Memorial Day bike ride, “2017 Unitedhealthcare Memorial Challenge,” was presented by Boeing. “Karen and I are jealous — we’re bikers! We’d love to ride with you,” said Pence, greeted by laughter and applause. “Especially the first five miles that are all downhill.” Pence touted President Trump’s “extraordinary” first overseas trip as commander-in-chief, and the administration’s dedication to veterans and military men and women, and cited a statistic that more than 1 in 5 veterans have PTSD. “It’s Memorial Day 2017 — their duty was to serve, our duty is to remember,” Pence said. “It is the greatest privilege of my life to be the vice president to a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and veterans of the United States —  Donald Trump.” Pence also thanked Shulkin for his efforts in “fighting tirelessly” to give the veterans of the United States the “healthcare they’ve earned, and deserve, in uniform,”  and noted an executive order signed by President Trump last month dedicated to improving accountability within the Department of Veterans Affairs. “We wish you Godspeed and safe travels all the way to Virginia Beach, and Project Hero, all the way to a full recovery in an America that cherishes all who serve,” Pence said. Second Lady Karen Pence delivered a prayer to the bikers, and joked: “Don’t forget all these oranges and bananas before you leave!”  Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

Atir Khan  | Edited by Nikhil Agarwal  Follow @atirwkhan   atir.khan@aajtak.com New Delhi, May 29, 2017 | UPDATED 19:59 IST A +A - Highlights 1 Affairs of the civil aviation ministry during UPA will be probed 2 FIRs filed on purchase of 111 aircrafts and leasing of places 3 A CAG report had pointed out irregularities The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary enquiry to probe irregularities in the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. The CBI has alleged that the merger of the two government-owned airlines caused losses of thousands of crores of rupees. Three first information reports (FIRs) to enquire about the purchase of 111 aircrafts, leasing of planes and the giving up of profit-making routes by Air India have also been filed. The agency will also probe affairs of the civil aviation ministry during the earlier UPA regime. Issues include purchase of 50 Boeing aircraft for Air India and handing over of lucrative international airline routes to private airlines. Agency sources said the cases are built around a CAG report submitted to the Parliament in 2011 and later to Parliamentary Accounts Committee. Both reports pointed out irregularities in the acquisition process which may have led to losses. Earlier this year the Supreme Court had also asked the CBI to complete the probe by June.

HON – for the management and operations of Sandia National Laboratories. This, along with contract wins like the aforementioned ones, tends to bolster the service volume for the company, which, in turn, is expected to boost its growth trajectory, going ahead. Price Performance Northrop’s stock has gained 19.9% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 25.7%. This could be due to higher operating expenses continuing to partially impact Northrop’s profit margin. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment, customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which remains a major concern. Northrop faces tough competition from rivals like The Boeing Company BA and General Dynamics Corp. GD , both of which outperformed the broader industry’s gain in the last one year.

Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases.

The Wall Street Journal.3:51 UP NEXT Justin Trudeau really didn’t want to talk about Donald Trump. After three days together at a pair of meetings in Europe, Trudeau spent a press conference bobbing, weaving and ducking questions from reporters about his U.S. counterpart. The barrage of media queries came as the 43rd Group of Seven summit in Sicily ended with the U.S. president as an outlier. The final meeting communique had all leaders except Trump back the Paris climate accord and added new caveats aimed at appeasing the U.S. -- thanks in part to diplomacy and deft editing by Canada. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 190.23 +2.91 +1.55% Bombardier Inc BBD.A ▲ 2.62 +0.09 +3.56% AdChoices But while Germany’s Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron of France showed signs of frustration with the U.S. and Trump, Trudeau put on a happy face. He’s intent on playing peacemaker while confronting a growing list of disputes with his top trade partner in areas such as lumber, dairy and aerospace. And, given the dependence that Canada has on trade with its southern neighbor, he has a lot to lose. “I’m not going to lecture another country on what they should do, nor will I have my position determined by anyone outside of Canada,” Trudeau said when asked about Trump at a press conference Saturday in the seaside town of Taormina, Italy. “We share a very similar approach on a broad range of issues.” Trump officially set the table for new talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement when he notified Congress on May 18 that he intends to start renegotiating the 23-year-old deal binding the U.S., Canada and Mexico in 90 days. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland joined Trudeau at the G-7 and said Canada would be focused on finding “common ground” with the U.S. on trade. Lumber Dispute In a 30-minute bilateral meeting on Saturday, Trump and Trudeau discussed trade but not Nafta specifically, said a Canadian government official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The Congressional notice period prevents Trump from discussing Nafta with Canadian and Mexico officials. Instead, the pair talked about softwood lumber, steel, aluminum and aerospace. In the latter case, Trudeau’s government is threatening to back out of a planned purchase of Boeing Co. fighter jets because of a trade case pending against Canada’s Bombardier Inc. Load Error Trump said in a Twitter post on Saturday, not long after meeting with Trudeau, that he’d “take major action if necessary” as his Commerce Department reviews whether steel and aluminum imports threaten national security. Through it all, Trudeau espoused a positive view of Trump. “We know that creating growth through trade in ways that benefits all our citizens is a priority we share,” Trudeau told reporters. “The approach that we need to strike fair, free, open, balanced trade is something we all share around the table.” ‘Fight Protectionism’ While the summit face-time yielded little on Nafta, it underscored Trump’s position -- and hinted at a change. The U.S. initially bristled at the inclusion of a pledge to oppose protectionism in the G-7’s joint release. Ultimately, though, the communique had leaders committing to “keep our markets open and to fight protectionism, while standing firm against all unfair trade practices.” Reflecting Trump’s view of the U.S. as the loser in many trade deals, it also noted that “trade has not always worked to the benefit of everyone.” The path forward for Trudeau is risky because no G-20 country does a larger share of its trade with the U.S. than Canada. Trudeau is weighing restrictions on shipments of American coal through Canadian ports in response to U.S. tariffs placed on its lumber. Canada has also pledged to fight the lumber duties -- imposed as part of a long-running dispute -- in court. The lumber spat is shaping up to take years, and Nafta talks could stretch into 2018, when they could be snagged by U.S. midterm elections and Mexico’s presidential vote. With Europe frustrated by Trump and lengthy battles shaping up, Trudeau is sticking with a pair of mantras: Freeland’s hunt for “common ground,” which was also the title of Trudeau’s 2015 autobiography, and “sunny ways,” the 45-year-old leader’s quasi-slogan of optimism from his winning campaign that year. “There’s always opportunities to do more on trade, always opportunities to improve trade deals,” Trudeau said on Saturday. “And that’s very much what we’re focused on.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Thao said she will meet exchange officials in New York later this week. The plan for the 41 trillion-dong (RM7.7 billion) low-cost carrier comes amid the government’s easing of rules to allow more foreign investment in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets. Hanoi-based VietJet, known for a marketing stunt featuring bikini-clad service crew, received shareholder approval in April to boost its foreign ownership limit to 49 per cent from 30 per cent. “Listing overseas on big markets will help increase our access to more fund sources, boost the trading of our stock and expand the list of our investors,” said Thao, a self-made billionaire. “We don’t want to hide our hope to become the first Vietnamese company to list shares overseas.” Shares of VietJet rose 0.8 per cent to 127,800 dong at the close in Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest gain in more than two weeks. The stock has surged about 51 per cent since it started trading three months ago, compared with a 6.4 per cent increase in the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index. The overseas listing plan would make VietJet the first Vietnamese company to officially trade overseas, according to Tran Anh Dao, deputy chief executive of the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. While VietJet has done well in Vietnam, it faces tougher competition against entrenched players such as low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd, as well as Cathay Pacific’s regional unit, Cathay Dragon, as it expands in Asia, said Tyler Cheung, director of institutional clients at ACB Securities Co in Ho Chi Minh City. “They have been able to accomplish something impressive in a relatively small period of time,” Cheung said. “The question is whether their business model and corporate strategy can transfer to a regional play.” Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd doesn’t comment on individual companies, a spokeswoman said in an email. Singapore Exchange Ltd declined in an email to comment. VietJet, which began operating six years ago, has 136 foreign investors who own 26 per cent of the company, Thao, 46, said in April. She owns more than 60 per cent of the airline directly and through holding companies and other entities, according to filings. The increase in foreign ownership will need to be approved by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc because aviation is considered a restricted industry, with the limit currently capped at 30 per cent. The airline has filed paperwork requesting the increase, Thao said. Raising the limit isn’t aimed at attracting a strategic investor, although the company is open to one, she said. “We always wanted to be the pioneer,” Thao said. “We want to increase our stock value and to boost the ability to mobilise capital with more participation of investors.” Thao made her first million dollars at age 21 selling fax machines and latex rubber. Almost a quarter of a century later, the executive became Southeast Asia’s first self-made woman billionaire with the listing of VietJet. Purchase negotiations Thao engages in round-the-clock negotiations with plane and engine makers by herself, surviving on as little as three hours of sleep a night, said VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh. In May last year, she sealed an US$11.3 billion (RM48.3 billion) deal with Boeing Co to buy 100 737 Max 200 aircraft just in time to have it announced during then-President Barack Obama’s visit to Vietnam. The carrier agreed to buy 30 A320neos valued at US$3.6 billion at list price in 2015, adding to an order for as many as 100 Airbus planes a year earlier. The budget airline forecasts profit will rise 36 per cent this year from 2.5 trillion dong in 2016. VietJet expects to serve 17 million passengers this year, after carrying about 15 million travellers in 2016. Its biggest competitor is Vietnam Airlines. The national carrier owns 70 per cent of low-cost operator Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC, with Qantas Airways Ltd holding the remaining 30 per cent. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co, known as Vasco. VietJet and Vietnam Airlines each have a 42 per cent share of the domestic aviation, said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. VietJet’s share could rise to 50 per cent within three years, he said in April. “Vietnamese aviation is growing at a high rate,” Thao said. “When we open the door wider for foreign investors and create more opportunities for them, it also means we increase the chance for the local aviation industry and domestic stock market to expand and integrate faster into international aviation markets.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions World Bank still sees global growth picking up amid policy risks Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles VietJet Air launches Hanoi-Siem Reap route VietJet Air seeks to proceed with US$1.2b listing Music convergence between Michael Learns to Rock and Wonder Girls for Vietjet’s fifth anniversary VietJet opens more domestic and foreign routes Vietjet launches another zero-fare promotion Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

But while Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron showed signs of frustration with Trump -- the German chancellor said Sunday that Europe can no longer fully rely on the U.S. -- Trudeau put on a happy face. He’s intent on playing peacemaker while confronting a growing list of disputes with his top trade partner in areas such as lumber, dairy and aerospace. And, given the dependence that Canada has on its southern neighbor, he has a lot to lose. “I’m not going to lecture another country on what they should do, nor will I have my position determined by anyone outside of Canada,” Trudeau said when asked about Trump at a press conference Saturday in the seaside town of Taormina, Italy. “We share a very similar approach on a broad range of issues.” Trump officially set the table for new talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement when he notified Congress on May 18 that he intends to start renegotiating the 23-year-old deal binding the U.S., Canada and Mexico in 90 days.

Merkel, conversely, left the G-7 to declare that “the last few days” left her reassessing the reliability of the transatlantic relationship. “We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands,” she said. Macron, the newly elected French president, later described his knuckle-crushing handshake with Trump as a “moment of truth” designed to show he’s no pushover. ‘Fight Protectionism’ While the summit face-time yielded little on Nafta, it underscored Trump’s position -- and hinted at a change.

PUBLISHED : Monday, 29 May, 2017, 2:58pm UPDATED : Monday, 29 May, 2017, 5:20pm Comments:   May Chan Rhodes Share PrintEmail Related topics PolyU – THE Innovation & Impact Summit [Sponsored article] With a decades-long track record of working closely with the government and fostering professional skills in the private sector, technology know-how and scientific research, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has always been at the heart of the economic development in Hong Kong, as its alumni assume global leadership positions in various industries. “PolyU have trained over 400,000 graduates over the course of 80 years,” says Professor Philip Chan, deputy president and provost of the university. Its close partnership with the industry and the government goes back to 1937, when it started out as a government-funded vocational school. “Professional training, scientific research with an emphasis on application, and partnership with the public and business sectors have always been the cornerstones for PolyU,” says Chan. “We have been providing much-needed talents to various industries, including manufacturing, construction and engineering, transport and aviation, and more. We are better positioned than any other local university to understand what it takes to take Hong Kong’s economy to the next level.” In celebration of its 80th anniversary, PolyU is co-hosting the “Times Higher Education Innovation & Impact Summit” with the leading education publication. PolyU was ranked 17th in the latest Times Higher Education’s Asia University Rankings. The three-day summit, starting from the end of May, will feature global movers and shakers from higher-education, government, and business sectors, who will brainstorm ways to empower universities’ economic and social impact through innovative research and teaching. World-renowned leaders who will share insights include Charles Chen Yidan, founder of Yidan Prize and core founder of Tencent Holdings Limited; Hermann Hauser, co-founder of Amadeus Capital Partners; Candace Johnson, Founder/Co-Founder SES, Loral-Teleport Europe, Europe Online, VATM, GTWN, OWNSAT, Success Europe; and Greg Simon, Former executive director, White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. The Showcase in the summit will focus on four areas: space, aviation and railway, sustainable urban development, human-centred innovation, and hospitality. Aviation is one of the strategic highlights for PolyU in terms of research and innovation. Utilising its extensive network with world-class aircraft maintenance companies and factories, as well as its profound knowledge of the industry’s regional development thanks to its close links with the government and industry representatives, PolyU is playing a key role in elevating Hong Kong’s status as a regional aviation hub, particularly in terms of the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) of aircrafts. The school has also partnered with Boeing to setup an Aviation Services Research Centre (ASRC) to develop new or improved aviation service technologies and processes applicable to the industry. The ASRC business scope covers aviation service research, manpower development, and business information exchange. This is one of the best examples of how PolyU is pushing forward the transformation of Hong Kong into a knowledge-based economy. By working with world-class industry leaders in researching and developing new technology, industry standards and skills, Hong Kong is able to position itself as a global leader in the MRO industry. Apart from aviation, Chan says PolyU is also dedicating its inter-disciplinary effort in addressing social issues such as ageing population, and sustainable urbanisation. For example, combining the efforts and expertise of engineering, information technology, life sciences, medicine, and social science, the university is conducting new research in order to bring about a new era of “healthy, active ageing” where the elderly will receive sufficient and suitable support for their physical, mental and social well-being. The university is also contributing to the Hong Kong’s transformation into a smart city. For example, thanks to expertise in information technology, geo-informatics, construction and land surveying, PolyU staff and alumni have been heavily involved in the development of East Kowloon, looking into how to incorporate technology into facilities management and eco-friendly features. Such an interdisciplinary approach is reflective of the global trend in the higher education scene. “It’s clear that in the future, the creation of new knowledge will be cross-disciplinary in nature,” says Chan. “The traditional academic disciplines have already got decades, if not hundreds of years of history, where knowledge has been accumulated to a very deep level. It makes sense to look into how to make use of different schools of knowledge to create something new, instead of just digging deeper and deeper into a well-explored subject.” Another global trend in higher education is the increasingly close partnership between universities and start-ups. In a globally competitive economy, mega enterprises grow not only in scale, but also in the need for innovation. As a result, they look to universities as breeding grounds for new ideas. “University is a place where bright, eager young minds can innovate without the constraints and repercussion of the real world,” says Chan. “They can afford to do what mega enterprises cannot, try new ideas and fail. That is why they are interested in supporting start-up businesses on a university level, and are eager to look for potential partnerships or acquisitions of these businesses.” “We have already nurtured over 200 start-ups in the last few years, and 70 per cent are still sustainable,” he continues. “PolyU has been promoting start-ups by granting seed-funds to winning business proposals from alumni and undergraduates, and matching them with industry figures and private investors. It is a very concrete way of making an impact. Ideas are being turned into real businesses that make real contributions to the economy of Hong Kong, and even the world.” SCMP Today: Intl Edition Get updates direct to your inbox E-mail * By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy Thank youYou are on the list.   Most Popular Viewed 1 WannaCry hackers ‘were likely from southern China’ 2 Dead hiker’s three friends arrested over suspected murder 3 Overseas Chinese students caught between two worlds 4 How the QR code has forever changed China’s social habits 5 Revealed: the sneaky ways Chinese move money across the border Shared 1 How the QR code has forever changed China’s social habits 2 Overseas Chinese students caught between two worlds 3 WannaCry hackers ‘were likely from southern China’ 4 Dead hiker’s three friends arrested over suspected murder 5 Hong Kong’s Uber driver arrests show emptiness of innovation talk Commented 1 WannaCry hackers ‘were likely from southern China’ 2 Muslim group slams UK far-right party over sharing of MTR video 3 Everest conqueror rejects criticism for not helping dying climbers 4 Messy parking sparks call to regulate bike-share service 5 Why are so many young people falling for phone scams?

Thao said she will meet exchange officials in New York later this week. Vietjet founder Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao discusses a possible overseas listing and plans to develop long haul flights. Source: Bloomberg The plan for the 41 trillion-dong ($1.8 billion) low-cost carrier comes amid the government’s easing of rules to allow more foreign investment in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets. Hanoi-based VietJet, known for a marketing stunt featuring bikini-clad service crew, received shareholder approval in April to boost its foreign ownership limit to 49 percent from 30 percent. “Listing overseas on big markets will help increase our access to more fund sources, boost the trading of our stock and expand the list of our investors,” said Thao, a self-made billionaire. “We don’t want to hide our hope to become the first Vietnamese company to list shares overseas.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Shares of VietJet rose 0.8 percent to 127,800 dong at the close in Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest gain in more than two weeks. The stock has surged about 51 percent since it started trading three months ago, compared with a 6.4 percent increase in the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index. The overseas listing plan would make VietJet the first Vietnamese company to officially trade overseas, according to Tran Anh Dao, deputy chief executive of the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. While VietJet has done well in Vietnam, it faces tougher competition against entrenched players such as low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd., as well as Cathay Pacific’s regional unit, Cathay Dragon, as it expands in Asia, said Tyler Cheung, director of institutional clients at ACB Securities Co. in Ho Chi Minh City. “They have been able to accomplish something impressive in a relatively small period of time,” Cheung said. “The question is whether their business model and corporate strategy can transfer to a regional play.” Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. doesn’t comment on individual companies, a spokeswoman said in an email. Singapore Exchange Ltd. declined in an email to comment. VietJet, which began operating six years ago, has 136 foreign investors who own 26 percent of the company, Thao, 46, said in April. She owns more than 60 percent of the airline directly and through holding companies and other entities, according to filings. The increase in foreign ownership will need to be approved by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc because aviation is considered a restricted industry, with the limit currently capped at 30 percent. The airline has filed paperwork requesting the increase, Thao said. Raising the limit isn’t aimed at attracting a strategic investor, although the company is open to one, she said. “We always wanted to be the pioneer,” Thao said. “We want to increase our stock value and to boost the ability to mobilize capital with more participation of investors.” Thao made her first million dollars at age 21 selling fax machines and latex rubber. Almost a quarter of a century later, the executive became Southeast Asia’s first self-made woman billionaire with the listing of VietJet. Purchase Negotiations Thao engages in round-the-clock negotiations with plane and engine makers by herself, surviving on as little as three hours of sleep a night, said VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh. In May last year, she sealed an $11.3 billion deal with Boeing Co. to buy 100 737 Max 200 aircraft just in time to have it announced during then-President Barack Obama’s visit to Vietnam. The carrier agreed to buy 30 A320neos valued at $3.6 billion at list price in 2015, adding to an order for as many as 100 Airbus planes a year earlier. The budget airline forecasts profit will rise 36 percent this year from 2.5 trillion dong in 2016. VietJet expects to serve 17 million passengers this year, after carrying about 15 million travelers in 2016. Its biggest competitor is Vietnam Airlines. The national carrier owns 70 percent of low-cost operator Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC, with Qantas Airways Ltd. holding the remaining 30 percent. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co., known as Vasco. VietJet and Vietnam Airlines each have a 42 percent share of the domestic aviation, said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. VietJet’s share could rise to 50 percent within three years, he said in April. “Vietnamese aviation is growing at a high rate,” Thao said. “When we open the door wider for foreign investors and create more opportunities for them, it also means we increase the chance for the local aviation industry and domestic stock market to expand and integrate faster into international aviation markets.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. — Reuters ← Previous Why nuclear plants could become the next ‘fossil’ fuel UK defence minister denies report of divisions Next → You May Also Like Cyclone wreaks havoc in Bangladesh refugee camps 30/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Cyclone wreaks havoc in Bangladesh refugee camps Former Hong Kong leader Tsang gets 20-month jail for corruption 22/02/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Former Hong Kong leader Tsang gets 20-month jail for corruption Syria rebel fighters mount fierce defence of key Aleppo district 02/12/2016 Oman Observer Comments Off on Syria rebel fighters mount fierce defence of key Aleppo district Latest News 80 expat doctors to be replaced by Omanis 04/06/2017 Kabeer Yousuf Comments Off on 80 expat doctors to be replaced by Omanis Sultanate’s roads best among 5 in the world 04/06/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Sultanate’s roads best among 5 in the world Salalah gears up for khareef 04/06/2017 Kaushalendra Singh Comments Off on Salalah gears up for khareef London attackers kill seven, May says ‘enough is enough’ 04/06/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on London attackers kill seven, May says ‘enough is enough’ Facebook Twitter Instagram Load More...

Beavers, the two-time defending champion, shot a 3-under-par 69 Sunday at Harbour Pointe Golf Club to remain in the lead after two rounds of the Snohomish County Amateur at 5-under. But Casto had the low score of the day, shooting a blistering 4-under-par 68, and trails Beavers by a single stroke going into Monday’s final round. “I played pretty well,” Casto, a Snohomish native who turned 20 Saturday, said. “I kept it in play all day, which was good, and then just made a couple putts.” Casto, a freshman at Western Washington University, was one of three members of the Vikings team to sign up for the tournament at the last minute. Western played at the NCAA Division II men’s golf championships earlier this week, and had things gone to plan, Casto wouldn’t have entered the County Am as the Vikings would have been competing for a national title Friday in Kissimmee, Florida. But Western didn’t make the final eight, meaning Casto was able to make it back in time for Saturday’s opening round at Legion Memorial Golf Course, where he shot an even-par 72. Casto, who’s playing in his first County Am, followed that up Sunday by setting a pace at Harbour Pointe no one else was able to match. Playing in the day’s first group, Casto registered five birdies and just a single bogey in what he described as a consistent performance. His birdie at the 513-yard, par-5 18th hole — where he just missed the green in two — was what gave him the day’s low round. “Yesterday I felt like I played terrible,” Casto said. “Today I felt like I played really well. I think this golf course is harder than Legion, so the score is a lot better.” Casto could have an insider’s advantage Monday. Snohomish Golf Course, the site of the final round, is his home course. But Casto may need all the home-course advantage he can muster to overcome Beavers, who’s taken quite a liking to the County Am. Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer from Seattle, won the tournament the only two previous times he entered, and he has a chance to become just the second player ever to win three straight County Ams, joining Bob Burton from 1973-75. Sunday was just another good day at the office for Beavers. Beavers, who came into the day with a two-stroke lead after shooting a 2-under 70 at Legion Memorial, made six birdies en route to his 69. It was a birdie at 18 that gave Beavers the lead heading into the final round. “Today I was conservative the majority of the day, but I felt like my course management was exceptional today,” Beavers said. “Yesterday it was more like you can hit it and find it and hit it again. This golf course won’t let you do that so much, you’ve got to hit the fairways. Even if you have a 7-iron into the green, it’s better doing that from the fairway than taking your chances with the driver. So I think I played well today, I really did.” For the second straight day Beavers had to overcome some early adversity. He double-bogeyed the fifth hole and bogeyed the sixth. But he bounced back with a birdie on seven to get his round back on course. He was 4-under over his final 12 holes. “It kind of got me back into things,” Beavers said of the seventh hole. “I actually made a long putt there, about 30 feet. It was just like, ‘Phew, all right, let’s keep going.’” Alvin Kwak shot a 2-under 70, putting him at 2-under for the tournament and alone in third place. The 16-year-old Mukilteo resident and sophomore at Kamiak High School will round out Monday’s final threesome, which is scheduled to tee off at 10:54 a.m. “I played really well,” said Kwak, who finished with six birdies and four bogeys. “I wasn’t putting as well as yesterday, so I could have gone a lot lower. But still I can’t complain about 70.” Chris Hatch of Mukilteo, Casto’s Western teammate, and Jacob Rohde of Everett were the only other players under par for the tournament. Both shot 71s Sunday and are tied for fourth at 1-under.   The first grouping of the day putt Sunday morning during the second round of the Snohomish County Amateur Golf Tournament on May 28, 2017.

It was being too clever by half. First things first: Donald Trump didn’t reveal the location of U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines in his phone call with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Trump comes off as a braggart and bully in the transcript, but what he said about submarines is far less interesting than our reaction to it. It’s clear that whatever signal Trump was trying to send got fouled up. But that shouldn’t make us angry about the Trump administration’s clumsiness. It should make us wary about the overconfidence of all policymakers who think they can use the deployment of military forces to signal resolve to adversaries and allies without getting the rest of us killed. Trump did say a fair number of awful and stupid things to Duterte. He told him that his campaign of extrajudicial executions was working (it isn’t) and that North Korea’s missiles are crashing (they aren’t). But on the subject of submarines, Trump is blameless. Here is what he said in reference to North Korea: We have a lot of firepower over there. We have two submarines — the best in the world. We have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all. It is entirely unclear where Trump thinks “over there” is, but in recent days U.S. Pacific Command had announced two port calls for nuclear-powered submarines, one in South Korea and another in Japan. USS #Michigan, one of #USNavy's four Ohio-class Guided Missile Submarines (SSGN), makes a port visit to Busan, #SouthKorea. pic.twitter.com/opmkvZLwut — U.S. Pacific Command (@PacificCommand) April 25, 2017 USS #Cheyenne arrives in Japan; @PacificSubs’ port visits demonstrate #USNavy commitment to our regional allies. https://t.co/wIvccqDxua pic.twitter.com/csaGUNhaSC — U.S. Pacific Command (@PacificCommand) May 4, 2017 But then someone in the Defense Department freaked out. Three someones, actually. “We never talk about subs!” three anonymous officials told Nancy Youssef of BuzzFeed News. Oh, you don’t? Then maybe someone should tell the Navy — because it blabbers on and on about submarines. Contrary to the exclamations of the three anonymous officials, the Navy releases this kind of information all the time. Submarine Force Pacific even has a webpage on which it publicizes submarine port calls, including the two Trump referenced, as a matter of routine. I counted 20 announced port calls in Japan and South Korea alone in 2016 — plus additional calls in Singapore and Australia, among other locales. Last I checked, 20 a year is more than “never.” This is not surprising. Forward-deployed military forces, like a doomsday device, don’t provide much deterrence if you keep them secret. And, frankly, how secret is a 6,000-ton nuclear-powered submarine sidling up dockside and unleashing more than a hundred sailors on port call? (Like how I kept that G-rated?) Some of the reaction to Trump’s alleged indiscretion is a product of partisanship run amok — a kind of lefty version of the asinine “Hillary revealed nuclear launch procedures!” nonsense that sent Republicans into spasms of stupidity. But it’s important to remember that some of the reaction is probably also by design. Even before anyone knew about Trump’s phone call, U.S. Pacific Command was tweeting pictures and giving interviews about the submarines, explicitly stating that such port visits “demonstrate [the Navy’s] commitment to our regional allies.” Trump may have been showing off or hoping Duterte would pass the message along to Kim Jong Un. Either way, Trump wanted a reaction. Just not quite the one he got. Still, the reaction to Trump’s comments reveals a broader gullibility about how we collectively respond to the government’s public messaging about military deployments. As someone who studies nuclear weapons — and is deeply skeptical about using military forces to send messages to adversaries — the reaction to this nuclear submarine story is a cautionary tale. After all, ship deployments are planned long in advance, and these two submarines are probably no exception. The Navy keeps a schedule for deployments that takes into account crew rotations, needs for maintenance, and so on. While there is flexibility within that schedule, port calls at places like Busan and Sasebo aren’t usually a spur of the moment event. The U.S. military is conducting an enormous number of military exercises and operations around the world at any given moment. Instead of dramatically changing carefully planned schedules to chase one crisis or another, someone (more often than not, the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center in San Antonio) looks at the list of exercises, ponders the global situation, and decides how to “frame” existing deployments and exercises in terms of current events to send the right signal to adversaries and allies. And reporters eat it up. This year, the United States conducted a long-planned Minuteman III launch out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The headlines — “U.S. Test Fires Boeing’s $40M Missile in Message to North Korea” — predictably framed the test as a message to Kim Jong Un. Every reporter with whom I spoke about that event started by asking that same question. I responded by pointing out that Minuteman launches are scheduled 3-5 years in advance — long before the current crisis began — and the planning for a launch can take a year. But this time, they overdid it. The United States conducted a second Minuteman test a few days later, and, for whatever reason, the Air Force didn’t like the idea that two intercontinental ballistic missiles had been tested in a single week as a warning to North Korea. Officials dutifully explained to reporters that it was a coincidence that the two tests were so close to each other — the first test had long planned, while the other had been delayed from the fall due to a wildfire. None of which changed the headlines spurred by the initial “framing” of the initial launch. But that raises the question of why the public hasn’t learned its lesson. Why do we consistently fall for spin? The answer is that human beings have a bad habit of inferring causation from correlation. And so a missile test planned months ago can be sold as a response to events from last week, even though that is patently absurd. Similarly, the regular series of port calls by U.S. submarines in South Korea and Japan can be explained as an extraordinary response to a crisis. The funny thing is, there just isn’t much reason to think that these signals make much of a strategic difference beyond winning mostly friendly headlines. Defense experts, policymakers, and military officials are all confident that they can message like this effectively to deter adversaries and reassure allies. But I think the misreading of Trump’s remarks suggests that they aren’t nearly as good at messaging as they think. This is the second time that the Trump administration has clumsily tried to use naval forces to send a message to Kim Jong Un. And, like the public messaging about a change to the deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, it was a fiasco. The Barack Obama administration wasn’t much better. It fell in love with bomber overflights. In 2013, the Pentagon flew two B-2 bombers to South Korea. It was so pleased with this signal that it did a B-52 flight in January 2016. And then a B-1 in September. The Defense Department was doing so many bomber flights that South Korea proposed a permanent rotation of bombers and other assets. There was another bomber overflight in May — not that anyone noticed. It’s not surprising that these signals have little effect. The academic literature on signaling is too complicated to fairly represent in a few paragraphs, but a basic point is that fundamental capabilities and interests tend to matter more to crisis outcomes than bluffing. To the extent that signals matter, they need to be costly to the one sending them. And my own observation is that the best stories told by practitioners about great moments in the history of nuclear signaling usually turn out to be based on fairly tendentious interpretations of historical events. It would be nice to subject policymakers to the same data-driven scrutiny that has suggested that other traditional by-the-gut actors, like baseball managers or campaign gurus, tend to overstate their own impact on events. There is no reason to think the Trump administration is any more adroit at using military deployments to send signals than more competent White Houses. Which raises a thought — how about we stop trying to signal with forces and use words instead? We have diplomats, led by a secretary of state who I have been assured is still alive. So rather than pointing to a submarine, missile, or bomber, how about we simply say what we mean?

RwandAir launches its first direct flight to Europe The airline will fly to London three times a week and is expected to boost tourism and trade between the UK and Rwanda. FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE CYPRUS� Rwanda's national airline RwandAir has launched first direct commercial flight to Gatwick International Airport, London's second busiest airport. The airline's flight took off from Kigali International Airport on Friday afternoon en route to Gatwick International Airport, adding it to its network of 22 destinations worldwide. The new route will be operated by recently acquired brand new Airbus A330 aircraft that boasts of in-flight connectivity. The airline will fly to London three times a week and is expected to boost tourism and trade between the UK and Rwanda. Speaking to reporters shortly after launching London flight destination, the airline's deputy chief executive officer in charge of corporate affairs, Yvonne Manzi Makolo said that the airline has embarked on expanding its wings to far destinations in order to serve a large clientele of travellers to visit Rwanda. "It's great step for our country, because it will bring us closer to our trade partners and sources of tourists. Rwanda will be making a big impact as a must-visit country," she added. Last year, the airline acquired its first A330-200 and A330-300 Airbus planes, boosting its fleet to 11 aircraft and capacity to compete globally. It is also scheduled to take delivery of another brand new Boeing before end of May. This direct seamless long-haul flight is an important milestone towards improving trade relations between Rwanda, the European continent. RwandAir carried more than 650,000 passengers last year and projects to transport over three million in the next five years. The Rwanda aviation industry which has become one of the largest and most profitable airlines in East Africa has continued to spread wings across Africa and beyond. The airline has been growing at an average of 20 percent in the last six years and is currently positioning itself as the most efficient and reliable airline in the region, according to figures from the Rwanda's ministry of infrastructure. The airline has 11 aircraft and expects delivery of the 12th, a Boeing 737-800, in May. � (Xinhua) Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

Quora Contributor Newsweek 27 May 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Quora Questions are part of a partnership between Newsweek and Quora, through which we'll be posting relevant and interesting answers from Quora contributors throughout the week. Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Nicolas Nelson, advocate for human space development: Will we have landed on Mars in the coming 50 years? Trending: Donald Trump's Twitter Has Been Unusually Quiet, But Will It Last? It depends on five distinct entities that could lead the way and accomplish that goal. Each one has lots of supporters and certainly a number of detractors and resistance to overcome. The first three are government agencies: NASA, CNSA (Chinese National Space Agency), and ESA (European Space Agency). Fifty years is a long time: long enough for any of these slow-moving but highly capable agencies, each with human spaceflight capability (well, ESA is working on it, but it's only a matter of time now, and you're offering fifty years) to scale up to a human mission to Mars. They might even cooperate with one another or with other space agencies (Roscosmos is not going to take the lead but is an obviously strong partner; ISRO a less obvious but highly desirable one; there are plenty of others). nasa mars magnetic shield radiationMore The planet Mars is shown May 12, 2016, in this NASA Hubble Space Telescope when it was 50 million miles from Earth. NASA/Handout via Reuters Don't miss: Two Men Killed Trying to Stop Anti-Muslim Rant on Oregon Train The next two are private firms, SpaceX and Blue Origin, inspired and driven by their visionary owners/leaders Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Either of these firms could send a human mission to Mars long before any space agency can, if they want to do so and are not constrained by finances. Jeff Bezos has lots more money than Elon Musk, but Bezos is content to play the slow-and-steady turtle when folks talk of a “race” to Mars. His focus is on cislunar space development first, then Mars when the cislunar infrastructure is in place, at least to some degree. Elon Musk burns with a passion to colonize Mars (yay!) but he also isn't concerned with any sort of “race” to Mars. He'd be delighted to see others get to Mars first, and has openly said so, if only “others” would hurry up and get busy. But he faces financial constraints that slow down his R&D and rocket building efforts. Musk doesn't seem too concerned with cislunar space infrastructure, his plans are more similar to a Martin Marietta “Mars Direct” style of mission, pushing very quickly past “explore and do science” missions into full-steam settlement mode. But he's taking financial risks to do so, risks that may not pan out. If Tesla or the Gigafactory or the Boring Company flop badly, any one of them could pull all the others down, including SpaceX. The fate of rapid Mars exploration and colonization might rest on whether Tesla’s new trucks sell well in 2018! (Okay, maybe not quite that delicate a financial position, but you get the idea.) Most popular: As President Trump Returns to U.S., Efforts to Counter Russia Probe Fallout Intensify So: fifty years from now, Elon Musk will have sent humans to Mars or died/gone bankrupt in the attempt. If all goes well for SpaceX, they will have a crew of humans on the Red Planet in just ten or twelve years… but there's a lot that can delay this. Fifty years from now, if Elon has failed somehow, Jeff Bezos will have sent humans to Mars, but only recently, and all in good time. Thirty or forty years is about right, I imagine. Fifty years from now, a NASA/Boeing human mission may have visited Mars two or three times over a span of six years, left flags and footprints, taken a ton or two of geologic samples, and declared it all a success and gone home to Earth, all depending entirely on the notoriously fickle will of the American Congress and constantly-changing presidential administrations. Can this happen? Oh certainly. Is it likely? Certainly not. Read More Same goes for the ESA and the CNSA: assuming a sustained political will, and diplomatic success in both foreign policy and scientific cooperation, there's no reason either of them (plus any partner they recruit, optionally) could not send a human mission or two to Mars. But so many factors conspire against it, the likelihood is low, in the current geopolitical climate. Just one serious war or threat of imminent war could derail it for another fifty years.

DoD photo Posted By: Richard Sisk May 29, 2017 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis finally has a financial officer to fill the comptroller’s spot at the Pentagon, but dozens of political appointee slots remain vacant four months into the administration of President Donald Trump. The Senate on Thursday confirmed David Norquist, the former chief financial officer for the Department of Homeland Security and the brother of anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, as comptroller. In his confirmation hearings, Norquist, a former partner at financial services contractor Kearney & Co. in Virginia, pledged to finally get an audit going at the Defense Department, which has never had one. “Everything you have heard about the size and complexity of the department is true,” Norquist said, “but that is not a reason to delay the audit. That is a reason to begin.” By unanimous consent, the Senate also confirmed Robert Story Karem as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and Kari Bingen as principal deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence. Bingen has served in several congressional staff positions, and most recently was policy director for the House Armed Services Committee. Karem has worked as a Middle East adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney and a legislative aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). Three more nominees — Elaine McCusker to be deputy comptroller; Robert Daigle to be director of the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office; and Kenneth Rapuano for assistant secretary of defense for homeland and global security — have been approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee but still await a vote by the full Senate. The Pentagon has more than 50 slots for political nominations by Trump requiring Senate confirmation. The confirmations of Norquist, Karem and Bingen appears to bring the total number of political appointments at DoD thus far to five, counting Mattis and new Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. The posts of Army secretary and Navy secretary remain open, and the No. 2 position at the Pentagon is still held by Deputy Secretary Bob Work, an Obama administration holdover. Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan has been named by Mattis to replace Work, but he has yet to be formally nominated by the White House more than two months after his name was announced. Work had expected to leave the post this month. Previous post Next post About the Author Richard Sisk Richard Sisk is a reporter for Military.com. He can be reached at richard.sisk@military.com.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Aircraft Tire Market 2017-2021 with Bridgestone, Dunlop Aircraft Tyres, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company & Michelin Aircraft Tyre Dominating – Research and Markets DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „Global Aircraft Tire Market 2017-2021” report to their offering. The global aircraft tire market to grow at a CAGR of 4.75% during the period 2017-2021. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global aircraft tire market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated in the overall market from the procurement of new tires (for new aircraft) as well as the retreading or replacement of existing tires. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is emergence of green aircraft taxiing systems. Aircraft taxiing involves the movement of aircraft on the ground under its own engine power, which burns a significant amount of fuel. An Airbus A320 aircraft uses approximately 600 liters of fuel while taxiing for an average of 3.5 hours a day. This has necessitated the adoption of alternative approaches for taxiing an aircraft. A number of stakeholders have directed their efforts in developing alternative hybrid or electrically driven approaches to mitigate the excessive fuel consumption and emission impact during taxiing aircraft. According to the report, one driver in market is rise in aircraft retrofitting. There are many aircraft that have been in service for a long time across the globe. These aircraft require periodic component retrofitting for optimal functioning. Landing gear components, including tires and braking systems, need periodical replacements to keep an aircraft in optimum working condition, as well as to enhance the operational efficiency of aircraft landing gear systems. Retrofitting of landing gears would play greater importance in the growth of the global aircraft tire market, especially for the radial tires segment. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is dominance of OEMs and landing gear suppliers in dictating contract conditions. The high bargaining power of any single stakeholder is not a positive sign for any industry. Boeing and Airbus being the two major streamlined aircraft OEMs retain supremacy on finalizing the prices of aircraft tires for their respective aircraft. Also, major landing gear suppliers, such as General Electric (GE) and United Technologies Corporation (UTC), exercise control over structuring the overall features and prices of landing gear systems, which include tires along with other components.  Key vendors Key Topics Covered: Media Contact: Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior Manager press@researchandmarkets.com   SOURCE Research and Markets CategoriesUncategorized TagsSurveys, Polls and Research Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Infrared Search & Track (IRST) System Market Worth 5.95 Billion USD by 2022 Next PostNext Refrigerant Compressors Market will grow at a CAGR of 4.92% till 2021: Radiant Insights Search Recent Posts Ion Exchange Resins Market expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% from 2016 – 2026 Asia-Pacific STV Stevia Market Research Report 2017 to 2022 Global Methionine Market Analysis- Size, Share, overview, scope, Revenue, Gross Margin, Segment and Forecast 2017 IBM Research Alliance Builds New Transistor for 5nm Technology Mobile Phone Accessories Market will reach at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2015 to 2025 Business Directory Business Contacts Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Proudly powered by WordPress

It Took Two Days for Mainstream Media to Post Big Stories About Portland Attack and the Suspect, Who Is a Known White Supremacist: The incident happened on Friday afternoon—two men were killed by a man who was yelling racist slurs at two teenage girls, one of whom wore a hajib, on a Portland MAX train. The man charged with the murders, Jeremy Christian, is a known white supremacist. But mainstream news said very little about the incident on Friday, buried the story at the bottom of their pages on Saturday and much of Sunday. Only on Sunday night, did the incident (which has the appearance of white supremacist terrorism) rise to the top of their pages. And one suspects that a much-retweeted tweet by Dan Rather, the former news anchor for the CBS Evening News, had something to do with this increased coverage and a response from the White House, which was tweeted this morning. Dan Rather to Trump: Say their names. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Ricky John Best were stabbed death not by a Muslim but a man yelling at a Muslim teenager and her black American friend. The third person stabbed by the terrorist, Micah Fletcher, is a poet who won in 2013 a poetry competition with a "poem condemning Islamophobia."

The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are w/ them. — President Trump (@POTUS) May 29, 2017 This Memorial Day: I will honour Rick Best, an Army veteran who was killed by a man threatening two teens, one of whom is Destinee Mangum, a black American. Rick Best was an Army veteran, father of 4. He died defending teens from a racist tirade.

He had no idea what hit him. It was a speeding pickup truck. It struck him with all its force, destroyed his body, and did not stop. The young man died on the spot. Witnesses believe the driver attended the party and deliberately killed their friend. KOMO reports that the mother of the dead man wants justice. Bullets Fly In Pioneer Square: The incident happened near the entry of the Pioneer Square Station at around 11 p.m.. A fight broke out. A car sped away. But the car returned a moment later, and two people on the sidewalk fired at it. The police arrived and found 24 bullet casings on the street and sidewalk. 24! They also found a person bleeding to death in a car. This person was taken to Harborview Medical Center, where another person suffering from bullet wounds appeared and received treatment. Both are expected to survive. KOMO reports that one suspect is in custody and two are "on the loose." Tourists Say Seattle Is Too Expensive: My Northwest reports that a travelers survey conducted by JD Power found that people visiting Seattle just to see the city, found "lodging, parking, transportation, entertainment, and activities are too expensive." The wonder is someone would visit our city just to see it. There is, too be honest, nothing to really see here. New York City, New Orleans, Los Angeles—these are places to see. Trump Claims in a Tweet That Trumpcare Will Put More Money Into Healthcare: The neo-Keynesian economist and NYT columnist Paul Krugman is under the impression that Trump does not know that Trumpcare will take nearly $1 trillion out of the system. But he does know this. He knows it very well. He is just lying, and nothing more. He has lied before and he will lie again. Saying he is in a muddle only makes matters worse. The US Considering Banning Laptops From All Incoming and Outgoing International Flights: The laptop ban, which is nothing but cruel, is currently imposed on nonstop US-bound flights from airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries. As to why international flights are more vulnerable than domestic ones—this is not explained. Also, the current ban and its possible expansion is not responding to any specific threat but a hunch. Boeing Took $242 million From Poor People in the State of Washington And Gave It to Its Shareholders: That's the right way of looking at it. The wrong way is found in this Seattle Times headline: "Aerospace tax incentives saved Boeing $242 million last year."

"On the MC-21 plane, we proceed from the fact that we will offer a full-cycle contract: from delivery to the utilization of the machine itself. And of course in terms of its performance characteristics, it is now ahead of its competitors, both Boeing and Airbus," Rogozin said adding that the aircraft price will be more competitive than the one for the European or US analogues. According to the deputy prime minister, the flight trials of MC-21 are to be completed in 2018. "We have now moved to the second stage of the flight tests of the PD-14 engine. Since spring 2019, the Russian engine PD-14 will be used in the aircraft," Rogozin announced, adding that the tests of the engine are carried out with the use of Ilyushin Il-76 flying simulator in the town of Zhukovskiy in the Moscow Region. Medvedev, in turn, noted that the new models of airplanes and helicopters should be developed in Russia. Apart from the MC-21 aircraft test, the maiden flight of Ka-62 helicopter was also successful, the prime minister noted. "It is necessary to assess what had happened and work further across the board. Of course, first of all, [the work should be carried out] in the technological direction now. But do not forget the commercial prospects. Because, the more orders we will receive for these new vehicles, the better, of course, for our country," Medvedev stressed. The MC-21 is a twin-engine medium-haul airliner with a capacity of 150-212 passengers. The presentation of the aircraft took place in June 2016 in the Russian city of Irkutsk while the maiden flight was carried out on Sunday. The overall volume of sales the MC-21 passenger plane is expected to amount to 1,000 pieces till 2037, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Sunday. The maiden flight of the Ka-62 helicopter was carried out on Thursday.   Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...
