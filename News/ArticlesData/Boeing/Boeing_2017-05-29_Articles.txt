For some, the experience will offer nothing out of the ordinary, including the tiredness and jet lag associated with long-haul travel. Others, however, will fare – and feel – better. Blake Emery, Director of Differentiation Strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, looks at how innovation has shaped a better passenger experience. What makes an airplane journey memorable? Was it the comfort of the seat, the quality of service, or the in-flight entertainment? Since the earliest days of air travel, the expectations of the flying public have largely remained unchanged: safety, cabin comfort, and in-flight service. While flying has never been safer, and airlines in the Middle East have set a high bar for both the quality of service and the standard of their cabins, there was still a need for aircraft manufacturers to step up and further enrich the cabin experience. This wasn’t about building bigger airplanes; it was about designing better ones that rely on innovation and attention to detail to truly improve the passenger journey. Think about your most recent flight: did you feel a sense of relief after walking down the narrow confines of the jet-way and boarding the aircraft to be greeted by an open area with high ceilings? Did you then comfortably settle into your seat, taking in the roomy cabin around you, instead of crouching to slide down your row, all the while dreading the next few hours? And when you got to your destination, did you feel less tired and jet-lagged than you expected to? If the answer to all the questions is affirmative, it was very likely that you were experiencing the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and its Boeing Sky Interior. The sense of relief you felt when stepping onboard the plane was the result of using an age-old architectural technique – compression and release – commonly employed in the construction of religious monuments and modern hotels. After queuing through the tunnel-like bridge, the aircraft’s entrance is specifically designed to give passengers a psychological sense of relief and space when they board the plane. The space and comfort you experienced are the results of a wider cabin, the largest windows currently in the sky, sculpted sidewalls for added enhancement, and spacious overhead storage bins which don’t protrude inconveniently over the seats, folding instead into the ceiling and walls. Even the latches on the bins have been given careful consideration and are designed to operate whether a passenger pulls or pushes them, opening the stowage in a carefully timed manner. The uniquely lower cabin altitude that better matches what your body is used to on the ground, and the human-centric cabin lighting which, depending on the time of the day, will emit soothing hues of the airlines’ choice, helped reduce your tiredness and symptoms commonly associated with jetlag. Although the flying public will take many of these features for granted, each element of the cabin’s design – however mundane it may seem – is intended to unconsciously appeal to the passengers’ psyche, improving their in-flight wellbeing. Each aspect is meticulously well-thought-out and refined, using a combination of science, passenger feedback, and practicality, with the goal of contributing to the overall customer experience. Importantly for customers such as Saudi Arabian Airlines, which currently operates the 787 Dreamliner, they also complement an airline’s in-flight product and brand. By placing emphasis on the details that matter to the comfort and well-being of the passenger, we always strive to better that journey for the people who travel on our airplanes. And when airplanes – such as the Dreamliner and the 777X – set new benchmarks for passenger comfort, they do so entirely by design. — SG SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSyria’s economy is on its knees Next articleMerkel hosts Indian PM, looks to broaden world ties Imran Syed RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR King, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince condole UK Premier King orders advance payment of month’s salaries on Ramadan 23 Saudi courts to force Saudi Oger to pay employees’ entitlements NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply June 2017 S M T W T F S « May       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,643,654FansLike 44,205FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts King, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince condole UK Premier June 5, 2017 King orders advance payment of month’s salaries on Ramadan 23 June 5, 2017 Saudi courts to force Saudi Oger to pay employees’ entitlements June 5, 2017 Saudi, Egyptian FMs discuss anti-terror cooperation June 5, 2017 King receives dean of diplomatic corps and heads of groups June 5, 2017 Archives June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Boeing & Aerospace Business World Russia’s challenger to 737 and A320 makes first brief flight Originally published May 30, 2017 at 1:14 pm The MS-21, which is also often referred to using the Cyrillic alphabet as MC-21, is Russia’s first post-Soviet airliner and represents a determined effort to regain the country’s standing as a center of aerospace engineering prowess. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Less than a month after China’s national aerospace champion offered its challenge to Airbus and Boeing with the first flight of a 737-sized airliner, Russia entered the fray Sunday when jetmaker Irkut flew the MS-21 for the first time. The MS-21, which is also often referred to using the Cyrillic alphabet as MC-21, is Russia’s first post-Soviet airliner and represents a determined effort to regain the country’s standing as a center of aerospace engineering prowess. It features a carbon fiber reinforced plastic wing and tail, as well as the latest Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, similar to those on the Airbus A320 and Bombardier CSeries jets. The flight was not announced in advance. Irkut said in a statement that the larger of two proposed variants, the MS-21-300, successfully completed its flight in Irkutsk, Siberia, flying for just 30 minutes, reaching an altitude of 3,300 feet and a speed of 186 miles per hour.

The shortness of the flight and the relatively low speed and altitude could indicate some issue arose to cut the test flight short, but in its statement Irkut insisted all was normal. “During the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning,” Irkut said. “This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft.” Larger yet lighter The Russian jet enters the same market as the Chinese C919, which had its debut flight in Shanghai on May 4. Designed to carry 163 to 211 passengers, the MS-21-300 — like the C919 — is aimed at the heart of the single-aisle market, today dominated by the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737-800. Its fusleage is four inches wider than that of the Airbus jet and a full foot wider than Boeing’s, offering the possibility of wider seats and better passenger comfort. The MS-21 is also slightly longer than either of the Western aircraft, and it has an extra seven inches of wingspan. Yet data provided by independent Russian aviation sites indicates that the plane’s composite plastic wing and tail make it more than 3 tons lighter than the Boeing 737. The composite wing is not produced the way Boeing manufactures the wings of the 787 Dreamliner — by baking the material to hardness in a high-pressure oven, known as an autoclave. Instead, Irkut uses a technology called Resin Infusion that hardens the composite without the enormous energy and capital investment required for the autoclave process. Future threat The 21 in the MS-21’s name designates it a “21st century” aircraft. “MS” is for Magistralni Samolyot, meaning airplane for mainline or backbone routes. Irkut, a division of Russia’s state-controlled United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), has been tasked by President Vladimir Putin with restoring the country’s aerospace industry to its former pre-eminence and challenging the West’s dominance. Russia is also developing its own PD-14 jet engine, which it plans to offer as an alternative on the MS-21 to the Pratt & Whitney engine. The aircraft has won 175 initial firm orders from Russian buyers. It’s likely to sell more not only within Russia but within those countries of the former Soviet Union still dependent on Moscow. But can it sell well in the West? To do so, UAC will have to build an extensive support infrastructure to supply maintenance and spare parts for Western airlines — a tall order starting from scratch. Irkut’s ability to streamline the resin infusion technology to efficiently ramp up production will also be critical to the jet’s chances of success. In a report published Monday, U.S. aviation consulting firm AirInsight wrote that “if the MC-21 turns out to meet its specifications, then UAC has a fine product on its hands that may further disrupt the duopoly” of Airbus and Boeing. The challenge to the two Western aircraft makers is not so much to the new Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX single-aisle jets. Both of those are established successes, with Airbus having already stacked up more than 5,000 orders for the A320neo while Boeing has just over 3,700 orders for the MAX. But if the MS-21 gains a foothold in the market and sells well enough to survive, then looking a decade ahead the next new jet from Russia could be more of a threat. Earlier this month, Russia and China together announced a new joint venture to develop over the next decade a larger, twin-aisle airliner in the same size category as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350.

(Supplied photo) Etihad Airways on Tuesday announced plans to boost its European Dreamliner network with the deployment of Boeing 787-9 aircraft to Amsterdam and Madrid. The 299-seat Dreamliners will be introduced on year-round scheduled services to Amsterdam from September 1, and to Madrid, effective October 1, joining Düsseldorf and Zurich as the airline's other European Dreamliner services. The 787-9 will also operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months. With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, the aircraft are gradually being introduced on a number of international routes from the airline's Abu Dhabi hub. Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 13 Boeing 787-9s to 11 destinations - namely Washington, Düsseldorf, Zurich, Johannesburg, Amman, Riyadh, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Perth and Brisbane from Abu Dhabi. Beirut, Beijing, Seoul and Melbourne are due to join the 787 network over the next few months. The Amsterdam route will have a taste of the 787 between 2 and 30 June to help meet demand during the early summer peak period. The current four weekly Madrid services will also be boosted with additional flights, moving to a daily operation from June 1. Peter Baumgartner, chief executive officer of Etihad Airways, said: "Flights to and from Amsterdam and Madrid cater to business and leisure travellers, and with growing demand, there was a strong case to introduce bigger aircraft to these destinations." The 787 is fast becoming our flagship long-haul aircraft and as more are delivered, we will continue to look at upgrading existing routes with these excellent planes." Etihad Airways' two-class Boeing 787-9s include award-winning interiors that feature 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats, offering superior levels of comfort, entertainment and in-flight connectivity. On-board décor and lighting have been inspired by contemporary Arabian design, complementing the signature 'Facets of Abu Dhabi' identity introduced by the airline during its livery relaunch in 2014. Etihad Airways has pending deliveries of a further 58 Dreamliners over the next few years. - business@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Aviation Etihad expands Boeing 787 network in Europe Etihad Airways on Tuesday announced plans to boost its European...

Turns out, it's been around since the '60s. Back then, everyone was excited for supersonic commercial flight.  Sadly, that never panned out. However, that excitement got Boeing to thinking: its 747 might not be ideal for commercial flight if supersonic planes ruled the skies. So, instead of designing the 747 solely for passengers, Boeing also designed the plane for cargo. But it needed an easy way to load large cargo into the plane.  That's where that iconic hump comes in. Engineers decided to turn the front of the plane into a giant door. The nose would open up, making it easy to load tall cargo. But there was just one problem: the cockpit was located over the nose.  So, it was moved to the second deck, creating that giant hump you still see today.

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s comment that it’s “reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing” appeared to be a not-so-subtle hint that the government would revisit its purchase of Super Hornets. The government has said it plans to sole-source 18 Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure before running a full competition to replace its aging CF-18 fleet. The Liberals say the Super Hornets, which internal estimates suggest could cost as much as $2 billion, are urgently needed. Military officials and defence industry representatives contacted by The Canadian Press on Thursday were united in assuming that Freeland’s warning related to the planned Super Hornet purchase. Freeland’s comments came as the next potential Canada-U.S. trade dispute unfolded Thursday with the aerospace giants clashing at a Washington hearing. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing began into Boeing’s claim that Bombardier received subsidies allowing it to sell its CSeries planes at below-market prices. Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group said the Canadian government’s move was inevitable, putting into question Boeing’s strategy in taking on Bombardier. “If Boeing is smart it’ll press the do-over button and walk away,” he said in an interview, adding the aeronautics powerhouse has much more to risk from losing military contracts than the tiny gain from a successful trade complaint. “Boeing values Canada as a customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defence businesses,” said company spokesman Dan Curran. “Two of Canada’s most recent acquisitions of Boeing military products, the C-17 Globemaster and CH-47 Chinook, were delivered on-time and/or ahead of schedule.” In an emailed statement Boeing also pointed out that it places substantial amounts of commercial and defence work in Canada and has a supply chain that “leverages the breadth and depth of the Canadian aerospace industry.” Lobbyists, lawyers and aerospace executives crowded a room in Washington for a little battle playing out in the broader context of the day’s larger trade news: the U.S. announcement that NAFTA renegotiations will start in the next 90 days. Bombardier has made it clear that its true goal is to grab half the international market share for 100-to-150-seat aircraft, according to Boeing, which argues its rival has received an unfair head start from Canadian taxpayers. Boeing vice-president Raymond Conner said the sale of cheap, subsidized planes to Delta Air Lines helped build momentum for Bombardier to enter a new market. If Bombardier reaches its stated goal, he said, it would squeeze Boeing from that market and cost the company US$330 million a year in annual sales. “Today we are at a critical moment,” Conner told the seven-member U.S. International Trade Commission. “If you don’t fix it now, it will be too late to do anything about it later.” Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. A preliminary determination on the petition is expected by June 12. If the ITC determines there is a threat of injury to the U.S. industry, preliminary countervailing duties could be announced in July, followed in October by preliminary anti-dumping duties, unless the deadlines are extended. Final determinations are scheduled for October and December. Boeing is calling for countervailing duties of 79.41 per cent and anti-dumping charges of 79.82 per cent. It complains that Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far that have allowed it to engage in “predatory pricing.” Lawyers for the U.S. aerospace giant argued Thursday that Bombardier’s own words prove it was rescued financially by multibillion-dollar assistance from the Quebec government, which last year invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 per cent stake in the CSeries. The company also shored up its finances by selling a 30 per cent stake in its railway division to pension fund manager Caisse de depot for US$1.5 billion. Bombardier representatives countered that their planes never competed with Boeing in a sale to Delta—which the American rival describes as a seminal moment. Bombardier lawyer Peter Lichtenbaum said the plaintiff is a global powerhouse that hasn’t lost any sales as a result of Bombardier, has an enviable order backlog and doesn’t even compete with Bombardier in the sales campaigns it has complained about because the CSeries is smaller than Boeing’s 737-800 and Max 8 planes. “Boeing’s petition in this case is unprecedented in its overreach,” he said. “If this is a case of David vs. Goliath, Boeing has cast itself in the wrong role.” Boeing’s annual sales were US$94.6 billion last year. That means the US$330 million Conner expressed concern about amounts to one-third of one per cent of its annual sales. Bombardier revenues last year were US$16.3 billion, including US$9.9 billion from aerospace activities.

By Fora Staff Tuesday 30 May 2017, 3:30 PM Tue 3:30 PM 22,921 Views 21 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3416840 Share6 Tweet Email4 Image: Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ie Image: Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ie RYANAIR SEES “MASSIVE” growth opportunities in continental Europe as loss-making legacy airlines in Germany and Italy rejig their troubled business models. Speaking at the announcement of Ryanair’s annual financial results today, chief executive Michael O’Leary said that monetary woes at Air Berlin and Alitalia have opened a further gap in markets that the Irish carrier already in some cases dominates. “At the moment we have more growth opportunities than our planned fleet deliveries for the next couple of years can cope with,” O’Leary said. As a result, Ryanair’s finance boss, Neil Sorahan, has been tasked with extending leases on 10 aircraft through to 2019. “We’re also having discussions with (plane manufacturer) Boeing about adding one or two aircraft deliveries in 2018 and 2019 where Boeing can facilitate those additional orders,” O’Leary said. Source: Ryanair Click here to view a larger version. Ryanair has been taking delivery of 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft since 2015. That order is due to be completed by the end of next year. From 2019, it will start receiving the first of its 200 Boeing 737 Max planes. Those jets are frequently referred to as “game-changers” because they will give the airline eight extra seats – 197 in total – and use 15% less fuel on a per-seat basis. Ryanair said the extra capacity gives its scope to serve 200 million passengers per year by the end of March 2024. Sorahan was enthused about growth opportunities in Germany, where Ryanair operates 10 bases. German legacy carrier Air Berlin has been undergoing a major shake-up in recent months, seeing its fleet halved to 75 aircraft and downsizing its flight network from 387 to less than 100 routes. “We see more (German) corporates and private customers alike coming to Ryanair and more airports looking for our business,” Sorahan said. Mock-up of a Ryanair 737 Max 200 Source: Boeing On Alitalia – which earlier this month filed to be put under special administration – O’Leary said he believes that it will be restructured as well. He said said Ryanair is not prepared to invest in or acquire Alitalia, but will “help it survive” by offering to feed passengers into the Italian airline’s long-haul routes. Labour relations A thorn in O’Leary’s side will surely be the slip in Ryanair’s prized punctuality record, which dropped 2% in 12 months to the end of March 2017. That meant that 88% of all Ryanair were on time last year. The airline blamed this slight drop on “unusually disruptive weather” in November and December as well as air traffic controller strikes in France. On the subject of labour relations, O’Leary was dismissive of recent turbulence in Scandinavia. In his usual colourful language, the chief executive recently branded Nordic pension providers as “idiots” for refusing to invest in the airline over objections to its work practices. As many as seven retirement schemes in Denmark and Sweden sold their shares or blacklisted Ryanair after it clashed with trade unions in Copenhagen. “There has been some misinformed commentary up in Scandinavia recently about our labour relations which remain excellent,” O’Leary said today. “In 30 years we’ve never had a strike.” O’Leary has for years taken a no-nonsense approach to unions. He told Fora last week that any workers looking to unionise “will find their base either frozen or closed”. Ryanair hired 1,000 new staff last year bringing the total workforce to 13,000. O’Leary expects to recruit another 1,000 people this year. Brexit has been high on Ryanair’s agenda since the UK voted to leave the European Union last June. O’Leary told investors today that it remains “a big dark cloud hanging over us the next 18 months”. He repeated warnings that there may be “a period of days week or months” after March 2019 where there may be no flights between the UK and European Union in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the two regions. He said if that was the case, Ryanair would relocate UK-based aircraft to European bases. Ryanair posted a profit of just over €1.3 billion in the financial year ended 31 March 2017, up from €1.2 billion for the previous 12-month period. It said that it expects traffic to grow by 8% to 130 million by the end of March 2018. Sign up to our newsletter to receive a regular digest of Fora’s top articles delivered to your inbox.

On Tuesday, the European budget airline said in its fiscal year 2017 annual report that it's extending 10 of its planned lease returns in 2018 and 2019 to help boost fleet growth. XAutoplay: On | Off Ryanair is also considering adding "selectively" to its current Boeing order to have planes delivered in the next 24 months. With some models, carriers can be on the waiting list for years before deliveries start. Ryanair's U.S.-listed shares rose 1.45% to 107.76 in afternoon trade on the stock market today, hitting a fresh record high. Boeing rose 0.2% to 186.88, holding above a 185.81 buy point. Ryanair has 79 737-800 jets left to be delivered by fiscal 2019 on its massive 183-plane order from Boeing. The carrier has also agreed to buy up to 200 Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft during fiscal 2020 to 2024. The carrier reported full year profit in line with analysts' views, despite a shift in capacity to Spain over terrorist attacks in the Middle East and North Africa, causing some overcapacity but a weaker pound sterling helped cut costs. Ryanair plans to boost fiscal 2018 profit by 8%.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Boeing Wins Contract to Build DARPA XS-1 Experimental Space Plane But hey! What happened to Blue Origin? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 30, 2017 at 10:13AM For nearly three years now, we've been following the saga of the XS-1 Spaceplane -- the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) project to build a new and improved, 21st-century space shuttle. Designed to fly "10 times in 10 days," the unmanned XS-1 will rocket to the edge of space and then fire a different rocket to launch payloads into orbit -- never leaving the atmosphere itself, and never actually entering orbit. Instead, after delivering its cargo the XS-1 will return to land on Earth like an airplane. In contrast to the actual space shuttle, which famously cost about $1 billion a mission to fly, XS-1 aims to deliver up to 3,000 pounds of cargo to orbit for just $5 million per flight. Artist's conception of Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 spaceplane. Image source: Boeing. NASA has hired privately held Vector to build the second-stage "rocket" that will push payloads the last mile into orbit, using Vector's internally developed Vector-R rocket for this purpose. The question up till now, though, has been who would build the spaceplane itself. Would it be: Boeing (NYSE:BA), in collaboration with Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos' "Blue Origin" space company? Northrop Grumman, teaming up with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic? Or privately held Masten Space Systems, working with equally private XCOR Aerospace? Now we know the answer: It's Boeing ... and Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD). Boeing wins the prize -- but not Blue Origin On Wednesday, May 24, DARPA made its announcement: Boeing will "build and fly an experimental vehicle for aircraft-like access to space." Dubbed the Boeing Phantom Express, this will be the "first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would bolster national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space." After Boeing successfully completed phase 1 of the XS-1 competition, DARPA has tapped the company to proceed through phases 2 and 3 as well -- fabrication and flight. And yet, Boeing's victory seems to have left Blue Origin in the lurch. Somewhere between 2014, when Boeing entered this competition, and this week, when Boeing won it, Blue Origin appears to have fallen off the Boeing team, to be replaced by Blue Origin's rocket-building rival Aerojet Rocketdyne. According to DARPA's press release, "the XS-1 technology demonstrator's propulsion system is an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine (SSME)." In confirmation of this, Aerojet issued its own press release on Wednesday, stating that "Aerojet Rocketdyne is a member of the Boeing team" and that it has been "selected to provide the main propulsion for the Boeing and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) reusable Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1)." So it's official now: DARPA will proceed with building its spaceplane, with Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne doing the work. So what happens now? What happens now According to DARPA, Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne now move into phase 2 of the project, transforming XS-1 from concept into aircraft. This should be accomplished before the end of 2019, and will include at least 10 test-firings of the Phantom Express' engines over the course of 10 days. This accomplished, the companies will proceed to phase 3 in 2020, running between 12 and 15 flight tests to prove the aircraft can actually fly 10 times in 10 days. Ultimately, DARPA will ask its contractors to demonstrate Phantom Express' ability to hit flight speeds of Mach 10, and launch a demonstration payload weighing between 900 and 3,000 pounds into low-earth orbit. If they succeed in doing this, they'll prove the ability to put a pound of payload in orbit for as little as $1,700 -- and change the economics of spaceflight forever.

The new delivery, which was welcomed with a traditional water salute, is a highly one for the carrier as it is the first aircraft to feature seats by Turkish Seats Industries (TSI), a complete Turkish brand through a close collaboration with Boeing. TSI, the first locally aircraft seat producer in Turkey, which is a joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Assan Hanil, aims to play a key role in the global aircraft seat market with its innovative, lightweight, quality products. “Three years ago, we partnered in a significant initiative to pioneer another first in Turkish Civil Aviation. By establishing Turkish Seat Industry (TSI), in collaboration with Assan Hanil, we took a more active role in the industry through logistical support. And now we’re taking the delivery of the first aircraft equipped with those locally produced seats designed by TSI, an installation manufactured in Turkey that conforms to all international standards. With adding this 30th Boeing 777-300ER to our ever expanding fleet, we look forward to TSI to become a leading brand across the industry, and be a substantial part of our aircrafts in the near future.” said M. İlker Aycı, chairman of the Board and the executive committee of Turkish Airlines.   “Turkish Airlines has been a long-standing and key partner for Boeing and we are proud of their confidence and trust in Boeing’s technology and industry-leading airplanes such as the 777,” said Marty Bentrott, vice president for Sales, Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “This delivery is especially significant since it is the first to feature seats by Turkish Seat Industries (TSI). We look forward to further developing and strengthening our relationship with Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Aviation Industry.” Turkish Airlines and Boeing share a long history that goes back to 1945, with the arrival of the airline’s first DC-3/C-47 airliners. Turkish Airlines entered the jet age in the late 1960s, when the airline began operating DC-9, DC-10 and Boeing 707 airplanes. Over the years, the Turkish carrier has also flown the Boeing 727, 757, MD-80 and the most modern 737 and 777 airplanes. Boeing’s backlog with Turkish Airlines includes two 777 Freighters and 75 737 MAXs. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | Turkish | Airlines | 777 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Parks and Resorts unveils dxbpass Fairmont Nile City stays green on World Environment Day InterCon opens Staybridge Suites in Jeddah Jannah Hotels employs cats to counter workplace stress Gulf Air promotes destination Georgia to Bahrain travel trade Fairmont Quasar Istanbul welcomes over 5,000 GCC guests since opening Aviation leaders assemble in Mexico for Iata’s 73rd AGM Hurley appointed as Rotana's new corporate VP - sales Emirates showcases eco-friendly aircraft cleaning technique Geneva nominated as 'Europe's Leading Destination' at WTA SalamAir to launch Taif flights this week Airbus plans major presence at Paris Air Show AirAsia free seats promo is back!

"If any measure is taken in violation of the contract to purchase planes, we will reciprocate," Government Spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht told reporters in his weekly press conference in Tehran on Tuesday. His remarks came after US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin announced last week that the department is reviewing licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran. Mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. The review suggests that Trump’s support for Boeing’s defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran has said that halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. For Boeing, losing the Iran Air deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the wide-body jetliners are included in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to Iran Air by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year. Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40% this year under plans that include Iran Air’s still-tentative order. Iran's National Flag Carrier, Iran Air, has agreed to buy 200 US and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need US licenses because of their reliance on US parts. Meantime, Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh announced late in March that the giant aviation company Airbus has delivered the third passenger plane to the country.

Over the weekend, the Irkut MC-21, a prospective new jet airliner that's expected to be Russia's answer to the Boeing-737 and the Airbus A-320, conducted its maiden flight. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov MC-21, Russia's Answer to Boeing, Performs Its Maiden Flight (PHOTO, VIDEO)Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, whose portfolio includes aircraft construction, has taken a highly active role in promoting the new aircraft and supporting its development. On Monday, the minister finally revealed the real reason for the number '21' in the MC-21's name.  In a post on his official Facebook page, Rogozin wrote that his aircraft designer friend has told him that "the MC-21 is 21% superior to its competitors in every respect – fuel consumption, maintenance requirements, comfort, noise isolation, and weight. And of course, buyers will earn 21% more by flying these aircraft, compared to the catalogue prices of Boeing and Airbus planes." "There you have it. Now I understand where our mainline aircraft [Russian 'Magistralny Samolet' – abbreviated as MS or MC] got its lucky number from," Rogozin quipped. © Sputnik/ IRKUT Corporation/Marina Lisceva Russia to Offer Integrated Contracts for MC-21 Plane - Deputy Prime MinisterEngineers have confirmed that the MC-21's maiden flight Sunday took place as expected, with all the plane's onboard systems working flawlessly. The twin-engine short- and mid-range airliner is expected to have at least three variants, with passenger capacity ranging between 150-212 persons.  The MC-21 is designed to be faster, more efficient, and less expensive than its Western counterparts, incorporating the latest in the field of airframe, engine and avionics systems technology in its design. For example, the plane features a composite wing-design, which improves fuel efficiency, and will eventually be fitted with new Russian-made PD-14 engines, which meet and exceed global safety, noise, and fuel efficiency standards. The aircraft is also designed to have a superior cruising speed, and a price tag tens of millions of dollars less than those of its Boeing and Airbus competitors. Last week, Rogozin said that there are already 185 orders for the MC-21, with dozens more expected as interest rises amid flight testing.  On Monday, Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov said that the MC-21 should receive its airworthiness certificate in 2019. Eight planes, including three for flight testing, are currently being assembled at the Irkutsk Aviation Plant. Russia hopes to produce up to 1,000 of the planes for the medium-haul passenger liner market, which is by far the most capacious segment of the global aviation market, by 2037. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov 'Great Export Potential': Russia's MC-21 Passenger Jet Conducts Maiden Flight (VIDEO)Work on the MC-21 first began in the late 2000s, and intensified in 2014 after the downturn in relations with Western countries. Moscow has taken a number of steps to allow Russian aviation companies to win back the commercial passenger aircraft market, both domestically and abroad. On Tuesday, RIA Novosti reported that the Russian government had instructed its representatives in the boards of directors of state companies to vote in favor of the purchase or lease of only Russian-made aircraft. ...

The 787-9 will also operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months.   With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, the aircraft are gradually being introduced on a number of international routes from the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub.   Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 13 Boeing 787-9s to 11 destinations – namely Washington, Düsseldorf, Zurich, Johannesburg, Amman, Riyadh, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Perth and Brisbane from Abu Dhabi. Beirut, Beijing, Seoul and Melbourne are due to join the 787 network over the next few months.   The Amsterdam route will have a taste of the 787 between June 2nd and 30th to help meet demand during the early summer peak period. The current four weekly Madrid services will also be boosted with additional flights, moving to a daily operation from June 1.   Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways chief executive officer, said: “With two of Etihad Airways’ most popular European destinations joining our 787 network later this year, we are giving more guests the opportunity to fly on our next generation aircraft.   “Flights to and from Amsterdam and Madrid cater to business and leisure travellers, and with growing demand, there was a strong case to introduce bigger aircraft to these destinations. The 787 is fast becoming our flagship long-haul aircraft and as more are delivered, we will continue to look at upgrading existing routes with these excellent planes.   “Since introducing our first 787 into commercial service more than two years ago, we have enjoyed excellent feedback from guests on our ground-breaking cabin interiors that have set a benchmark for high service levels in the region and across the world.”   Etihad Airways’ two-class Boeing 787-9s include award-winning interiors that feature 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats, offering superior levels of comfort, entertainment and in-flight connectivity. On-board décor and lighting have been inspired by contemporary Arabian design, complementing the signature ‘Facets of Abu Dhabi’ identity introduced by the airline during its livery relaunch in 2014.   Etihad Airways has pending deliveries of a further 58 Dreamliners over the next few years. - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Etihad | Dreamliner | madrid | Amsterdam | B787 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Parks and Resorts unveils dxbpass Fairmont Nile City stays green on World Environment Day InterCon opens Staybridge Suites in Jeddah Jannah Hotels employs cats to counter workplace stress Gulf Air promotes destination Georgia to Bahrain travel trade Fairmont Quasar Istanbul welcomes over 5,000 GCC guests since opening Aviation leaders assemble in Mexico for Iata’s 73rd AGM Hurley appointed as Rotana's new corporate VP - sales Emirates showcases eco-friendly aircraft cleaning technique Geneva nominated as 'Europe's Leading Destination' at WTA SalamAir to launch Taif flights this week Airbus plans major presence at Paris Air Show AirAsia free seats promo is back!

(File Photo) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three FIRs pertaining to the affairs of the civil aviation ministry under the previous Congress-led government. The First Information Reports (FIRs) relate to the purchase of 50 Boeing aircraft for the erstwhile Air India, leasing of aircraft, and handing over of lucrative international airline routes to private airlines, while the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines has been registered as a preliminary enquiry, a source in the CBI told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former finance minister P Chidambaram’s son Karti. The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process, which experts believe led to the national air carrier bleeding financially. In January 2017, the Supreme Court had also asked the CBI to complete the probe on the same matter by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the Boeing purchase. “The Supreme Court had asked the attorney general to look into the allegations in a time-bound manner. We examined the evidence and decided to register three separate cases. We will finish the investigation soon,” said a senior CBI official privy to the development. According to the CBI official who spoke to HT, the CBI director sanctioned the registration of a case on Saturday after it remained under the scanner since 2014. The other two cases — the merger and surrendering of routes — are part of a larger probe into the mismanagement of the national air carrier whose losses increased from Rs 63 crore to over Rs 7,000 crore in the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014 coinciding with the Congress-led UPA rule. The FIR only mentions “unnamed official of civil aviation ministry”. The auditor, which covered the 2002-2010 period in its review, had said in its 121-page report that Air India was forced to buy aircraft from Boeing in a hurry. It also detailed events that led to the company’s ambitious $11-billion purchase on a paltry equity base of $34 million. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Former civil aviation minister Praful Patel told HT: “I am not aware of this. But if it is indeed true, I am happy. They should investigate and the truth must come out.” The first two decisions — purchase of aircraft and the merger — were decided by an empowered group of ministers headed by P Chidambaram, the then finance minister, and Pranab Mukherjee, the then external affairs minister. Patel was part of the group as civil aviation minister. The CAG report, however, pinned the responsibility on Patel’s ministry, “The erstwhile Air India was advised to revisit its proposal by “the aviation ministry” into expanding its requirement of aircraft. Whilst their earlier proposal for 28 aircraft had taken two years to prepare and submit, the revised long-term fleet for 50 aircraft plan was completed in four months,” the auditor had said. more from india While you were away: Top stories to get you up to date Jun 05, 2017 08:10 IST World Environment Day: Despite increasing green cover, India is losing its forests Jun 05, 2017 09:35 IST Nurturing Recruitment-Ready Students Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

(Repeats Monday's story with no changes to text)
    * MS-21 first jetliner using composite wings without
autoclaves
    * Move foreshadows changes in the way many jets may be built
    * Boeing pondering same technology for possible mid-market
plane
    * Upcoming technology choices to shape jet industry for
decades

    By Tim HepherPARIS, May 29 (Reuters) - Russia's new jetliner, which
conducted its maiden flight on Sunday, may have a hard time
challenging the sales duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, but it does
point the way to radical changes in how they could be building
jets in the future.
    The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia'sUnited Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne
aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a
costly pressurised oven called an autoclave.
    The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology
already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for
cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircaft with
composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers.
    Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make
wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for
its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market
between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737.
    "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without
 autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said.
    A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market
opportunities and declined further comment.
    Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its
two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next
generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from
2030 and last well into the second half of the century.
    Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy
publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of
jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same
production system as the one developed for the NMA.
    Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years
and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology
choices represent a colossal 75-year bet.
    Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how
to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month.
Airbus has declined to comment on the report.

    PIVOTAL DECISION
    Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but
achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787
Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save
money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon.
    Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on
fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to
build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA
or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to
build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help.
    Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is
a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel
<HXL.N>, Solvay <SOLB.BR> of Belgium and Toray <3402.T> of
Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing.
    At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay
showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to
supply manufacturers on a bigger scale.
    "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to
produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds,"
said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel
Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance.
    Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from
carbon fibre already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg",
which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane
parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves.
    Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to
produce than aluminium.
    Under the new technology, instead of using fibre that is
pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fibre
engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused
with resin under a vacuum.
    The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a
process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal.
Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear.
    Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for
years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way.
    But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique
for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before
the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing.
    The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to
catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western
giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded
models to future designs.
    "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is
on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank
Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay
Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21.
    He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size
to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.
    Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And
composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds
planemakers have in mind.
    Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of
its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for
the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be
closer to the 60-80 mark.
    Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft
would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to
a higher tempo using the widely expected composites.
    Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output
require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider
automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology
works first time, following widespread delays with new jet
programmes.
    "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based
on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need
to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his 707 to an Australian aviation museum. Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:15 AM, May 30, 2017 SYDNEY — Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the Hollywood actor, who is a qualified pilot, acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 145km from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Boeing puts 737 up against small business jets for $6.9B defense contract Originally published May 29, 2017 at 8:00 pm Updated May 29, 2017 at 9:53 pm Boeing is pitching to the Pentagon a 737-based replacement for the 17-aircraft fleet of JSTARS jets, used for surveillance of ground forces in a combat zone and to target enemy positions. The rivals are two high-end business jets. The contract may lead to further lucrative work. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter For a vital aircraft that will fly above distant battlefields, the Air Force will choose between Goliath and two Davids. One is a jet originally designed to carry around 135 passengers, the two others built to carry fewer than 20 people. With a $6.9 billion deal on the line, a militarized version of Boeing’s Renton-built 737 jet is going up against the Gulfstream G550 and the Bombardier Global 6000 high-end business jets for a special-mission contract to be awarded as early as this fall. The 17 JSTARS jets at issue will be stuffed with high-tech military radar and computer-analysis equipment.

The planes are heavily used in combat zones for surveillance of ground forces and to target enemy positions. The current JSTARS fleet is now active in strikes on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Boeing hopes a JSTARS win could incline the Air Force to choose the 737 to replace more than 100 different types of special-mission aircraft in its inventory — contracts that are lucrative far beyond the mere number of 737s involved. But the competition from Savannah, Georgia-based Gulfstream and Canada’s Bombardier is formidable. For special missions, air forces around the world are increasingly selecting business jets that fly higher, faster and further than airliners. The U.S. Air Force initially chose the Gulfstream for a separate electronic-jamming plane code-named Compass Call, although Boeing this month formally challenged that process. Fred Smith, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing Military Aircraft, dismisses the business jets as “a great solution for countries with smaller air forces and navies.” As for the U.S., he said, “for a bigger mission, you need a bigger airplane.” JSTARS 737 virtual tour In a conference room inside Boeing’s former Space Center in Kent, now a hive of different defense programs, a reporter donned a virtual-reality visor to take a look at a virtual mock-up of the jet maker’s 737 JSTARS contender. JSTARS stands for Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. It’s a joint Air Force and Army system, revolving around a massive, long-range radar that monitors what’s happening on the ground in a battle zone. The virtual mock-up shows the radar hidden in a canoe-shaped bump about 20 feet long under the jet’s fuselage. Inside the virtual airplane, operators seated at 10 stations toward the rear of the aircraft monitored large computer screens, analyzing the radar data and communicating with U.S. forces. Aft of the stations, large metal cabinets housed the computer servers and other equipment. Forward of them was a robust printer and a “mission table,” with a tabletop computer display screen of the battle zone. At the front of the cabin, immediately behind the flight deck, was a crew rest area for long-endurance missions and extra seats. Then Smith showed off a Boeing marketing trick, designed to impress upon the Air Force why size matters. With a click of a button, an arc of light sliced through the virtual cabin, superimposing upon Boeing’s mock-up another cabin wall that cut off half the computer stations. “That’s the G550 fuselage,” Smith said. Highflying G550 The Gulfstream jet is proposed by a team led by defense firm Northrop Grumman and L3 Technologies, a leading integrator of military electronics. L3 is the lead system integrator role on the Compass Call contract and is set to choose the aircraft for that program — Boeing’s protest of the contracting process centers on L3’s close collaboration with Gulfstream. L3 integrated the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission systems on G550s sold to Australia, Israel and Singapore and for other special-mission models sold to Japan and Germany. Northrop is the prime contractor on the current JSTARS fleet. First deployed in combat during the first Iraq war in 1991, those jets are all converted 707 airliners — now with an average age of 48 years and ripe for replacement with something more efficient. Alan Metzger, Northrop’s vice president for surveillance and targeting systems, said in an interview that though the Air Force needed a 707-sized jet to house all the equipment when the original JSTARS contract was awarded in 1985, a smaller business jet is appropriate today because the technology has all been miniaturized. “I don’t understand why you need a 135-passenger aircraft to carry around 10 Air Force operators,” Metzger said. Northrop bought a G550 and outfitted it with the current JSTARS mission equipment to demonstrate not only that the jet was big enough and met all requirements but that it had sufficient margin for any anticipated future growth. The key advantage of the business-jet solution is performance, he said. The G550 will fly hundreds of miles farther than a 737 and burn less fuel. It’s so much lighter it can take off from a shorter runway, giving it access to almost twice as many bases around the world, Metzger said. And the G550’s standard flight ceiling is 51,000 feet, compared with 41,000 feet for the 737. That matters when you are beaming radar down into a mountainous region such as, say, Afghanistan. At lower altitudes, a mountain peak up ahead may be in the way. As the plane flies higher, it has a direct line of sight into more of the landscape below. “You’ll see less if you have to look through rock, instead of over it,” Metzger said. Global 6000 foreign sales The third JSTARS contender, offering the Bombardier business jet as the platform, is a team led by defense giant Lockheed Martin, partnered with electronics and mission-systems integrator Raytheon. Raytheon is separately bidding against Northrop to provide the high-tech radar equipment on the JSTARS plane and all three contenders are ready to offer whichever radar system wins. The Bombardier Global 6000 is larger than the G550, both longer and with a wider cabin, yet still about half the weight of the smallest 737. The U.S. Air Force uses a Global 6000 for its E-11 special-mission jet, which is an airborne node for relaying battlefield communications. And the Bombardier jet too has won a series of foreign military orders, said Stephane Villeneuve, Bombardier’s vice president of specialized aircraft. It’s the platform for the U.K.’s Sentinel reconnaissance fleet, AWACS aircraft for the United Arab Emirates, intelligence-gathering aircraft for India and maritime-patrol aircraft for Israel. “In the international market, people are going to a business jet for all the missions we are describing here,” Villeneuve said. 737 cost effectiveness That trend threatens Boeing’s hope of extending its line of modified commercial jets for the military by replacing all the U.S. Air Force special-mission aircraft with 737-based models. Most of the existing planes are aging 707-based platforms, with a variety of missions and each with its own strangely opaque code name, including: • Cobra Ball, a fleet of three aircraft that collect data on ballistic-missile launches. • Rivet Joint, a 17-strong fleet of aircraft that gather and analyze military-electronic signals. • Constant Phoenix, a two-aircraft fleet that collects atmospheric data from nuclear tests. The Gulfstream and Bombardier jets each cost just over $60 million at list prices, some $20 million cheaper than the Boeing 737 model on offer. And they do burn a lot less fuel than the big jet. Nevertheless, one of Boeing’s major arguments is that the Air Force will save money on a fleet of 737s because maintenance and operational costs are so much lower. There are more than 9,000 of its 737s in service around the world, Boeing argues, with spare parts available anywhere in the world within 24 hours and with a tremendous reliability record that minimizes downtime. Smith compares the Air Force’s options to someone looking to repair a Ford truck rather than a fancy sports car. “There’s a maintenance shop on every corner,” he said. “It’s extremely cost competitive.” He cited U.S. Defense Department data showing that when maintenance costs are included, the total operational cost of a 737 used to ferry around top military brass is about half that of a G550-based Air Force jet used for the same purpose. Rod Meranda, Boeing’s sales and marketing lead for the JSTARS program, contends that the Air Force also takes on less risk if it goes with Boeing. For example, he said, neither the G550 nor the Global 6000 has ever been fitted with an in-flight refueling capability — a JSTARS requirement. “There’s a lot of risk taking a small airplane, cutting a hole in it and putting in in-flight refueling,” said Meranda. “How much will it take to test that, something that’s never been done before?” Boeing by contrast has already installed in-flight refueling on its 737-based fleet of P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine jets. The Air Force plans to weigh the cost, risk and performance of the three proposals on offer and choose the JSTARS replacement by year end. If Boeing were to win, the necessary military modifications to the airframe would likely be done during final assembly on the Renton production line — perhaps even on the same dedicated military line now churning out the P-8s. Where Boeing would then install the mission equipment, the radar and all the computers, is unclear. Still, for Renton, a Boeing JSTARS win would be significant and worth more than just 17 airplanes. It would indicate a high likelihood of further special-mission aircraft contracts later. First though, Goliath has to beat the Davids.

The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing (BA) 737 and Airbus (EADSF) A320. (Credit: CNN) Russia’s first large airliner since the fall of the Soviet Union made its maiden flight Sunday. The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The prototype took flight Sunday morning from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant airfield in Siberia, about 2,600 miles east of Moscow. During the 30-minute flight, the plane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters (roughly 3,300 feet). Oleg Kononenko, the flight’s lead test pilot, reported that the aircraft operated normally. The MC-21’s maiden flight was notably shorter than that of its Chinese competitor and other similar aircraft, which have typically flown for an hour or longer and at a higher altitude. The flight comes ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts June 18. Irkut hasn’t yet said whether the jet will be ready in time to make its international debut at the event. The Russian aircraft’s debut is the latest in a series of aviation firsts in 2017. The unusually busy year has featured a parade of maiden flights by new models from airplane makers around the world. China’s new challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the Comac C919, made its first flight on May 5. But while Russia is pushing the MC-21 with airlines around the world as a way to increase its non-military aerospace exports, Comac has shown less interest in selling the C919 overseas. Russia’s commercial aerospace industry has struggled over the past quarter century to regain the strength it had during the Soviet era. Through projects backed by President Vladimir Putin, it has sought to shed its reputation for advanced, but unreliable, passenger aircraft. The country last week formalized a partnership with China to made a long-range twin-aisle airliner to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The MC-21 is expected to start flying passengers in 2019 after it completes testing. Russian airline Aeroflot will be the first to fly the new jetliner. The state-run carrier has relied heavily on Airbus and Boeing jets as part of its modernization, but Russian policy has encouraged the introduction of homegrown models, like the MC-21. Irkut says the MC-21, which seats 163 passengers in two classes, will be 12% to 15% less expensive to operate than its Western counterparts. The manufacturer has taken 175 orders for the jet, which has a range of about 3,500 nautical miles or 6,400 kilometers. Irkut is an arm of the Russian state-owned aerospace conglomerate United Aircraft Corporation, which supplies the country’s airborne military hardware. Like the Chinese C919, the MC-21 has used many Western aerospace suppliers. The jet took the sky on Sunday powered by two U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which are also used by Airbus, Canada’s Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer. Russia is developing a new engine of its own for the MC-21. While the Russian aerospace industry has lagged U.S. and European companies, Airbus and Boeing are closely watching the new jet’s progress. The MC-21 is packed with advanced carbon fiber technology and flight controls that haven’t yet made their way to Boeing and Airbus aircraft. 61.524010 105.318756 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Irkut MC-21, russia, soviet union Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Instagram Popular Texas Man, 31, Dies After Contracting Infection While Swimming With New Tattoo Kathy Griffin Says She Is Being Bullied by First Family, Was Contacted by Secret Service Over Gory Trump Pictorial California Lawmakers Move One Step Closer Toward Ending Daylight Saving Time Baby Dies After Pregnant Woman Immediately Gives Birth Following Head-on Crash Near Valley Glen; Suspected DUI Driver Arrested Latest News L.A.

(AFP/Greg Wood) Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his "beloved" Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the "Saturday Night Fever" heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia's national carrier retired it more than 30 years later.  "It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS)," Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney.  A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it.  Read also: Dresses that tell a story: Princess Diana's life in fashion "The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again," Travolta said. "I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia." HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia's east coast. "We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it," De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. "When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we've been in detailed discussions and negotiations since." Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 190.23 +2.91 +1.55% Hexcel Corp HXL ▲ 52.17 +0.16 +0.31% The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurized oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircraft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel (HXL.N), Solvay (SOLB.BR) of Belgium and Toray (3402.T) of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fiber already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves.© REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Belgian chemicals group Solvay displays a prototype aircraft wing skin made using alternative resin-infusion production methods without a traditional autoclave at the JEC World exhibition at Villepinte Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminum. Under the new technology, instead of using fiber that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fiber engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.© REUTERS An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, produced by Irkut Corporation, takes off in Irkutsk Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes. "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

Companies reporting major news: The Boyd Group income fund (TSX:BYD.UN). Up $8.79, or 9.79 per cent, to $98.56 on 89,513 shares. The Winnipeg-based income fund will more than double its presence in Canada by acquiring 68 collision repair centres in Ontario operated by Assured Automotive Inc. for $193.6 million. Boyd says its North American network of collision repair shops will grow to 474 locations when the deal closes, including 110 in Canada. Assured Automotive CEO Desmond D'Silva and president Tony Canade will join the Boyd management team and continue to lead the Assured operation under its own brand name. Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR). Transportation. Down 32 cents, or 0.31 per cent, to $103.38 on 301,139 shares. The union representing approximately 3,000 employees at Canadian National Railway says it has reached a verbal agreement with the company, hours before the workers were in a legal strike position. Husky Energy (TSX:HSE). Oil and gas. Up 31 cents, or 1.92 per cent, to $16.46 on 389,804 shares. Newfoundland and Labrador government was exultant Monday as Husky Energy announced it will finally proceed with the multimillion-dollar West White Rose project, with first oil five years away. The company said it will use a fixed wellhead platform tied to the SeaRose floating production, storage and offloading vessel, known as an FPSO. First oil is expected in 2022 and could reach a gross peak production rate of approximately 75,000 barrels per day by 2025.

Boeing says a trade fight it has launched against Bombardier is meant to prevent the construction of a larger aircraft that would compete against its 737 aircraft.

Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent Ottawa reconsiders Boeing purchases amid accusations against Bombardier "The U.S. industry has been the victim of this exact strategy before, as subsidies to Airbus enabled it to push McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed from the market, and capture 50 per cent global market share, destroying countless high-paying, skilled U.S. jobs in the process," Boeing said. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company said its CSeries commercial jet isn't an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won't be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn't sell a comparable product and Boeing's 737 production is sold out for about eight years with a backlog valued at about $190 billion US, Bombardier said. "Using this case as an Airbus 'do-over' is a misuse of the statutory threat provision," Bombardier said. Boeing seeks duties at hearing against Bombardier CSeries Cross-border aircraft rivals Bombardier, Boeing clash in trade hearing Bombardier also rejected Boeing's claim that it is suffering present material injury as a result of Delta Air Lines' CSeries order. "If Boeing were correct that Delta established momentum for Bombardier, and caused harm to Boeing, one would expect to see additional CSeries orders in the U.S. market, but not one has occurred in the 13 months since the Delta purchase of CS100s," Bombardier said. Boeing's 737 fleet is expected to generate $26 billion US in free cash flow over the next four years, but the Chicago-based firm said it would be wrong to assume that it is not vulnerable to the threat subsidies pose, as the history with Airbus shows. The dispute has become politically charged, with Ottawa recently announcing that it was reviewing current military procurement projects with Boeing — a thinly veiled threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the company. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost.

McIntyre May 29, 2017 7:51 am EDT Print Email Tweet Russia has built its own commercial airplane. This is a potential long-term threat to Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) and Airbus which between them own the commercial aircraft business worldwide. Russia’s Irkut Corporation reported it had cleared a major milestone with a test flight during which its MC-21-300 “flew 30 minutes at the altitude of 1000 meters, at the speed of 300 km/hour.” While this does not compare to the flight duration and altitude levels which are routine to Airbus and Boeing planes, it is a reasonable start on the path which would allow Irkut to sell planes within several years. The company said it has reached several milestones in the recent test: The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant. According to the program, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft. The MC-21-300 will eventually carry 163 to 211 passengers, which Irkut describes as the largest segment of the airline market. It also said the MC-21-300 will compete well with existing planes because of polymer composite materials. This lightens the aircraft, which Irkut says will reduce operating costs by between 12% and 15% in contrast to its direct competitors. And, its most director competitor is one of the most successful plane in the world, the Boeing 737 MAX 8, which is sometimes called the 737-8. The first 737 went into service in 1968. Boeing has made almost 9,500 planes across the entire model line which has been updates several times. The new 737 MAX 8 began production 2014, had its firsts flight in January 2016, and its first delivery, to Malindo Air, this month. Boeing says it has over 700 orders for the new plane. While there is a chance the MC-21-300 will sell it Russia, it has a very long and hard climb to replace one of the most popular commercial aircraft in the world, made by one of the world’s largest and most well-funded companies, which has a history of delivering tens of thousands of planes.

So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet.Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon.Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help.Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel, Solvay of Belgium and Toray of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing.At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale."It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fibre already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves. Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminium.Under the new technology, instead of using fibre that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fibre engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum.The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear.Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing.The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs."This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind.Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark.Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites.Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes."Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

The complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based company from using subsidies to produce a larger version of the CSeries plane, pictured, that would compete with Boeing’s 737 aircraft.   (CLEMENT SABOURIN / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Ross MarowitsThe Canadian Press Mon., May 29, 2017 MONTREAL—Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Read more: Bombardier and Boeing clash in trade dispute over CSeries Article Continued Below Bombardier accused of dumping CSeries jets at ‘absurdly low’ prices in trade spat “The U.S. industry has been the victim of this exact strategy before, as subsidies to Airbus enabled it to push McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed from the market, and capture 50 per cent global market share, destroying countless high-paying, skilled U.S. jobs in the process,” Boeing said. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing’s effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is “misguided,” adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company said its CSeries commercial jet isn’t an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won’t be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn’t sell a comparable product and Boeing’s 737 production is sold out for about eight years with a backlog valued at about $190 billion (U.S.), Bombardier said. “Using this case as an Airbus ‘do-over’ is a misuse of the statutory threat provision,” Bombardier said. Bombardier also rejected Boeing’s claim that it is suffering present material injury as a result of Delta Air Lines’ CSeries order. “If Boeing were correct that Delta established momentum for Bombardier, and caused harm to Boeing, one would expect to see additional CSeries orders in the U.S. market, but not one has occurred in the 13 months since the Delta purchase of CS100s,” Bombardier said. Boeing’s 737 fleet is expected to generate $26 billion in free cash flow over the next four years, but the Chicago-based firm said it would be wrong to assume that it is not vulnerable to the threat subsidies pose, as the history with Airbus shows. The dispute has become politically charged, with Ottawa recently announcing that it was reviewing current military procurement projects with Boeing — a thinly veiled threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the company. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. A preliminary determination on the petition is expected by June 12.

Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the trade dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing says Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. A Bombardier CS300 airplane on display ahead of the opening of the 51st Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, June 13, 2015. Bombardier says in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided,'' adding that Boeing's complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. The company says its CSeries commercial jet isn't an imminent threat to Boeing because the first planes won't be delivered to Delta for another year, Boeing doesn't sell a comparable product and Boeing's production is sold out for about eight years. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. A preliminary determination on the petition is expected by June 12.

(AFP) Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his "beloved" Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the "Saturday Night Fever" heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia's national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. "It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS)," Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. "The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again," Travolta said. "I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia." HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia's east coast. "We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it," De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. "When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we've been in detailed discussions and negotiations since." Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

The American giants are in the cross-hairs of an Israeli lawyer with a track record of humbling huge corporations and winning multi-million-dollar settlements for her clients. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner has spent the past decade filing lawsuits for the victims of terror attacks against the governments, banks and corporations that enabled or financed the violence. As a result of her efforts, more than $200 million has been collected for terror victims and their families (including out of court settlements), and some $600 million in assets has been frozen. Darshan-Leitner has also used the courts to fight against what she considers to be unfair lawsuits against Israeli military commanders. In one notable case, she stopped a Spanish lawsuit against Israel’s Chief of Staff Dan Halutz over a bombing raid in Gaza by filing a similar suit against Javier Solana, a top Spanish politician who had overseen NATO’s bombing of Kosovo. Spain changed the law. The Bar-Ilan University-educated mother of six will speak about her work in a live interview in Jerusalem on Sunday, June 4 in our next Times of Israel Presents event, produced in association with Nefesh B’Nefesh. (Book tickets HERE). Last year, she won an unprecedented $655 million verdict against the Palestinian Authority and PLO on behalf of 11 American families whose loved ones had been killed or injured in attacks in Israel. That decision was overturned by the US Court of Appeal, but Darshan-Leitner says she is not deterred. Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, with the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center and representing those affected by attacks in Israel in the early 2000s, walks from a federal courthouse in New York on February 23, 2015. (photo credit: AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Darshan-Leitner and Shurat Hadin, the non-profit law center she heads, are self-funding and do not receive backing from any government, including that of Israel. Sometimes she can be more effective even than the Israeli army: In 2011, she prevented a Gaza-bound activists’ flotilla from leaving Greece after challenging the seaworthiness of the vessels in a local court. Now she has discovered that Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah is using Western Union to channel funds, and Iran is planning to use Boeing aircraft to deliver missiles to Syria. She plans to sue them both. “Hezbollah is launching a fundraising campaign and using Western Union to accept the donations, so one of the moves that we are planning is to go after Western Union,” says Darshan-Leitner. “In addition, we learned that Boeing not only signed a horrible deal with Iran providing them with 80 aircraft with a special waiver for the sanctions, Iran actually is using these aircraft to deliver missiles into Syria and let Hezbollah drive them to South Lebanon to shoot them over Israel. Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner: ‘Hezbollah is launching a fundraising campaign and using Western Union to accept the donations.’ (courtesy) “We are suing Boeing now to stop the deal, and we are launching a campaign to put pressure on the administration not to let Boeing continue,” she says. Darshan-Leitner is also suing Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants for their alleged role in “facilitating” terror activity. “Facebook, Twitter and Google provide material support in the form of social media network services to Hamas, to ISIS. This is unacceptable. It’s also a violation of American law. So we’ve filed lawsuits against them as well,” she says. Are the courts the right battleground to fight terrorism? Does her work encourage Israel’s enemies to resort to their own “lawfare” against Israeli targets? We’ll be asking those questions and more when we interview Darshan-Leitner on June 4. Join us for what promises to be a fascinating conversation and the chance to meet one of Israel’s most dynamic lawyers.

    * Unannounced, Russia stages test flight of new passenger
plane
    * MS-21 seen competing against Airbus, Boeing best-sellers
    * Officials hope cheaper running costs will win sales

    By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack StubbsMOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - Russia carried out the maiden
flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday,
its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline
commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its
Western competitors.
    In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation
<IRKT.MM> and its state-controlled parent company United
Aircraft Corporation (UAC) <UNAC.MM> said an MS-21-300 model had
successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000
metres and travelling at 300 km an hour.
    Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine
crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial
production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms.
    The test flight, which was not announced to media
beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden
flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing
competition to industry heavyweights Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus
<AIR.PA>.
    Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its
Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped
up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts
say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the
transatlantic airplane duopoly. [nL8N19052L]
    "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine,
there were no observations which will prevent further testing,"
test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying.
    Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the
flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with
recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models.
    "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have
had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western
flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight".
    A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test
everything that needed checking in the air.
    Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation
for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews.
    Flag carrier Aeroflot <AFLT.MM> last year earned its fourth
star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it
alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and
ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.

    FIRM ORDERS
    President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg
Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the
Kremlin called "a significant event".
    The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the
MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200
which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as
the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters.
    Production is expected to start in the next two years and
state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and
foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far
had "firm orders" for 175 planes.
    America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of
their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and
more advanced technical know-how.
    But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern
European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers
attracted by its lower running costs.
    Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to
15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.
    With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be
competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which
currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both
companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable
15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions.
    State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close
Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85
aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec
said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body
Airbus models, including 70 A320s.
    UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand
for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next
20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new
aircraft," he said.

Jamie Burgess, Vice-President and Program Manager for Boeing Military Aircraft Mobility Surveillance and Engagement division "The size of the 737 is about right for a [command and control] C2 mission crew that would be spending upwards of 12 hours on an aircraft. It also offers tremendous growth potential in terms of power, size, weight, cooling, and aircraft performance." said Jamie Burgess, Vice-President and Program Manager for Boeing Military Aircraft Mobility Surveillance and Engagement division, told IHS Janes. "We think the 737-700 is the right solution for the air force's [C2 and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] C2ISR recapitalization." The current fleet of 16 Air Force Northrop Grumman E-8C JSTARS dates back to the early 1990's. The E-8C is based off the 707 airframe, which suffers from high operating costs at as much as $200,000 an hour. There is also a lack of spare parts and airframes available. Multiple companies are bidding for the program. The JSTARS features a radar system that can cover a theater-sized battlefield region. It is meant to provide ground and area commanders with long-range ground surveillance.

The US government awarded Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, $1.48 billion for the development of a "Redesigned Kill Vehicle", the Pentagon said in a statement last week. The extra money brings the total publicly known value of the US government contract with Boeing to a whopping $7.78 billion. The White House wants to upgrade the system before Kim Jong-un develops the capabilities to strike the continental US. So what is a kill vehicle? Simply put, kill vehicles intercept and destroy long-range ballistic missiles. Launched atop missiles of their own, they use sensors, lenses and rocket thrusters to pick out ballistic warheads and steer into their path. When it comes to shooting down ballistic missiles "there is a fundamental difference in the technology - whether you want it to do that inside the atmosphere or in space," says Dr Stephan Fruehling from the ANU's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre. In the case of medium and long range missiles coming from North Korea, an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) which intercepts the missile in space would be the technology of choice. If a threat is detected by a system of sensors based on land or on warships at sea, then a Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) will be launched into space using a rocket booster. Once outside the Earth's atmosphere, operating at the edge of space at hypersonic speeds, the kill vehicle is deployed. It seeks out the target using sensors, a sophisticated on-board computer and a rocket motor used for steering in space. It hones in on the missile and destroys it using nothing more than the force of a massive collision. Continued below.

MULTIPLE FAILURES Leader Kim Jong Un at what was said to be a missile test site. Photo / AP The technology has been around for more than two decades but it hasn't always worked as intended. In fact it's been hugely problematic. In 2010 a meticulously controlled test of its missile defence technology at a site in Alaska ended in embarrassment for the US military. Despite knowing the exact speed and coordinates of the target, the intercepting kill vehicle completely missed the fake warhead. Eleven months later, when the US Missile Defense Agency staged a repeat of the test, it again failed. During a test in July 2013 success once again proved elusive, raising serious questions over missile defence system the Pentagon had poured more than $US40 billion ($A53 billion) dollars into. A test conducted last year was announced as a success but it was later revealed that one of the thrusters malfunctioned, causing the interceptor to fly offcourse. Dr Stephan Fruehling is a Chief Investigator on the Australian Research Council's project on nuclear deterrence and was a member of the Australian Government's external panel of experts on the 2016 Defence White Paper. He says the latest contract awarded to Boeing by the US military is about reinventing a kill vehicle that isn't wedded to ageing technology. The United States deployed an operational GBI system in California and Alaska which was rushed into the field after September 11 under the George W. Bush administration. Essentially the system is situated to intercept missiles from rogue states like North Korean or Iran during their trajectory to the continental United States. But much of the system was based on technology from the previous decade, which has been plagued with issued since testing began in 1999. "It has a lot of limitations," Dr Fruehling told news.com.au. "And essentially what the US is stuck with is evolutions of a kill vehicle that remains based on this technology from the 1990s ... and that's caused a lot of problems that they've had with that system." WHY ARE THEY INVESTING IN NEW TECHNOLOGY NOW? May 22, 2017: Photo distributed by the North Korean government shows a missile lifting off during its launch test at an undisclosed location in North Korea. Photo / AP With North Korea continuing to test nuclear warheads at a feverish pace, the Pentagon is racing to improve its kill vehicle technology. "What this is about now is taking a step back and developing a interceptor that addresses those issues," Dr Fruehling said. CALLS FOR AUSTRALIA TO DEVELOP MISSILE SHIELD A woman watches a TV screen showing a file footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at Seoul Train Station in Seoul, South Korea. Photo / AP Advances in missile technology made by North Korea - as well as China - in the past few years have taken some western analysts by surprise. And the situation has led to growing calls for Australia to develop its own missile shield. Defence specialist Andrew Shearer who previously worked as a national security adviser to Prime Ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott is among those who believe Australia needs to invest in this area. He wants the government to examine systems "to defend the continent against the new and growing threat posed by long-range ballistic missiles that could be used to strike or intimidate future Australian governments". "The cumulative effective of these capabilities is to increase the missile threat to ADF forces deployed forward in the (Asia) region, whether independently or as part of an allied coalition," he told Fairfax Media last month. He also warned that over time such weapons could be used to "reduce Australia's strategic depth and put Australian and allied forces operating from rear bases on the mainland at greater risk. "The latter is a new threat but one that will become very real over the next decade," he said. According to Dr Fruehling "there has been an ongoing debate about whether Australia should actually acquire interceptors. But so far that's not been done." Largely because it's not really a threat Australia could thwart on its own with current technology. "If you look at the threat to Australia from intercontinental ballistic missile, there's little that Australia could do to address that on its own," he said. "If you look at North Korean missiles, for example, you'd have to have a ship with SM3 (a ship-based missile interception system) off the North Korean coast. Or you would have to base ground based interceptors in northern Australia but you would be looking at sensor infrastructure and an investment cost that runs into the dozens of billions, so it's not really feasible." But that certainly doesn't mean Australia isn't engaged in aspects of missile defence systems on the research and development side of things. "There's been some technology co-operation, even going back to the 1990s" with our US ally but these experiments have been "largely in the sensor space in terms of looking at the overall horizon radar and how that could be to detect missiles," Dr Fruehling said. "There is some scope for integrating some Australian sensors into missile defence systems," he said. - news.com.au By Nick Whigham Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Thrilling Lions match lights up city Fans on both sides of the match were unified in their enjoyment of the match.

The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing (BA) 737 and Airbus (EADSF) A320. By Jon Ostrower SEATTLE (CNNMoney) -- Russia's first large airliner since the fall of the Soviet Union made its maiden flight Sunday. The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The prototype took flight Sunday morning from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant airfield in Siberia, about 2,600 miles west of Moscow. During the 30-minute flight, the plane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters (roughly 3,300 feet). Oleg Kononenko, the flight's lead test pilot, reported that the aircraft operated normally. The MC-21's maiden flight was notably shorter than that of its Chinese competitor and other similar aircraft, which have typically flown for an hour or longer and at a higher altitude. The flight comes ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts June 18. Irkut hasn't yet said whether the jet will be ready in time to make its international debut at the event. The Russian aircraft's debut is the latest in a series of aviation firsts in 2017. The unusually busy year has featured a parade of maiden flights by new models from airplane makers around the world. China's new challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the Comac C919, made its first flight on May 5. But while Russia is pushing the MC-21 with airlines around the world as a way to increase its non-military aerospace exports, Comac has shown less interest in selling the C919 overseas. Russia's commercial aerospace industry has struggled over the past quarter century to regain the strength it had during the Soviet era. Through projects backed by President Vladimir Putin, it has sought to shed its reputation for advanced, but unreliable, passenger aircraft. The country last week formalized a partnership with China to made a long-range twin-aisle airliner to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The MC-21 is expected to start flying passengers in 2019 after it completes testing. Russian airline Aeroflot will be the first to fly the new jetliner. The state-run carrier has relied heavily on Airbus and Boeing jets as part of its modernization, but Russian policy has encouraged the introduction of homegrown models, like the MC-21. Irkut says the MC-21, which seats 163 passengers in two classes, will be 12% to 15% less expensive to operate than its Western counterparts. The manufacturer has taken 175 orders for the jet, which has a range of about 3,500 nautical miles or 6,400 kilometers. Irkut is an arm of the Russian state-owned aerospace conglomerate United Aircraft Corporation, which supplies the country's airborne military hardware. Like the Chinese C919, the MC-21 has used many Western aerospace suppliers. The jet took the sky on Sunday powered by two U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which are also used by Airbus, Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer. Russia is developing a new engine of its own for the MC-21. While the Russian aerospace industry has lagged U.S. and European companies, Airbus and Boeing are closely watching the new jet's progress. The MC-21 is packed with advanced carbon fiber technology and flight controls that haven't yet made their way to Boeing and Airbus aircraft.

Canales lashes out over killed bill By PAUL COBLER | Special To The Herald Brownsville Herald AUSTIN — McAllen’s payment to Enrique Iglesias for a 2015 holiday performance may never become public information, and state Rep. Terry Canales is not happy about it. On Wednesday night, Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, removed House Bill 349, Canales’ bill, from the Texas Senate’s Local and Consent Calendar. This effectively killed the bill by preventing it from being read on the Senate floor before the end of the legislative session next Monday. “He did it because it’s a chink in the armor and takes a piece of the Boeing ruling away,” Canales said. “They don’t want the sweater to unravel, and he wants to keep the public in the dark.” The bill reversed a very narrow portion of the Texas Supreme Court’s Boeing Ruling, which was cited when the City of McAllen refused to disclose the price tag for the Iglesias concert. If the bill had passed, it would have wiped out the contract between McAllen and Iglesias, forcing the city to disclose the payment. In a personal privilege speech on the House floor, Canales, D-Edinburg, ripped into Schwertner for his decision to kill HB 349, calling him a “villain” who “dwells in the shadows of corporate greed.” Prior to the speech, Canales approached Schwertner on the Senate floor, poked him in the shoulder and said next session he would block every piece of legislation Schwertner authored that was sent to the House. Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, who was carrying HB 349 in the Senate, said Schwertner told him he removed the bill from the calendar as retribution for Canales calling a point of order on one of his bills, Senate Bill 11. A point of order is a request to the House Parliamentarian to review that the bill is not breaking any House rules, but commonly can be used as a legislative delay tactic. “ Sometimes, at this point in the session, people get overly emotional and retaliate,” Hinojosa said. “I was not notified he was going to pull the bill from the calendar, which is usually the protocol here. I was disappointed Sen. Schwertner didn’t notify me, because I could have talked to him and probably persuaded him not to do that.” Canales said he believes Schwertner killed the bill because of its intention to expand government transparency in Texas. “(Schwertner) says the bill was killed because of a point of order, but no point of order was ever sustained on one of his bills,” Canales said. “The reason for him to kill the bill was protecting corporate industry.” Schwertner did not respond to a request for comment. The death of HB 349 leaves no legislation supporting open government in Texas left standing, according to Kelley Shannon, the executive director of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. “Legislators should definitely not be playing games with open government,” Shannon said. “It’s a basic right of the people of Texas to know how their government operates and to know how their government uses their taxpayer dollars. When they play games with open-government, they are playing games with the voters of Texas.” In his personal privilege speech, Canales called on legislators to do better when it comes to open-government legislation. “If you don’t have the spine to stand for transparency, you don’t have the right to stand for Texas,” Canales said in his speech. “To my understanding, Sen. Schwertner is an orthopedic surgeon, which I find ironic because he doesn’t have a spine.”  Discuss Print Posted in Valley on Sunday, May 28, 2017 10:38 pm.

Based in Adelaide, the office will create around 250 new highly skilled technical and advanced research positions as it undertakes programs spanning C3I, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and advanced experimentation and prototyping. ‘These skilled roles will offer significant sustainable employment opportunities to young South Australian graduates, with the added benefit of creating jobs with defence contractors and significant numbers of indirect jobs,’ says Jay Weatheril, Premier of South Australia, in a Boeing media release. Boeing Defence Australia employs more than 2,000 employees at 14 locations throughout Australia and three international sites. In South Australia, its support programs include the E-7A Wedgetail, P-8A Poseidon and Collins Class submarine. ‘Boeing Defence Australia is committed to building local capability in South Australia,’ says Darren Edwards, Boeing Defence Australia vice president and managing director. ‘One way we are doing this is by investing A$500,000 over five years in the Techstars Adelaide global accelerator program to support South Australia’s entrepreneurial startups. ‘We also know that partnerships with higher education institutions are critical for preparing today’s students with tomorrow’s skills for defence industry capability and advancing innovation. To that end, this year we have invested A$7,000 with the 2017 Defence Honours Scholarship Program and look forward to expanding our education partnerships with South Australian universities.’ Boeing’s presence in Australia is its largest outside the US. The company has been in Australia for more than 90 years and has invested more than A$1 billion in its Australian operations over that time. It employs more than 3,000 people in 27 locations across Australia.

DARPA  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By JUSTIN BACHMAN | Bloomberg | Published: May 28, 2017 In the future, military dominance will depend partly on how fast you can fly and how quickly you can get into space. That's one of the guiding principles behind an advanced Pentagon project to build a spacecraft able to launch smaller payloads into low-earth orbit on short notice, and at lower cost. Boeing Co.'s XS-1 (Experimental Spaceplane), which the company dubs "Phantom Express," got a green light this week by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. The XS-1 is designed to quickly lift satellites as heavy as 3,000 pounds into orbit for $5 million or less, launching from the ground, deploying a small upper-stage module, and then landing like a traditional airplane-the key to reuse and lower operating expense. Darpa also has a separate program aimed at launching 100-pound satellites for less than $1 million per launch, using conventional aircraft. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," Jess Spoonable, a Darpa program manager, said in a May 24 statement. The Phantom Express will be powered with an Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. AR-22 engine, a newer version of the main engine trio that served on NASA's Space Shuttle. Boeing will design and build the aircraft through 2019, including 10 engine ground firings over 10 days, followed by 12-15 flight tests in 2020. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the project's cost. Beyond the military's desire for a spaceplane, such a craft would likely carry immense appeal for commercial companies, many of which are planning to launch constellations of small satellites. These companies don't need the weight capability, or large expense, associated with traditional payload launches sold by United Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp. joint venture, Arianespace, or Elon Musk's SpaceX. The XS-1 is also envisioned as a means to further engineering work on advanced airframe designs capable of hypersonic flight, generally five to 10 times above Mach 1, the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 767 miles-per-hour). Historically, these designs have been challenged due to the intense friction and heat generated by higher Mach speeds. Beyond a quick pop into space, a craft with hypersonic speed offers the Pentagon a new capability-an aircraft deployable anywhere in the world in less than three hours. "When most people think about hypersonic aircraft, many believe they would have to be large, expensive, and exotic," Lockheed Martin says. "It's time we change that perception." One way the defense contractor is trying to do that is with the next generation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the Cold War-era speed demon able to fly at Mach 3, which provided critical reconnaissance for the Air Force until the late 1990s, when it was retired. The SR-71 still holds numerous speed and altitude records. The new Lockheed Skunk Works project, called the SR-72, is a proposal envisioning an unmanned aircraft that cruises at Mach 6 - roughly twice as fast as the 2,300-mile-per-hour SR-71 - meaning "an adversary would have no time to react or hide," Lockheed Martin says in its promotional materials. A Skunk Works spokeswoman declined to comment on hypersonic projects. The SR-72 could be operational by 2030, for less than $1 billion, according to the company, which has been touting the aircraft for several years. Boeing has previously experimented with hypersonic flight with its X-51 WaveRider, a small scramjet platform, dropped from a B-52 bomber, which flew its last test mission in 2013 over the Pacific. The X-51 topped Mach 5, or about 4,000 mph. In the 1960s, NASA experimented with the manned X-15, a high-altitude, hypersonic flight program to inform future space missions. In 1967, the X-15 achieved a record Mach 6.7 (4,520 mph) at more than 102,000 feet. DARPA has selected The Boeing Company to complete advanced design work for the Agency’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule.

Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

(CAT) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) ABT, BA and CAT stock are all ready to break higher May 30, 2017, 11:00 am EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group     The market has been able to maintain its low-volatility trend move higher as we get into what are typically the more quiet days of summer trading. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) are three of the large-cap companies on our technical radar screens today as all three companies are part of the market’s melt-up as stocks continue to push to new highs. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott stock surged on Friday with relatively heavy volume, pushing the stock towards a bullish technical trigger. ABT shares were pushed forward on a break above the stock’s 50-day moving average. This initiated a technical buy signal and thus the heavy volume. The move came close to seeing Abbott shares break above their top Bollinger Band, a move that would have accelerated and extended the rally of this biotech company. ABT stock will run into a little resistance at $45 from past chart resistance and the fact that the top Bollinger Band still resides at this price. A move above $45 will give traders a boost of confidence that this market leader is ready to take it to the next level with a price target of $50 from there. Boeing Co (BA) The continued political headlines have caused many of the air and defense stocks to start seeing selling as doubt over the Administration’s agenda, including defense spending, grew unsteady. This was the fundamental reason for the weakness in Boeing stock through March and April. After this consolidation, BA shares are beginning to build momentum again as the stock is headed towards $200 with a head of steam building. Chart watchers have been eyeing $185 as historical resistance as the stock has been stopped in its ascent at that price a number of times. Now, the break above this price has traders increasing their volume trading on Boeing. From a short-term perspective, BA shares are likely to become overbought as they approach $200. That will combine with the round-numbered resistance that comes naturally from a price point like $200. Expect to see the stock pause due to these factors. However, Boeing should be able to make a momentum move through this price and continue its leadership role in the market. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) Another group of companies that have been affected by doubt around the Trump administration’s ability to move their agenda forward are the heavy machinery industrial companies. Caterpillar shares declined more than 10% into a short-term bottom in May, giving investors an opportunity to buy this stock “on sale”.  CAT shares have regained their price of $105 and are wrestling with chart resistance in trying to break higher. Short interest in the latest report showed that the bears have been selling out of their positions, helping to fuel the rally higher. The short interest of 4.0 now indicates that we’ve probably seen the majority of short covering help the stock higher. Look for a little rest as the stock takes a breather before breaking above $105, but from there, the momentum will move this heavy equipment manufacturer higher towards the $115-mark. As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The FAA alleged that in June 2014, United mechanics replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on the Boeing Co aircraft but failed to perform a required inspection before returning the aircraft to service. A United spokesman said, "The safety of our customers and employees is our top priority. We immediately took action after identifying the issue and are working closely with the FAA in their review."

On January 5, the apex court had given a direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. On Monday, the CBI registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the decisions taken by the Manmohan Singh government, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases were registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption. CBI sources said “all stakeholders” were under its scanner. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had recently said the government was open to strategic divestment of Air India, which had a debt of ₹50,000 crore and a market share of 14 per cent. Both Air India and Indian Airlines have been dogged by controversies since the Manmohan Singh government assumed office in 2004. In September 2005, Indian Airlines signed a ₹10,000-crore deal to acquire 43 Airbus A-320 family aircraft. Months later, Air India acquired 68 Boeing aircraft at over ₹35,000 crore. This too ran into controversy; government officials who had objected to such a large number of aircraft being ordered were reportedly shunted out before the deal was inked in January 2006. In 2007, the government completed the Air India-Indian Airlines merger into one airline under the name Air India. But problems soon emerged between the staff of the airlines. Before the merger, the airlines followed different human resource management policies. The then Civil Aviation Secretary told the Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Undertakings that unless there was a merger in “the hearts of the people” the new airline will not work as intended. Under the Manmohan Singh government, the number of domestic carriers increased with IndiGo, Go Air, Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet taking to the skies. This too led to controversy as it was alleged that Indian Airlines was pressured to give up preferred times of operations in favour of private airlines. It was not uncommon for a flight by a private airline to depart on the same route a few minutes before an Indian Airlines’ flight. While the Manmohan Singh Government had three civil aviation Ministers, Praful Patel was Minister when Indian Airlines and Indian Airlines ordered the aircraft, the merger took place between the two airlines and many new airlines took off.

The CBI, as the federal police is known, registered three cases and one preliminary inquiry in the light of orders from the Supreme Court in January, according to the statement dated May 29 on its website. The cases include investigating allegations regarding buying planes for 700 billion rupees ($10.8 billion), the CBI said. The acquisition allegedly caused a financial loss to the “already stressed” national carrier, it said. Tell a friend File image Air India spokesman Dhananjay Kumar and a spokeswoman for Boeing in India declined to comment. Praful Patel, who was India’s civil aviation minister at the time of the purchases, and an Airbus spokesman in India didn’t immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. In December 2005, India’s cabinet gave an approval to the national carrier to buy 68 aircraft from Boeing In 2006, state-owned Indian Airlines Ltd. inked an agreement to buy 43 planes from Airbus SE. While the aircraft orders were made separately, the two national carriers were later merged by 2007 into the National Aviation of India Ltd., which operated under the brand Air India. Allegations The CBI said it’s also investigating allegations of leasing of a large number of aircraft “without due consideration.” Also part of the probe will be allegations about giving up profit-making routes by Air India in favour of national and international private airlines, which caused a “huge loss” to the national carrier, it said. Read also: Gupta plane had 'official business' Air India’s aircraft deal was controversial at the time of the purchase itself. A day after the Mumbai-based carrier chose to buy 23 Boeing 777 aircraft and 27 Dreamliners, Nigel Harwood, Airbus’s then vice president of sales for India, said in an interview that the European company wasn’t given a “fair chance.” Air India denied that, saying it took “strong exception” to the claims. India is considering selling a majority stake in Air India to a strategic partner after a $3.6 billion bailout failed to turn around the loss making national carrier, Bloomberg News reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The proposal includes reviving Air India within five years of selling a 51 percent stake, they said.

Since then there have been many more to have claimed scores of lives. Here, we count down the 10 deadliest plane crashes of all time.   It’s worth noting at this point that 2017 is on its way to being one of the safest years in aviation history, with just 37 crashes and 117 fatalities so far, according to the Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives. Last year, too, was one of the safest. 10. American Airlines Flight 191 Date: May 25, 1979 Fatalities: 272 The DC-10 left Chicago O’Hare on the Friday afternoon of Memorial Day weekend only for its left engine to detach from its wing and fall off, rolling the plane in the air and sending it crashing to earth just a mile from the runway. The plane “burst into a pillar of flame and smoke that could be seen up to eight miles away,” the Chicago Tribune reported at the time. All 271 people on board and two on the ground were killed in what remains America’s worst aviation disaster. How to survive a plane crash The crash was found to be the result of a shortcut taken by removing the plane’s engines for maintenance, cracking an aluminium component which held the engine to the wing. 9. Iranian Air Force Ilyushun II-76 Date: February 19, 2003 Fatalities: 275 The official report into the military aircraft that crashed in the Sirach Mountains near Kerman in Iran found that bad weather, including high winds and fog, brought the plane down, killing all on board, all members of the Revolutionary Guards. The Aviation Safety Network classifies the crash as a Controlled Flight into Terrain. 8. Iran Air Flight 655 Date: July 3, 1988 Fatalities: 290 A controversial incident during tense times in the Gulf, owing to the Iran-Iraq War, the Airbus A300, a civilian airline, was shot down by surface-to-air missiles fired from US military cruiser USS Vincennes, killing all on board. The flight was in Iranian airspace, over Iranian territorial waters and on its usual flight path, yet, according to the US government, Vincennes mistook it for an F-14A Tomcat fighter plane. Crew on the American ship made 10 attempts to contact the Iran Air aircraft on military and civilian radio frequencies, with no response, before firing. Iranians mark the 21st anniversary of the downing of a Iranian passenger jet by the US Credit: 2009 AFP/ABOLFATH DAVARI In 1996 the US government and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice, the former expressing “deep regret over the loss of lives”, but not admitting legal liability or formally apologising. The US agreed to pay $213,103.45 compensation per passenger, about £346,000 in today’s valuation. 7. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Date: July 17, 2014 Fatalities: 298 A similar incident took place over eastern Ukraine when a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down near the Russian border, likely by pro-Russian forces in control of the region during the War in Donbass between separatist insurgents and the Ukrainian government. All 298 on board died when the plane crashed into a field near Torez. Some airlines had already begun to avoid Ukrainian airspace owing to the Crimean crisis that began early in 2014, with the International Civil Aviation Organisation warning of a risk to passenger jets in the area, but not all carriers had changed their routes. A fire burns amid the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Credit: DOMINIQUE FAGET In September 2016, Dutch prosecutors concluded that the missile used to shoot down the plane had been transported into eastern Ukraine from Russia, adding that the launch vehicle returned across the border a day after the crash. The conflict in the region is ongoing. 6. Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 163 Date: August 19, 1980 Fatalities: 301 The death of all 301 passengers on board the Lockheed L-1011 on the runway at Riyadh is the world’s deadliest aviation accident not to involve a crash or mid-flight break up. The flight took off from the Saudi capital airport en route to Jeddah, only to return to Riyadh minutes later for an emergency landing after a fire started in the cargo department. However, when the plane landed, instead of initiating an emergency evacuation, the pilot taxied the aircraft back towards the airport, stopping on the runway for nearly three minutes. It then took some 23 minutes to access the aircraft once the engines were stopped. By the time the doors were opened all on board had died from smoke inhalation. The source of the fire is believed to have been two butane stoves in the cargo. An evacuation was never initiated. At a glance | 10 deadliest years in aviation history 5. Air India Flight 182 Date: June 23, 1985 Fatalities: 329 Deemed the deadliest terror attack involving a plane at the time, the Air India Boeing 747 crashed off the coast of Ireland en route from Toronto to Sahar International in India, after a bomb placed in the cargo hold by Sikh extremists Babbar Khalsa exploded over the Atlantic. The passenger responsible is believed to be 'M Singh' who checked himself onto the flight - along with a suitcase - but did not board. A second bomb intended to go off in tandem on another flight exploded early in the terminal building at Narita Airport, Japan. An investigation into the bombing of Flight 182 found numerous failings in the security processes in Canada that allowed the terrorist attack to be successful. A number of memorials commemorate those who died, in Canada and Ireland. 4. Turkish Airlines Flight 981 Date: March 3, 1974 Fatalities: 346 A design flaw on the Douglas DC-10 led an aircraft carrying 335 passengers and 11 crew to crash in the Ermenonville Forest north of Paris, after taking off from Orly Airport bound for London Heathrow, en route from Istanbul. Around 10 minutes after the plane took off from Orly, the rear left cargo door blew off owing to a problem with how the hatches latched shut - they could be forced shut by baggage handlers without the pins locking correctly - causing an explosive decompression in the cabin and severing cables linking the flight deck with the aircraft’s elevators, rudder and two engines. The aircraft pitched sharply nose-down and began picking up speed as the pilots lost control, before it crashed into trees travelling at around 490mph. In the wake of the accident, the locking mechanism on the cargo doors was redesigned. The crash remains the deadliest single-plane crash with no survivors, the worst on French soil and the second worst in Europe. Safest years in aviation history | Total deaths 3. Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision Date: November 12, 1996 Fatalities: 349 The world’s deadliest mid-air crash involved Saudia Flight 763 and Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907 over the city of Charkhi Dadri in northern India. The Saudia-operated Boeing 747 was bound for Dhahran from Delhi while the Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin II-76 was bound for Indira airport from Shymkent when they collided, killing 312 people on board the former and 37 on the latter. The crash occurred after the Ilyushin aircraft was cleared to descend to 15,000 feet, but then descended past that level to 14,500 feet while the 747 was ascending in the opposite direction. By the time the air traffic controller could warn of the proximity between the two aircraft it was too late. The tail of the Kazakhstan plane cut through the Saudia wing, causing the aircraft to go into a rapidly descending spiral, while the Ilyushin entered a gentler but still fast and uncontrolled descent. The captain of a passing US Air Force aircraft saw the crash and described a “a large cloud lit up with an orange glow”. A number of factors were found to have caused the crash, including the failure of the Kazakhstan Airlines pilot to follow the ATC instructions.

Japan Airlines Flight 123 Date: August 12, 1985 Fatalities: 520 The largest single aircraft accident in history was the crash of a Boeing 747 into Mount Takamagahara in central Japan. Just four survived when the aircraft spiralled out of control, its wing clipping a mountain ridge, before flipping and landing on its back, following an explosive decompression towards the rear of the plane, the result of a faulty repair job seven years earlier. Pilots were able to keep the plane in the air for 32 minutes after the mechancial failure - a time that has not been matched repeating the scenario in flight simulators since - before crashing into a mountain. Today, there is a shrine on the mountain dedicated to the crash, as well as a museum opened by the airlines that includes last letters and notes written by passengers to loved ones, to which all staff must visit. Though four passengers were able to survive, all female and sat in the middle of rows towards the rear of the aircraft, some concluded that more could have been saved had the wreckage been reached quicker by rescuers, and the offer of assistance from a nearby US base been accepted. A month after the crash a Japan Airlines maintenance official committed suicide, leaving a note, “I am atoning with my death”. 1. Tenerife Airport Disaster Date: March 27, 1977 Fatalities: 583 “The magnitude of the accident speaks for itself, but what makes it particularly unforgettable is the startling set of ironies and coincidences that preceded it,” wrote author and pilot Patrick Smith of the accident that took place at Tenerife North Airport (formerly Los Rodeos) 40 years ago, when two Boeing 747s, one belonging to KLM, the other to Pan Am, collided on a foggy runway. Los Rodeos air crash Neither of the two aircraft were supposed to be at Los Rodeos, both having been diverted away from Las Palmas on the nearby island of Gran Canaria, after it transpired that Canary Island separatists planted a bomb in the airport flower shop. The collision occurred when the KLM aircraft attempted to take-off without clearance while the Pan Am aircraft was still taxiing along the same runway, having missed its turning to leave. As the KLM 747 emerges from dense fog, having begun an errant take-off, owing to poor communication and confusion over radio contact, the pilot of the Pan Am was recorded as saying “There he is! Look at him! Goddamn, that son of a bitch is coming!” The KLM attempted to leapfrog the Pan Am but couldn’t and clipped the mid-section of the latter with its belly. There were no survivors on the KLM flight while 61 of the 396 on the Pan Am survived.

Irkut Corporation plans initial production of 20 planes a year, increasing to 70 by 2023. Read more Russia’s new civilian airliner takes off on maiden flight (PHOTOS, VIDEOS) The aircraft is expected to compete with the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 and China’s COMAC C919. “We plan to complete the testing in 2018. We are starting the second stage of flight testing for the PD-14 engine. The airliner will be powered only by Russian-made jet engines starting in spring 2019,” said Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin at the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The first examples of the airliner are to be powered by Pratt & Whitney PW1400G engines, while those for the domestic market will use the new PD-14 engine. The Prime Minister ordered a rethink of the commercial prospects for the plane, as new contracts could boost the country’s economy. According to Rogozin, the issue will be discussed at a meeting of the aviation board. Rogozin said the new aircraft would be sold with a 'full circle contract' meaning the manufacturer will be responsible for the planes through delivery until they are operating on revenue earning flights. “As the МС-21 is ahead of its rivals, Boeing and Airbus. We are seeking to announce the price which will be much more competitive than the one set by US and European colleagues,” Rogozin said.

X Ryanair offers to take over Alitalia’s short-haul business Irish airline’s profits grew by 6 per cent last year to €1.3 billion Tue, May 30, 2017, 06:52 Updated: Tue, May 30, 2017, 10:03 Barry O'Halloran Ryanair flew 120 million passengers in the course of its financial year, up 13 per cent on the previous year. Photograph: Reuters         Ryanair plans to offer Alitalia a deal that would see the airline effectively take over the bankrupt Italian carrier’s short-haul business while also selling its long-haul flights on its website. The Irish airline said on Tuesday that it grew profits after tax by 6 per cent to €1.316 billion in the 12 months to March 31st and announced plans to return €600 million to investors through a share buy-back scheme. According to chief commerical officer, David O’Brien, Ryanair is planning to propose a tranfser deal to the government-appointed commissioners s charged with saving Alitalia. Under its terms, Ryanair would take over much of Alitalia’s short-haul business and feed passengers to its long-distance network. “We’d even sell their long-haul flights on our website,” Mr O’Brien added. While analysts were not sure that the Italians would accept the deal they suggested that government efforts to save the flag carrier could deliver an outcome that would suit Ryanair. “They cannot keep it on life support but keeping it as a long-haul focused airline, which Ryanair would like, is an option,” one said. Ryanair has a bigger share of the Italian market than its troubled rival. Its operations there flew 36 million passengers in the 12 months ended on March 31st. Chief executive Michael O’Leary confirmed that Ryanair was in talks with Boeing to add “selectively” to the orders it has with the American aircraft manufacturer. The airline took delivery of 52 Boeing 737s in its 2017 financial year. Ryanair flew 120 million passengers during the financial year, an increase of 13 per cent on 2016. It grew revenues by 2 per cent to €6.54 billion. It plans to buy back €600 million worth of equities from investors between this week and October, bringing total returns to shareholders since 2008 to €5.4 billion. Mr O’Leary said Ryanair believed that profits this year could rise 8 per cent to between €1.4 billion and €1.45 billion, subject to a range of uncertainties. “Investors should be wary of the risk of negative Brexit developments, or any repeat of last year’s security events at European cities, which could damage consumer confidence, close-in bookings, and this full-year-18 guidance,” he cautioned.       Topics: David O Brien Michael O Leary Irish Stock Exchange Alitalia Boeing Ryanair Europe United Kingdom Read More Steering parts shortage stalls BMW car production BA left with financial headache and battered reputation Russia squares up to Boeing and Airbus with maiden flight of jet Eight British Airways flights from Dublin cancelled over IT failure Knock Airport leads the way in Irish passenger growth BA chief says he will not resign over IT problems Road Warrior: Alitalia bid deadline ICG sells 21-year-old vessel for €45m What now for DAA as Toland checks out three years early?

The CBI, as the federal police is known, registered three cases and one preliminary inquiry in the light of orders from the Supreme Court in January, according to the statement dated May 29 on its website. The cases include investigating allegations regarding buying planes for 700 billion rupees ($10.8 billion), the CBI said.

While the aircraft orders were made separately, the two national carriers were later merged by 2007 into the National Aviation of India Ltd., which operated under the brand Air India. Allegations The CBI said it’s also investigating allegations of leasing of a large number of aircraft “without due consideration.” Also part of the probe will be allegations about giving up profit-making routes by Air India in favour of national and international private airlines, which caused a “huge loss” to the national carrier, it said.

If the U.K. government doesn't strike any sort of deal with the European Union regarding flying regulations, airlines will have to stop their activities in the country, Neil Sorahan, the chief financial officer of budget airline Ryanair told CNBC. "We need to get some kind of clarity on whether the U.K. is going to stay in the open skies (agreement). It looks like they're not and if they don't then we need to see some movements made in relation to negotiating bilateral agreements," he said. "If these bilateral agreements are not negotiated by October 2018 then the chances of being rectified by March 2019 are very slim, which means there's a distinct possibility that there could be no flights in and out the U.K. for a period of time … days, weeks, months, we don't know," Sorahan warned. show chapters Confident in our IT systems, says Ryanair CFO    Tuesday, 30 May 2017 | 1:43 AM ET | 03:07 The EU's open skies agreement allows for all transatlantic routes to be opened up to EU and U.S. airline firms. Ryanair has been one of the most vocal firms against the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. The Irish airline operates widely across the continent. Its chief executive officer, Michael O'Leary, has said that the airline is "pivoting" its operations towards Europe in the aftermath of Brexit. The U.K.'s Department for Transport has previously replied to these concerns in February. It said it was committed to getting the "best deal possible" from EU exit negotiations. "We will work closely with the international aviation community to ensure that this global industry continues to be a major success story for the U.K. economy," the department said, according to the Financial Times. Sorahan from Ryanair said: "Our biggest concern is that we have no certainty as we roll into this time next year and we are in a position where we're in 12 months we have to start loading our summer schedule for 2019." Meanwhile over the weekend, British Airways saw massive disruption after its IT systems collapsed. However, Sorahan said that Ryanair has invested "an awful lot of money" into its IT systems and it is confident on their reliability. "What happened to them appears to have been a hardware which was impacted by a power surge. We have our critical data over a number of data centers, so if one goes down, it would fall over to the other centers," Sorahan explained. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

X Ryanair offers to take over Alitalia’s short-haul business Irish airline’s profits grew by 6 per cent last year to €1.3 billion Tue, May 30, 2017, 06:52 Updated: Tue, May 30, 2017, 10:03 Barry O'Halloran Ryanair flew 120 million passengers in the course of its financial year, up 13 per cent on the previous year. Photograph: Reuters         Ryanair plans to offer Alitalia a deal that would see the airline effectively take over the bankrupt Italian carrier’s short-haul business while also selling its long-haul flights on its website. The Irish airline said on Tuesday that it grew profits after tax by 6 per cent to €1.316 billion in the 12 months to March 31st and announced plans to return €600 million to investors through a share buy-back scheme. According to chief commerical officer, David O’Brien, Ryanair is planning to propose a tranfser deal to the government-appointed commissioners s charged with saving Alitalia. Under its terms, Ryanair would take over much of Alitalia’s short-haul business and feed passengers to its long-distance network. “We’d even sell their long-haul flights on our website,” Mr O’Brien added. While analysts were not sure that the Italians would accept the deal they suggested that government efforts to save the flag carrier could deliver an outcome that would suit Ryanair. “They cannot keep it on life support but keeping it as a long-haul focused airline, which Ryanair would like, is an option,” one said. Ryanair has a bigger share of the Italian market than its troubled rival. Its operations there flew 36 million passengers in the 12 months ended on March 31st. Chief executive Michael O’Leary confirmed that Ryanair was in talks with Boeing to add “selectively” to the orders it has with the American aircraft manufacturer. The airline took delivery of 52 Boeing 737s in its 2017 financial year. Ryanair flew 120 million passengers during the financial year, an increase of 13 per cent on 2016. It grew revenues by 2 per cent to €6.54 billion. It plans to buy back €600 million worth of equities from investors between this week and October, bringing total returns to shareholders since 2008 to €5.4 billion. Mr O’Leary said Ryanair believed that profits this year could rise 8 per cent to between €1.4 billion and €1.45 billion, subject to a range of uncertainties. “Investors should be wary of the risk of negative Brexit developments, or any repeat of last year’s security events at European cities, which could damage consumer confidence, close-in bookings, and this full-year-18 guidance,” he cautioned.       Topics: David O Brien Michael O Leary Irish Stock Exchange Alitalia Boeing Ryanair Europe United Kingdom Read More Steering parts shortage stalls BMW car production BA left with financial headache and battered reputation Russia squares up to Boeing and Airbus with maiden flight of jet Eight British Airways flights from Dublin cancelled over IT failure Knock Airport leads the way in Irish passenger growth BA chief says he will not resign over IT problems Road Warrior: Alitalia bid deadline ICG sells 21-year-old vessel for €45m What now for DAA as Toland checks out three years early?

The CBI, as the federal law agency is known, registered three cases and one preliminary inquiry in light of orders from the Supreme Court in January, according to the statement dated May 29 on its website. The cases include investigating allegations regarding buying planes for 700 billion rupees (S$15.02 billion), the CBI said. The acquisition allegedly caused a financial loss to the "already stressed" national carrier, it said. Air India spokesman Dhananjay Kumar and a spokeswoman for Boeing in India declined to comment. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Praful Patel, who was India's civil aviation minister at the time of the purchases, and an Airbus spokesman in India didn't immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. In December 2005, India's Cabinet gave an approval to the national carrier to buy 68 aircraft from Boeing Co. In 2006, state-owned Indian Airlines Ltd. inked an agreement to buy 43 planes from Airbus SE. While the aircraft orders were made separately, the two national carriers were later merged by 2007 into the National Aviation Co of India., which operated under the brand Air India. The CBI said it's also investigating allegations of leasing of a large number of aircraft "without due consideration". Also part of the probe will be allegations about giving up profit-making routes by Air India in favour of national and international private airlines, which caused a "huge loss" to the national carrier, it said. Air India's aircraft deal was controversial at the time of the purchase itself. A day after the Mumbai-based carrier chose to buy 23 Boeing 777 aircraft and 27 Dreamliners, Nigel Harwood, Airbus's then vice president of sales for India, said in an interview that the European company wasn't given a "fair chance". Air India denied that, saying it took "strong exception" to the claims. India is considering selling a majority stake in Air India to a strategic partner after a US$3.6 billion (S$5 billion) bailout failed to turn around the loss making national carrier, Bloomberg News reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The proposal includes reviving Air India within five years of selling a 51 per cent stake, they said.

New Russian jet takes to air in bid to rival Airbus, Boeing | Bangkok Post: business News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More BUSINESS Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive E-PAPER SIGN IN About E-Paper Subscribe Free Trial Report problem Contact us Business homepage Business news Telecom Finance Tourism & transport Find company & suppliers Exchange rates More World Gold prices IT Auto Property Business > World New Russian jet takes to air in bid to rival Airbus, Boeing 30 May 2017 at 09:00 1,679 viewed0 comments NEWSPAPER SECTION: BUSINESS | WRITER: REUTERS An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane takes off in Irkutsk, Russia on Sunday. (Irkut Corporation via Reuters) - + MOSCOW: Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation nd its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 kilometres an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing Co and Airbus SAS, plane-making division of Airbus SE. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut general director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15% cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15% operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. "At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot,'' Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC president Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said.

NEW DELHI: The CBI has registered three FIRs against unknown officials of the civil aviation ministry and private persons for alleged irregularities in UPA government's purchase of 111 aircraft for Air India and Indian Airlines at a cost of Rs 70,000 crore, leasing of a large number of aircraft by AI without due consideration, and surrendering of the debt-ridden carrier's profit-making routes and schedules to benefit private players. In addition, the agency has launched a preliminary enquiry (PE) into the 2007 merger of the two public carriers, IA and AI, to ascertain whether the matter needs to be probed further by registering an FIR. The merger followed the decision to place huge orders with Boeing and Airbus, a decision which the agency alleged cost the exchequer "tens of thousands of crores". CBI had been directed by Supreme Court to probe the decisions based on a PIL filed by activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan. It said that in its three FIRs and one PE, it has booked unknown officials of the civil aviation ministry, Air India and unknown private persons for criminal conspiracy, cheating and under the prevention of corruption Act. About the purchase of 111 planes, CBI officials said the original proposal was to buy a total of 28 planes for Air India and Indian Airlines. But the government finally decided to buy 68 for Air India from Boeing, and another 43 for Indian Airlines from Airbus. The twin decisions triggered a controversy, with the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) terming the decision to purchase planes through debt a "recipe for disaster", noting that the decision was taken when the airlines were "in a crisis". The federal auditor also criticised the decision to lease planes, saying they were leased from private operators even while the process to acquire new planes was underway. The CAG criticised the merger as ill-timed and said that the financial case for merger was not "adequately validated". CBI said the FIRs were based on the preliminary inquiries it conducted in the light of the SC's directive and the findings of the CAG and Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, which was also critical of the decisions. "The acquisition was done to benefit private companies," CBI alleged in its FIR into the acquisition of planes. "The entire acquisition (for both Air India and Indian Airlines) was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for Indian Airlines. This was a recipe for disaster and should have raised alarm signals in ministry of civil aviation, Public Investment Board and the Planning Commission", the CAG report had stated. It further said: "This increase in numbers does not withstand audit scrutiny, considering the market requirements obtaining then or forecast for the future, as also the commercial viability projected to justify the acquisition. The acquisition appears to be supply-driven." CBI's second FIR has been registered to probe what it called "irregular leasing of large number of aircraft by Air India without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy". The decision benefited private carriers, the CBI alleged The third FIR has been lodged to investigate AI for giving up profit making routes and timings in favour of national and international private airlines, which again led to a huge loss to the national carrier but came as a boon to private operators. Sources said the PE into the decision to merge the two airlines - the process for which started on March 16, 2006 - would focus on those who were running the civil aviation ministry at the time. Subsequently, a presentation was made to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on March 22, 2006, in which the chairman and managing directors of Indian Airlines and Air India, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and the civil aviation secretary were also present. The move to merge AI and IA was initiated in 2006 by the civil aviation ministry under Praful Patel and was cleared by a group of ministers which included Pranab Mukherjee and P Chidambaram, before being formally approved by the Manmohan Singh Cabinet.

Apart from Civil Aviation Ministry and Air India officials, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked some private unnamed companies in its FIRs lodged under sections of criminal conspiracy and cheating of Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process which caused to the national air carrier to face a financial crunch, a CBI official said. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former Finance Minister P. Chidamabram's son Karti in a money laundering case. The agency took the step on Supreme Court's January 5 order pertaining to the affairs of the Civil Aviation ministry under the previous United Progressive Alliance government. The court has reportedly asked the CBI to complete the probe by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the purchase of the Boeing aircraft. The first FIR related to purchase of 111 aircraft for Air India costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufactures while the second mentions leasing of large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy. A CBI official said the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on. The official said the agency in its third FIR will probe the cause of giving up profit making routes and profit making timings of Air India in favour of national and international private airlines causing a huge loss to the national carrier.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, May 30, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Russia launches maiden jet flight Reuters, MOSCOW Russia on Sunday carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corp and its state-controlled parent company, United Aircraft Corp (UAC), said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000m and traveling at 300kph. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and would be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. However, Western aviation sources expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent three-to-four-hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight.” A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Irkut director-general Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees on what the Kremlin called “a significant event.” The twin-engine MS-21 is to be built in two variants: the MS-21-300, which is to have 160 to 211 seats, and the later MS-21-200, which is to have 130 to 165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and Russian state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. The US’ Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. However, the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts said, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane would be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000km, the MS-21 would be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies have upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared with previous versions. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1399 times.

This new method enables the integration of electrical, optical and structural component during the build process. A component 3D printed using the THREAD process. Photo courtesy of AMRC. Based out of the University of Sheffield and working with aircraft manufacturing company Boeing, AMRC says this new patent-pending process will allow for parts to be additively manufactured with built-in, continuous connectivity and functionalities. Currently, the fully automated THREAD processes has been successfully demonstrated on polymer 3D printing machines. However, AMRC believes THREAD can be applied to a wide range of AM platforms. “THREAD has scope to simultaneously add multiple industry-recognised threads of differing materials into one component, giving the component additional functions,” explains AMRC Development Engineer and AM specialist Mark Cocking. “This will open AM up to a greater variety of uses.” Cocking adds that this development is significant in the fact that is crosses into so many different industries and has the ability to revolutionize the medical, aerospace and automotive sectors. THREAD will be an advantage in the manufacture of components requiring encapsulated electronics. This new 3D printing process can be developed as an add-on technology for existing AM platforms and also incorporated into next generation AM technologies. “We see THREAD transforming the functionality of additively manufactured components,” says Chris Iveson, who is driving the commercialisation of the technology. “Feedback from our contacts in various industries indicates a real need for this capability, with new potential applications being discussed daily. This is a great example of the AMRC using its unique expertise to solve real industry problems.” The AMRC with Boeing is continually developing THREAD technology for various markets. www.amrc.co.uk Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags 3D printing AMRC Boeing THREAD Related 3M develops new technology for 3D printing polymers Boeing awards OPM with 3D printing contract for Starliner spacecraft Researchers develop the world’s largest solid 3D printed tool for aircraft manufacturing Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Published: 14:55 May 29, 2017 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Moscow: Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic aeroplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engined MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 per cent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 per cent operational savings compared to previous versions. BOX — Airbus Helicopters starts construction of assembly line in China PARIS: Airbus Helicopters, the world’s largest supplier of commercial helicopters, has started building an assembly line in China in what Europe’s largest aerospace group said was a key step in its plans to tap into the Chinese market. The company’s final assembly line will be located in Qingdao, eastern China, with construction expected to be completed by 2018. An Airbus framework agreement signed in 2016 called for 100 H135 helicopters to be assembled over the next 10 years, and the first aircraft roll-out from Qingdao is planned for mid-2019. Guillaume Faury, chief executive of Airbus Helicopters, said in a statement that the start of construction demonstrated the company’s “commitment to further enhancing our industrial cooperation with China’s rapidly growing aviation industry”. -Reuters More from Aviation Iata AGM to discuss electronics ban ADAFZ grants 200th licence Barcelona moves to low-cost, long-haul flights Boeing delays Norwegian’s order a second time Know the rules for taking pics on a plane Etihad Airways deploys A380 on all JFK flights Canada’s defence minister threat against Boeing Get Dubai discounts with this boarding pass filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation Also In AviationIata AGM to discuss electronics ban Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Know the rules for taking pics on a plane 02Barcelona moves to low-cost, long-haul flights 03ADAFZ grants 200th licence 04Boeing delays Norwegian’s order a second time 05Iata AGM to discuss electronics ban 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 2Images China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet takes off May 05, 2017 15Images First ‘Silk Road’ train leaves UK for China Apr 11, 2017 8Images Dubai’s next big mall gets into project mode Mar 16, 2017 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Woman killed minutes before ending fast UK PM says enough is enough after attack Woman arrested for stealing Dh11 million Over 50,000 private sector firms fined Palm residents caught in beach dispute Double tragedy as son, mum die days apart Shah Rukh Khan slams Ramez after prank In Pictures: London Bridge terror attack ‘Forests’ under bridges to beautify Dubai Close Recommended For You Sisters die trapped inside father's car PUBLISHED ON Jun 04, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the “Saturday Night Fever” heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. (FILES) A file photo taken on July 12, 2002, shows Hollywood star and Qantas “Ambassador-at-Large” John Travolta, standing in front of his Boeing 707 at Sydney Airport./ AFP PHOTO / Greg Wood Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Lt. Col. Robert Vaucher and Joe Wing both served on B-29s during the war. The airplane will land at noon accompanied by other World War II airplanes, including a C-45 Expeditor, T-6 Texan and a collection of World War II aircraft from the local Commemorative Air Force Delaware Valley Wing based at Princeton Airport. Vaucher, a decorated World War II veteran, was a B-29 aircraft commander. He piloted the first B-29 Superfortress accepted from Boeing by the U.S. Army Air Corp, delivering it to the U.S. Air Corp 40th Bomb Group in Pratt, Kansas. He also flew the first B-29 strategic combat mission over mainland Japan on June 15, 1944, and also the longest B-29 mission - 4,030 miles round trip - from India to Sumatra on Aug. 10, 1944. Wing served as a gunner and back up flight engineer on B-29s during World War II flying over 30 missions from Tinian to Japan. One of his last missions was flying with the Enola Gay the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The B-29, Fifi, is one of only two remaining airworthy B-29s in the world and is the only one that is flown regularly. The aircraft will remain at the airport on Tuesday and Wednesday, and tours of the aircraft are available for $10 for adults and $5 for children ages 11 to 17. Those under 11 can see inside the aircraft at no charge. Fees for flights range from $80 to $1,595 and reservations may be made at online.

The contract includes design and development, hardware procurement, technical reviews, risk reduction, and product support and engineering tasks. Work will be conducted in Orlando, Fla., and St. Louis, Mo. The project is expected to be completed by April 2020. Navy Fiscal 2017 research, development, testing, and evaluation funds of $21 million will be allocated to the program at the time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the fiscal year. The IRST is designed to locate the heat emitted by aircraft engines without the use of active radar, which is easily detected by enemy planes and ships. It also helps countering stealth technology. The system has already seen service aboard a King Air test-bed aircraft. The Super Hornet fighter is the primary Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, capable of land and carrier-based operations. The plane is expected to be upgraded and in use until the 2040s.

According to Izvestia, Moscow hopes that the talks will open a new page in bilateral relations, which hit the skids during Francois Hollande’s term as president. French experts told the newspaper that Macron is also interested in contacting the Russian leader, since this will allow him to demonstrate that his foreign policy is independent.

Despite all that sharp rhetoric, the new French president invariably stressed that dialogue with Moscow is essential. Macron’s headquarters refrained from commenting on the upcoming talks to Izvestia, preferring "to wait for the results." According to French experts, the meeting with Putin will help Macron prove himself as an independent head of state. "The upcoming meeting is more important for Macron than for Putin. The new French leader has a crucial aim - to show that he is a strong president, and he really has the opportunity to demonstrate that he is not a puppet of Angela Merkel," French analyst, one of the founders of Stratpol analytical portal Xavier Moreau told Izvestia. An expert of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) told Izvestia "The anti-Russian and pro-NATO lobby is extremely strong in the French establishment," noting that by welcoming Putin, Macron will be displaying political willpower and courage. The Russian Ambassador to France Alexander Orlov was optimistic about the possibility of a warming in the countries’ bilateral relations. He noted that with the rise of a bright and competent president to power in France, Moscow and Paris have hopes for friendlier ties. In addition, expectations are in the air that the new leader of France will show more independence than former President Hollande.   Kommersant: Top Russian officials take off for Egypt to bolster strategic alliance Russia’s top diplomat and defense chief are heading to Egypt to meet their counterparts in a 2+2 format meeting set to be held in Cairo. The event will focus on bilateral issues, such as new weapons deals and the restoration of air travel, as well as the numerous regional problems, namely terrorist attacks against Christians in Egypt, chaos plaguing neighboring Libya, the ongoing wars in Syria and Yemen, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Kommersant wrote. This is the third meeting between the ministers in the 2+2 format. According to Kommersant’s diplomatic source in Moscow, the parties will discuss "the possibility of prolonging or re-signing the agreement for a strategic partnership between Russia and Egypt, which was signed in 2009 (for 10 years) by then-presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Hosni Mubarak." Read also Putin highlights Russia’s solid ties with Egypt According to a source from the Russian Ministry of Defense, another topic on the agenda is implementing a package of contracts for around $3.5 bln, signed in 2014, which include deliveries of Russian air defense systems to Cairo, as well as artillery, small arms, and aviation. The issue can be considered settled, the newspaper’s source in the military-technical cooperation project said, adding that all that is left is to "agree on the price." According to Kommersant's diplomatic source in Moscow, during the talks "the ministers will certainly discuss the deadlocked topic of resuming air travel between the two countries, although this is not an essential matter for Lavrov and Shoigu." The situation in Libya will also be a major topic for discussion. "In the international arena, Moscow and Cairo are increasingly acting as partners, and in some cases as situational allies," the newspaper wrote, so talks on the conflict in Yemen, the Palestinian-Israeli settlement and the war in Syria are also to be expected. According to a Kommersant source in the Russian Defense Ministry, Sergey Shoigu is going to talk in detail about the four zones of de-escalation created in Syria with the help of Russia, Iran and Turkey. Earlier, Moscow believed that the Egyptian military could participate in protecting these zones. The Russian diplomatic source told Kommersant that this issue is still relevant.   Vedomosti: Russia’s MC-21 to challenge Boeing, Airbus as maiden flight is major success Russia’s MC-21-300 aircraft completed a successful maiden flight on May 28, after the event had been postponed several times. According to Vedomosti, the MC-21 will have to compete not only with Airbus and Boeing, but also with China’s C919 aircraft. The MC-21 is an airliner in the most popular segment of narrow-body civilian aircraft, dominated by Airbus and Boeing. According to its developer, Irkut (part of United Aircraft Corporation), deliveries of the MC-21 will begin once it receives its certificate in 2019. A federal official told the newspaper, it was planned to roll out 900-1,000 aircraft in total, with up to two-thirds earmarked for export. Read also Russia gets hundreds of orders for MC-21 new medium-haul airliner Overall, the price tag for developing the MC-21 will come to about 245 bln rubles ($4.31 bln), two federal officials told Vedomosti. Orders for 312 aircraft have already been received. "The first flight is a beginning for flight tests, which will demonstrate whether the announced characteristics live up to expectations. If it fails, then the program will have problems. However, a composite wing and good aerodynamics offer reasons to expect success,” Infomost Consulting CEO Boris Rybak told Vedomosti. According to the newspaper, the MC-21 will have to compete not only with Airbus and Boeing, but also with Chinese C919. Both countries are targeting roughly the same export markets, vying for third after Airbus and Boeing in developing countries due to state support of sales and political arrangements, a source close to United Aircraft Corporation told the newspaper, adding that China might have more political weight and money. Fyodor Borisov from Institute for Transport Economics at the Higher School of Economics told Vedomosti, that China still lags significantly behind Russia in the aircraft industry, although the gap is rapidly narrowing. According to the expert, the C919 will be widely popular outside of China and its satellite countries. Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Labor shortage fears being stoked to raise retirement age The latest concern topping President Putin’s economic agenda is the country’s labor shortage. The team of Alexey Kudrin, Head of the Center for Strategic Research, and ex-Finance Minister, will present his economic strategy to the president before the end of May. While the supporters of raising the retirement age are currently in the majority, in reality the labor shortage problem can transpire only if labor policy does not boost productivity, upgrade production or improve economic efficiency, the newspaper wrote. According to a new forecast by the Economic Development Ministry, from 2016 to 2020, the number of the working-age Russians (men aged 16-59, women - 16-54) will diminish by about 3 mln people. According to the newspaper, this is not the first time the ministry has warned about a negative demographic trend. However, right now “this topic is becoming crucial to the country’s strategy that faces the task of modernizing production, introducing new technologies, and increasing efficiency.” Read also Russia may increase retirement age in 6-18 years — ex-finance minister Russian government has not made decision on retirement age hike — minister IMF recommends to reexamine retirement age in Russia to keep pension payments strong Russia's economy ministry: raising retirement age is global trend Russian Economic Development Ministry supports raising retirement age to 63-65 “Demographic ‘fearmongering’ help justify unpopular economic decisions. The population in Russia is aging, the number of employees is decreasing, so people need to tighten their belts, and pension payouts to the older generation need to be put off - this logic can be found in a new strategy put together by Alexey Kudrin’s team. The Ministry of Finance tends to agree with it,” Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote. The experts interviewed by the newspaper believe that the impending labor shortage is overblown. Official unemployment in Russia is slowly declining. And given the current pace, the number of jobless in Russia will drop from 4.2 mln people (on average per month) in 2016, to 3.7 mln people by 2020, Professor of Labor and Social Policy Department of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration Alexander Shcherbakov told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "Unemployment is the classic, foremost reserve of manpower," he told the newspaper. "I think that as far as Russia's labor market is concerned, with proper regulation, the shortage of workers will not be a significant threat by 2020," the expert added. Talks about a dearth in the working-age population is another ploy to justify raising the retirement age, Solid Management analyst Sergei Zvenigorodsky told the newspaper, adding that raising the retirement age might be dangerous as it could lead to a decrease in the overall level of wages, and in unemployment.   Izvestia: IT watchdog to outline restrictions on video content for websites with Russian audience Russia’s Internet watchdog is laying out a set of rules for thwarting viewers for online theaters. Those who have more than 100,000 visitors from Russia per day will have to introduce additional restrictions on video content and ensure age-related rating of the content, Izvestia wrote citing the draft law. The law on online cinemas will come into force in Russia on July 1. It will concern audiovisual services, visited by more than 100,000 users per day in Russia and prohibits screening videos that justify extremism, contain pornography, obscene language, and the like, without the age-restricting ratings. Read also Presidential aide says Russia’s law on online movie theaters won’t affect YouTube Until recently, the watchdog did not set out any guidelines to count website traffic - now, a user would have to watch a video for at least 15 seconds or just stay on a webpage to be considered a “visitor”. According to Tvzavr CEO, Marina Surigina, online cinemas have many different ‘counters’ that enable it to analyze users’ behavior and to tally them up. “We do not care what counter we will be asked to use, it only needs to be free and easy to install,” she added. “Of course, I would like the watchdog to choose one that has already been installed by almost everybody (for example, Mediascope) or some kind of free analogue. We do not want to pay for additional counters, which we do not really need,” she told the newspaper. According to J'son & Partners Consulting, in 2016 the volume of the Russian market for legitimate video services reached 11.18 bln rubles ($196.76 mln), which is 32% more than in 2015. According to the company's estimates, by 2020 the revenues of legal video services in Russia will increase to about 20 bln rubles ($352.01 mln).   TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in the press reviews {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News June 04, 17:34 In connection with terrorist acts in London police arrest 12 people June 04, 17:34 June 05, 3:49 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference June 05, 3:49 June 04, 14:09 Death toll from London terrorist attacks rises to seven June 04, 14:09 June 04, 8:51 Putin's annual televised Q&A session due on June 15 June 04, 8:51 In other media Реклама Photo 9 Results of Vladimir Putin's visit to Serbia 11 38th mission to the International Space Station over, cosmonauts back to earth 15 This week in photos: Cannes awards, Moscow storm and supermodel's charity marathon Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference 2 Putin recommends US not to teach Russia how to live 3 Lives of those who turned Trump’s alleged ties with Russia into sensation boring - Putin 4 Russia’s economic policy no longer depends on oil prices - Economic Development Minister 5 Russian cruise missiles hit terrorist targets near Palmyra 6 Over 2,000 servicemen take part in final stage of Russian-Tajik anti-terror drills 7 British military intelligence doc calls Russian T-14 Armata tank ‘most revolutionary tank’ 1 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 2 Russia’s economic policy no longer depends on oil prices - Economic Development Minister 3 More than 380 agreements were signed at SPIEF-2017 for 2 trillion rubles ($35.32 bln) 4 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference 5 Six people died in terrorist acts in London - police 6 Trump following London attacks calls for stopping being politically correct 7 Chairman of Saudi Aramco on meeting with Putin, travelling to Arctic and OPEC deal 1 Moscow concerned over US threats against Syria’s armed forces 2 Russia’s cutting-edge fighter jet to enter service this year 3 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane 'unprecedented' 4 Russian cruise missiles hit terrorist targets near Palmyra 5 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 6 Russian anti-submarine destroyer enters English Channel 7 Putin jokes about climate change, US hegemony at St. Petersburg forum TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

SYDNEY: Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his “beloved” Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the “Saturday Night Fever” heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Irkut Corporation is a Russian aircraft manufacturer and member of the United Aircraft Corporation. The duration of the flight was 30 minutes at the altitude of 1000 m, at the speed of 300 km/hour, said a statement from the company. The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant, it said. According to the programme, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft, it added. The new aircraft is Russia's first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors usch as Boeing and Airbus. The test flight comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus, said a Reuters report. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly, Reuters added. The MC-21-300 aircraft was piloted by the crew commander Oleg Kononenko and copilot Roman Taskayev. Kononenko said: “Flight mission is accomplished. The flight went in the normal mode. There are no obstacles revealed preventing the tests continuation.” Roman Taskayev said: “Characteristics and operational modes of the power plant are confirmed, all aircraft systems operated without glitches.” Oleg Demchenko, president of Irkut Corporation, said: “Today is the historic day for our personnel and the whole big team, which works on creation of MC-21 aircraft.” “We put the most advanced technical solutions in our aircraft, to provide enhanced comfort for passengers and attractive economic characteristics for air carriers,” he said. “I am happy to declare the maiden flight of the MC-21 aircraft has been successfully accomplished. I congratulate all project participants on our common holiday,” he added. Yury Slyusar, president of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), said: “MC-21 is created in a wide cooperation, where together with Irkut, other enterprises of the UAC are actively participating, namely Aerocomposite company, Ulyanovsk and Voronezh aircraft plants, UAC Integration Centre in Moscow.” “This is an important stage in the formation of the new UAC industrial model. According to our estimates, the global demand in the MC-21 segment will be about 15,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years. I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he added. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: | Russia | aircraft | flight | maiden | Irkut | More Industry, Logistics & Shipping Stories Le Beck wins approval to operate in Saudi Arabia Alba appoints director of global export markets Saudi delegation visits Dafza to discuss cooperation Siemens makes key appointment Canon Middle East launches two new DSLR cameras Michelin holds tyre safety campaign Iran’s Mapna builds two mobile power plants Evonik to focus on innovation for growth Iran firm, Gazprom plan compressed gas plant V-Line sets up new unit in Saudi Arabia AkzoNobel backs Ocean Cleanup's landmark effort Baidu partners with German firms on Autonomous driving Sabic backs Madinah education academy Saudi 'plans to build major aircraft facility' Sharp slowdown in ME air freight growth Australia’s Victoria state, Mena trade sees steady growth Russian firm plans showcase new jet at Dubai Air Show Aramco signs landmark JV agreement for maritime yard The Fjords to build 'all electric' ship Sadara launches region’s first PMDI facility Saudi Electricity Company seals Al Safwa Cement deal SWCC, DuPont join hands to improve desal facilities GE, Saudi Arabia deals to focus on mining, energy, healthcare Emerson releases new Syncade MES version Thales makes senior appointments in Middle East Hyundai high-performance prototypes prove their strength Rockwell Automation develops 3-step industrial security programme Sejel Technology selects HPE platform DMCC chief joins trade delegation to Canada Ooredoo supports SMEs forum in Oman Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Right now it’s only a press release and a few concept images, but it looks like this is an air-launched system kind of like a Tristar/Pegasus, only much higher and completely unmanned. It’s a ton and a half to low earth orbit, with a goal of 10 flights in 10 days. Up in Albany? There’s a new hacker con happening in a few weeks. Anycon is a hacking, infosec, and cyber security conference happening June 16 & 17th in Albany, NY. The organizers of this con ([Chris], and his company Leet Cybersecurity) are loosely modeling this con after Derbycon. [Dave Kennedy] of TrustedSec will be attending as the keynote speaker. GOOD NEWS! [Casey Neistat] is under investigation by the FAA. [Casey Neistat] is the YouTuber that flies drones right in the middle of the Hudson River corridor, and is a menace to general aviation around NYC. This is neat. The Supplyframe Design Lab is the Hackaday Mothership right in the middle of Pasadena where we host our designers in residence, host a few meetups, and slowly fill every cubic inch of space with either dust or tools. The Design Lab just won a design award. You can check out the ‘design’ part of the Design Lab here, but keep in mind it will never be that clean ever again. Here’s an interesting Twitter to follow. Alitronik is a curator of the weird and wonderful cheap crap that can be found on AliExpress. Need an Altera Cyclone dev board? Here you go. A desk-mountable OLED inspection microscope? Done. A seven dollar Tesla coil? Dude, you can totally fit this inside a hat. [Drygol] had a nice old Commodore C16 with a broken TED chip. A shame, really. He did what anyone would do: put a C64 motherboard in the case for a fancy stealth upgrade. Is the great crowdfunded 3D printer boom over? Some would say that ship sailed after dozens of 3D printer crowdfunding projects failed to deliver, or delivered very low-quality machines. These people were wrong. This Polaroid-branded 3D printing pen might not get funding. A year ago, this project would have been funded on day one. There would have been writeups in The Verge on how Polaroid is turning the corner after decades of wasted opportunities. Now, the Crowdfunded 3D printer boom is finally over. The Hackaday crew was at the Bay Area Maker Faire last weekend and holy crap did we have a blast. Everyone came to the meetup on Saturday except for the fire marshall. The secret OSHPark bringahack on Sunday was even more impressive. We also saw a Donkey Car capable of driving around a track autonomously, but the team behind it didn’t have their work up on the Internet at the time.

Do you even have a valid point? The included chart you post shows it is legal. Sounds more to me like you are a jealous piece of crap and have already lost. Report comment Reply Silis says: May 28, 2017 at 5:45 pm The links shows that light aircraft are actively using the area, therefore making flying quad copters there a dangerous thing. Although we should note that it does not matter what argument you make, as calling someone a ‘jealous piece of crap’ disqualifies you from a discussion instantly.

They were hit quite badly by the complete obsolescence of chemical-based photography. Now you can get a few Chinese megafactory-made TVs with Polaroid’s name on them. Next week it’ll be a caffeinated fruit juice. Nobody cares. If Polaroid aren’t making instant film cameras, it isn’t Polaroid, and nobody wants an instant film camera anyway.

That’s the new curse: “may your children become youtubers” Report comment Reply Greenaum says: May 29, 2017 at 8:02 am Actually the face-punching thing is one Youtube channel I’d watch. Since they’re all desperate, cheap whores, they’d probably let you do it for a hundred dollars. Line the fuckers up, stupid, vacant, ugly mugs, one after another, spouting their vapid ideas and their complete ignorance of basically everything. Then we get somebody sensible to come in, perhaps wearing a mortar board, academic gown, and boxing gloves. He beats their stupid, uncomprehending, still smiling faces to a pulp, to a 10-second loop of Sandstorm by Darude. I’d actually enjoy watching that. Next week, we take petrol bombs round the bedrooms / garages / “recording studios” of all the idiots who’ve decided that reinventing traditional network TV channels, ON YOUTUBE, is going to make their millions. Then after that, it’s a visit to Hell, to see those special souls who use utterly misleading thumbnails and descriptions for their banal videos of still photographs with narration over them.

Report comment Reply Greenaum says: May 29, 2017 at 8:07 am Aren’t Tesla coils supposed to resonate in some special Tesla fashion?

And they are suddenly hit by all kinds of problems on locations that they can use. All thanks to drones causing problems.

Any mass of humans is incredibly stupid, it’s a law passed by the Gods in Ancient Greece. So, cheap mass-manufacturing has killed a formerly responsible hobby. It happens all the time. The Internet was better too before absolutely everybody got on it. Report comment Reply Biomed says: May 28, 2017 at 11:35 pm I assume you are referencing Neistat. Risk of an incident is non-zero, hence that no incident has happened yet is entirely moot, all we have to do is wait, he’s using airspace that is rich with potential incidents. Even if you never get your feet off the ground, the ground is where a disaster ends up, and a major city is a crowded place. Want that on your head? Complaining to “Dude” is the wrong place… it’s Neistat that’s taken possession of the risk that threatens to end with much more strict regulations imposed on us. If you wish to dispute still… simply prove the risk is actually zero. Report comment Reply Brian Benchoff says: May 29, 2017 at 6:12 pm ^ This shit right here. Fly right over an airport in the middle of Idaho when there are no planes for miles? I don’t care. Fly over the Hudson at 1000 feet during VFR conditions? Execution by Boosted Board. Report comment Reply Biomed says: May 30, 2017 at 2:21 am Actually Brian, I care very much in both cases, but the author of this article seemed to restrict it to Neistat as the issue. Small airport operators are typically quite cooperative. I set up one AMA flying field right across the freeway from an active small airport on the other side of the city, light aircraft and ultralights, but asked permission rather than simply informing them in writing as required because our runway was right in line with their runway. Excessively cooperative, even offered that we just use his runway instead! Tried hard to get us. Went further and offered to pour a 50/50 mix of dirt and concrete over one stretch for us so it would be smooth for the small wheels. But, the county was providing us the land for modelling and already had the work release crew from county jail there for me to oversee and build the runway for us, so we stuck with the county plan which included moving us on top of a nearby hill a couple years down the road, plus they were providing liability insurance in addition to the insurance an AMA club enjoys. I’d worked that all out with them a couple years earlier. Next example, there is an airport in the northern half of the state has two paved runways for small jet aviation. Tuesday and Thursday evenings, and weekends alternating Saturday and Sunday, one runway is closed for the modellers to use. It works out nice. Pavement is fun to master landings on! I served as president of the AMA club here at home for something like 10 yrs. Not mentioned in proper sequence, but the County gave us the land for the very first runway at a local park just 3 miles away from the runway, and half a mile to the side of the local County Regional Airport approach. Again, I worked with the airport to not only inform them in writing, but to have them define all the flight restrictions they wished the club to use. It was easy… I just stepped out of the house and walked 3/4 block to the airport, knocked on the control tower door. They already knew me, took care of business for the club plus as Scout Leader arranged for the Scouts to get a guided tour of the control tower and air traffic control. Lotta people misunderstand RC Modelling…. but airport operators don’t. They know those models are a gateway drug addicting you into getting a pilot’s license. They see the money tied up in the models. They’re most accommodating! Report comment Reply Greenaum says: May 29, 2017 at 8:12 am The risk is a drone getting sucked into a jet intake, or smashing a smaller plane’s windscreen, or some other important part, possibly causing a crash. Of course birds can do the same, but we can’t actually do anything to legislate against birds. They just don’t pay any attention, the avian scofflaws. Perhaps if sentences were harsher… Anyway… Drones contain harder parts than birds, and they don’t test engines for drone-strike. Since drones are man-made things, it’s better to keep them out of the way altogether. It would be stupid to wait for an accident to happen, when prevention is easy, and all that we’re losing is a bit of airspace for hobbyists. When human lives are one the line, it’s a fair trade.

Report comment Reply Erin says: May 29, 2017 at 12:33 pm The Tristar/Pegasus comparison for XS-1 and its payload seems wrong. The XS-1 is intended to be a proper first stage, doing proper first stage work, just like Falcon 9’s first stage. Get S2 up above the atmosphere and moving reasonably quickly so it can insert into orbit. Also like the Falcon 9 first stage, the XS-1 is intended to be reusable. It just makes an aerodynamic landing instead of a propulsive one. I don’t think this is picking nits. Launcher aircraft have their place–even though I don’t think we’ve practically applied it yet (it’s not a huge energy/drag gain, but it does let you move the noise/violence of launch to a less-contested space)–but a first stage is more than a launcher aircraft, and a reusable first stage even more so. A combination of the two would be quite something, as well, and I think that’s what the Brits are after with Skylon…if they can ever pull it off… Report comment Reply Chris says: May 30, 2017 at 10:39 am ***COUPON CODE*** for the ANYCon hacker conference mentioned above is HACKADAY.

The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defense Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co, and hailed it as an "incredible accomplishment." "This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat," Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. "This is one element of a broader missile defense strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats," Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday's launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the U.S. mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, described the test as "vital" prior to launch. "We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today," Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a program that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD program. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon's weapons testing office in January said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States.

The company also supplied its Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) target rocket for this critical national security system test. The OBV was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on May 30, 2017. Orbital ATK provides the OBV to MDA as part of an industry team led by The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA). “This flight test was a major undertaking for Orbital ATK as we supplied both the boost vehicle for the interceptor and the target,” said Rich Straka, Vice President and General Manager of Orbital ATK’s Launch Vehicles Division. “Today’s successful test confirms the United States’ missile defense program stands ready to protect against long-range missile attacks, and we are proud to be a part of that team.” FTG-15 was the first flight of the “C2” configuration of the OBV, which includes upgraded avionics and safety systems to address new requirements and obsolescence issues with the legacy vehicles. It was also the first flight of the ICBM range target. MDA’s goal is to expand the Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) fleet to 44 missiles by the end of 2017. “Orbital ATK is honored to be a part of MDA’s charge to strengthen the national defenses from 30 to 44 GBI Interceptors in 2017,” said Straka. “We understand the importance of this goal and, we are focused on mission success.” Following a preliminary post-flight analysis of the data collected from the mission, MDA and the GMD team confirmed all primary OBV objectives for the interceptor test were achieved. These included pre-launch built-in test functionality, silo launch and fly out of the OBV, and accurate booster delivery of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) to enable intercept of the target. The MDA/Orbital ATK ICBM Team also confirmed nominal operation of the target, meeting all primary mission objectives. The ICBM is largest target in a broader family of targets that Orbital ATK supplies to the MDA for Ballistic Missile Defense System testing. Orbital ATK’s missile defense interceptors and related target vehicles are primarily produced at the company’s engineering and manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona, with solid rocket motor propulsion manufactured in Magna, Utah, and its vehicle assembly and integration facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and Huntsville, Alabama. Today’s OBV mission was executed under the GMD Development and Sustainment Contract, which continues through at least 2018. Orbital ATK developed the OBV under a multi-year contract with Boeing that began in 2002. Together the OBV and the EKV comprise the GBI, which is assembled by Boeing. The ICBM target was provided under the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile contract, which continues at least thru 2019 with options for additional target vehicles and launches. About Orbital ATK Orbital ATK is a global leader in aerospace and defense technologies. The company designs, builds and delivers space, defense and aviation systems for customers around the world, both as a prime contractor and merchant supplier.

The airline’s new premium section, to be featured on its Boeing Co 777-300ERs, will have six private suites instead of eight, Emirates said in an e-mailed statement. The cabins will be presented in November sporting “a totally fresh new look,” said Tim Clark, Emirates president. Emirates, which has been developing new first-class cabins for several years, has been hit by falling demand from premium Gulf passengers and industry-wide concerns about terrorism. To cope with some of the toughest operating conditions in its 30-year history, Emirates is revamping the bars on its Airbus SE A380s, mulling a premium-economy class for the first time and considering introducing narrow-bodies to its all-widebody fleet in cooperation with low-cost sister carrier FlyDubai. The smaller cabins come just after Qatar Airways announced its Qsuite, a new business-class section with double-beds that morph into meeting rooms. The market for the most expensive seats on an aircraft is at a crossroads, with many carriers either scaling back first-class offerings, while others such as Etihad Airways are taking the opposite approach by adding three-room cabins. Emirates, which is also known for onboard showers, will show its new first-class cabins and the corresponding routes at the biennial Dubai Airshow. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week How to survive United’s record-breaking 18-hour non-stop flight Fresh safety concerns hang over global airlines conference Sacred Shimogamo: Streams of fate and mirrors of beauty AirAsia offers up to three million promotional seats Lake Tahoe public art takes on climate change AirAsia offers up to three million promotional seats Penghu — Taiwan’s best-kept secret Beautiful Swiss town bans tourists from taking photos Take a trip through the Andes mountains on this luxury sleeper train Sacred Shimogamo: Streams of fate and mirrors of beauty Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles China’s reforms not enough to arrest mounting debt, says Moody’s Emirates airline annual profit falls for the first time in five years Laptop ban hits Dubai for 1.1m weekend travellers Emirates to turn onboard bar and lounge into flying yacht Snake on a plane grounds Emirates flight Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

A plane designed to take on Boeing and Airbus has completed its maiden flight.More Russia has surprised the airline industry by announcing the successful test flight of a new medium range passenger plane. Irkut Corporation, itself owned by state controlled United Aircraft Corporation, said its MC-21-300 had successfully flown for 30 minutes at a height of 1000 metres at a speed of 300 kilometers per hour. "[The] flight mission is accomplished. The flight went in the normal mode. There are no obstacles revealed preventing the tests continuation," the lead test pilot, Oleg Kononenko, is quoted as saying on the Irkut Corp. website, Sunday. With a capacity between 163 and 211 passengers and a maximum flight range of 6,000 kilometers, the MC-21-300, will attempt to compete with the Boeing (NYSE: BA) 737 and Airbus (Euronext Paris: AIR-FR) A320. Irkut said global demand for that area of aviation should translate to about 15,000 new aircraft worldwide across the next 20 years. The firm claimed the new plane is superior to existing rivals, highlighting its extensive use of polymer composite materials. The plane maker also lauded the new generation engines which it said reduced fuel consumption, emitted lower noise and pumped out less hazardous emissions. "[The] calculated reduction of direct operational costs for MC-21 is 12-15% lower than for counterparts," the statement added. The program cost of the plane was estimated by Russian state media at 164 billion rubles ($4.6 billion) in 2014, but delivery dates have slipped since then. Irkut said it has an initial portfolio of 175 "firm orders" which will maintain production capacity "in the coming years".

Hopes are high for the plane, which the Russian United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) hopes will propel a return to the global commercial aircraft market. It's been a long road for the MC-21, first conceived of in 2003 to replace the aging Tupolev Tu-204. A twin engine medium jet airliner introduced in 1989, the Tu-204 was meant to challenge American commercial industries like Boeing. As of December 2016, only 43 were in service worldwide, the majority used within Russia. Designs for the MC-21 were finalized in 2008, with UAC subsidiary Irkut leading the construction. Irkut has long had a successful military plane operation but has wanted to expand its market. The plane was initially given a fly date of 2016 which had to be pushed back due to delays in development, both technical and organizational. Certification in Russia is now expected in 2018, with a goal of the European Aviation Safety Agency granting certificate a year after that. The baseline MC-21, known as the MC-21-300, can carry 211 passengers and fly 3,200 nautical miles. There's a shorter variant, the MC-21-200, which can hold 165 passengers. Irkut went beyond Russian borders for the plane, with avionics supplied by international companies like Honeywell, Thales and Elbit Systems. But the plane was built with a distinctly Russian sensibility, with foreign suppliers setting up a modern production line in Siberia. The craft's name, MC-21, stems from the Russian acronym Magistralny Samolet 21 veka, which translates as "mainline aircraft of the 21st century." It's unclear who will buy the aircraft. So far Irkut has 175 firm orders, but these are mostly from government-owned Russian leasing companies. Maybe once the MC-21 gets into the sky, it will turn heads outside of Moscow.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday June 5, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Samsung's woes highlight explosive limits of lithium batteries Jeremy Wagstaff 13 Oct 2016, 4:14 p.m. Consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology to the limits, battery experts say. Samsung's woes highlight explosive limits of lithium batteries A Panasonic lithium-ion flexible battery that's just 0.55 millimeters thick: Producers are pushing to develop ever smaller batteries, but there's a safety issue. Photo: Koji Ueda Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Local Business Lithium-based batteries have been powering our portable devices for 25 years. But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology, which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. "We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane," Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light-weight, high energy Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 per cent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that "very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny." Sony, HP, Toshiba and Panasonic have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. "It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety," Tsuga said. "With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents." Greater demands Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 per cent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

This month alone he has spent $3.5m chartering a flight for trips to Singapore and Cancun in Mexico. Source: Jet-setting Mugabe spends $3.5m to charter plane to Singapore, Mexico | News24 Harare – This is why he’s known as Zimbabwe’s ‘visiting president’: so far this year Robert Mugabe has spent more days outside the country he’s ruled for 37 years than he’s spent at home, it’s been reported. Until May 27, when Mugabe got back from a week-long jaunt to Mexico, the president had spent 77 days outside the country, reports the Standard. Only 69 days had been spent at home. Luxury Boeing Mugabe, 93, recently had to charter a luxury Boeing as the Air Zimbabwe plane he usually uses is grounded for servicing. The paper said Mugabe began his 2017 travels on January 17, while still on official leave in Dubai, with a trip to China. 9 countries, 3 continents Since then, the paper estimates he’s covered 145 000km, and clocked a staggering 250 hours in the air. Countries he has so far visited on three continents include China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Mauritius, Singapore (twice), South Africa, Swaziland and Mexico. The Zimbabwe Independent, a respected business weekly, estimates that this month alone the president spent $3.5 million chartering a plane for trips to Singapore and Cancun in Mexico. $1 million for 4 days The paper identified the plane as a Comlux Aviation Boeing 767. “It costs one million US dollars to hire the plane for four days so Mugabe paid that when he went to Singapore,” an unnamed aviation source told the paper. “The plane also attracted close to half a million dollars in charges when it was parked for six days, from May 13 to May 18 while the cabin crew was at a local hotel. Mugabe paid close to 2 million US dollars for the nine days the plane took him to Mexico.” President pays  But transport minister Joram Gumbo, while declining to disclose the amount spent on the Mexico trip, suggested that chartering a plane is no more expensive than flying Air Zimbabwe. “Air Zimbabwe is used at cost and the rates are the same. Every last penny is paid for by the president’s office,” he told the paper. Large entourage Mugabe invariably travels with a large entourage, including state media journalists who get paid daily expenses in scarce foreign currency. Critics say the country gains nothing from these expensive trips. Share this: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email More Google Reddit No related posts.

But Joram Gumbo the Honourable Transport Minister must be the most silly of that lot. If you don’t believe me look what he says here… “But transport minister Joram Gumbo, while declining to disclose the amount spent on the Mexico trip, suggested that chartering a plane is no more expensive than flying Air Zimbabwe. “Air Zimbabwe is used at cost and the rates are the same. Every last penny is paid for by the president’s office,” he told the paper.” Where does he think that the “Presidents Office” get its money from. From the sky? From the West? From the East? From Mugabe? No you silly man, from the people of Zimbabwe, while they go hungry, homeless and cold while Mugabe and all his many high spending jet setter cohorts are gallivanting (and often staggering) all over the World doing bogger all… Waken up Joram and admit to what is happening. Just dream of your many deep potholes that US$ 3.5 million could have mended! Reply ↓ Farai May 31, 2017 The minister has now just proven that this is tax payers money by saying ” Every last penny is paid for by the president’s office” – the presidents office is solely funded by taxpayers and therefore when our country is burning Mugabe sees it fit to spend millions of tax payers dollars just so he can play around overseas. Reply ↓ Fallenz June 4, 2017 Agreed. But, someone backed the communist insurgency. Someone chose to pick up weapons and join the fight. Someone killed and maimed innocents with market bombs. Someone put Mugabe in charge. Someone has used violence to keep him in power. Now, I ask… who are those “somebodies”..? Let them step forward and explain how stupid they were. Let them tell us they did not understand that this is how communist-inspired governments work. Let them explain how a communist economy works that provides jobs and opportunities for income, food, and fees for school. Let them explain how one man can steal and squander so much from people who have nothing left. Let those valiant somebodies speak… or let them hide in shame.

It would be an godsend for operators and airlines straining under severe capacity crunch in airports world over. That’s the aim of Henk Hesselink, Senior R&D Manager at Netherlands Aerospace Centre. His only condition? The runway has to be circular. Hesselink is leading a project called The Endless Runway, which since it was unveiled in March has divided aviation experts on its efficacy. The fundamental principle of the project, which is a collaboration between research centres in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Poland, is that aircraft take-off and land on a large circular structure. “This helps aircraft to overcome strong wind conditions in which landing or take-off can be dangerous,” Hesselink told BusinessLine over a telephone chat from Amsterdam. In October last year, video had gone viral of a Boeing aircraft nearly crashing while landing in Prague while battling crosswinds. Circular runways may also be the answer to an infrastructure crunch at airports, including in India. Hesselink explains: “The circle’s diameter is 3.5 km and the length of the runway is 10 km, similar to the length of three conventional runways. But an airport with an Endless Runway will have the same capacity as an airport with four runways.” Airport buildings can be built in the middle of the circle, reducing the size of the airport. The runway, with a width of 140 metres, is banked. This will make the airspace less noisy and also prevent the crosswinds. The concept of circular runways was first tested in 1964, when the US Navy used a 8,400-foot-wide banked track. Though the trials were successful, the runways never took off. But now, says Hesselink, aided by technology a circular runway is feasible. At present, the concept of the airport and a design of the airport are ready. Hesselink, and his team of 14 aviation experts, performed simulations based on flight simulators and air traffic control simulator. The next phase of the project is to use tracks for trials. “At least two sites in Europe are interested,” says Hesselink without revealing the names as talks are still on. But it’s expensive. An airport with a circular runway will cost about 1.5 times the conventional one. “Cost is an issue. We need to explore a business model with benefits higher than the costs,” says Hesselink. For instance, circular runway will drastically reduce the waiting period for an aircraft, thus enabling an airport to service more flights and passengers a day, resulting in higher revenues. As revolutionary as it may sound, the endless, circular runway might become a reality only by 2050.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Matt Sallas: From Afghanistan to advanced manufacturing May 30, 2017 – While serving in Kandahar, Afghanistan, U.S. Navy construction mechanic Matthew Sallas may not have imagined where his experience would take him next. But researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory certainly had the future in mind as they were creating programs to train men and women like him for tomorrow’s maker workforce. Matt had returned to Knoxville from a tour of duty in 2013 and was working as an installer in the home remodeling business, but he was looking for an opportunity to parlay his natural inquisitiveness and mechanical skills into something more. When he heard about a special 6-week internship at the Department of Energy’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL, he took a chance. Matt was among more than 120 applicants to the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Program for returning veterans and wounded warriors. He and 14 others chosen for the program received an accelerated, hands-on introduction to the field of advanced manufacturing, including the opportunity to design and print objects in 3D. Matt’s skills as a mechanic served him well in the internship. Today, Matt operates and maintains the biggest 3D printers as a staff technician at the MDF, the two Big Area Additive Manufacturing machines, as well as a large-scale milling machine that trims excess material from printed parts. Since his time as an intern, Matt has been involved in some of the most high-profile prints at the MDF, including the Shelby Cobra sports car, the house for the Additive Manufacturing + Integrated Energy project, and the mold for a new Boeing airplane wing, which earned a Guinness World Records title for largest 3D-printed solid object. His favorite project was printing a replica of a 1952 Willys Jeep, which took only 3 weeks from printing to assembly. “I’m always working on something new here,” Matt said. “We’re basically figuring out the puzzle of how to print [a variety of objects]. You never do the same thing over again. It keeps me on my toes.” Veterans: An ‘ideal workforce’ Working at the MDF has given Matt a solid foundation in advanced manufacturing. He has gained skills in CAD design, programming, mechanical and electrical engineering, and heavy equipment operation. Matt’s work on the BAAM printer, in fact, resulted in his being a contributing author to a paper that examined the impact of temperature decay on bonding during the printing process for objects made with carbon fiber–reinforced acrylonitrile butadiene styrene thermoplastic. The best thing about working at ORNL? “The people. They’re great to work with here,” Matt said. “They have my back, and I have theirs.” Matt’s mentor at the MDF is Lonnie Love, ORNL Corporate Fellow researcher and leader of the Manufacturing Systems Research Group. “The veteran’s program was really eye-opening for me,” Love said. “We currently have over 300,000 open manufacturing jobs in this country. At the same time, we have over 10,000 active duty service men and women entering civilian life every month. These veterans like Matt are the ideal workforce. They’re loyal, hard-working, not afraid of a challenge, and are used to working as a team. All they need is a little direction, and they can have amazing careers. ORNL served as the pilot for this program, which is now being replicated at other national labs. Getting Matt to be a part of our team was an added benefit.” Matt continues to serve in the Navy Reserve, training at least one weekend a month and two full weeks each year to maintain readiness for deployment. He is close to earning his associate’s degree in engineering technology from Pellissippi State Community College and has plans to pursue a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. He is also a certified first responder. Matt’s advice to other young people is that although school is important, students should also pursue real-world experience: “You’ve got to get out and do the internships. Get out there and learn. That’s my philosophy.” CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious IoT Tech Expo : les principaux conférenciers de T-Systems, Microsoft, Sigfox, Coca-Cola, Lufthansa, Nestlé, BMW & Visa sont prêts pour le plus grand salon IdO d’Europe – Ouverture cette semaine !

Moon and other ranking Cheong Wa Dae officials recently received the Samsung devices tailor-made for their internal communications, they said. This comes about two weeks after Moon took office as president in the wake of the political scandal surrounding former President Park Geun-hye who was ousted earlier this year over alleged corruption. The presidential office is known to have chosen the S7, instead of the latest S8 flagship model that debuted this April, because it takes some time to make the customized phones. The S7 hit shelves early last year. Aside from the flagship Galaxy S series, LG Electronics is also known to have special devices for use by the presidential office, which the company also declined to confirm. In the United States, National Security Agency (NSA) officials use the privacy-focused Blackphone developed by Boeing and BlackBerry. The device is widely used by the U.S. government and military officials who require a special communication device to keep internal information confidential. "It is true the presidential office uses such specially designed smartphones over possible hacking or wiretapping concerns," an industry source said. "Even if the new President uses the Galaxy S7 tailor-made to ensure the highest level of security, no one may be able to confirm this." In Korea, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics hold enough technological expertise to manufacture devices ensuring privacy and security. But they have remained silent on the details. That might be because demand for such a device is extremely low, as it is mainly used for a few high-ranking officials in the military and state-run organizations. In February 2003, the Seoul-based handset maker Pantech launched its own security-first handset by developing dedicated software to guarantee security. But the company scrapped its sales soon after, citing low demand and weak profit. Most countries also disallow commercialization of such phones, citing national security, fearing they could end up in the hands of criminals or terrorists. On top of that, manufacturers are unlikely to make public the development of such devices amid concerns over their involvement in political wiretapping or interception, the source said. mhlee@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Holocaust vs. comfort women Court rejects arrest warrant for Choi Soon-sil's daughter Hyundai Motor accused of sacking American model for her period 1 Korean killed, 3 injured in shooting rampage at Philippines casino Kia Tigers' slugger Choi voted KBO player of month Man gets 30-year jail term for killing 3 Koreans in Philippines Policeman jumps off bridge after being caught buying sex Gov't blamed for neglecting adoptees abroad GDP grows 1.1% in first quarter Activists slam lack of government action over poor sleeping conditions for domestic workers Visiting fallen husband Hail in summer 'Pro-Park' tents gone Hot and cool First day Last day as governor Last day as PM Minor contender's appeal Korea Defense Veterans Association Cooling off Park's impeachment About Korea Times CEO Message Times History Contents Distribution Media Kit Contact Us Location Privacy Statement Ombudsman Mobile Service RSS Service Youth Protection Policy

The program aims to achieve a capability well out of reach today—launches to low Earth orbit in days, as compared to the months or years of preparation currently needed to get a single satellite on orbit. Success will depend upon significant advances in both technical capabilities and ground operations, but would revolutionize the Nation’s ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. “We’re very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight.” The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds. The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. In its pursuit of aircraft-like operability, reliability, and cost-efficiency, DARPA and Boeing are planning to conduct a flight test demonstration of XS-1 technology, flying 10 times in 10 days, with an additional final flight carrying the upper-stage payload delivery system. If successful, the program could help enable a commercial service in the future that could operate with recurring costs of as little as $5 million or less per launch, including the cost of an expendable upper stage, assuming a recurring flight rate of at least ten flights per year—a small fraction of the cost of launch systems the U.S. military currently uses for similarly sized payloads. (Note that goal is for actual cost, not commercial price, which would be determined in part by market forces.) To achieve these goals, XS-1 designers plan to take advantage of technologies and support systems that have enhanced the reliability and fast turnaround of military aircraft. For example, easily accessible subsystem components configured as line replaceable units would be used wherever practical to enable quick maintenance and repairs. The XS-1 Phase 2/3 design also intends to increase efficiencies by integrating numerous state-of-the-art technologies, including some previously developed by DARPA, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force. For example, the XS-1 technology demonstrator’s propulsion system is an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). Other technologies in the XS-1 design include: - Advanced, lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks to hold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. - Hybrid composite-metallic wings and control surfaces able to withstand the physical stresses of suborbital hypersonic flight and temperatures of more than 2,000o F. - Automated flight-termination and other technologies for autonomous flight and operations, including some developed by DARPA’s Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program. XS-1 Phase 2 includes design, construction, and testing of the technology demonstration vehicle through 2019. It calls for initially firing the vehicle’s engine on the ground 10 times in 10 days to demonstrate propulsion readiness for flight tests. Phase 3 objectives include 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5. Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. Another goal of the program is to encourage the broader commercial launch sector to adopt useful XS-1 approaches, processes, and technologies that facilitate launch on demand and rapid turnaround—important military and commercial needs for the 21st century. Toward that goal, DARPA intends to release selected data from its Phase 2/3 tests and will provide to all interested commercial entities the relevant specs for potential payloads. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” TAGS: Cybersecurity, Spectrum, Telecommunications DARPA’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program seeks to build and fly the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would break the cycle of escalating launch costs and make possible a host of critical national security options. As the next step toward a future of routine, responsive, and low-cost space access, DARPA has awarded Phases 2 and 3 of the program to The Boeing Company.

PTI The CBI registered FIRs to enquire about the purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of planes and the giving up of profit-making routes by Air India. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe the controversial merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, besides alleged irregularities in purchase and lease of aircraft by the two state-run carriers under the UPA government which caused “huge” losses to the exchequer. The investigative agency on Monday registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, ministry of civil aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R.K. Gaur said. “The cases relate to decisions taken by the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer,” he said. “The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers,” Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government’s decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines—48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing—for about Rs70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a “recipe for disaster”, the government auditor had said it should have raised “alarm” in the ministry of civil aviation, public investment board and the planning commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. “It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on,” he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a “huge” loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it “ill-timed”. Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said, “The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger.” The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet’s approval on 1 March 2007. The CBI’s action follows the Supreme Court’s 5 January direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI officials said “all stakeholders” were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then civil aviation minister Praful Patel of NCP on 16 March 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on 22 March that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India chairman-cum-managing director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India’s “downfall”. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline’s market share was just around 14%whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs50,000 crore.

The deal was concluded with Boeing and Airbus in 2005-06. © AFP 2017/ RAVEENDRAN Air India Sheds Weight by Grounding Dozens of Obese Cabin CrewNew Delhi (Sputnik) – The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three cases and one preliminary inquiry under sections related to cheating and forgery of Indian Penal Code in the light of orders from the Supreme Court in January this year. “The first case has been registered against unknown officials of Ministry of Civil Aviation (Government of India), Air India and unknown private persons to investigate the allegations relating to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs. 70,000 crore ($10.6 billion) to benefit foreign aircraft manufactures. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers,” a CBI statement said. The CBI has also said that it has registered case against government officials, Air India and private companies to investigate the allegations of leasing of large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy. “It was also alleged that the aircrafts were leased even while aircraft acquisition program was going on,” CBI added. Air India is facing heavy losses and has a debt of approximately $7.8 billion. It is alleged that with the collusion of private players, officials had made arrangements in such a way that Air India flew its aircraft on loss-making routes. The CBI is also investigating the charges of giving up profit-making routes and profit-making timings of Air India in favor of national and international private airlines causing a huge loss to the national carrier. With 140 long-haul fleet, Air India controls 17% market share on international routes and 14.6% of domestic passenger market. Due to continuous losses, Indian government is considering to sell it to private players. "Today, what has happened is (Air India's) market share is 14%. And the debt is $7.8 billion. Now there are private airlines that are flying — Indigo, GoAir, Spicejet, Jet Airways — there you don’t invest money. But to run Air India, you have invested $7.8 billion. That money is government’s money, that’s your money. It could have been used for school education. And if 86% of flying can be handled by private sector, so it can also handle 100%,” Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley said a few days back.

THE MOST FROM THE COAST ! ..  Coastweek website Home  Coast Classified | Coast Art | Coast Books | Coast Cuisine | Coast Directory | Coast Eating Out | Coast Obituaries | Coast Poster | Shipping | Tides XINHUA NEWS SERVICE REPORTS FROM THE AFRICAN CONTINENT   RwandAir launches its first direct commercial  flight to Europe KIGALI Rwanda (Xinhua) -- Rwanda’s national airline RwandAir has launched first direct commercial flight to Gatwick International Airport, London’s second busiest airport. The airline’s flight took off from Kigali International Airport on Friday afternoon en route to Gatwick International Airport, adding it to its network of 22 destinations worldwide. The new route will be operated by recently acquired brand new Airbus A330 aircraft that boasts of in-flight connectivity. The airline will fly to London three times a week and is expected to boost tourism and trade between the UK and Rwanda. Speaking to reporters shortly after launching London flight destination, the airline’s deputy chief executive officer in charge of corporate affairs, Yvonne Manzi Makolo said that the airline has embarked on expanding its wings to far destinations in order to serve a large clientele of travellers to visit Rwanda. “It’s great step for our country, because it will bring us closer to our trade partners and sources of tourists. Rwanda will be making a big impact as a must-visit country,” she added. Last year, the airline acquired its first A330-200 and A330-300 Airbus planes, boosting its fleet to 11 aircraft and capacity to compete globally. It is also scheduled to take delivery of another brand new Boeing before end of May. This direct seamless long-haul flight is an important milestone towards improving trade relations between Rwanda, the European continent. RwandAir carried more than 650,000 passengers last year and projects to transport over three million in the next five years. The Rwanda aviation industry which has become one of the largest and most profitable airlines in East Africa has continued to spread wings across Africa and beyond. The airline has been growing at an average of 20 percent in the last six years and is currently positioning itself as the most efficient and reliable airline in the region, according to figures from the Rwanda’s ministry of infrastructure. The airline has 11 aircraft and expects delivery of the 12th, a Boeing 737-800, in May. . Ethiopian Airlines to boost Asia routes with flight to Singapore ADDIS ABABA, (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia’s national air carrier Ethiopian Airlines plans to tap into increasing passenger traffic between Asia and Africa with a new direct flight route to the South east Asian city state of Singapore to start on May 31. Speaking to Xinhua on Monday, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ethiopian Airlines Tewolde Gebremariam says with direct, non-stop services to the “Lion City”, a global aviation centre Ethiopian hopes in particular to use the new route as a gateway to Asia and Europe. “Ethiopian Flights to Singapore will greatly contribute to strengthening of trade, investment, and tourism ties between a booming Africa and a highly developed, innovative, and business friendly Singapore” he says. “The new route will serve the growing traffic between Africa and Singapore, giving the best possible connectivity options to passengers travelling between most points in Africa and Asia in partnership with Singapore Airlines” adds the CEO. With direct flights to Singapore, Ethiopian Airlines will add its 96th international destination, ensuring as it enters its seventh decade in existence it will remain one of the few successful state owned air carriers in the African continent.             Remember: you read it first at coastweek.com !   SPECIAL OFFERS WEEKEND GETAWAYS WITH SERENA     TO ADVERTISE ON THIS WEB SITE:  www.coastweek.com Please contact MOMBASA - GULSHAN JIVRAJ, Mobile: 0722 775164 Tel: (+254) (41) 2230130 / Wireless: 020 3549187 e-mail: info@coastweek.com NAIROBI - ANJUM H.

Deals went to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Atomics and Northrop Grumman.  The process thus far has been geared toward MQ-25A Stingray technical and task analysis efforts spanning air vehicle capabilities, carrier suitability and integration, missions systems and software -- including cybersecurity,  Engineering an unmanned aerial refueling tanker able to take off from a carrier deck and support fighter jets en-route to attack missions is a vital aspect of the Navy plan to meet emerging enemy anti-ship missile threats. The new carrier-launched tanker will be designed to extend the combat range of key carrier air-wing assets such as F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-35C Joint Strike Fighters. Such an ability is deemed vital to the Pentagon’s concern that long-range precision guided anti-ship missiles are increasingly able to target and destroy aircraft carriers at distances as far as 1,000-miles off shore. The threat, including weapons such as the Chinese-built DF-21D missile referred to as a “carrier-killer” able to destroy targets more than 900 miles off shore, is sufficient to potentially prevent aircraft carriers from operating in closer proximity to enemy coastlines in order to project power and hold enemy targets at risk, many US military developers say. “MQ-25A Stingray will help to preserve the power projection dominance of the nation's carrier fleet. MQ-25A Stingray is the next step in the Navy's evolutionary integration of unmanned air systems into the carrier strike group's operational environment.  As part of our incremental approach this will allow the Navy to deliver carrier-based unmanned capability to the fleet faster,” Cosgrove said in a statement to Scout Warrior last year.   The range or combat radius of carrier-based fighter jets, therefore, is fundamental to this equation. If an F-35C or F/A-18 can, for instance, only travel roughly 500 or 600 miles to attack an inland enemy target such as air-defenses, installations and infrastructure – how can it effectively project power if threats force it to operate 1,000-miles off shore? Therein lies the challenge and the requisite need for a drone tanker able to refuel these carrier-launched aircraft mid-flight, giving them endurance sufficient to attack from longer distances. Advantages of a Drone Tanker: An existing large fuselage tanker, such as the emerging Air Force KC-46A, might have too large a radar signature and therefore be far too vulnerable to enemy attack. This, quite naturally, then creates the need for an unmanned platform or drone able to better elude enemy radar and refuel attack aircraft on their way to a mission. While there is not much public information available about the MQ-25A Stingray as it is an emerging system very early on in the developmental process, Navy officials did explain the key strategic concepts behind its existence to Scout Warrior. “Greater endurance” is described by Navy officials as a fundamental impetus for the new platform. “When fielded, MQ-25A Stingray will deliver a high-endurance organic aerial refueling and ISR capability.  Unmanned aerial refueling will extend the performance, efficiency and safety of manned aircraft and impart longer range and greater endurance to enable the execution of missions that otherwise could not be performed,” Cosgrove added.   Aerial Refueling Key to Future of Carriers: The emergence of the MQ-25A Stingray comes at a key time amidst ongoing discussions about the trajectory or evolution of aircraft carriers as a platform. Some analysts and military experts, for example, believe carriers may soon become obsolete in light of weapons such as the DF-21D and the prospect of hypersonic attack weapons in the future. If carriers are not able to project power as intended, then should they be replaced with faster, more agile or smaller ships able to carry and launch drones and perform other missions? Despite the emergence of weapons such as the DF-21D, senior Navy leaders and some analysts have questioned the ability of precision-guided long-range missile to actually hit and destroy carriers on the move at 30-knots from 1,000 miles away. Targeting, guidance on the move fire control, ISR and other assets are necessary for these kinds of weapons to function as advertised. GPS, inertial measurement units, advanced sensors and dual-mode seekers are part of a handful of fast-developing technologies able to address some of these challenges, yet it does not seem clear that long-range anti-ship missiles such as the DF-21D will actually be able to destroy carriers on the move at the described distances.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The rocket that blasted into space from New Zealand on May 25 was special. Not only was it the first to launch from a private site, it was also the first to be powered by an engine made almost entirely using 3D printing. This might not make it the “first 3D-printed rocket in space” that some headlines described it as, but it does highlight how seriously this manufacturing technique is being taken by the space industry. Members of the team behind the Electron rocket at US company RocketLab say the engine was printed in 24 hours and provides efficiency and performance benefits over other systems. There’s not yet much information out there regarding the exact details of the 3D-printed components. But it’s likely many of them have been designed to minimise weight while maintaining their structural performance, while other components may have been optimised to provide efficient fluid flow. These advantages – reducing weight and the potential for complex new designs – are a large part of why 3D printing is expected to find some of its most significant applications in space exploration, with dramatic effect. One thing the set of technologies known as additive manufacturing or 3D printing does really well is to produce highly complicated shapes. For example, lattice structures produced in exactly the right way so that they weigh less but are just as strong as similar solid components. This creates the opportunity to produce optimised, lightweight parts that were previously impossible to manufacture economically or efficiently with more traditional techniques. Boeing’s microlattice is an example of taking this to the extreme, supposedly producing mechanically sound structures that are 99.9% air. Not all 3D printing processes can achieve this, but even weight savings of a few percent in aircraft and spacecraft can lead to major benefits through the use of less fuel. 3D printing tends to work best for the production of relatively small, intricate parts rather than large, simple structures, where the higher material and processing costs would outweigh any advantage. For example, a redesigned nozzle can enhance fuel mixing within an engine, leading to better efficiency. Increasing the surface area of a heat shield by using a patterned rather than a flat surface can mean heat is transferred away more efficiently, reducing the chances of overheating. The techniques can also reduce the amount of material wasted in manufacturing, important because space components tend to be made from highly expensive and often rare materials. 3D printing can also produce whole systems in one go rather than from lots of assembled parts. For example, NASA used it to reduce the components in one of its rocket injectors from 115 to just two. Plus, 3D printers can easily make small numbers of a part – as the space industry often needs – without first creating expensive manufacturing tools. In orbit 3D printers are also likely to find a use in space itself, where it’s difficult to keep large numbers of spare parts and hard to send out for replacements when you’re thousands of kilometres from Earth. There’s now a 3D printer on the International Space Station so, if something breaks, engineers can send up a design for a replacement and the astronauts can print it out. The current printer only deals with plastic so it’s more likely to be used for making tools or one-off replacements for low-performance parts such as door handles. But once 3D printers can more easily use other materials, we’re likely to see an increase in their uses. One day, people in space could produce their own food items and even biological materials. Recycling facilities could also enable broken parts to be reused to make the replacements. Astro printing. Barry Wilmore/NASA Looking even further ahead, 3D printers could prove useful in building colonies. Places like the moon don’t have much in the way of traditional building materials, but the European Space Agency has proven solar energy can power the production of “bricks” of lunar dust, which would be a good start. Researchers are now looking at how to use 3D printing to take this idea further and develop complete printed buildings on the moon. To make many of these applications a reality, we’ll need to research more advanced materials and processes that can manufacture components to withstand the extremely harsh conditions of space. Engineers also need to work on developing optimised designs and find ways of testing 3D printed parts to prove they’re safe. And then there’s the irritating issue of gravity, or rather the lack of it. Many current processes use powders or liquids as their raw materials so we’re likely to need some clever tricks in order to make these function safely in a low or microgravity environment. Some of these barriers may even require entirely new materials and techniques. But as research goes on, 3D printing is likely to be used more and more in space, even if a fully printed space vehicle isn’t going to launch any time soon. The sky is no longer the limit.

Courtesy of PR Department of Irkut Corporation/Handout via REUTERS Reuters, Moscow Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLTMM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. Stay updated on the go with The Daily Star News App. Click here to download it for your device.

This will be the 289th mission by Arianespace. ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B are the 558th and 559th satellites to be launched by Arianespace.  ViaSat-2 is the second ViaSat, Inc. satellite to be launched by Arianespace. The first was WildBlue-1 in 2006. ViaSat has publicly announced plans to launch a ViaSat-3 class satellite with Arianespace in the future, further extending the partnership between the two companies. ViaSat is changing the perception of satellite Internet, globally. As a broadband services company, ViaSat has set out to advance global connectivity beyond what traditional telecom, wireless, cable or fiber could deliver, by solving one of the hardest communications problems: making the Internet accessible and affordable to all. The ViaSat-2 satellite system was designed to offer high-capacity connectivity and wide coverage, with dynamic flexibility to move capacity to where demand requires it. The ViaSat-2 satellite system is expected to bring considerable improvements in terms of speed, lower costs and extended broadband coverage within its footprint, which includes North and Central America, plus the Caribbean, northern South America, and the aeronautical and maritime routes in the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe. ViaSat-2 offers double the network capacity and seven times more coverage than its predecessor, ViaSat-1, and it will continue to transform the economics and quality of satellite broadband services, delivering the satellite Internet to users on the ground, in the air, or at sea. The satellite system offers approximately 300 Gigabits per second (Gbps) of total network capaci. With an abundance of network capacity, coupled with a state-of-the-art ground network and industry-best bandwidth economics, ViaSat-2 can significantly improve speeds with an in-orbit cost per bit that is considerably lower than other satellite systems. Positioned at 70 West, ViaSat-2 will be the highest capacity communications satellite in orbit, and will enable the highest quality Internet connections, allowing customers to operate an array of fixed and mobile services including in-flight connectivity, maritime, emergency relief, oil and gas operations, and government applications anywhere within its coverage areas. After the launch of ViaSat-2, Arianespace has another ViaSat Inc. satellite in its order book for orbiting at a future date. ViaSat-2 was built by Boeing in El Segundo, California, using a 702HP platform. It will be the 54th Boeing satellite launched by Arianespace, which has three more satellites from this manufacturer in its order book.   EUTELSAT 172B will be the 32nd satellite launched by Arianespace for Eutelsat. Both companies have worked side-by-side since 1983, when Arianespace launched the Eutelsat-1 F1 satellite. Including this upcoming launch, more than half of Eutelsat’s satellites will have been orbited by Arianespace. Eutelsat is one of the world’s leading and most experienced operators of communications satellites. The company provides capacity on 39 satellites to clients that include broadcasters and broadcasting associations; pay-TV operators; video, data and Internet service providers; enterprises and government agencies. EUTELSAT 172B will deliver increased capacity for fast-growing applications that include in-flight and maritime connectivity, cellular backhaul, corporate networks, video distribution and government services. It will be located at 172 degrees East, a key neighborhood providing exceptional Asia-Pacific reach over land and sea, from Alaska to Australia. EUTELSAT 172B will, in particular, feature a new Ku-band multi-beam payload delivering 1.8 Gbps of throughput to serve the world’s fastest-growing region for air traffic. Asia-Pacific represents the largest opportunity for in-flight entertainment and connectivity services. The customized High Throughput Satellite (HTS) payload on EUTELSAT 172B will be a major growth platform for in-flight connectivity, notably Panasonic Avionics Corporation – one of the leading suppliers of in-flight entertainment and connectivity services for commercial airlines. In addition to this HTS payload, the satellite will provide service continuity and improved performance via C- and Ku-band payloads connected to a range of footprints serving the Asia-Pacific markets as well. Arianespace also has two other Eutelsat satellites in its order book for future launches. EUTELSAT 172B is the first all-electric telecommunications satellite built in Europe. This key enabling technology has been implemented by Airbus in Toulouse, using the new all-electric Eurostar E3000 EOR (Electric Orbit Raising) platform. The high-power satellite relies exclusively on electric propulsion for orbit raising and all on-station maneuvers. It also features technological innovations such as the Multi-Port Amplifier (MPA) to distribute power between spot beams in direct response to surges in capacity on-board aircraft; deployable robotic arms to orientate and control plasmic thrust direction during the approximately four-month ride to geostationary orbit; and 3D-printed components. It is the first satellite with this platform to be launched by Arianespace, which has 15 other Airbus-built satellites in its order book. EUTELSAT 172B is the first all-electric satellite to be launched by Arianespace with Ariane 5.   Topical Tags :  Agencies    Launch    Consumer Applications    Satellite Operator    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  Asia/Asia Pacific    Europe    North America             FREE SUBSCRIPTION Today's Top News Success for Airbus Safran Launchers and Arianespace as They Celebrate Third Launch ViaSat Celebrates Successful Launch and Even the First Signals from ViaSat-2  Inmarsat Signs On Thales Alenia Space to Build Their Next GX Satellite HISPASAT Parts Ways with the Thales Alenia Space-Built Hispasat 1C Satellite SpaceX's Dragon Re-Play Is a Success ...

Europe’s biggest discount carrier is in talks with Boeing Co to add two or three more jets to its existing delivery schedule while extending leases on 10 other planes through 2019, Ryanair said in a statement today. That’ll help fuel growth in Italy, Germany, Poland and Romania, where airlines including Air Berlin Plc and Alitalia SpA are restructuring operations amid steep losses. “There’s a huge amount of opportunities out there across Europe as we grow and one of the limiting factors continues to be deliveries of the aircraft,” chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said in a phone interview. “We’ve said to Boeing, if they see gaps in their schedule and have additional aircraft, we’ll take them.” Ryanair has been cutting costs and slashing prices to undercut rivals on regional routes, while expanding its transatlantic partner network to feed into the lucrative long-haul segment. Its strategy brings its business model closer to traditional network carriers after a previous focus on bare-bones point-to-point travel. This weekend’s massive cancellations at British Airways could also be a boon for Ryanair. Ryanair is following low-cost rival EasyJet Plc in bulking up its fleet. Its London-based rival earlier this month upgraded an order for 30 Airbus SE narrow-body aircraft to the biggest A321 variant. The moves will add additional pressure on other European competitors. Profit growth Rising demand in the past year helped push Ryanair’s net income for the fiscal year ended March 31 to €1.32 billion (RM6.29 billion) from €1.24 billion a year earlier, according to the statement. Passengers increased 13 per cent to 120 million, bolstering profit despite a 13 per cent drop in fares. The slide in ticket prices should ease to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent this year as supply better matches demand. The airline predicted an increase in fiscal 2018 earnings of about 8 per cent to between €1.4 billion  and €1.45 billion. Lack of clarity on whether the UK will opt to remain in Europe’s open skies agreement could cause “significant disruption” of flights between the two regions for months after Brexit takes effect in March 2019, the company said. “In the absence of such certainty, or direction, we will continue to pivot our growth away from the UK in 2017 and 2018 to capitalise on the many growth opportunities elsewhere in Europe,” Ryanair said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions World Bank still sees global growth picking up amid policy risks Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Ringgit closes higher on buying interest Ringgit finishes lower against US dollar over lack of demand, dealer says Malaysia slowly winning battle against forex speculators Ringgit ends higher against US dollar Ringgit appreciated 1.8pc against US dollar in April, says BNM Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Europe’s biggest budget airline plans to add at least 47 Boeing Co. 737 planes to its fleet by March 2018, a 12 percent expansion. That compares with the Dublin-based company’s forecast for 8 percent growth in net income. Ryanair’s plans were accelerated as it extended leases on 10 jets through 2019. The airline’s also in talks with Boeing to add two or three more aircraft to its existing delivery schedule. “There’s a huge amount of opportunities out there across Europe as we grow and one of the limiting factors continues to be deliveries of the aircraft,” Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said in a phone interview. “We’ve said to Boeing, if they see gaps in their schedule and have additional aircraft, we’ll take them.” The focus is on growth in markets like Italy, Germany and Poland, where airlines including Air Berlin Plc and Alitalia SpA are restructuring amid steep losses. By adding to its network of long-haul partners, Ryanair is also seeking to take advantage as traditional competitors scramble to lower costs and maintain services, pressure that appeared to contribute to British Airways’ meltdown over the weekend. Ryanair shares rose 1.2 percent to 17.97 euros at 10:30 a.m. in Dublin, taking its gain over the last 12 months to 28 percent. Brexit Pivot The expansion push comes despite doubts about whether the U.K. will remain in Europe’s open skies agreement. That could cause “significant disruption” of flights between the two regions for months after Brexit takes effect in March 2019, the company said. “In the absence of such certainty, or direction, we will continue to pivot our growth away from the U.K.,” Ryanair said.

Sign Up The no-frills airline is prepared to cut ticket prices to fill its expanded fleet, forecasting that fares will fall as much as 7 percent this fiscal year after dropping 13 percent in the 12 months through March. The slump, spurred by surplus capacity as European carriers looked to benefit from cheaper fuel costs, was expected to ease this year with the likes of EasyJet Plc and eastern European discounter Wizz Air Holdings Plc forecasting rosier pricing outlooks. Rising demand in the past year helped push Ryanair’s fiscal 2017 net income up 6.5 percent to 1.32 billion euros ($1.47 billion) as passengers increased 13 percent to 120 million.

SNOHOMISH — With two fist pumps and a “C’mon!,” Kevin Beavers wrote his name into the Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament record book. Beavers finished 9-under par to hold off a hard-charging Jacob Rohde and become just the second player ever to three-peat as Snohomish County Amateur champion. Beavers shot a 4-under 68 in Monday’s final round at Snohomish Golf Course, finishing with a 54-hole score of 207 and joining Bob Burton (1973-75) as the only individuals to win three straight times in the County Am’s 87-year history. ”It feels really good,” said Beavers, who dedicated the victory to his fiancee, Hanh Tran, who he got engaged to eight months ago. “I put a lot of work into my game the last few years. I didn’t swing my best these last couple days, but I putted really well. My heart was pumping pretty hard out there, but I managed myself really well, and that’s something I’ve been working on, so I’m very proud of myself for that.” Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer who lives in Seattle, finished two strokes ahead of Rohde, who shot the low round of the day at 66 to finish at 7-under. Rohde, playing in the group ahead of Beavers, pulled within one stroke through 16 holes. But Beavers overcame an errant tee shot on 18 to finish with a birdie and secure what ended up being a wire-to-wire victory. ”I knew last night going to bed that, with the way Kevin’s been playing, that 69 was likely for him,” said Rohde, a 39-year-old landscape architect from Everett who finished second for the second straight year. “So I thought I needed to shoot 64 to have a chance. I did my best and just came up short. But I tried hard, and the greens were really tough today for putting. Had I gotten a couple more putts to go it could have been good.” Ethan Casto, a 20-year-old from Snohomish and a freshman at Western Washington University, finished third at 4-under. Casto, who came into the final round one stroke behind Beavers in second place, shot an even-par 72. For a while it looked as though Beavers would run away and hide with the trophy. Beavers played flawless golf through 11 holes, making five birdies to reach 10-under. He was all over the flag with his approach shot at the par-4 second before making a 5-foot birdie putt, he drained a 20-foot birdie putt at the par-3 fifth, then he sank a 7-foot birdie putt at the par-4 sixth. After birdieing the first two holes of the back nine he was seven strokes ahead of his playing partner Casto, and even though Rohde finished 3-under over the front nine it seemed immaterial. But Beavers made his first slip at the par-4 13th when he three-putted from 35 feet for his first bogey of the day. Another bogey on the par-4 16th after he drove into the trees, combined with Rohde’s birdie on the par-4 15th, suddenly saw Beavers’ lead shrink to one. But Beavers, taking deep breaths before each of his shots, regained his composure on the par-4 17th, sinking a 5-foot putt to save par. ”Nothing was going wrong on the front side,” Beavers said. “Then I started hitting some squirrely shots on the back nine, which started making me a little nervous. When I heard Rohde was 6-under (for the day), I told myself on 18 I’ve got to make 4.” That would be the par-5 18th. Rohde, needing a birdie, hit a long drive to give himself a chance to go at the green in two. Rohde’s second shot was slightly to the right, landing in a green-side bunker. His bunker shot came up short, and he two-putted from 25 feet to finish with a par. ”I hit a great drive,” said Rohde, who finished with six birdies and no bogeys. “My second shot, I leaked it a little right into the bunker, and when I got into that bunker it was really thin, there wasn’t a lot of sand. So in my head I was going, ‘Just don’t scull it across the green,’ so I fatted it, unfortunately.” Beavers, unaware of Rohde’s par on 18 and thinking he needed a birdie to ensure victory, pulled his drive left and into the trees. But Beavers was able to punch out to 100 yards, then hit a wedge into the green to 7 feet. With two putts to win, Beavers, after another deep breath, rolled the birdie putt into the cup before reacting with his fist pumps. ”My drive was two feet from going in that really tall stuff, so I got a little lucky there,” Beavers said. “I had a window and I hit a really nice 3-iron out and got myself back in play and hit a really nice wedge in there. You don’t go through 54 holes of golf without getting a little lucky, and that was my break.” Beavers has won the tournament all three times he’s entered. Chris Hatch, a senior at Western Washington University, and Alvin Kwak, a sophomore at Kamiak High School, were the only other players to finish under par for tournament, as the Mukilteo residents tied for fourth at 2-under. Hatch shot a 1-under 71 Monday, Kwak shot an even-par 72.   Kevin Beavers chips on to the green under watchful eyes Monday during the final round of the Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament at Snohomsih Golf Course. Beavers finished 9-under par to become the second player ever to win the tournament three straight years.

The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing-- for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

BSE Sectors like pharma, IT and telecom are consolidating but beneficiaries like Banks, FMCG and Infrastructure are extending the bull rally, Vinod Nair Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said in an exclusive interview with Kshitij Anand of Moneycontrol. Transport Corporation of India, Bharat Electronics, Havells India, Ashok Leyland, and Bharat Forge are among top five stocks which can turn out to be multibaggers in next 2-3 years. Q) What is your call on markets right now? It looks like geopolitical concerns and earnings back home are keeping bulls at bay? A) Currently, we have a cautious view due to high valuation, high expectation for FY18 earnings growth and consolidation in the global financial market due to increase in risk. In spite of these concerns, the market is rolling higher into new high due to strong liquidity from MFs and FIIs. Sectors like pharma, IT and telecom are consolidating but beneficiaries like Banks, FMCG and Infrastructure are extending the bull rally. Developed market is hovering with some volatility led by political uncertainty over US President's ability to deliver its reform promises and interference in a federal investigation, but the overall positive trend has been maintained. The domestic market expectation for FY18 is very strong led by exponential earnings growth and benefit from the implementation of GST. The fourth quarter result has been good providing chance of this trend to continue. A case of caution is that market is expecting more than 20 percent earnings growth in FY18 compared to muted FY17 (Bloomberg), creating a risk of a setback in the future. The Sensex is currently valued at a 1-year forward P/E of about 18x. But given strong retail inflows, Mutual Funds are likely to use every dip as an opportunity to invest in equity. In the case of FIIs, the inflows will depend on the next course of action in the US, which is anticipating strong growth in the economy led by next reform and low cost of funds, FOMC has a cautious view regarding the pace of US rate hike, which is positive for EMs. Q) Any top five stocks you think could well turn out to be multibaggers in the next 2-3 years? Transport Corporation of India Implementation of Goods & Services Tax (GST) will be a game changing event for businesses in general and for organised logistics players. It will provide a boost to warehousing, supply chain management and third-party logistic players (3PL) business. Lesser border checks/paperwork would lead to faster movement of trucks; Transit times and cost is expected to shrink by 20-30%. Further, GST will lead to consolidation of warehouses and outsourcing of warehousing services to third party logistic players. Transport Corporation of India Ltd (TCI) will be one of key beneficiary from the implementation of GST given its well-integrated network with a fleet of 9000 trucks, 1400 branch network, manages 5 ships and has warehousing space of 11mn sq ft. Bharat Electronics Bharat Electronics (BEL) has market leadership in defence electronics given its strong execution capabilities, technological tie-ups with a higher focus on R&D. BEL is a debt free & a cash rich company with a strong order book with of Rs 33,806 crore which is 4.7x FY16 sales, providing strong revenue visibility for next 4 years. Further, BEL will be a major beneficiary of GoI higher focus on Make in India and higher indigenous procurement. GoI plans to bring down import dependence to 30% from current 60%. Further, under the new defence procurement policy, a new category called Buy Indian (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured – IDDM) was introduced, having the highest priority in procurement which will provide higher opportunities for domestic players and improve domestic R&D investments. Havells India Higher than expected GST rate in consumer discretionary may give some impact on volume due to likely price hike post the GST rolled out. However, being a leading player in electrical consumer goods and the recent acquisition of Lloyd consumer business is expected to bring long-term scalability to HAVL’s consumer business. We expect revenue & PAT to grow at healthy 14% & 17% CAGR over FY17-FY19E. Given strong revenue growth and healthy earnings outlook, HAVL is expected to portray a long-term story in the consumer goods segment. Ashok Leyland Ashok Leyland (AL) is the second largest commercial vehicle (CV) manufacturer in India will be direct beneficiary led by improvement in the road infrastructure projects. AL is the largest supplier of logistic vehicles to Indian Army (5% of revenue), will see higher traction from the new defence procurement policy. AL's 100% Acquisition on its 3 JV with Nissan Corporation of the LCV business will give positive impetus for the business and also allow using the Nissan technology on a 1% royalty basis for 5 years. Management is focused on gaining market share in LCV from 15% to 30% over next 2-3 years by launching new models in FY18. We expect the AL's revenue to grow at 14% CAGR over FY17-19E by factoring 12% volume growth in our estimate for the same period. Bharat Forge Bharat Forge (BFL) is planning to scale up the new business from current 5% to 15% in the next 2 to 3 years. The orders from Boeing and new defence JV with AM General will provide higher revenue visibility in the non auto sector during FY18. BFL has also entered into JVs with SAAB, Rafael & IAI (Israel Aircraft Industry) which will boost its presence in the field of air defence. Government mandatory for in-house sourcing for ‘Make in India’ projects will benefit Bharat Forge, in the long run, to build up order book. Upcoming BS6 emission norms can aid a sharp increase in content per vehicle due to increase in the engine components parts in car and Truck segment. We expect 13% revenue CAGR over FY17-19E led by picking in US truck market and de-risking the utilization in Non-auto sector Q) How are you reading RBI’s guidelines on banking sector regarding NPA? Do you think banking sector is trading at frothy valuations? What should investors do? A) The market is anticipating that the proposed NPA resolution will bring a long lasting solution to the country's NPA issue. More leeway will be given to RBI for direct intervention in NPA resolution of banks. This will remove the uncertainty pertaining over the fate of the accumulated NPA in banks book and add more stability to the sector outlook. RBI’s had broadly outlaid the action plan to tackle NPAs issue (released on 22nd may). But, given the wide nature of the report, it failed to provide clarity on the resolution of outstanding NPA. One concern which may be hoarding the market is that how much quantum of haircut banks will have to take to make this resolution effective, leading to some selling pressure on PSU banks. But, Government is moving in the right direction to strengthen the PSU banks space by favouring a merger of weaker small banks into much larger banks. This will strengthen PSU banking with fewer but stronger banks. Larger PSU banks will have significant benefits from synergies and scope of activity. Regarding valuation, we know that it is high compared to historical trend. The current re-rating in valuation is in anticipation of reforms for NPA resolution, the uptrend in business from FY18 and possibility of a reversal in RBI policy stance. Please do note that though the valuation is high it has not reached the all-time high of one year forward P/B. Hence, even if the prices are high but not completely in terms of valuation. Given the encouraging outlook for banking and Indian economy, the valuation can expand further. As a rational investor, we suggest investors be watchful and convert the dip either through external or internal factor as an opportunity to add their exposure in the banking sector. Q) March quarter season has been a mixed bag for D-Street? Do you think the trend will continue and we could see some correction on the back of high expectations of earnings growth? A) We believe that Q4 numbers for the main indexes (like Sensex) way be mixed but for the broad economy, it has been very good. For example, BSE-100 has given a PAT growth of more than 30 percent on a YoY basis led by Metals, Chemicals, Infrastructure and Energy. The fourth quarter has come as a good one on a YoY basis after a gap of about two years. This is providing more weight to the market's expectation of a reversal in earnings growth in FY18. The risk is that currently, the market expects more than 20 percent growth in earnings compared to sub single digit growth in FY17. Implementation of GST can impact the flow of business in the near-term. At the same time, we should also acknowledge the fact that GST will be a big beneficiary to the listed entities in the long-term. The trend of profitability is likely to be maintained in the future unless global factor changes. The question is whether its YoY growth will be as good anticipated by the market or sub below to conclude whether the valuation is high or fair. This question is very difficult to be answered perfectly today, whereas the trend in the long-term is intact but at premium prices. Q) What are your contra buys (sector or stocks) in the year 2017 and why? A) Three sectors which can be considered as a contrary view are: PSU banks PSU banks have not seen a major improvement in asset quality and business growth continued to remain muted in Q4FY17. Concerns prevail over the quantum of haircuts PSUBs will have to absorb in their balance sheet from the proposed NPA resolution policies. If the new framework proves to bring a sustainable solution to the NPA in the Indian banking sector, it could improve the risk profile of PSUBs and result in a re-rating in valuation. Further, PSUBs are transforming into better-disciplined management, while government’s focus on strengthening the PSU banks through mergers and meeting the capital adequacy improves the business outlook in a reviving economic environment. The current valuation and discount to private peers, therefore, provides a favourable risk-reward ratio. Additionally, Government is moving in the right direction to strengthen the PSU banks space by favouring a merger of weaker small banks into much larger banks. The revised PCA (Prompt Corrective Action) regulatory framework is expected to trigger the next phase of consolidation in the PSUB space. There will be fewer, but stronger banks and large PSU banks will benefit from synergies and scope of activity. SBI and Bank of Baroda are our top picks in the space Cement: The industry valuations (1Yr fwd) are at high on the expectation of revival in demand supported by GoI’s enhanced focus on infra and affordable housing. In spite of high valuation, we still have a positive outlook on cement due to the fact that the realisation should see an improvement going forward. Realisations will improve on account of improvement in capacity utilisation as the demand-supply gap is likely to narrow down given the reduced pace of capacity additions over FY17-18E. Further, the cost efficiency initiatives of the companies will fetch the added benefits on profitability. Additionally, the declining trend of interest rates will give a fillip to the housing sector which accounts for ~67% of total cement demand. IT: The IT sector is witnessing a structural change and is planning to recovery from a new framework of business. The current headwinds are a delay in the US new visa immigration policy and lower spending by the international customers. Other headwinds are lower penetration of the Indian IT companies in the emerging digital and artificial intelligence and a stronger rupee. As a remedy, the Indian IT companies are heavily investing in the digital platform, which is currently growing at 30 percent on a YoY basis in revenue as per the latest quarterly result. Indian IT spending is likely to rise from $270B today to $1trllion by 2024. We maintain our contrarian view in the IT space with a long-term view due to its quick adaptability to the new digital business and advantage of lower valuation. Q) The latest minutes from the RBI suggests that instead of a rate cut, the rate hike could be a possibility. Do you agree? If yes, what could be its implication on market? A) The last RBI policy minutes conclude its view as per the then available data and upcoming unknown issue like the future impact of Demonetisation, GST and caution over monsoon and its implication on food inflation. But recent data act like a shot in the arm, retail inflation has collapsed to 3 percent in April compared to 3.8 percent in March. RBI was working on an inflation rate of 4 percent for FY18, the start to the year has been good and the outlook is anticipating further consolidation in retail inflation at least in the near term due to cut in food prices. Economists expect inflation to inch higher to 5 percent by March-2018 due to the reversal of demonetisation effect over the long-term. But, currently, the market is taking it as a positive action in anticipation of good monsoon which will ease inflation further. Additionally, Government is working in such a way that GST rates will further cut the food prices. This has to be factored by RBI and can change its stance from neutral to accommodative in the medium-term. Q) What is your one advice to investors inspired from your guru? A) The market is the true guru of its own which cannot be completely explained by any Voyager due to known and unknown's factor. For example, even after spending years or decade in the equity market experts find it difficult to decide whether we are in a bull or bear market, when did it start or when it will end. Yesterday's defensive capital creates have become today's wealth destroyer or vice versa. In all this unknown’s one thing is for sure, that equity is the best asset with a good return in the long-term. The only way to explore the benefit is to keep it simple and excels in long-term. For passive investors, the best way to benefit from the ever-changing and competitive business world is through equity SIP. While for active retail investors be updated on research outputs and invest in companies which have built and grown their brands with healthy historical parameters. Work with a portfolio method which is not over diversified.To outperform the benchmark you need to identify sectors for which outlook is changing or improving led by demand-supply scenario (domestic or global market), technology changes or regulatory factors. Accordingly, you will have to get in or out of the stocks or sectors. Keeping emotions away from the investment is always advisable. tags #Ashok Leyland #Bharat Electronics #Bharat Forge #Havells India #Stocks Views #Transport Corporation of India #VinodÃ‚Â Nair Related news Business Here are a few stocks by market experts to trade for today Jun 05, 2017 09:03 AM Business GST Impact: Jockey manufacturer Page Industries gains post Credit Suisse upgrade to Neutral Jun 05, 2017 08:33 AM Business Bull's Eye: Buy Godrej Properties, Kaveri Seed; sell PFC, NMDC, DHFL Jun 05, 2017 08:05 AM Business Resistance for Nifty at 9713; Bajaj Finserv, IRB Infra bullish plays: Prakash Gaba Jun 05, 2017 07:45 AM Business Buy Bharat Electronics; target of Rs 200: Edelweiss Jun 02, 2017 05:27 PM Business Here are SP Tulsian's top trading ideas Jun 02, 2017 04:20 PM Business Maruti well poised to post double digit growth in FY18: Centrum's Awanish Chandra Jun 02, 2017 03:45 PM Business IndusInd Bank can climb to Rs 1540, Muthoot Finance Rs 435: Prakash Gaba Jun 02, 2017 03:27 PM Business Buy Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Oberoi Realty: Ashwani Gujral Jun 02, 2017 03:20 PM News Most Popular Top News How Ravi Narain built the NSE, and then lost his grip Book profits @ 9700 on Nifty; 5 stocks which can return up to 14% in short term Wipro chief Azim Premji took home 63% less salary, zero commission in FY17 What green initiatives are banks taking towards climate change?

The American Cemetery in Normandy at Omaha Beach. (GeekWire Photo / John Cook). As the first warm-weather holiday weekend of the year, it’s easy to get caught up in barbecues and road trips and lose touch with Memorial Day’s roots. But today is also about reflecting on those who have passed while serving in the armed forces. In their honor, we’ve rounded up some of our veteran and military-related coverage. We’ve also checked in on what the people and organizations have been up to since we featured them in GeekWire. Continue reading to find out what they’re up to now and to learn about the intersection of technology and military service. On the front lines of tech: Bunker Labs ready to help veterans move from military service to startups Since GeekWire’s Lisa Stiffler profiled Bunker Labs just a few months ago, the company has continued expanding to help more veterans make the leap to startups. Bunker Labs Seattle hosted its first Bunker Beers event in January in Tacoma at Odd Otter, a veteran owned establishment. (Bunker Labs Photo) Why military veterans make exceptional tech workers, and how Microsoft is helping them land jobs Earlier this month, Microsoft was recognized by the U.S. Department of Defense for its support of National Guard and Reserve military members. Among the ways the Redmond-based company supports troops is through their recruiting efforts. GeekWire’s Taylor Soper has a look at Microsoft’s mission to train and hire veterans. Military veterans Bernard Bergan (left) and Ryen Macababbad went through the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy and now work for the Redmond tech giant. Boeing and Air Force demonstrate new airborne networking system for fighter jets Boeing continues to test plane-to-plane networking systems allowing fighter jets to communicate. The Talon HATE system uses satellites to share operational data between F-15C and F-22 aircraft. GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor Alan Boyle has a look at this in-flight communications system. When the call of duty is technology, veterans rally to support each other through Operation Code Since we covered David Molina’s Operation Code, a non-profit that helps veterans launch careers in technology, the organization has grown into a massive Slack group with 1,200 members and about 60 channels. All of the members are military veterans seeking a community and resources related to coding. Molina’s efforts to get the G.I. Bill to cover coding schools is gaining traction in Congress. Operation Code website. Code Fellows wins approval to accept GI Bill to teach veterans how to code As Stiffler noted in her coverage of Operation Code, Molina has been working with Seattle developer school Code Fellows to help train more veterans in tech skills. Last year, Code Fellows received approval from the Veteran’s Administration to accept funding through the G.I. Bill. Code Fellows continues to offer scholarships and actively recruits veterans to join its program. Microsoft’s HoloLens joins the military The military has been using Microsoft’s HoloLens virtual reality headset to simulate field conditions for training exercises. Boyle revisits how the military is leveraging Microsoft’s HoloLens in today’s update: Microsoft HoloLens takes augmented reality to the next level for America’s warfighters.

File image of Air India aircraft. Reuters The investigative agency on Monday registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines — 48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing — for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on 1 March, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's 5 January direction on a petition filed by the Centre for public interest litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then civil aviation minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A group of ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India chairman-cum-managing director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline’s market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore. #Air india#Cag#Cbi#Indian airlines#Manmohan singh government#Ministry of civil aviation#Newstracker#Upa government Published Date: May 30, 2017 08:05 am | Updated Date: May 30, 2017 08:05 am Champions Trophy 2017 Match Date Details 1 Jun 5 AUS Vs BAN 2 Jun 6 ENG Vs NZ 3 Jun 7 PAK Vs SA 4 Jun 8 IND Vs SL 5 Jun 9 NZ Vs BAN Full Schedule Top Stories Jammu and Kashmir: CRPF jawans thwart suicide attack in Bandipora, 4 militants killed Saudi Arabia-led Bloc Cuts Ties With Qatar Over 'Support to ISIS, Al-Qaeda' Rahul Gandhi in Andhra promises UPA-led in 2019 would grant special status to state: 'It's not a gift, it's your right' London terror attack: British Police discover YouTube link to Saturday's attack after tip-off from perpetrator's friend Consider these 5 factors while making lump-sum investments in mutual funds ICC Champions Trophy 2017: India's comfortable win a result of an archaic, insipid Pakistan show As GST rollout nears, pain points increase and the blame rests squarely on both central, state govts Salman Khan: 'I doubt Tubelight will break Baahubali 2's record, but don't feel the pressure' Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 IND Vs PAK India beat Pakistan by 124 runs (D/L method) Afghanistan in West Indies, 3 T20 International Series, 2017 WI Vs AFG West Indies beat Afghanistan by 29 runs (D/L method) ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 SL Vs SA South Africa beat Sri Lanka by 96 runs Afghanistan in West Indies, 3 T20 International Series, 2017 WI Vs AFG West Indies beat Afghanistan by 6 wickets ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 AUS Vs NZ Match Abandoned ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 ENG Vs BAN England beat Bangladesh by 8 wickets ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 IND Vs BAN India beat Bangladesh by 240 runs ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 NZ Vs SL New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets South Africa in England, 3 ODI Series, 2017 ENG Vs SA South Africa beat England by 7 wickets ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 AUS Vs PAK Match Abandoned ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 AUS vs BAN - Jun 5th, 2017, 06:00 PM IST Afghanistan in West Indies, 3 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs AFG - Jun 6th, 2017, 05:00 AM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 ENG vs NZ - Jun 6th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 PAK vs SA - Jun 7th, 2017, 06:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 IND vs SL - Jun 8th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 NZ vs BAN - Jun 9th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST Afghanistan in West Indies, 3 ODI Series, 2017 WI vs AFG - Jun 10th, 2017, 12:00 AM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 ENG vs AUS - Jun 10th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 IND vs SA - Jun 11th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST Afghanistan in West Indies, 3 ODI Series, 2017 WI vs AFG - Jun 12th, 2017, 12:00 AM IST Site Index हिंदी फर्स्टपोस्ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Video Room Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India ICC Champions Trophy 2017 IPL 2017 E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

(Photo: Detroit News Photo Archive) 109 CONNECTTWEET 27 LINKEDIN 32 COMMENTEMAILMORE Mark Fields is the latest Ford Motor Co. chief executive ousted from a company where big decisions still are very much influenced by its founding family. Henry Ford II didn’t like Lee Iacocca, and said so publicly. Don Petersen ran afoul of Hank the Deuce and tried to sideline the next generation of the family. Jac Nasser angered dealers and employees, important constituencies to the family. And Fields, named to the top job less than three years ago, was judged to be the wrong guy at the wrong time, despite presiding over two years of record profits. “We had a board meeting (last) Friday, and following that, Mark and I got together and we decided that it was the right time for him to resign,” Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said when Fields’ departure — and the appointment of Jim Hackett as president and CEO — was announced May 22. “So really only at that point did we activate (Hackett) as the new CEO.” The automaker is in a hurry. Amid plateauing vehicle sales and lagging quality, Ford is trying to cement its place in a rapidly changing industry with newcomers Tesla Inc., Waymo, Apple Inc. and others from Silicon Valley. Hackett, a management veteran with a reputation for teamwork and attention-grabbing moves in his time as head of Steelcase Inc., follows Fields as a “change agent” who Bill Ford Jr. hopes will dismantle the management hierarchy and better deliver the message that the automaker is a future-looking company. “With Mark, it was kind of a retrenchment to some of that Ford history,” said David Cole, chairman emeritus at the Center for Automotive Research. “That, plus the decline in the value, put a lot of pressure on all the shareholders, which included the Ford family… I think they perceived Mark Fields as business as usual. And that turned out to be the kiss of death. “That would have scared the liver out of anybody.” Ford CEOs have always had tough jobs for a multitude of reasons. Few could have filled Alan Mulally’s shoes, according to Cole. “One of the toughest jobs in the world is to replace somebody who was viewed as an icon,” Cole said. “That was a horrifying job that Mark had.” History of clashes Since Henry Ford II fired automotive legend Lee Iacocca in 1978, Ford CEOs and presidents have stayed with the company for an average of four years — not including Bill Ford Jr.’s tenure in the 2000s. Fields was fired two years and 11 months after his appointment to succeed Mulally, whose tenure ran for nearly eight years. The family with its name on the cars of the 114-year-old automaker remains a guiding and stabilizing force within the company. Bill Ford Jr. and his cousin Edsel Ford II sit on the 16-member board. As chairman since 1999, Bill Ford Jr. is the voice of the Ford family. Record profits and sales under Fields were marred by an unclear vision for the future. His retirement came as the board grew less confident in Fields and more involved in pushing for a clear path forward for the company.

Javits Convention Center in New York City.

In recent months, Ford’s outside directors began to delve more deeply into Fields’ strategy for the future and grew increasingly troubled with the company’s direction and Fields’ ability to lead it, according to a source familiar with the situation. The Ford family’s 70.9 million shares make up less than 2 percent of the company shares, yet the stake gives the family 40 percent of the voting power within the company, according to a February regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under a structure established when the automaker went public in 1956, a single Class B share is equivalent to 16 common shares, and can be owned only by family members. The weighted shares have been challenged by recurring proposals at annual meetings, but those challenges have been routinely voted down. Dissident shareholders like John Chevedden have called the super-votes unfair because they give the Ford family so much control. “The super-voting shares effectively give them veto power over any decisions,” said Bryce Hoffman, author of “American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company” and a former Detroit News auto writer. “But the company still has to satisfy the public markets. Nobody can force the family to do something they don’t want to do. That doesn’t make it immune to the market.” Ford CEOs have historically clashed with the family even during periods of growth. But that doesn’t appear to be the case with the dismissal of Fields, as pressure came from outside directors. Iacocca, whose eight-year run as Ford’s president began in 1970, infamously butted heads with then-Chairman and CEO Henry Ford II. Even bringing the wildly popular Ford Mustang to the market in 1964 and running the Blue Oval during Detroit’s Golden Age didn’t keep Iacocca in good standing with Hank the Deuce. “It’s personal, and I can’t tell you any more. It’s just one of those things,” the grandson of the company’s founder told Iacocca when firing him, according to “Iacocca: An Autobiography.” When Iacocca pressed, Hank the Deuce replied: “Well, sometimes you just don’t like somebody.” Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford, arrives on set of Good Morning America to reveal the new 2015 Ford Mustang on December 5, 2013 in New York City. The 2015 model marks the 50th anniversary of the Ford Mustang line.  (Photo: Andrew Burton / Getty Images) Phil Caldwell, a loyal lieutenant of Hank the Deuce, took over the presidency from Iacocca. In 1981, he became the first company CEO whose last name was not Ford. In the four years before his retirement, Caldwell led the company through some of its most difficult years, including competition from Japanese carmakers. Bill Ford Jr. and his cousin Edsel Ford II worked their ways into the company’s highest ranks in the late ’80s and early ’90s. Donald Petersen, Ford’s CEO from 1985-89, was known to quote Edsel Ford in saying there were no crown princes at the Blue Oval. “I’m not a caretaker for anybody,” Petersen told Fortune magazine in 1989. “I admire the fact that (Edsel and Bill) are trying very hard to go as far as they can. But being a Ford does not give them a leg up. The principle we must operate on is that selection to top management is based solely on merit.” Amid disagreements with the board and the Ford family, Petersen was forced out. Then as now, the company’s leadership cannot be separated from the family. Bill Ford Jr. told The New York Times in 1993, “When people joined this company, they knew we held this unique position. So if it makes other people uncomfortable, I guess I’m sorry. But it’s a fact of life they’re going to have to live with.” Harold “Red” Poling, who followed Petersen as CEO from 1990 to 1992, appeared to have few disputes with the family and retired from the company at age 68. But when Bill Ford Jr. became chairman in 1998 — a position that was held by then-CEO and President Alex Trotman — Trotman spat, “So now you have your monarchy back, Prince William,” Fortune reported in 2000. The family oversight has often proved beneficial, according to Hoffman. He said they were instrumental in pushing out CEO Jac Nasser in 2001 after less than two years on the job amid conflicts with dealers and employees – and the Firestone rollover crisis. That crisis linked faulty tires used on the Ford Explorer and other vehicles to 200 deaths and 800 injuries, leading to a recall and replacement of 20 million tires.

He recruited Alan Mulally from Boeing Co. in 2006 to lead a sweeping industrial restructuring as the automaker slipped into crisis and then the Great Recession, which pushed two Detroit rivals into bankruptcy. Mulally was credited with changing the culture at Ford by fostering teamwork under his “One Ford” mantra. During his tenure, Mulally cut six of Ford’s eight brands and mortgaged the company’s assets — including the Blue Ovals on the sides of World Headquarters — to carry it through the Great Recession. Mulally was well-regarded within the company. In 2014, Mulally left the company on his own terms. And with board approval, he backed Fields to succeed him. Feeling the pressure Shares fell 40 percent under Fields, vehicle quality slipped and strategic decisions were delayed or slow to come to market. The company was void of short-term achievements despite long-term aspirations, analysts say, and Fields engaged in rhetorical battles with President Donald Trump. This pressured the board and frustrated shareholders, despite record sales and profits. Fields’ pay packages, determined solely by a compensation committee of outside directors, signaled more dissatisfaction with his leadership. Last year, Ford’s top five executives missed out on hundreds of thousands in bonus pay because the company failed to meet quality standards. While Fields still made a $2.7 million incentive bonus for meeting company goals last year, he missed out on additional bonuses as CEO that were awarded to other executives to “recognize and reward exceptional performance.” During his time as CEO he was never awarded one of those incremental bonuses, according to Ford proxy statements. “We’re as frustrated as you are by the stock price,” Bill Ford Jr. said during the company’s annual shareholders meeting May 11. “Most of (the Ford family’s) net worth is tied up in the company, and stock price matters a lot to us.” Cole said the lagging stock price amplified other troubling factors under Fields. “They want (their shares) to be profitable,” he said. “Unless the world thinks Ford is a good investment, it’s not good for the family. In (Fields’) case, both the family and the external shareholders (were asking) what’s wrong with this picture.” The re-emerging “Old Ford” culture of hierarchy – and a lack of clarity about where the company was going – caused concern in the company, according to comments Bill Ford Jr. made after Fields’ departure. The board feared the company would fail to compete in an industry headed toward automation and areas like ride-sharing. Ford Motor Co.

He said Fields failed to follow “this amazing management system” Mulally left, which is part of the reason he didn’t last. Bill Ford Jr. said as much in an interview with The Detroit News last week: “I didn’t feel the ‘Old Ford’ so much as I felt the stress. When Alan was here, he engendered such a sense of can-do and optimism. And maybe we lost a little of that.” The key for Hackett will be delivering quick results, according to Hoffman and Cole. “Hackett got on the radar screen (and) obviously, Bill was very enamored with his performance,” said Cole, adding that the 62-year-old CEO will have to implement a culture of change in a short amount of time. The company, he said, “can’t go back.” ithibodeau@detroitnews.com Twitter: @Ian_Thibodeau 109 CONNECTTWEET 27 LINKEDIN 32 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2sfsgRZ TOP VIDEOS Impressions of Wednesday's Mackinac Conference 6:41 Flyover of the Little Caesars Arena neighborhood 0:38 Spirit airlines unveils new maintenance hangar at DTW 1:24 Raw video: Taking a hot lap on Belle Isle 3:58 Little Caesars world headquarters hosts 'topping out' ceremony 1:33 Entrepreneur/actor Hill Harper an admirer of Detroit 2:55 Construction continues on M-59 1:51 Packard site owner: 'We will not fail' 2:56 QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51

He also said the purchase decision was cleared by the former finance minister P Chidambaram-led Empowered Group of Ministers. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three separate cases in connection with the alleged irregularities in the purchase or hiring of the aircraft during the tenure of Patel. The move by CBI is crucial as it has already initiated a preliminary inquiry into all these aspects after the Supreme Court's direction in November 2013. Patel said when the UPA government came to power, Air India was struggling with its old fleet. In 2003, the Vajpayee government decided to disinvest in Air India, and therefore no new acquisition was considered. "In 2004, the UPA government decided to continue AI as a public sector undertaking (PSU). At the time, I informed the prime minister (Manmohan Singh) that it was difficult to turn around AI with its current fleet and precarious financial condition. The government decided there was need to continue AI operations but to induct new planes as the international and domestic competition was taking away customers," Patel said. Accordingly, the AI board decided on a comprehensive long-term strategy to induct new planes and phase out the aging ones. Indian Airlines decided to purchase 43 Airbus 320s family aircraft and AI decided to induct the long -haul Boeing 777 and the new generation 787 Dream Liner. The AI board issued a tender, while IA had had already completed the tendering process during the previous government. "I wrote to the PM informing him that since this was a large purchase, we should have an oversight committee to oversee the entire process. The PM appointed CG Somiah, a former CAG and CVC, to overlook the entire process,'' Patel said. Later, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) constituted the Chidambaram-led EGoM to discuss with manufacturers and negotiate the best possible price. "The EGoM finalised all transactions and orders with Boeing and Air Bus, respectively. The decision by EGoM was ratified by the PM and the Cabinet," he noted. Patel reiterated that the entire process was done through bidding, and even before going to the Cabinet for ratification, his ministry wrote to the then CAG and CVC to examine all documents. However, he said they declined to do so saying that it was not required at that stage. Further, even in the context of the number of aircraft, it is important to mention that even though the order was finalised in December 2005, all the aircraft have not been delivered as on the date, Patel said. "Twenty three aircraft have been delivered in the last three years. If there was something wrong, it should have been addressed accordingly," Patel said. He said the finance ministry had given a sovereign guarantee to cover the purchase in view of AI's precarious financial position.

The agency has also registered a preliminary enquiry to look into the merger of Air India and erstwhile Indian Airlines which the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had called "ill-timed". The cases have bee registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of "tens of thousands of crore of rupees" to the exchequer, he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor has said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The planning commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which alleged caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal before. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Previous Next Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets with Pope Francis for a private audience at the Vatican on Monday, May 29, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Highlights from the news file for Monday, May 29 ——— POPE OPEN TO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS APOLOGY, PM SAYS: Canadians are anxious to reconcile with Indigenous Peoples, Justin Trudeau described telling Pope Francis on Monday as he asked the pontiff to apologize for the role the Catholic Church played in the tragedy of residential schools. The Pope — himself no stranger to the cause of social justice, he noted to Trudeau — seemed open to the idea, the prime minister said as he related the broad strokes of their private conversation at the Vatican. "He reminded me that his entire life has been dedicated to supporting marginalized people in the world," Trudeau said after he arrived back in Rome. Pope Francis also expressed his enthusiasm for working with the prime minister and the Canadian bishops on finding a way forward on the issue of an apology, as recommended by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission included the demand for a papal apology — to survivors, their families and communities — as one of the 94 recommendations in its report on the dark 120-year history and tragic legacy of residential schools. ——— SCHEER GETS HERO'S WELCOME FROM TORY CAUCUS: New Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is basking in a hero's welcome on Parliament Hill. The Saskatchewan member of Parliament was feted by his fellow MPs and leadership rivals alike as he arrived Monday to address the Tory caucus, fresh off a thrilling final-ballot win in the party's leadership contest on the weekend. He called the role a great honour, but an even greater responsibility. Scheer touched on all of the same themes he delivered following Saturday night's win, hailing the efforts of the other 12 candidates who sought the job and singling out Quebec MP Maxime Bernier in particular. Bernier was the presumptive front-runner throughout the race and the leader throughout Saturday night's nail-biting process of elimination, right up until the last ballot. He did not stop to speak to reporters prior to Monday's meeting. Scheer did have significant support among other elected MPs going into the campaign, about two dozen by the end of it. Many of the rest had backed fellow MP Erin O'Toole. ——— NDP LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE PREGNANT: NDP leadership candidate Niki Ashton says she is expecting a baby in November. Ashton, a Manitoba MP, is one of six candidates seeking the party's top job. The leadership race is scheduled to wrap up in October, when rank-and-file members pick a successor to Tom Mulcair. Ashton says she plans to carry on her work, adding she will continue to reach out to party members, activists and progressives across Canada. She says she intends to visit B.C. and the Atlantic provinces in the next two weeks. Ashton's rivals in the race include Quebec MP Guy Caron, Ontario legislature member Jagmeet Singh, Ontario MP Charlie Angus, former veterans ombudsman Pat Stogran and B.C. MP Peter Julian. ——— SACRED FIRE LIT TO LAUNCH MISSING WOMEN INQUIRY: A sacred fire ceremony in Whitehorse has marked the first family hearings of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. About 30 people gathered in a circle at sunrise for traditional prayers and songs as the fire was lit this morning. It will burn until the hearings conclude in Whitehorse later this week. Forty families are registered to testify before the commissioners in both public and private hearings between Tuesday and Thursday. Commissioners will be examining and reporting on the causes of violence against indigenous females by scrutinizing practices, policies and institutions, including policing and child welfare. Yukon minister responsible for the women's directorate, Jeanie Dendys, says 41 indigenous women have disappeared or been killed in the territory over several decades. Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston says he's pleased the families of missing and murdered women in the territory finally have a chance to present their stories and share their challenges. ——— CANADIANS WEIGH IN ON PLANNED ACCESSIBILITY LAW: Public consultations on Canada's first national law for disabled people have identified high unemployment rates, inaccessible buildings and barriers in transportation as some of the key issues that need to be addressed. The priorities were laid out in a report, released by the federal government Monday, summarizing eight months of consultations held with Canadians from coast to coast. It says participants wanted to see laws that would help lower stubbornly high unemployment rates for those with disabilities, reduce the number of buildings inaccessible to those with physical and intellectual disabilities, and remove accessibility barriers for the country's air, rail, ferry and bus transportation systems. The report also says Canadians have voiced a strong preference for the government to set up an independent body to oversee compliance with the new laws, which are expected to come before the House of Commons in early 2018. ——— GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES FAMINE RELIEF FUND: Aid agencies are urging Canadians to respond generously to the federal government's matching fund for famine relief in Africa and the Middle East, calling it a response to the worst humanitarian crisis in decades. The Liberal government said Monday it would match donations made by Canadians to registered charities to create a famine relief fund for more than 20 million men, women and children who are at risk of starvation. International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said the fund would support Canadian and international organizations working to provide assistance in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen and neighbouring regions. Bibeau said the government's window to match donations is from March 17 to June 30. Millions of people in the four affected countries and neighbouring regions are in need of necessities including water, sanitation services, shelter and urgent food assistance, Bibeau added. ——— JUDGE BANS ABORTION PROTESTS AT NEW BRUNSWICK HOSPITAL: As provinces across Canada move to establish protest-free "buffer zones" around abortion providers, a judge has banned anti-abortion activists from demonstrating outside a hospital in northern New Brunswick. Court of Queen's Bench Judge Reginald Leger granted a permanent injunction against protesters outside the Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. The anti-abortion picketers, affiliated with the 40 Days for Life campaign, put the safety of patients and employees at risk, Leger said in his recent decision. The ruling comes amid efforts across the country to strike a balance between the constitutional right to free expression and ensuring safe access to health-care services without harassment or intimidation. Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said Monday he plans to introduce legislation that would create safe zones outside abortion clinics in that province, citing reports of harassment at an Ottawa clinic. The Newfoundland and Labrador government introduced a law last November, modelled after British Columbia's Access to Abortion Services Act, to keep protesters at least 50 metres away from an abortion clinic. ——— FILINGS SHED LIGHT ON BOMBARDIER-BOEING DISPUTE: Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. ——— QUEBEC TABLES BACK-TO-WORK CONSTRUCTION BILL: The Quebec government tabled a bill Monday forcing the province's striking construction workers back on the job by Wednesday. In response, a coalition of construction unions promised to contest the bill in court, saying the legislation favours construction companies. Thousands of workers gathered in front of Quebec's legislature earlier Monday to voice their disapproval of the government's decision to end their strike after five days. The back-to-work bill maintains current working conditions for the province's 175,000 construction workers and grants them a pay raise of 1.8 per cent. It also opens an immediate five-month mediation period after which the unions and construction companies will be required to enter into arbitration. Members of the legislature are expected to debate the bill late into the night but the Liberal majority in the legislature will ensure it passes. Quebec Labour Minister Dominique Vien said before tabling her bill that both sides had months to negotiate a new agreement and added that every strike day costs the Quebec economy $45 million. ——— ONTARIO TAXPAYERS FOOT $120K BILL FOR GIANT DUCK: An Ontario government grant of about $120,000 that is going toward a giant rubber duck for Canada 150 celebrations is ruffling some feathers. The 18.6-metre, 13,600-kilogram yellow duck is being brought to Toronto by the Redpath Waterfront Festival, reportedly at a total cost of $200,000, combining other funding. It's being billed as a tourist attraction — with particular Instagram and selfie appeal — and will also be taken to other communities in Ontario. Ontario's Progressive Conservatives say they're unclear on the giant duck's connection to Canada's heritage celebrations and call it a waste of taxpayer money. Tourism, Culture and Sport Minister Eleanor McMahon says the province has been funding the waterfront festival for the past three years and it does a good job promoting tourism. She cautions against focusing too much on the duck, adding she thinks it is much ado about nothing. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Ashton's rivals in the race include Quebec MP Guy Caron, Ontario legislature member Jagmeet Singh, Ontario MP Charlie Angus, former veterans ombudsman Pat Stogran and B.C. MP Peter Julian.  ——— SACRED FIRE LIT TO LAUNCH MISSING WOMEN INQUIRY: A sacred fire ceremony in Whitehorse has marked the first family hearings of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. About 30 people gathered in a circle at sunrise for traditional prayers and songs as the fire was lit this morning. It will burn until the hearings conclude in Whitehorse later this week. Forty families are registered to testify before the commissioners in both public and private hearings between Tuesday and Thursday. Commissioners will be examining and reporting on the causes of violence against indigenous females by scrutinizing practices, policies and institutions, including policing and child welfare. Yukon minister responsible for the women's directorate, Jeanie Dendys, says 41 indigenous women have disappeared or been killed in the territory over several decades. Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston says he's pleased the families of missing and murdered women in the territory finally have a chance to present their stories and share their challenges. ——— CANADIANS WEIGH IN ON PLANNED ACCESSIBILITY LAW: Public consultations on Canada's first national law for disabled people have identified high unemployment rates, inaccessible buildings and barriers in transportation as some of the key issues that need to be addressed. The priorities were laid out in a report, released by the federal government Monday, summarizing eight months of consultations held with Canadians from coast to coast. It says participants wanted to see laws that would help lower stubbornly high unemployment rates for those with disabilities, reduce the number of buildings inaccessible to those with physical and intellectual disabilities, and remove accessibility barriers for the country's air, rail, ferry and bus transportation systems. The report also says Canadians have voiced a strong preference for the government to set up an independent body to oversee compliance with the new laws, which are expected to come before the House of Commons in early 2018. ——— GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES FAMINE RELIEF FUND: Aid agencies are urging Canadians to respond generously to the federal government's matching fund for famine relief in Africa and the Middle East, calling it a response to the worst humanitarian crisis in decades. The Liberal government said Monday it would match donations made by Canadians to registered charities to create a famine relief fund for more than 20 million men, women and children who are at risk of starvation. International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said the fund would support Canadian and international organizations working to provide assistance in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen and neighbouring regions. Bibeau said the government's window to match donations is from March 17 to June 30. Millions of people in the four affected countries and neighbouring regions are in need of necessities including water, sanitation services, shelter and urgent food assistance, Bibeau added. ——— JUDGE BANS ABORTION PROTESTS AT NEW BRUNSWICK HOSPITAL: As provinces across Canada move to establish protest-free "buffer zones" around abortion providers, a judge has banned anti-abortion activists from demonstrating outside a hospital in northern New Brunswick. Court of Queen's Bench Judge Reginald Leger granted a permanent injunction against protesters outside the Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. The anti-abortion picketers, affiliated with the 40 Days for Life campaign, put the safety of patients and employees at risk, Leger said in his recent decision. The ruling comes amid efforts across the country to strike a balance between the constitutional right to free expression and ensuring safe access to health-care services without harassment or intimidation. Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said Monday he plans to introduce legislation that would create safe zones outside abortion clinics in that province, citing reports of harassment at an Ottawa clinic. The Newfoundland and Labrador government introduced a law last November, modelled after British Columbia's Access to Abortion Services Act, to keep protesters at least 50 metres away from an abortion clinic. ——— FILINGS SHED LIGHT ON BOMBARDIER-BOEING DISPUTE: Boeing says its trade complaint against Bombardier is designed to prevent the Montreal-based rival from using subsidies to build a larger version of the CSeries plane that would directly compete with its own flagship narrowbody 737 aircraft. Last week, Boeing filed a document with the U.S. International Trade Commission that sheds new light on the tit-for-tat dispute between the two aerospace manufacturers. In the 109-page filing, Boeing said Bombardier would be positioned to build a full-fleet of single-aisle planes — repeating a strategy employed by French aerospace company Airbus — if Canadian subsidies to Bombardier are left unaddressed. Bombardier said in a separate filing that Boeing's effort to shut down its innovative technology from the market is "misguided," adding that the complaint is tantamount to asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to imagine a hypothetical world in the future. ——— QUEBEC TABLES BACK-TO-WORK CONSTRUCTION BILL: The Quebec government tabled a bill Monday forcing the province's striking construction workers back on the job by Wednesday. In response, a coalition of construction unions promised to contest the bill in court, saying the legislation favours construction companies. Thousands of workers gathered in front of Quebec's legislature earlier Monday to voice their disapproval of the government's decision to end their strike after five days. The back-to-work bill maintains current working conditions for the province's 175,000 construction workers and grants them a pay raise of 1.8 per cent. It also opens an immediate five-month mediation period after which the unions and construction companies will be required to enter into arbitration. Members of the legislature are expected to debate the bill late into the night but the Liberal majority in the legislature will ensure it passes. Quebec Labour Minister Dominique Vien said before tabling her bill that both sides had months to negotiate a new agreement and added that every strike day costs the Quebec economy $45 million. ——— ONTARIO TAXPAYERS FOOT $120K BILL FOR GIANT DUCK: An Ontario government grant of about $120,000 that is going toward a giant rubber duck for Canada 150 celebrations is ruffling some feathers. The 18.6-metre, 13,600-kilogram yellow duck is being brought to Toronto by the Redpath Waterfront Festival, reportedly at a total cost of $200,000, combining other funding. It's being billed as a tourist attraction — with particular Instagram and selfie appeal — and will also be taken to other communities in Ontario. Ontario's Progressive Conservatives say they're unclear on the giant duck's connection to Canada's heritage celebrations and call it a waste of taxpayer money. Tourism, Culture and Sport Minister Eleanor McMahon says the province has been funding the waterfront festival for the past three years and it does a good job promoting tourism. She cautions against focusing too much on the duck, adding she thinks it is much ado about nothing.

Watch video Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE cut ties with Qatar; say it supports 'terrorism' The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three FIRs and launched a preliminary enquiry to probe alleged irregularities in Indian Airlines-Air India merger and purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of planes and giving-up of profit-making routes by Air India. These decisions, according to the CBI, caused a loss to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees to the exchequer. The Union Cabinet had cleared the Indian Airlines-Air India merger proposal in March 2007. NCP leader Praful Patel was the civil aviation minister when both the merger and acquisition of Boeing aircraft to expand fleet took place. CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said the FIRs have been registered for offences of criminal conspiracy and corruption against unidentified officials of the ministry and Air India. The cases relate to decisions taken by the ministry during the tenure of the UPA government causing a loss of “tens of thousands of crore” of rupees to the exchequer, he said. A preliminary enquiry has been registered to probe the merger, while 3 FIRs have been lodged to probe alleged irregularities in the purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of planes while acquisition process was still on, and giving-up of profitable routes in favour of national and international airlines by Air India, Gaur said. In a report tabled in Parliament in January 2012, CAG had flagged these irregularities and called the decision to acquire 111 planes by Air India “a recipe for disaster”, which should have raised alarm in the government. It said the aircraft acquisition through debt had “contributed predominantly” to the airline’s massive debt liability. CAG had also called the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines “ill-timed” and pointed out that “the financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger”. “The entire acquisition (for both Air India and Indian Airlines) was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for Indian Airlines. This was a recipe for disaster and should have raised alarm signals in Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and the Planning Commission,” the report said. The CAG also flagged the “speed” at which the acquisition process for 68 aircraft was dealt with and observed that it was based on “flawed” assumptions. Given that the initial proposal was made in December 1996, CAG had said that acquisition process took an “unduly long time” and only in January 2004 a plan was made to buy 28 planes, which was revisited and later increased to 68 aircraft. “This increase in numbers does not withstand audit scrutiny, considering the market requirements obtaining then or forecast for the future, as also the commercial viability projected to justify the acquisition. The acquisition appears to be supply-driven”, the report had said. Terming the merger “ill-timed”, the report had said this exercise was undertaken “strangely from the top (rather than by the perceived needs of both these airlines), with inadequate validation of the financial benefits”.

Reply P Pradip Naik May 31, 2017 at 12:34 am Air-India was once a profitable airline. During 53 out of 67 years of Congress rule in India, ru party was corrupt & the govt officials don't know how to run the cos & they have no forsight. Ordering 787 dreamliners was a disaster. You have to order wide-body a/c like A380, 747-8 & 777-300/300ER for the future growth. AI most profitable routes were Nairobi & Gulf Sectors so as Malaysia & Singapore sectors. AI withdrew NON-STOP flight between JFK & Mumbai. That was a big mistake. If you operate NON-STOP 747-8 daily & round the year, the flight will go full. Reply C Citizen May 30, 2017 at 5:19 pm Air India is a white elephant apart from all these things their staff should know to serve/treat all the customers properly I emphasize once again ALL the customers. They should change their mind set then only it can improve their coffers nothing else. One mis behaved with the staff and escaped with apology that only can happen on this air line that shows how they discriminate customers on the basis of color,power,gender etc. Jaihind Reply A ashok May 30, 2017 at 11:53 am Corrupt ministers n officials in UPA regime got together to improve their conditions at the expense of the country exchequer. Middle East air lines like Emirates, Air Arabia, Etihad, Qatar airway, etc. Each operate more than 2 flights daily before 2010 to Indian cities but AI was significantly absent. These corrupt people for selfish gains caused immense damage to the country. I request Mr. Modi government to take appropriate steps to eliminate corruption in the country.

The CBI will probe the controversial merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, besides alleged irregularities in purchase and lease of aircraft by the two state-run carriers under the UPA government which caused "huge" losses to the exchequer. The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing-- for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers (GoM) had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

The investigative agency today registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government with regard to the two national carriers, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases have been registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. "The cases relate to decisions taken by the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of tens of thousands of crore of rupees to the exchequer," he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Mr Gaur said about the first FIR. The government's auditor CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing-- for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor had said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The Planning Commission. The second case relates to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which allegedly caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said, "The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CBI sources said "all stakeholders" were under its scanner with regard to the merger of the two state-run airlines. The process for the merger was initiated by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel of NCP on March 16, 2006. Patel had sought a concept paper on the merger and a presentation was made before the prime minister on March 22 that year. A Group of Ministers had later examined the proposal. Indian Airlines officially merged with Air India in April 2007. The current Air India Chairman-cum-Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had recently said the merger was behind Air India's "downfall". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on Saturday favoured disinvestment of Air India, saying the airline's market share was just around 14 per cent whereas its debt burden stood at a staggering Rs 50,000 crore.

X Russia squares up to Boeing and Airbus with maiden flight of jet Medium-range aircraft capable of seating more than 200 completes 30-minute flight Mon, May 29, 2017, 20:26 The MC-21-300 passenger airliner during its maiden flight in Irkutsk, Russia. Photograph: Irkut Corporation/EPA         Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger aircraft on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000m and travelling at 300km/h. Squeezed by western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to the media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic aircraft duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Flight’s brevity Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent three- to four-hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A western aircraft-making source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed to be checked in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut general director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engined MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300, which will have 160-211 seats; and the later MS-21-200, which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media has said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 aircraft. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new aircraft could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. With a range of up to 6,000km, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 per cent operational savings compared to previous versions. – (Reuters)       Topics: Oleg Demchenko Oleg Kononenko Aeroflot Airbus Boeing Irkut United Aircraft China East Aimak Europe Russia Ukraine United States Read More Eight British Airways flights from Dublin cancelled over IT failure Knock Airport leads the way in Irish passenger growth BA chief says he will not resign over IT problems Road Warrior: Alitalia bid deadline ICG sells 21-year-old vessel for €45m Steering parts shortage stalls BMW car production What now for DAA as Toland checks out three years early?

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary MC-21-300 new Russian airliner maiden flight completed MC-21-300 new Russian airliner maiden flight completed May 29, 2017, 7:32 PM BST | Written by Christian Nordqvist | MC-21-300, the new Russian commercial airliner, has completed its maiden flight at an airfield of the Irkutsk Aviation Plant, Irkut Corporation announced today. Irkut Corporation, part of the United Aircraft Corporation, is a Moscow-based aircraft manufacturer. The maiden flight lasted thirty minutes, during which the new airplane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters and a speed of 300 km/h. Squeezed by economic sanctions by the United States, much of Europe, and other allies, Russia is attempting to revive domestic industrial production to make the country more economically self-sufficient. This Russian airplane’s test flight, which had not been announced to the media in advance, comes just three weeks after the maiden flight of China’s new C919 passenger jet. According to Irkut Corporation: “The airliner is offered to the customers with two options of power plant – PW1400G of Pratt & Whitney Company (USA) or PD-14 of United Engine Corporation (Russia). New-generation engines feature reduced fuel consumption, low noise and hazardous emissions. MC-21 aircraft meets prospective environmental requirements.” (Image: adapted from eng.irkut.com) Suddenly, the global market is looking much more precarious for the two commercial aviation giants, America’s Boeing and and Europe’s Airbus. In a Reuters article, Gleb Stolyarov and Jack Stubbs wrote that Western aviation experts expressed surprise at how short the maiden flight was, as well as its low altitude. Most American and European maiden flights last from three to four hours. Reuters quoted an ‘anonymous’ Western flight test engineer, who said: “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back.” The test pilots Oleg Kononenko (far left) and Roman Taskayev, talking to Oleg Demchenko, President of Irkut Corporation. The new MC-21-300 airplane is in the background. (Image: eng.irkut.com) MC-21-300 flight successful – Irkut claims The company said that during the MC-21-300 maiden flight, a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and then turning. This is a common technique for a new aircraft’s maiden flight. MC-21-300 was piloted by Oleg Kononenko, crew commander, and Roman Taskayev, copilot. Mr. Kononenko said: “Flight mission is accomplished. The flight went in the normal mode. There are no obstacles revealed preventing the tests continuation.” Mr. Taskayev added: “Characteristics and operational modes of the power plant are confirmed, all aircraft systems operated without glitches.” President of Irkut Corporation, Oleg Demchenko, said: “Today is the historic day for our personnel and the whole big team, which works on creation of MC-21 aircraft. We put the most advanced technical solutions in our aircraft, to provide enhanced comfort for passengers and attractive economic characteristics for air carriers.” MC-21-300 team members at Irkutsk Aviation Plant on the day of the maiden flight. (Image: eng.irkut.com) “I am happy to declare the maiden flight of the MC-21 aircraft has been successfully accomplished. I congratulate all project participants on our common holiday!” MC-21-300 New Russian Aircraft MC-21-300 is a next-generation commercial airplane with a capacity of between 163 and 211 passengers. Irkut Corporation says that the aircraft has the largest fuselage diameter in the category of narrow-body aircraft, which provides passengers with a qualitatively new level of comfort. According to a press release by Irkut Corporation: “This design decision significantly widens private space of each passenger, ensures free passage of passenger and service trolley over the aisle, and shortens airport turnover time. ” “Natural lighting of the passenger cabin is enhanced due to big windows. Comfortable air pressure and advanced microclimate will be maintained in the aircraft.” Western experts wondered why the maiden flight was so short – just 30 minutes. Test flights in Europe and North America generally last from three to four hours. (Image: eng.irkut.com) The manufacturer says its new commercial aircraft has an innovative ergonomic pilot cabin, and is superior to any similarly-sized plane that is currently out there in terms of efficiency and flight-technical characteristics. MC-21-300 features: – Dense layout capacity: 211 seats – Two-class layout capacity: 163 seats (147 economy plus 16 business) – Maximum takeoff weight: 79,250 kg – Maximum payload: 22,600 kg – Maximum flight range: 6,000 km – Height: 11.5 meters – Length: 42.2 meters – Wing span: 35.9 meters Video – MC-21-300 maiden flight This Sputnik video of the MC-21-300’s maiden flight starts with a view of inside the cockpit as the new aircraft takes off.

The agency has also registered a preliminary enquiry to look into the merger of Air India and erstwhile Indian Airlines which the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had called "ill-timed". The cases have bee registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. The cases relate to decisions taken by the the ministry during the tenure of the UPA which caused losses of "tens of thousands of crore of rupees" to the exchequer, he said. "The allegations relate to purchase of 111 aircraft for national airlines costing about Rs 70,000 crore to benefit foreign aircraft manufacturers. Such a purchase caused an alleged financial loss to the already stressed national carriers," Gaur said about the first FIR. The CAG had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the government's decision to order 111 airplanes for AI and Indian Airlines--48 from Airbus and 68 from Boeing for about Rs 70,000 crore in 2006. Calling the decision a "recipe for disaster", the government auditor has said it should have raised "alarm" in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Public Investment Board and The planning commission. The second case pertains to leasing of a large number of aircraft without due consideration, proper route study and marketing or price strategy, he said. "It was also alleged that the aircraft were leased even while aircraft acquisition programme was going on," he said. The third case involves allegations of surrender of profitable routes and timings of Air India to favour national and international private players which alleged caused a "huge" loss to the state-run carrier. In its report on the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, the CAG had called it "ill-timed". Now the CBI will go into various aspects of the merger. The government auditor had said,"The financial case for the merger was not adequately validated prior to the merger." The merger proposal had received the Manmohan Singh cabinet's approval on March 1, 2007. The CBI's action follows the Supreme Court's January 5 direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, produced by Irkut Corporation, takes off in Irkutsk, Russia, May 28, 2017. (Reuters Photo) Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependent on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jet making source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Tourism A special ceremony involving 1,453 trucks was arranged Monday near...

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight’s brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. “It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back,” said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a “genteel flight”. A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15% cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15% operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. “I’m sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he said. more from business Wipro chief Azim Premji’s salary drops 63% to Rs 79 lakh in a year Jun 04, 2017 23:55 IST No downturn in IT sector, reports are wrong, jobs will come: Ravi Shankar Prasad Jun 04, 2017 23:38 IST Nurturing Recruitment-Ready Students Promotional Feature Recommended for you Read more Who will buy Air India?

European plane makers who import US-made parts fear this will endanger the multi-billion dollar deals they have done there. By Thomas Jahn and Jens Koenen Published on 29. May 2017, 12:06 Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Deal in danger: An Airbus A330-200 in service for Iran Air. Source: Airbus It was only a couple of sentences but they were enough to cause a major amount of concern in the aerospace industry. In a hearing, US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin announced his intention to impose additional sanctions not only on Syria and North Korea, but also on Iran. Then he added, “both in the case of Boeing and Airbus, there are licenses that will be required and they are under review.” A lot of money is at stake. Airbus has an order from Iran Air for 32 A320neo-s, six A320ceo-s, eight A321ceo-s, eight A330—200s, 28 A330—900neo-s and 16 A350—1000s. And a lot of money will continue to be at stake: As one Airbus press release put it, on the delivery of the first of the Airbus A321s to Iran in January this year: “Iran is forecast to require some 400 to 500 new aircraft to modernize as well as to grow its existing passenger fleet to catch up with years of pent up demand on domestic as well as international routes.” Want to keep reading?

By India Ashok May 29, 2017 07:07 BST The MS-21 successfully completed a 300minute flight, flying at 300km an hour at an altitude of 1,000mIrkut Corporation Russia quietly launched a new medium-range passenger jet, the MS-21, on Sunday (28 May), which it hopes will boost its aviation industry. The jet, which is Russia's first attempt into the production of a commercial jet since the Soviet era, carries the hopes of the nation in rivalling aviation giants like Boeing and Airbus. The aircraft made its first flight from the Siberian city of Irkutsk, the base of the jet's manufacturer the Irkut Corporation. Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin took to Twitter to announce the maiden flight, writing "Our swallow learned to fly." Irkut said in a statement that the MS-21 successfully completed a 30-minute flight, flying at 300km an hour at an altitude of 1,000m. Russian president Vladimir Putin's press secretary told state media Tass that Rogozin informed Putin of the aircraft's successful flight over the phone. The jet's test flight was not announced to the media and comes on the heels of China testing its new passenger jet C919, indicating the growing competition in the aviation industry. According to the aircraft's manufacturers, the MS-21 can carry up to 211 passengers and travel for up to 6,000km. Irkut said that the twin-engine aircraft will come in two versions, one which can seat around 211 passengers and another which will hold up to 165 passengers. Putin reportedly reached out to Irkut's director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him on the "momentous occasion". Although the jet's manufacturer claimed that the aircraft was "superior to existing counterparts in terms of flight-technical characteristics and efficiency," Western aviation experts were surprised at the parameters of the test flight, in terms of the low altitude and the brief duration of the flight. Reuters cited an unspecified jet maker as deeming the MS-21 as a "genteel flight".

The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus.   Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly.   "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying.   Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity.   A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air.   Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.   President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event".   The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters.   Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes.   America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs.   Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.   With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions.   State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s.

The authorization for this week’s mission—designated Flight VA237 in Arianespace’s launcher family numbering system—followed today’s Launch Readiness Review, which confirmed the “go” status for Ariane 5, its two spacecraft passengers, the Spaceport infrastructure and the network of tracking stations. Flight VA237’s Ariane 5 is now ready for rollout from the Final Assembly Building, where ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B were integrated on the launcher, to the Spaceport’s ELA-3 launch zone. Liftoff will commence as soon as possible in a one-hour launch window that opens at 8:45 p.m. in French Guiana (between 23:45 and 00:45 Universal Time, during the night of June 1 to June 2). ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B will be deployed into geostationary transfer orbit on a mission lasting just under 42 minutes. Released first will be ViaSat-2, which is expected to bring considerable improvements in terms of speed, lower costs and extended broadband coverage within its footprint, which includes North and Central America, plus the Caribbean, northern South America, and the aeronautical and maritime routes in the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe. As a global broadband services and technology company, ViaSat operates from corporate headquarters in Carlsbad, California. ViaSat-2 was built by Boeing in El Segundo, California, using a 702HP platform, and will be positioned at 70 deg. West EUTELSAT 172B’s deployment by Ariane 5 will complete Arianespace’s Flight VA237. Operating at an orbital position of 172 deg. East for Asia-Pacific reach over land and sea from Alaska to Australia, the relay platform will deliver increased capacity for fast-growing applications that include in-flight and maritime connectivity, cellular backhaul, corporate networks, video distribution and government services. This satellite will join the fleet of Paris-based Eutelsat, a leading satellite operator in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Using the new all-electric Eurostar E3000 EOR (Electric Orbit Raising) platform assembled by Airbus in Toulouse, France, EUTELSAT 172B is the initial all-electric telecommunications satellite built in Europe – and the first of its type orbited by Ariane 5. Flight VA237 maintains Arianespace’s busy launch schedule in 2017, during which the company is targeting a total of 12 flights using its heavy-lift Ariane 5, medium-lift Soyuz and lightweight Vega vehicles. The five missions already performed this year have utilized two Ariane 5s, two Soyuz launchers and one Vega.   Topical Tags :  Agencies    Launch    Consumer Applications    Satellite Operator    SatBroadcasting      Regional Tags :  Asia/Asia Pacific    Europe    North America             FREE SUBSCRIPTION Today's Top News Success for Airbus Safran Launchers and Arianespace as They Celebrate Third Launch ViaSat Celebrates Successful Launch and Even the First Signals from ViaSat-2  Inmarsat Signs On Thales Alenia Space to Build Their Next GX Satellite HISPASAT Parts Ways with the Thales Alenia Space-Built Hispasat 1C Satellite SpaceX's Dragon Re-Play Is a Success ...

With British Airways still digging out of its weekend meltdown, Ryanair Holdings reported higher profit and announced plans to accelerate its European expansion. It's the latest sign that legacy carriers are groping for ways to compete beyond just offering customers less and less for higher fares. The looming danger for airlines like British Airways and Lufthansa is that no-frills carriers are putting increasing pressure on the main source of their profits; long-haul travel. Ryanair, which is also moving into main hubs from secondary airports, has signed deals to feed passengers to Air Europa, Norwegian Air Shuttle and even Aer Lingus, which has the same parent as British Airways. If Norwegian can show that its ambitious long-haul budget model can work, then the air will indeed become very thin for Europe's legacy carriers. "Events like what happened with BA at Heathrow and Gatwick can only be good for our business," Ryanair chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said in a Bloomberg TV interview. "We're certainly seeing a buildup yesterday and today into June, July, August, of people who are not willing to take the risk that they'll be stranded by BA at Heathrow." For now, British Airways has given frustrated passengers another reason to look elsewhere. Three days after a brief power surge knocked out its communications systems and froze the carrier's entire London operations, the U.K.'s flag carrier struggled to explain how a local computer outage could strand thousands of passengers. "We will make an in-depth investigation to make sure we will get to the bottom of exactly why this happened," chief executive officer Alex Cruz said in a YouTube video posted late Monday. "We will react. Absolutely this will not happen again at British Airways." That's too little, too late for the at least 75,000 affected passengers. With nearly 600 flights cancelled and luggage unable to be delivered, images and horror stories quickly coursed through social media. The Daily Mail ran a story of a young British woman "in tears" as the chaos forced her to put off her wedding in Greece. So while British Airways continues to look for answers, Ryanair is pushing ahead with plans to increase its fleet by 12 per cent by March 2018 and has sent the message to Boeing that it will take every additional 737 it can get. "Ryanair seems to be succeeding at squaring the circle," said Jonathan Wober, a London-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. As Ryanair expands into primary airports and adds more services, "that puts pressure on legacy airlines and incumbents." Those aggressive expansion plans contrast with what's happening at the likes of British Airways or labour strife-ridden Air France — not to mention insolvent Alitalia. The fundamental problem for traditional network carriers is that air travel isn't the elite luxury it used to be. It's become a mass-market commodity, laden with onerous restrictions. It hardly matters who operates the Boeing or Airbus planes as long as travelers get to their destinations and so they gravitate toward the cheapest fares. That's an ideal environment for the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet, which can pressure fares to gain market share. Europe's second-largest budget airline also plans to bulk up its fleet by upgrading an order for 30 Airbus narrow-body aircraft to the biggest A321 variant, which the Luton-based company will deploy head-to-head with the legacies on the busiest city routes. "Short-haul air travel in the U.S., in Europe is becoming commoditized," O'Leary said. "The lowest cost wins, and Ryanair is the lowest cost." Meanwhile, British Airways is struggling to clean up its mess. A spokesperson said passengers are being asked to pay to upgrade to first class on some long-haul flights when no economy seats are available. That's a ticket that could cost about 11,000 pounds. On Norwegian Air, a one-way transatlantic trip goes for as little as 99 pounds.

(Source: Bloomberg) A Raytheon Co. warhead “completely obliterated” a mock intercontinental ballistic missile in a test that shows the U.S.’s $36 billion ground-based defense system can defeat any long-range threat North Korea or Iran can develop through 2020, a top Pentagon official said. The test on Tuesday showed the system based in Alaska and California “helps us outpace the threat” while a new warhead to be deployed by 2019 “will be the next step to improving reliability and performance against the evolving threat,” Vice Admiral James Syring, director of the Missile Defense Agency, told reporters Wednesday on a conference call. Progress by North Korea’s ruler Kim Jong Un toward developing a nuclear missile that can hit the U.S. mainland has focused new attention on the array of missile interceptors. Success is a political boost for President Donald Trump, who has vowed that North Korea won’t be permitted to develop an ICBM. The Pentagon released dramatic video of the explosion as the interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California crashed into the mock ICBM fired from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. But a scientist critical of the missile defense program questioned whether the exercise staged in daylight against a target launched from a known location provided a “real-world” test of a system that has had as many failures as successes in the past. Realism Questioned “What I think it showed is that they’re on the right track in the fixes to this kill vehicle” but it didn’t prove a “realistic capability,” Laura Grego, senior scientist for the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an interview. “A real adversary would try to confuse you as much as possible” by launching at night, perhaps in the rain and with a barrage of decoys. Syring said decoys were used in the first test of the ground-based interceptor system since one that the Missile Defense Agency called a success in June 2014 -- after two that failed in 2010. “What we see in 2020 was very well-replicated” on Tuesday, Syring said. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up The element of surprise was missing. Military personnel who conducted the test from a U.S. Northern Command site in Colorado were aware the test was scheduled within a launch window of several hours, Syring said, although they weren’t tipped off when the dummy missile was launched. With a system that’s on constant watch, they were alerted to the launch per standard procedure by the early warning SBIRS satellite and cued by tracking radar on Wake Island in the Pacific and an X-band precision radar floating in the Pacific on a platform. Syring said his assertion that the U.S. is protected until 2020 is based on intelligence community projections of the current status of North Korea and Iranian missiles as well as how they are expected to evolve. “We design tests specifically to incorporate the attributes of that threat today and what the intelligence community predicts it will be in, say, three years,” he said. More Tests Needed The test’s success was an important step toward demonstrating that improved interceptors the agency is now installing in silos “are capable and can be relied upon to defend the U.S. homeland from a ballistic missile attack,” Cristina Chaplain, the missile defense director for the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, said in an email. But she cautioned that it was “one of several tests needed” to demonstrate that the system is capable of defending the U.S. and said further analysis “is also needed to ensure that no further changes are needed to the interceptors currently undergoing production.” The GAO said in a report issued earlier Tuesday that the ground-based system continued to make progress last year as the Pentagon expands a 30-interceptor force to 44 by year-end, a decision made in May 2013 to counter North Korea’s growing threat. There are 36 interceptors in silos today. The network of radar, communications and interceptors managed by Boeing Co. has demonstrated only a “limited capability to defend the U.S. homeland from small numbers of simple” intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Pentagon’s testing office said in January in its latest annual report. In addition to replicating for the first time the first time the speed, trajectory and closing velocity of an ICBM, Tuesday’s launch also tested avionics updates to the booster rocket built by Orbital ATK Inc. that carries an improved version of the conventional warhead made by Raytheon, Syring said.

Shaswati Das In December 2005, UPA with Praful Patel as civil aviation minister approved a purchase of 68 aircraft by Air India from Boeing. In 2006, it approved Indian Airlines’ purchase of 43 aircraft from Airbus. Photo: Mint New Delhi: A day after India’s Cental Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered three cases and one preliminary enquiry related to aircraft purchases and leasing—and the surrender of profit-making routes—by the country’s two state-owned airlines, Air India and Indian Airlines, the minister who was then in charge said all decisions were taken “collectively”. Some of the charges involve decisions that are at least a decade old. All were taken when the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power. CBI said on Monday it had also launched a preliminary enquiry into the merger of the two airlines, Air India, and Indian Airlines, creating an entity called National Aviation Co. of India Ltd (NACIL), which was subsequently renamed Air India. Air India declined comment on the probe into the alleged corruption and mismanagement that led to the airline suffering heavy losses, but Union minister of civil aviation Ashok Gajapathi Raju said in New Delhi on Tuesday that his ministry would “fully cooperate with CBI on this”. CBI said on Monday it is investigating “unknown officials of the ministry, Air India, NACIL, unknown private persons, and private companies”. In a copy of one of its first information reports, the agency says it is looking into allegations that the ministry “under Praful Patel, the then minister”, abused its position and conspired with other government officials and private domestic and foreign airlines. Patel said the agency does not name “any individual” and that “all decisions were multi-tiered and collective”. He added CBI “started a preliminary enquiry in 2013 during the UPA’s regime”. The allegations are not new. They are part of a plea filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, ruling on which, the Supreme Court, in January, asked CBI to probe the issues raised. And several government committees and departments have raised concern about the aircraft purchases and the merger in the past. This includes a report by government auditor Comptroller and Auditor General, and two parliamentary committees—one on transport and the other, public sector units. The aircraft purchases cost the two airlines around Rs70,000 crore and the other decisions, CBI said in its statement on Monday, caused Air India significant losses. The state-owned airline has debt of about Rs50,000 crore, of which about Rs25,000 crore are loans taken to buy aircraft. Patel said the aircraft purchase order had been cleared by an empowered group of ministers (eGoM) headed by P.Chidambaram and approved by Pranab Mukherjee, with the decisions being ratified by the cabinet. In December 2005, the UPA-1 cabinet, with Patel as civil aviation minister, approved a purchase of 68 aircraft by Air India from Boeing Co. A year later, it approved Indian Airlines’ purchase of 43 aircraft from Airbus Group SE. CBI is looking into these purchases and also into leasing deals entered by Air India. In 2011, a CAG report said the purchases “will involve substantial negative cash flows”. CAG’s report said although concerns on potential difficulties of funding the acquisition process had been raised, they had been ignored—a factor which CBI highlights in the FIR. “Unnecessary expansion was made without any proper study and without any transparency. Loans were taken from US and Indian banks to finance the same, causing the airlines to go into debt and suffer huge losses.” Shaswati Das Topics: Air India Indian Airlines merger case CBI Praful Patel More From Livemint READ MORE Donald Trump may not block James Comey testimony at key public hearing Foxconn says Apple, Amazon to join its bid for Toshiba chip business : report Markets likely to consolidate, RBI policy to keep traders busy First Published: Wed, May 31 2017. 02 31 AM IST Editor's Picks Currency ban: The politics vs the economics Are nationalized banks the walking dead of the Indian banking system? $120 million-plus brand value just numbers for me: Virat Kohli Latest News Donald Trump may not block James Comey testimony at key public hearing Foxconn says Apple, Amazon to join its bid for Toshiba chip business : report Markets likely to consolidate, RBI policy to keep traders busy 22 killed as bus catches fire after collision with truck in Bareilly Markets Live: Sensex, Nifty fall, Titan shares up 11% Mint On Sunday The best food of Delhi’s state bhawans When parents step in to run schools The defenders of the skies of Roland Garros Beneath the beauty, Mauritius is an archive of human struggle and triumph The elusiveness of silence Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

Political Editor For Dailymail.com Published: 16:47 EDT, 30 May 2017 | Updated: 17:29 EDT, 30 May 2017 e-mail 24 shares 65 View comments President Trump's first overseas trip was 'extraordinarily successful,' and his relations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel are 'fairly unbelievable,' White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Tuesday. Spicer held his first televised press briefing in more than two weeks, after a trip that got mixed reviews as the president met Saudi leaders without incident, visited holy sites in the Middle East and bonded with Israeli leaders, lectured European leaders on their defense spending, didn't personally affirm the nation's Article 5 commitments to defend NATO, and mostly avoided the simmering Russia controversy by failing to hold a press conference. 'This was an extraordinarily successful nine-day trip the president took,' Spicer said, providing his own review of the president's day-by-day accomplishments. White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke glowingly about President Trump's first overseas trip during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, May 30, 2017 Spicer was equally upbeat in his assessment of Trump's relations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, on a day when Trump tweeted Germany was 'very bad' by slacking on defense spending and holding a trade surplus with Washington.    'I think the relationship the president has had with Merkel, he would describe as fairly unbelievable,' Spicer said.  Merkel stoked concerns about a split in the transatlantic alliance when she said in a speech in Munich Monday that ''The times in which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent, over.' Spicer didn't hold back as he recapped an 'the incredible, historic trip,' which he attended along with Trump and several aides and family members – though Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner bailed out after Rome as reports came forward that he was a subject of inquiry of the FBI's Russia investigation.

Share this article Share 24 shares 'I think the relationship the president has had with Merkel, he would describe as fairly unbelievable,' Spicer said President Donald Trump took another swipe at longtime U.S. ally Germany , firing off a tweet that chided the nation for its trade surplus with the U.S. and for shirking its defense responsibilities 'It truly was an extraordinary week for America and our people,' Spicer said.  Nor did he leave it to the pundits or historians to issue pronouncements about the president's first trip abroad. 'We've never seen before at this point in a presidency such sweeping reassurance of American interest and the inauguration of a foreign policy strategy designed to bring back the world from growing dangers perpetual disasters brought on by years of failed leadership,' Spicer said. He called Trump's speech on extremism 'a historic turning point that people will be talking about for many years to come.'  Trump got mixed reviews in Europe after he chided NATO leaders for insufficient defense spending. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Germany¿s Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump and European Council President Donald Tusk attend the G7 summit in Taormina, Sicily, Italy, May 26, 2017 His rebuke Tuesday morning came after summit meetings last week that exposed splits between Trump and European leaders. 'The president's historic speech was met with nearly universal praise,' he said, allowing some others to do the praising. Spicer quoted Egyptian President Al-Sisi, who flattered Trump during their meeting by saying, 'Let me say that you have a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible.'  'I agree!' Trump quipped at the time, with a smile. Spicer also talked up 'historic economic development deals,' and name-checked major U.S. companies that were involved, including Locked-Maritn, Raytheon, Boeing, GE, DOW Chemical, Honeywell, Emerson, Alcoa, and CISCO. Spicer went on to review another of Trump's speeches, delivered at the Israel Museum. He called it 'highly praised' and a 'moving address.' Trump warned that Germany's trade and defense policies were 'very bad' for the U.S., stoking a growing feud with Merkel, who on Monday said her European allies could not longer 'completely depend' on others Merkel lifts a glass of beer during an election campaign event in Munich on Sunday. 'The times in which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent, over,' she said at the event In Europe, Trump 'boldly stood up for American taxpayers and our common defense by calling on other NATO countries to pay their fair share.' The speech wasn't as well received in Europe, where NATO leaders appeared uncomfortable while Trump told them to pony up and spend more on defense, while paying more for past years when defense spending fell short of a 2 per cent pledge.  It didn't take long for the Democratic National Committee to crank out a release mocking Spicer's claims. 'Sean Spicer may have tried to filibuster criticism of President Trump's foreign trip during today's White House briefing, but calling this trip 'extraordinarily successful and historic' would be best described as an alternate fact,' the DNC said in a statement. They included clips of more negative reviews, including a State Department official who told the Daily Beast ''When it comes to diplomacy, President Trump is a drunk tourist,' and a quote from Merkel expressing displeasure that the U.S. wouldn't agree to a joint G7 statement on climate change. Merkel called it 'very unsatisfactory' and said, 'We have a situation of six against one'. French President Emmanuel Macron said his prolonged televised handshake with Trump during the trip was a deliberate effort at one-upsmanship.   'One must show that you won't make small concessions, even symbolic ones, but also not over-publicize things, either,' he told Journal de Dimanche. 'My handshake with him — it wasn't innocent,' he added.

British Airways recent meltdown is estimated to cost the company tens of millions.  (Luke MacGregor / Bloomberg file photo)   By Richard Weiss Benjamin KatzBloomberg Tues., May 30, 2017 The airline industry battle between full-service carriers and discounters looks like an increasingly unfair fight. With British Airways still digging out of its weekend meltdown, Ryanair reported higher profit and announced plans to accelerate its European expansion. It’s the latest sign that legacy carriers are groping for ways to compete beyond just offering customers less and less for higher fares. The looming danger for airlines like British Airways and Lufthansa is that no-frills carriers are putting increasing pressure on the main source of their profits: long-haul travel. Ryanair, which is also moving into main hubs from secondary airports, has signed deals to feed passengers to Air Europa, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA and even Aer Lingus, which has the same parent as British Airways. If Norwegian can show that its ambitious long-haul budget model can work, then the air will indeed become very thin for European’s legacy carriers. Read more: British Airways cancels flights amid global computer outage Article Continued Below British Airways IT debacle puts spotlight on technology systems British Airways says most flights running but angry passengers face delays “Ryanair seems to be succeeding at squaring the circle,” said Jonathan Wober, an analyst in London at CAPA Centre for Aviation. As Ryanair expands into primary airports and adds more customer-friendly services, “that puts pressure on legacy airlines and incumbents.” For now, British Airways has given frustrated passengers another reason to look elsewhere. Three days after a brief power surge knocked out its communications systems and froze the carrier’s entire London operations, the U.K.’s flag carrier struggled to explain how a local computer outage could strand thousands of passengers. “We will make an in-depth investigation to make sure we will get to the bottom of exactly why this happened,” chief executive officer Alex Cruz said in a YouTube video posted late Monday. “We will react. Absolutely this will not happen again at British Airways.” That’s too little, too late for the at least 75,000 affected passengers. With nearly 600 flights cancelled and luggage unable to be delivered, images and horror stories quickly coursed through social media. The Daily Mail ran a story of a young British woman “in tears” as the chaos forced her to put off her wedding in Greece. Capitalizing on BA’s troubles, Ryanair said it had seen “strong bookings” over the weekend. Its Twitter account rubbed salt into the wound with tweets that poked fun and added the hashtag “ShouldHaveFlownRyanair.” The company’s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, admitted on the BBC “we had a bit of fun on social media.” Ryanair posted a 6-per-cent increase in annual profits Tuesday to 1.3 billion euros ($1.95 billion Canadian) despite “difficult trading conditions,” caused by terror attacks in European cities and a sharp decline in the British pound. BA, meanwhile, is counting up the cost of its debacle that some have estimated could run into the tens of millions. Cutting costs — and corners? As British Airways resumed full service Tuesday, shares in its parent company, International Airlines Group, dropped 3 per cent as investors appeared to worry that the company’s quality of service may have been undermined by recent efforts to save money. “Although cost cutting has been good for the share price in the last year, it will come back to bite IAG if it stops them from doing what they are supposed to do: Fly passengers to their destinations,” said Kathleen Brooks, the research director at City Index. IAG has been battling tough competition, even as it has faced pressure on its earnings from a weaker pound following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. The company issued a profit warning following the Brexit vote nearly a year ago. Cost pressures aggravated an already complicated situation. Renewing IT systems is complex, time-consuming and expensive — a factor that prompts many companies to put it off as long as possible, said Loizos Heracleous, a professor of strategy at Warwick Business School. The problem with IT systems is recurring across the industry, particularly among established airlines. In August, Delta Air Lines cancelled hundreds of flights when a power outage likewise knocked out its computer systems worldwide. Airlines face challenges with their IT systems also due to linkages across their systems. There’s further demand on the system when companies consolidate — as has been the case among airlines — since “IT issues get heightened and any vulnerabilities are exposed.” Such troubles give an advantage to newer airlines such as Ryanair. “The ability to set up an airline from scratch bypasses a lot of the legacy issues, because you can go for state-of-the-art systems,” Heracleous said. “Newer airlines can also invest in IT systems that are more easily upgradeable and scalable. An airline such as Ryanair, that is also financially successful, has more leeway to divert needed resources toward upgrading its IT systems.” Need for Planes While British Airways continues to look for answers, Ryanair is pushing ahead with plans to increase its fleet by 12 per cent by March 2018 and has sent the message to Boeing Co. that it will take every additional 737 it can get. “There’s a huge amount of opportunities out there across Europe as we grow and one of the limiting factors continues to be deliveries of the aircraft,” chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said in a phone interview. That’s a stark contrast to the likes of British Airways or labour strife-ridden Air France — not to mention insolvent Alitalia. The fundamental problem for legacy network carriers is that air travel isn’t the elite luxury it used to be. It’s become a mass-market commodity, laden with onerous restrictions. It hardly matters who operates the Boeing or Airbus planes as long as travellers get to their destinations and so they gravitate toward the cheapest fares.  That means the airlines with the lowest costs win, and right now that’s the likes of Ryanair and easyJet on European short-haul routes. easyJet also plans to bulk up its fleet by upgrading an order for 30 Airbus SE narrow-body aircraft to the biggest A321 variant, which the Luton-based airline will deploy head-to-head with the legacies on the busiest city routes. Especially for Ryanair, which continues to squeeze operating costs, a fare war is the quickest route to snatching up market share. With Alitalia’s collapse and financial troubles at LOT Polish Airlines and Portugal’s TAP, the status quo of low fuel and lower fares is ideal for the Irish airline. Meanwhile, British Airways is struggling to clean up its mess. A spokesman said passengers are being asked to pay to upgrade to first class on some long-haul flights when no economy seats are available.
