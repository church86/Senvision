Credit: NASA NASA is sure enough that Boeing and SpaceX can safely launch astronauts to the International Space Station by early 2019 to hold off paying Russia to keep flying U.S. crews to the research complex, and one official says a deadline to order parts for new Russian Soyuz crew capsules may have already passed. Boeing and SpaceX are working on new commercial capsules designed to transport at least four astronauts to and from the orbiting outpost, but their schedules appear to be slipping, this time due to technical woes, not the lack of funding that caused previous delays in the program. Until the U.S.-built spaceships are certified by NASA, all space station crews will launch and land aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft. NASA last year signed a $490 million agreement with the Russian government for six round-trip seats on Soyuz missions, with launches in 2018 and landings extending into early 2019. The space agency is sending nearly $82 million to Russia for each ticket. Even as the commercial crew schedules move later into 2018, NASA officials say they are not considering extending the contract with Roscosmos — the Russian space agency — for more launches in 2019. The last Soyuz launch seats reserved for U.S. astronauts are at the end of 2018. It takes more than two years to procure components and assemble new Soyuz capsules, so Russia needed to receive new Soyuz orders from NASA by some time this fall to ensure the spacecraft would be ready for liftoff in early 2019. Four Soyuz spacecraft currently launch each year, and without NASA’s reliance on the Russian ferry craft, that production and launch rate will be cut in half. NASA has recently signed new contracts for Soyuz seats by May of each year. The last contract extension with Roscosmos was announced in August 2015, just in time for Russian engineers to start work on the spaceships for launches in 2018. While NASA and Roscosmos have not publicly identified a deadline for a fresh Soyuz agreement, the U.S. space agency’s top human spaceflight official recently told Spaceflight Now the date may have already passed. “We may have actually crossed the deadline, so we’re not really looking at that,” said Bill Gerstenmaier, head of NASA’s human exploration and operations directorate. “There is still sufficient overlap, and we could still do things during the overlap period.” Asked if he is comfortable not buying more Soyuz seats, Gerstenmaier replied: “I don’t have much choice.” File photo of Bill Gesternmaier, NASA’s head of human exploration and operations. Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky “A Soyuz is a complicated vehicle, and a complicated vehicle doesn’t come into existence in a matter of days,” said Kirk Shireman, NASA’s space station program manager, in an interview last month, before Gerstenmaier’s comments. “It takes over two years to build a Soyuz, so yes, at some point in time, building a new Soyuz vehicle is not an option. We’re working with our Russian counterparts on exactly when that is. We have not crossed that date yet, but I believe the date is in sight. “It will be this calendar year when we will cross the point where we won’t be able to build a Soyuz in time for when our last seats that we’ve already procured expire,” Shireman said. Any decision to send more money to the Russian government — a new Soyuz contract for a year’s worth of seats is likely to cost more than $500 million — would be politically unpopular in the United States after the Obama administration pushed Congress and secured full funding for the commercial crew program last year, an appropriation NASA said would reduce chances of further delays. Holding off on more Soyuz seat purchases is also likely to put more pressure on Boeing and SpaceX. Commercial crew missions were originally scheduled to begin in 2015, but lawmakers in Congress for several years did not approve the funding NASA said the program needed. The CST-100 Starliner spaceship developed by Boeing will be ready for its first crewed test flight, with a Boeing test pilot and NASA astronaut on-board, in August 2018, the company confirmed this week. That is six months later than Boeing’s previous target date for the piloted mission announced in May. Assuming the test flight goes well, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner could be certified for its first operational crew rotation mission to the space station in December 2018, Boeing officials said in a report first published by Aviation Week. SpaceX claims its Crew Dragon spacecraft could fly with test pilots by the end of 2017, but the company is working through its second failure investigation in a year after a Falcon 9 rocket — the same type of booster that will launch crews — exploded on the launch pad in Florida last month. A prototype of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule completed a pad abort test at Cape Canaveral in May 2015. Credit: SpaceX While SpaceX has not announced any delays on the Crew Dragon program, the final impacts of last month’s explosion on the company’s manifest remain to be seen. SpaceX officials admit the schedule leading up to a trio of key milestones next year — an orbital mission without astronauts, an in-flight checkout of the Crew Dragon’s abort system, and a crewed demo mission to the space station — is optimistic, requiring near perfect execution and assuming engineers find no problems on the multitude of ground and flight tests planned over the next 12 months. If SpaceX can keep that schedule, the first operational Crew Dragon rotation flight is expected in early 2018. “We have a lot of work to do to get there, but that’s the schedule we’re working to,” said Garrett Reisman, SpaceX’s director of crew operations and a former astronaut. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden told reporters last month that the agency own internal schedule projects the first SpaceX and Boeing crewed test flights, each with two astronauts, in 2018. “We’re relatively confident that we’re going to make that,” Bolden said in a press conference at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. “This is a development program, and everyone needs to keep that in mind. With that said, we are not presently looking at any additional (Soyuz) seats beyond those that we have already purchased.” A report by NASA’s Office of Inspector General released last month echoed the worries of some NASA managers that neither commercial crew program will be certified for regular flights until late 2018. The latest slip in Boeing’s schedule stems from challenges moving from development into production of the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, which the company says have stabilized, minor component qualification test issues, and the scrapping of a spacecraft dome structure damaged during construction. “Based on those challenges, we stopped and took a hard look at our schedule moving forward and made the adjustment,” said Kelly Kaplan, a Boeing spokesperson. “As we learn these hard lessons, we’ll continue to incorporate them throughout the build and test campaigns. And we will remain focused on our first and most important priority — providing astronauts with safe crew transportation to and from the ISS.” Boeing’s first crewed test flight to the space station has moved six months from February to August 2018, Kaplan said, with the first two crew rotation flights in December 2018 and January 2019 — delayed from June 2018 and August 2018, respectively. A CST-100 pad abort test has been delayed from October 2017 to January 2018, and the capsule’s first unpiloted test flight has slid from December 2017 to June 2018, Kaplan said. Including a ground unit not intended to fly, four CST-100 Starliner vehicles are in various stages of construction and assembly. Each flight-worthy crew module is designed for 10 missions. Boeing is preparing to ship the first flight-like CST-100 crew module, a structural test article, from the company’s spaceship factory at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida to a test facility in Huntington Beach, California, in the coming weeks. Engineers there will put the crew module and a service module through a series of structural loads tests to ensure the design is up to the perils of spaceflight. A full-up drop test of a CST-100 mass simulator is also on tap from an altitude of 40,000 feet in the coming months to verify the capsule’s parachute deployment sequence works as expected. That test comes after a series of water and land landing tests that are nearing completion to measure the spacecraft’s response to the touchdown. CST-100 missions will end under parachutes with airbag-cushioned landings in the Western United States, with the initial test flights likely to touch down in New Mexico or Utah.

Credit: United Launch Alliance Boeing officials believe they have resolved a potential aerodynamic issue discovered during wind tunnel tests. Data indicated the capsule’s shape on top of its rocket — the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 booster — could make the launcher’s Centaur upper stage susceptible to higher-than-acceptable aerodynamic loads as the vehicle accelerates through the speed of sound. The spaceship will launch exposed, without the nose fairing typically flown on the Atlas 5 rocket. Engineers plan to add an aft skirt extending downward from the base of the CST-100 service module to resolve the problem. ULA released an updated artist’s rendering Thursday of the Atlas 5 rocket and CST-100 Starliner capsule in launch configuration. “Through incredible coordination and continued innovative thinking, the collective team of NASA, Boeing and United Launch Alliance completed three wind tunnel tests in six months to investigate the aerodynamic stability of various configurations and to anchor our analytical predictions,” said Gary Wentz, ULA’s vice president of human and commercial services. “Based on that information, we updated the configuration for the Atlas 5 Starliner integrated vehicle stack. This configuration is unique because it combines the Atlas 5 launch vehicle without a payload fairing with Boeing’s Starliner capsule, resulting in different aerodynamic interactions.” The metallic orthogrid aeroskirt will jettison from the rocket after it is no longer needed, and the structure will have “venting provisions” to prevent over-pressurization and allow the the CST-100’s pusher abort engines to safely ignite in the event of a launch mishap, according to ULA. Fabrication of the aeroskirt is due to begin this month at ULA’s factory in Decatur, Alabama, the company said. “Our testing indicates the solution we chose will sufficiently smooth the air flow around the vehicle during ascent, ensuring crew safety and mission success,” said John Mulholland, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s commercial crew program. Speaking at last month’s International Astronautical Congress in Mexico, SpaceX’s Reisman said the Crew Dragon recently passed its final design milestone. “That’s all behind us,” Reisman said. “We’re moving on with production, test and certification. That’s where all the focus is right now.” Reisman said the Crew Dragon has completed its primary structure qualification tests, and much of SpaceX’s attention on the commercial crew program is now centered on parachute testing — the human-rated version of Dragon will have four chutes, not the three currently flying on the cargo configuration — and validation of the performance of the spaceship’s life support system. One of the final tests of SpaceX’s spacesuit, which the company has kept secret, is scheduled around the end of this year, when the manager of the spacesuit design team will don the gear for a test inside a vacuum chamber, Reisman said last month. He said the spacesuit incorporates lessons learned from the bright orange launch and entry suits flown on the space shuttle, and is primarily composed of soft goods except for the helmet. “We’ve learned our lessons from the Columbia accident investigation report, and one of the things that was really featured in that report was the the deleterious effect of body-worn mass,” Reisman said. “One of the things we were very careful to try to eliminate as much as possible is that body-worn mass, so it’s mostly all soft goods with the exception of the helmet, and it’s got a bunch of other advances that make it really usable from an operational perspective.” He said SpaceX plans to release imagery of the spacesuit design soon. Around 80 percent of the Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spaceships that will fly with astronauts is designed and built in-house at SpaceX, Reisman said, with the exception of a few items like the parachutes, which come from an outside vendor.

Credit: SpaceX Reisman said SpaceX still intends for crews to board the Dragon capsule on the launch pad before fueling of the Falcon 9 rocket, a decision that concerned senior NASA officials even before last month’s explosion on the launch pad. “The baseline for crew ingress is for the crew to be ingressed and for the strap-in crew to be completely out of the blast danger area before we fuel the rocket,” Reisman said. “However, during that entire time, the launch abort system is armed and ready should anything untoward occur.” SpaceX plans to introduce the Crew Dragon’s propulsive landing capability, using the capsule’s SuperDraco abort engines to softly touch down without the need for parachutes, before the end of the decade. The first few Crew Dragon missions will splash down in the ocean, and Reisman said SpaceX expects to test the rocket-assisted landing scheme on a real space mission on the first automated logistics flight of the company’s next-generation Dragon cargo capsule. That flight, part of a follow-on cargo contract awarded by NASA in January, is scheduled in 2019. When Boeing and SpaceX begin flying astronauts, NASA will expand its crew complement on the space station from three to four people, a number that will include some representatives from Japan, Europe and Canada. That will give astronauts more time for scientific research. Russia is cutting the number of cosmonauts needed to maintain its segment of the space station from three to two next year, but Roscosmos aims to return to current staffing levels as soon as 2018, once a new Russian laboratory module arrives at the complex. Starting in 2019, when residents fly to the space station on Boeing, SpaceX and Russian vehicles, NASA and Roscosmos have agreed to launch mixed crews, where a Russian cosmonaut will always be part of a four-person crew on a CST-100 or Crew Dragon, and a U.S. astronaut will be one of the three fliers on each Soyuz. The in-kind agreement does not involve any exchange of funds, but it ensures there will always be at least one U.S. astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut on the space station in case an illness necessitates the homecoming of part of the research lab’s crew in a Crew Dragon, CST-100 or Soyuz capsule. “There are a number of things that could go wrong that would cause us, for instance, not to have a Soyuz vehicle up there,” Shireman said. “They could have a launch abort, or a problem in the factory, or the most likely scenario, according to our probabilistic risk assessment, is a cosmonaut or astronaut gets sick. If they get sick, everybody in that vehicle has to come home. If that was to occur, we wouldn’t want the Russian segment to be without a Russian segment expert, nor would we want the U.S. segment to be without a U.S. segment expert.” Email the author.

Taiwan has a growing economy and market penetration for no-frills airlines is relatively low compared with other countries in Northeast Asia, which suggests there is room for growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Acknowledging the recent difficulties faced by V Air (威航) and Tigerair Taiwan (台灣虎航), Tinseth said he remains confident that the emergence of LCC business — both regionally and in Taiwan — is unlikely to slow. V Air suspended operations on Oct. 1, while Tigerair Taiwan is also in bad shape. “For every market, there will be winners and losers,” Tinseth said at a news conference, adding that with a good business plan, capital and corporate culture, the LCC model remains lucrative. “I think the challenge here in Taiwan is there is a greater desire for people to come visit Taiwan than necessarily to leave on the low-cost model.” It explains why the more successful LCCs operating in Taiwan are foreign-based, he said, adding that Taiwanese LCCs should improve their services for local passengers to develop a more balanced consumer base. Boeing said that passenger air traffic in Northeast Asia will grow at an annual rate of 2.6 percent over the next 20 years, backed by LCCs. Taiwan could see even greater growth with a stronger economy, although it might pick up rather slowly in the LCC market, Tinseth said. “We have seen a surge in the number of flights being added within the region due to the emergence of LCCs over the past five years,” he said. According to Boeing, the market share of Northeast Asia LCCs has grown from 31 percent in 2011 to 47 percent this year. The trend is exciting news for the aviation industry, because budget airlines help stimulate flight demand in general, Tinseth said. Mature fleets in Northeast Asia will drive replacement demand, contributing two-thirds of the region’s aircraft deliveries, he added. Boeing also forecasts that airlines in Northeast Asia will require 1,440 new commercial airplanes valued at over US$320 billion between now and 2035. More than half of these airplanes, or approximately 770 aircraft, will be for widebody airplanes such as the new 787 and 777 airplanes, while 600 units will be for narrow-body airplanes, such as the new 737 MAX, Tinseth said. "Widebody airplanes will continue to play an important role in Taiwan's commercial air travel market and that trend will continue as EVA Air introduces new 787s in the coming years," he said This story has been viewed 1144 times.

Seen here is an artist's rendering of the airplane. Pic: Courtesy of BoeingKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 13 (Bernama) -- Boeing and China Southern Airlines on Wednesday Oct 12, 2016 finalized an order of 12 787-9 Dreamliners, valued at US$3.2 billion at current list prices. The new order strengthens China Southern's expanding long-haul fleet. "The 787 Dreamliners have helped us to achieve initial success in implementing our internationalization strategy in the past few years and enabled us to make our operation and services more appealing to passengers," said Tan Wangeng, CEO, China Southern Airlines in a statement from Guangzhou, China. "The additional new 787-9s will further increase our capacity and services for our long-haul routes." China Southern Airlines, China's launch customer of the 787, currently operates 10 787-8s. The airplanes have enabled the Guangzhou-based carrier to launch six new non-stop global routes, connecting Guangzhou to London and Rome in Europe, Vancouver in North America, as well as Perth, Auckland and Christchurch in the Oceania area. "China Southern has been a long-standing Boeing customer and we truly appreciate their confidence in the 787," said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president, Northeast Asia Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "The 787-9 will help the airline achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability." The 787-9 complements and extends the super-efficient 787 family. With the fuselage stretched by 6 meters (20 feet) over the 787-8, the 787-9 will fly more passengers and more cargo farther with the same exceptional environmental performance. Like the 787-8, the 787-9 brings the economics of large jets to the middle of the market, with 20 percent less fuel use and 20 percent fewer emissions than similarly sized airplanes. The 787-9 leverages the visionary design of the 787-8, offering passenger-pleasing features such as large windows, large stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity, a lower cabin altitude, cleaner air and a smoother ride. China's largest airline by fleet size, China Southern Airlines currently operates 700 aircraft, including Boeing 787, 777, 747, 757 and 737s. By 2020, the airline expects to have a fleet of 1,000 aircraft with passenger traffic surpassing 160 million annually. --BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Earthquake: Stay Vigilant, Najib Advises Malaysians In New Zealand BNM Tightens NDF Trading Rules Country's Future Cannot Depend On Hypocritical Political Pact - Najib Other News Headlines PPBM-Pakatan Harapan Collaboration Will Not Work - Ismail Sabri- politic Labuan To Agressively Promote Itself As An Attractive Tourism Destination- business Annuar Musa Stays Put With Decision To Resign From Kafa- sports The Best And Freshest Produce At Maha 2016- features 25 More Attackers Killed In Continued Clashes In Western Myanmar State- world Most Read News Communications Minister Attends Opening Of ITU Telecom World 2016 Earthquake: Stay Vigilant, Najib Advises Malaysians In New Zealand Agong, Permaisuri Attend Wedding Reception Of MSU President's Daughter Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

The order by Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliners. The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing’s 787 order tally for the year. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from banks, the Guangzhou, China-based airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group in the past year. China Southern, the country’s first Boeing 787 customer, already flies 16 Dreamliners on operating and financial lease, according to data the airline released in August. The carrier had a total fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world’s largest aviation market.

The order by Asia's biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliner The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing's 787 order tally for the year. The China Southern order also comes a day after Wichita-based Spirit AeroSystems celebrated delivery of its 500th 787 shipset, including the airplane’s forward fuselage that is sent to Boeing with a fully working cockpit. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from commercial banks, the airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group in the past year as more people fly in the world's most populous nation. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an order for 300 jets valued at $38 billion on a state visit to the U.S. as Chinese carriers expand their fleet in a nation set to become the biggest travel market in two decades. China Southern, the country's first Boeing 787 customer, already flies 16 Dreamliners, according to data the airline released in August. The carrier had a fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world's largest aviation market. Boeing had netted 19 orders for the Dreamliner this year prior to Qatar's announcement, bringing sales for the plane to 1,161. “We’re very proud to be on this program. We’re proud to be Boeing’s partner. We’re proud to be part of the 787 team,” Spirit CEO Tom Gentile said at Spirit’s 500th delivery ceremony Tuesday in Wichita. In addition to the forward fuselage, Spirit makes the 787’s engine pylons, and its fixed and moveable wing leading edges. Airbus’ 787 competitor, the A350, netted 25 sales through the end of September. Both planemakers have contended with slowing demand for widebody aircraft as moderating fuel prices and a glut of used Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 models tempers demand.

Defense One reported that the late September decision to sell $7 billion worth of F-15 fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait, which had been delayed for over two years by Israeli fears that the weapons would be turned against Jerusalem, was finally allowed to pave the way for a purchase by Qatar Airways of the Boeing jetliners. © AFP 2016/ JIM BOURG / POOL Hillary Clinton's Leaked Emails Show US Aware of Qatar, Saudi Arabia Supporting Daesh The fighter jet sale was widely reported as approved September 28, and the Qatar Airways deal, announced October 7, followed it by just over a week. When asked during a Washington DC news conference the day the purchase was announced whether the sales were connected, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said, “We don’t relate anything to anything. Qatar Airways has an independent policy of ordering airplanes. So nothing is attached to anything.” Qatar had requested 36 F-15 fighter jets, a roughly $4 billion sale, with an option to buy up to an additional 36. The Kuwait sale of 28 Boeing F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets, with an option for up to 40 total, is valued at about $3 billion, Flight Global reports. The airliner deal, for the purchase of 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-ER passenger jets, both long-haul aircraft, is valued at $11.7 billion, according to Boeing. An additional letter of intent to purchase 60 737 MAX 8 aircraft, would add another $6.9 billion to the total. US Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken, former deputy national security adviser to US President Barack Obama, was present at the DC news conference.   © AFP 2016/ FADI AL-HALABI Gulf Arming Syrian Rebels: 'Weapons Will Come From Qatar, Saudi Arabia & UAE' Defense One reported that the Qatar deal had been put on hold while the US negotiated a 10-year, $38 billion security package with Israel for 2018-2028. Defense News reported in February that Israel opposed the Qatar sale, unless the new aid deal included a few billion dollars more to allow Israel to upgrade its own fleet. The new Washington deal for Jerusalem – $3.8 billion a year for 10 years – is a record for defense aid to a country. Defense News reported that Israel was hoping for a deal closer to $50 billion over the same time frame. The sale comes just in time to save Boeing’s 40-year-old F-15 production line, which, it has been reported since 2014, was running out of the orders it needed to keep production going. Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said at the October 7 press conference that the deal would affect more than 100,000 jobs across the US.   US, Israeli, and other officials have accused Qatar of supporting anti-Israel and terrorist groups.  ...

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US Election World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Society Defence Will Indian Air Force opt for Boeing KC-46 Pegasus for its six tanker requirements? Boeing briefed Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar about KC-46 Pegasus' capabilities during his visit to the US in August. Aditya Bhat   October 12, 2016 22:49 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares Boeing's KC-46 refueling US Air Force's C-17 aircraft.Boeing Boeing has offered military aerial refueling and strategic military transport aircraft, KC-46 Pegasus, amidst growing uncertainty over India's tender for six multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft. The Narendra Modi government had withdrawn a tender for the MRTT aircraft in July. Earlier, another tender won by Airbus for A330 MRTT was also scrapped. Nevertheless, Boeing's representatives were in New Delhi to brief IAF on the aircraft, IAF sources told StratPost. Why advertise with us?

He had visited Boeing's Philadelphia facility. The KC-46 is developed from Boeing 767 commercial jet airliner. The aircraft has multi-role capability, which means it also has the ability to carry passengers, cargo and patients along with its tanker role. US Air Force had awarded its tanker contract to Boeing KC-46 in 2011, in which it is expected to make 179 aircraft units by 2027. Boeing had not participated in both the IAF tenders for MRTT aircraft, but had said that it was willing to offer it to India if selected for the US tanker program. There is no clarity if India would go in for government-to-government contract for the MRTT or if it would reissue the tender. KC-46 has a fuel capacity of 96,265kg and maximum air speed of 650mph. It features two Pratt & Whitney PW 4062 with 289.13 kN thrust. The aircraft features wing air refuelling pods, advanced fly-by-wire refuelling boom, defensive systems like infrared countermeasures, radio frequency warning and night vision lighting, among others.

Boeing has delayed the first manned flight of its new space taxi for the second time this year and could take a financial charge against the program as early as its third-quarter results. The company has pushed back the first crewed flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule by another six months to mid-2018 because of supplier and technical issues and said there were cost implications to the move. A Boeing spokesman declined to quantify the potential amount. “We are assessing the financial impacts of the schedule change as part of the quarterly earnings process,” he said. The potential charge would upset analysts’ expectations for Boeing to have a “clean” third-quarter earnings report on October 26. The company has taken a succession of charges against its military tanker program and the 747-8 jumbo jet because of design problems and slow sales, respectively. Boeing and Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies are vying to be the first to resume crewed flights with US spacecraft since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. The Starliner was originally due to fly with crew by the end of next year, but Boeing defence and space chief Leanne Caret revealed at its investor day in May that this would slip into 2018, with the company later flagging February as the likely first date. Boeing said technical issues, some of which emerged just last month, would push back the first unmanned flight to June 2018, with a crewed flight following in August. Earlier, Boeing officials signalled that engineering challenges could upset flight schedules.

Because ‘six seconds is more than enough’ Update: DDoS attack on Dyn DNS leaves internet crippled Trends / Space Technology / We can beat SpaceX to Mars – Boeing By Hadlee Simons on 10 October, 2016 HadleeSimons Share SpaceX has made a few big Mars-related announcements, but at least one firm believes it can beat Elon Musk’s company to the Red Planet. Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of Boeing, told a conference (h/t: ScienceAlert) that he believes the first humans on Mars will get there using Boeing’s spaceships. “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg was quoted as saying. Boeing thinks it can beat SpaceX to the Mars punch It wouldn’t be the first time that the aerospace colossus got involved in space matters either, building key parts for the Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the moon. Boeing is also working on the Space Launch System and CST-100 manned space capsule, both of which are slated for Martian and deep space missions. The SLS is scheduled to undergo its first test flight in 2018. Boeing will have stiff competition from SpaceX though, as the private firm recently revealed its radical Interplanetary Transport System. This was in addition to its manned Dragon V2 space capsule. The SpaceX system is extremely ambitious compared to Boeing’s seemingly brute-force approach. The private firm will make heavy use of reusable designs, as well as in-orbit refuelling. Additionally, SpaceX expects astronauts to create their own fuel from Martian resources for the return journey.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Boeing properly accounted for the costs and expected sales of the 787 Dreamliner and the 747 jumbo aircraft, sources say. (Bloomberg photo by Brendon O'Hagan) Boeing landed a deal to sell a dozen 787 Dreamliners to China Southern Airlines, bolstering support for its marquee carbon-fiber jetliner in an otherwise tough market for twin-aisle aircraft. The order by Asia's biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliners. The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing's 787 order tally for the year. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from commercial banks, the Guangzhou, China-based airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group in the past year as more people fly in the world's most populous nation. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an order for 300 jets valued at $38 billion on a state visit to the U.S. as Chinese carriers expand their fleet in a nation set to become the biggest travel market in two decades.

The carrier had a total fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world's largest aviation market. Boeing had netted 19 orders for the Dreamliner this year prior to Qatar's announcement, bringing total sales for the plane to 1,161. Airbus netted 25 sales of the A350, its most advanced jetliner, through the end of September. Both planemakers have contended with slowing demand for widebody aircraft as moderating fuel prices and a glut of used Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 models tempers demand.

NASA is building space habitats in partnership with various private companies to accomplish this. This space habitat by Ixion wants to repurpose a propellant tank into a habitat for humans. Image: Ixion. The article comes two weeks after Elon Musk outlined his plans for making human life interplanetary. Musk had said during his presentation, that his ambitious plans that did not just stop at Mars, was an effort to get more people talking about establishing permanent human settlements on other planets and moons. People are talking about it. A week after Musk outlined his plans, the chief executive officer of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg revealed his intentions to carry out the first manned mission to Mars. The mission is planned not for research or establishing colonies, but as tourists, as reported by Yahoo. Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Image: Reuters NASA plans to have a manned mission to Mars by 2030. The SpaceX Dragon II is planned to go on a pathfinding mission to Mars to scout out for suitable locations for humans in 2018 and 2020. The cheapest and fastest way to get to Mars is to send spacecraft when Mars and Earth are in particular positions called launch windows. There are launch windows roughly every two years, which could mean that there could be a lot of traffic between Earth and Mars every two years during the launch windows if all the current plans of NASA, SpaceX and Boeing are carried out. The Dragon II will find out on ground conditions. Image: NASA The technical developments to support these missions have moved beyond just spacecraft and rockets. The pioneers on Mars will have to be supported with food, shelter, fuel and waste disposal. NASA plans to provide this support using the resources available locally on Mars. The missions on Mars will have to use a technique called in-situ resource utilization or ISRU. A small propellant plant is planned to be on the first SpaceX colonial ship to Mars. The plant is expected to be expanded over time, over the course of subsequent missions. The idea is to mine the water and carbon dioxide that is abundantly available on Mars, to make cryogenic methane based fuel with superior technical characteristics. NASA also has plans for using locally available resources, and it goes beyond just fuel. The plans for the SpaceX Mars fuel plant. Image: SpaceX The ISRU research is mostly being conducted at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, directed by the former space shuttle astronaut Robert D Cabana. “It was an incredible accomplishment when we went to the moon. We stayed for a couple of days and took some rocks home. We explored,” said Cabana “But, now we want to be pioneers. As pioneers, we will create a sustained human presence in an ever more extreme environment. We now want to go to Mars.” Bob Cabana, Director of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Image: NASA Astronauts going to Mars will take a year to a year and a half to reach the planet and come back, not counting the time spent on the surface. Because of the distance and the few launch windows, there cannot be resupply missions like the ones that regularly go up to the International Space Station. Equipment is being manufactured and tested to harvest resources to make fuel, as well as consumables for the life support systems. The equipment will have to work in extreme and alien conditions. At the poles, the temperature is minus one twenty six degrees Celsius and twenty degrees Celsius at the equator. The machines will have to operate in an atmosphere made up of ninety five per cent carbon dioxide. The Curiosity Rover analysed Martian regolith. Image: NASA The air and soil will be used by Astronauts, even though they are so different from Earth. NASA plans multiple pathfinding missions to identify suitable sites, and make sure that the necessary resources are available when the astronauts need them. The first is an orbiter with instruments on board that will scan Mars for potential landing sites from space. After potential locations are identified, rovers will be sent on the surface to verify the presence of the necessary resources. An image of a carbon dioxide ice cap on Mars captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Similar orbiters may be used to scout the Martian surface for resources. Image: NASA NASA has used the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) have scanned the moon for resource rich sites. NASA is sending a Resource Prospector to the Moon, the first attempt at mining on another celesital body. The Resource Prospector is headed to the poles of the moon, where LCROSS spectacularly crashed into the surface and showed that there was water on the Moon. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite. Image: NASA Jackie Quinn, project manager for LCROSS said “Our objective is to go to the moon’s poles where the LCROSS and LRO missions told us that what we previously thought was a dry moon is actually a quite moist moon.” The Resource Prospector mission is scheduled for 2020, and will extract hydrogen, oxygen and water. NASA plans to learn more about how to extract resources for fuel, and water from the ice on Mars. A Resource Prospector prototype. Image: NASA Gravity on Mars is sixty two percent lower than that on Earth. This means that excavators do not need to be as bulky as they are on Earth. It also means designing new kinds of excavators for low gravity environments, technology that can potentially be used to mine asteroids as well. The mining on Mars can be done by a NASA robot called Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR). Martian regolith, which is crushed rock devoid of any organic matter, can potentially be used to construct 3D printed shelters for the astronauts as well. The Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot. Image: NASA Growing crops in space is another area of focus for the research. It is not easy to grow crops out of regolith, so NASA is figuring out the nutrients that need to be added to the soil, how to water the crops and lighting them with LEDs. Student citizen scientists are contributing to the effort by identifying the best plants that can be grown in space. While transporting entire crops may take up too much space, and prove uneconomical, seeds are small and can be transported easily. NASA plans to use robots to take care of the crops, which leaves the astronauts free for more critical tasks. Crops in space will be grown under artificial lighting made up of red, blue and white LED lights. Image: NASA. Apart from local extraction, fuel can also be obtained from waste. A Trash Reactor can be used on Mars to convert garbage generated by the astronauts into valuable elements. The trash reactor at the Kennedy Space Center burns garbage at a temperature of 537 degrees Celsius to convert garbage into fuel, with oxygen and water as by products. The current reactor can covert four and a half kg of garbage into a little over three kg of fuel. Annie Meier, a chemical engineer at the Kennedy Space Center said “There is food waste, there is biological waste, there is packaging waste. Here at Kennedy, we’re working on how to make this waste into useful products, such as methane for fuel.” Annie Meier with the Trash Reactor in the Background. Image: NASA NASA’s plans and efforts for using local resources on Mars are extensive and detailed. Similar to SpaceX, NASA wants to go beyond just Mars. “We don’t just want to go explore,” Bob Cabana said, “we want to pioneer; we want to establish a presence in the solar system.” Image: SpaceX Tags: Barack Obama, Human Colonisation, Mars, Mars Mission, NASA, SpaceX Also read Elon Musk test fires the Raptor engine meant for exploration of Mars and beyond Scientists unveil first prototype of Mars rover made in Mexico X Recommended For You Mars habitation for humans goes on display in London Researchers find that surface of Mars is so dry that it is inhabitable Schiaparelli probe destroyed on impact, says European Space Agency The ESA Schiaparelli Mars lander tracked by the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope near Pune Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents Gen Dyn IT Will Provide Mission Support to USSOCOM | IAI’s BirdEye 650D Gets Increased Endurance | Airbus Strikes Back; Campaign Costs Leave a Bitter Taste Oct 12, 2016 00:58 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas The USAF has tasked Boeing with selecting a supplier for a $198 million upgrade of the F-15C/D which will allow the fighter to detect at long range the heat generated by an aircraft engine. After selecting the infrared search and track (IRST) sensor supplier, Boeing will be tasked with integrating the pod with the F-15’s other systems, including the Raytheon-supplied active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. By delegating such work, the USAF avoids giving losing bidders a chance to protest Boeing’s decision to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). General Dynamics Information Technology reports they are to provide a range of mission support services to the US Special Operations Command. The multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity USSOCOM contract has a maximum ceiling value of $900 million over a five-year period. Under the deal, USSOCOM forces and their staffs will be provided with technical and management functions across the globe, including engineering and technical services for major weapon systems, program technical assistance, support systems requirements, production decision-making, and program controls assistance. Middle East & North Africa Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has increased the endurance of their BirdEye 650D UAV to over 15 hours. Regarded as the most sophisticated of IAI’s family of small tactical UAVs, the newest version has been designed for use by tactical-level infantry units, but with a “stretched envelope” for increased performance. This increased endurance coupled with the variety of plug-and-play payloads, makes it suitable for civil, as well as military applications. Africa Two AugustaWestland AW101 VIP helicopters have been handed over by the Nigerian government to their air force. The move comes during a round of cost cutting measures in an effort to reduce expenditures which has also seen two VIP jets put up for sale. Nigeria’s AW101s were originally two of 12 destined for the Indian Air Force, but diverted to Nigeria after the contract with India was cancelled over bribery and corruption allegations. Europe Airbus struck back at the Polish government yesterday following the dropping of a multi-billion Caracel helicopter deal. In an open letter to the Prime Minister, the Aerospace giant accused the government of shifting the goalposts as Airbus competed with US and Italian rivals, and attempting to contravene European Union regulations. Speaking in a separate email, Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said “never have we been treated by any government customer the way this government has treated us.” Industry sources estimate Airbus’ cost of running the helicopter sales campaign at several tens of millions of euros. An initial batch of twelve CV9035 infantry fighting vehicles have been delivered to Estonia from the Netherlands. In late 2014, Estonia signed a $125 million deal for the provision of of 44 used Dutch CV9035NL IFVs and six Leopard 1 tank-based support vehicles. All the vehicles, which will be delivered by 2018, are to undergo maintenance and repairs before arriving in Estonia, the Estonian Ministry of Defense said. Norway will also supply 37 IFV CV90, which will be rebuilt as armored support vehicles, to Estonia next year. Asia Pacific Dassault Mirage F1 fighters operated by the Iranian Air Force have successfully had their on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS) refurbished for the first time. The work was carried out by the Overhaul Center of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF). In 2014, Tehran announced that its defense ministry had domestically produced a cruise missile system for its Mirage fleet. Japan’s military and aerospace industry will use this week’s Japan International Aerospace Exhibition to push the case to develop a highly advanced, and costly, stealth fighter jet. Dubbed the F-3, the program could cost Tokyo as much $40 billion to develop depending on specifications. Options open to the government include developing the costly fighter or opting for a more cost effective conventional fighter. In March, Japan’s Ministry of Defence issued a request for information (RFI) to gauge interest among foreign aerospace companies for jointly developing the F-3, which would operate alongside Lockheed Martin’s new F-35s and older F-15s.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login A Most Unlikely Stock for the ‘War on Terror’ Posted on October 13, 2016 by Brad Hoppmann When you think of companies (and the stocks to own) that are directly involved in the West’s war on radical Islamic terror, you tend to think of companies in the defense and aerospace industries. Giant defense contractors such as Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) make the fighter jets that steal all of the dramatic battlefront headlines, as they rain smart bombs down on ISIS strongholds in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Yet in this asymmetric war of ideas, the real battles are being fought in the hearts and minds of people around the world. To wage that war, you have to go where the recruitment and the access to those ideas reside … and that means you have to go on social media platforms such as Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB). Fortunately, both Twitter and Facebook increasingly realize that they play a key role in this fight. And both have recently stepped up their efforts to get rid of members and platforms advocating dangerous extremist ideologies. According to a story at the excellent website Quartz.com: Twitter has become bullish on deleting terrorist accounts in recent months, and now it seems Facebook is ramping up its strategy to prune extremists from its platform. As evidence of Facebook’s intent to do just that, the Quartz story goes on to report verbiage from a "help wanted" post from the social networking giant for what FB calls a “Counterterrorism Researcher.” The job is basically a sort of cyber sleuth whose job will be to figure out how terrorists are using the social media site, and how to shut them down quickly. Here’s the text of the post as reported by Quartz: “The candidate will be responsible for helping drive our efforts around identifying the latest tools, tactics, and infrastructure used by terrorist actors as they affect Facebook and its ecosystems to better defend against and disrupt these threats.” Before I go any further, I’d like to stop here and thank Facebook for this effort. It shows that the social media giant knows it has a vested interest in maintaining a rational, free-idea zone … but that those ideas, when physically threatening and/or violent, are a threat to free ideas and free minds everywhere. Now, some may argue that, for Facebook, it is more than just a realization of the role it plays in safeguarding a free society that’s the real motivation. That may indeed be true — especially when you consider that, just last month, Facebook helped the Israeli government to take down what that government identified as “terrorist content.” Yet that help only came after the Israeli police minister accused Facebook of essentially enabling Palestinian violence via the failure to monitor and shut down the terrorist group Hamas. In fact, the move by Facebook may also have been at least partly in response to a $1 billion lawsuit filed against the company by Israeli and U.S. lawyers. That lawsuit claims the social network allowed Hamas to conduct an attack that left five Americans dead. According the Quartz story: Upon announcing the September partnership, Facebook claims to have taken down 95% of the content flagged by the Israeli government. So, did FB take that action as a result of a realization that freedom requires vigilant monitoring of terrorist groups? Or, did they take that action to avoid litigation of the sort brought in the Hamas case? Or, is it a combination of both? The answer isn’t really clear, nor does it have to be. The fact that they are doing the right thing now by stepping up their efforts to combat dangerous ideas is, in my view, laudable and deserving of acknowledgement and respect. It’s also just another reason why investors continue to bid FB shares higher, having pushed the stock to a one-year gain of more than 35%. And it shows in no uncertain terms why this "FANG" (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) stock has the chops to keep going up. *** What’s your take on social media stocks, and Facebook’s renewed efforts, in the fight against radical Islamic terror? Are you encouraged, or are you skeptical? Or, do you think that you will have to start worrying about what you write on social media, with so many eyes watching? Write in and tell me by leaving me a comment on our website or by sending me an e-mail. *** Stocks fell during Thursday’s session, but managed to recoup most of the losses to close just below the flat line. The Dow closed 0.2% lower as traders continued to ponder the Federal Reserve’s next move. • Jobless claims are at a 43-year low, according to the Labor Department. This statistic may just become the icing on the cake for an increasingly expected December interest-rate hike. • Delta (DAL) flew 1.9% higher today, after reporting Q3 earnings. Revenues came in at $10.5B and earnings-per-share came in at $1.70. However, that revenue number was 5.6% higher in the year-ago quarter. • Wells Fargo (WFC) shares gained 2% in after-hours trading yesterday on news that John Stumpf was stepping down. However, the euphoria that he would be replaced effective immediately by Tim Sloan as CEO and Stephen Sanger as chairman didn’t last today. WFC fell 1.3%. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “A Most Unlikely Stock for the ‘War on Terror’” Joe says: October 14, 2016 at 4:37 am The dominant players in social media (Facebook, Twitter) have allowed pro-ISIS and radical Islamic tweets and posts to go unchecked and unpunished, while suspending the accounts of those who advocate for opposing radical Islam, and supporting traditional values, traditional marriage, Judeo-Christianity, and the candidacy of Donald Trump. They are left wing censors for the global establishment, nothing more. Reply Schnieders says: October 16, 2016 at 5:02 pm Great job!!!!

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Boeing's Canadian investment has increased by an average annual rate of almost 8 percent, or four times that of Canada’s economic growth, according to the release. "Boeing contributes more than $3 billion annually to Canada’s economic growth and development, according to a study commissioned by the company," the release stated. In September, Boeing proposed its F/A-18 Super Hornet for a planned replacement by Canada’s military of the country’s CF-18 fighter aircraft. ...

Crunch Network Los Angeles is a transportation tech powerhouse Posted Oct 13, 2016 by Eric Pakravan (@epakravan) 0 SHARES Next Story Hyperloop One gains $50 million in funding from DP World Group of Dubai Eric Pakravan Crunch Network Contributor Eric Pakravan is a senior associate at Amplify.LA. How to join the network Los Angeles is famous for two things: entertainment and traffic. Back in the 1950s, any association with “stars” and “cars” would be the envy of any modern city. But today, that’s sometimes overshadowed by images of aggressive paparazzi and gridlocked freeways. Thankfully, over the last five years, the emergence of big content-centric startups like Maker Studios, Hulu and even Snapchat has shown that LA can embrace its Hollywood DNA to fuel its burgeoning tech scene. But when it comes to transportation, there might be more to LA than just bloated commute times. Intrinsically, anyone from LA knows that we spend far too much time thinking and talking about traffic (if you haven’t seen SNL’s rendition of “The Californians,” that should give you an idea). In a normal city, weather is a standard conversation starter. But in a city with 329 days of sunshine, conversations here naturally begin instead with a serious discussion about traffic and commute schedules. All that discussion of gridlock may make it seem like we don’t have our act together when it comes to transportation. But if that’s the case, why did Elon Musk choose to build his Mars-chasing SpaceX in LA? Or why did Bay Area-based Shervin Pishevar choose downtown LA for the HQ of Hyperloop One? And why did Chinese giant LeEco choose sunny Southern California as the home for their ambitious electric self-driving car company, Faraday Future? Simple: LA is a powerhouse in transportation technology. This isn’t a new development, either. LA has been a leading transportation technology center for decades. Since the Lockheed Corporation made its home in Burbank in 1928 (as it happens, the same year Warner Bros. moved its studios to Burbank), LA has been consistently churning out new, transformative modes of transportation. The first space shuttle was built in LA county, as were all four of NASA’s Mars Rovers. For a time, Boeing was Southern California’s largest employer. And NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena actually predates NASA itself. When JPL was established next to Caltech in 1936, it was already developing next-gen rocket launchers and early lunar landers. Only after NASA was formed by Eisenhower in 1958 did JPL transfer to NASA’s control. Today, JPL is most well-known for building and managing NASA’s fleet of Mars Rovers, and it funnels talent to Elon Musk’s SpaceX. It’s no surprise that prominent engineers, investors and entrepreneurs are proactively building their transportation ventures in LA. Southern California’s engineering talent continues to be the leading factor for LA’s continued success in delivering bleeding-edge transportation tech. Even with early LA mainstays like Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman moving the bulk of their manufacturing divisions outside of California to states with lower labor costs, all three continue to maintain sizable engineering departments in Southern California. Not only that, but the LA area’s nine engineering schools, including those at Caltech, USC, UCLA and Harvey Mudd, continue to graduate top-quality talent for companies like SpaceX, Boeing and, now, Hyperloop One. In fact, LA graduates more engineers than any other U.S. metro area. That statistic is referenced freely by LA’s startup community in an effort to encourage more LA-based software startups. While that statistic is often taken to mean that LA graduates a lot of programmers (which it does), in reality, a large portion of those engineers are also your PhD-level aerospace engineers, graduate-level electrical engineers and Caltech mechanical engineering grads. Not exactly your stereotypical programmer, right? But it’s exactly those engineers you need to build next-generation modes of transportation, and LA has no shortage of them. Even beyond Hyperloops and aerospace, the strength of LA’s university system continues to lead the way in bringing new edge-case transportation solutions to market. Case in point, TallyGo, an LA-based real-time navigation startup, was spun out of technology originally developed in-house at USC’s IMSC institute. The company has since raised millions in funding from local investors and is now taking on mapping giants like Waze, Google and Apple Maps. Related Articles Hyperloop Technologies becomes Hyperloop One, pulls in $80 million and announces global partners How To Expand Your Marketplace To LA What Los Angeles Is Missing And, believe it or not, LA even leads the nation in traffic mitigation; in 2012, LA was the first major city to sync all its traffic lights. That technology has increased the speed of traffic by 16 percent, reduced travel times in the city by 12 percent and, like a scene out of Fast & Furious, can be used to automatically reprioritize key travel lanes in times of emergency. With such a strong foundation, it’s no surprise that prominent engineers, investors and entrepreneurs are proactively building their transportation ventures in LA. In the not too distant future, self-driving cars from Google, Uber, Tesla or LA’s Faraday Future may eliminate the city’s traffic woes. Hyperloop One could eliminate travel time between LA, SF, Vegas, San Diego and Phoenix. And one day, you might even be able to hitch a first-class ride to Mars — courtesy of LA-native, Elon Musk.

Brazil's Embraer 'close' to deal to end US graft caseAFP – Thu, Oct 13, 2016 5:25 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial plane-maker after Boeing and Airbus, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated anti-corruption regulations in sales outside Brazil Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer's stock rose Thursday after the company said it was "close" to a deal with US authorities to settle corruption allegations that have dogged it since 2010. Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial plane-maker after Boeing and Airbus, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated anti-corruption regulations in sales outside Brazil. The company "is looking to finalize definitive agreements with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to resolve the allegations," it said in a statement released Wednesday. It is also in talks with Brazilian authorities to settle a local investigation, it said. Embraer's stock rose more than three percent on the New York stock exchange and 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo Thursday morning. The international corruption probe was opened after officials in the Dominican Republic allegedly accepted a $3.5 million bribe to buy eight of Embraer's Super Tucano military planes. Former Dominican defense minister Rafael Pena Antonio and three other people were arrested in August in the case. Embraer said it would give details on the settlement deals once they were complete. The company had set aside $200 million in the second quarter to settle the allegations. That helped push it into the red as it lost nearly $100 million for the quarter amid falling demand for executive jets. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Underground rail to link CBD to ParramattaAAP A new rail line will run from Parramatta to Sydney's CBD, with stops at Sydney Olympic Park and the Bays Precinct, … Woodside signs up ex-minister MacfarlaneAAP Ian Macfarlane joins Woodside boardAAP Home loans rose 0.9% in SeptAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7550 +0.001 +0.13% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6012 +0.0023 +0.38% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6992 +0.0036 +0.52% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Robert Vaughn Toyota AU US refugee Gumtree Four Nations Perth Accommodation Trump protests Car insurance comparison Cecil the Lion Life insurance Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Boeing Starliner Won't Be Taking Astronauts To ISS Until December 2018 Posted: Oct 13 2016, 7:41am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Boeing Boeing Company Delays its Starliner Spacecraft Flights with People On Board   The Boeing company has procrastinated its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft flights with people on board for the second time in a row. This is the second time that the Boeing company has delayed its CST-100 Starliner flight. This was the first time that there were supposed to be people on board. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals These people consisted of the crew that were to operate the spacecraft. This spacecraft had been built for the express purpose of taking NASA astronauts to and back from the ISS.  The Starliner was originally supposed to carry astronauts a year from now. Yet Boeing announced in the sultry month of May this year that it will send astronauts aboard the spacecraft in 2018. That is definitely a change of plan. The goal was mid-2018 yet now it has been even further delayed to December of 2018, according to AviationWeek via The Verge. Now that is a long way off. Boeing has given the reasons behind this delay as production glitches and qualification tests that need to be carried out in the nick of time. Also a production hitch forced Boeing to eliminate an important component of the spacecraft. This consisted of a dome that composed the pressure shell of the crew module.     These flaws and problems forced Boeing to further delay the timeline of the Starliner by about half a year or so. When the issues began to crop up, the administration and staff of Boeing took a pause for thought and decided that they were up against a hindrance or two. They had to do something about it and so the delay was inevitable. This was something which could not be avoided by an ostrich-like head-in-the-sand policy of ignorance.  Other tests still need to be carried out. There is the pad abort test. This has everything to do with crew safety in case of an emergency occurring while the spacecraft is on the launch pad. This test was supposed to occur by October of next year. Yet now it has been postponed to January of 2018. The Starliner spacecraft is NASA’s answer to the Commercial Crew Program. The goal is the switching of American astronauts back within the context of national spacecraft. Currently, the United States is dependent upon Russia’s Soyuz modules for sending its astronauts to the ISS. This trip has a steep price tag since each seat costs $80 million. The US of A is looking forward to the Boeing company to build the Starliner under contract from NASA. This way the United States will once again become autonomous as regards space travel and space exploration.  You May Like The Author Sumayah Aamir Sumayah Aamir (Google+) has deep experience in analyzing the latest trends.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News Marijuana Use can Weaken Heart Muscle, Says Study 33 minutes ago Hands-on Experience Helps Students to Grasp Concepts Much Better 6 hours ago, 3:53pm CST Neanderthal Helped Humans Adapt to Life outside Africa 9 hours ago, 12:34pm CST Smartphone App helps early Detection of Autism 9 hours ago, 12:19pm CST British Red Squirrels Carry Bacteria that Cause Leprosy in Humans 11 hours ago, 10:42am CST Best Buy Black Friday Deals on Samsung KS8000 SUHD 4K HDR TVs Sell Early 7 hours ago, 2:27pm CST Walmart Black Friday 2016 Map Release Details 8 hours ago, 1:06pm CST You Can Make Your iPhone Great Again With £3000 Gold-Plated Donald Trump iPhone 7 9 hours ago, 1:02pm CST H&M Launches First Black Friday Collection 9 hours ago, 12:48pm CST Apple To Release 10.9 Inch Bezel-less iPad Pro In 2017 9 hours ago, 12:38pm CST Amazon Launches 12 Day Black Friday Sale Monday in UK 9 hours ago, 12:10pm CST Ghost In The Shell is the New Matrix Movie 10 hours ago, 11:06am CST Cyber Monday 2016 Deals Forced To Change 11 hours ago, 10:43am CST Apple’s MacBook Pro beats all other laptops of 2016 in sales 11 hours ago, 10:29am CST Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Flyer Leaked 11 hours ago, 10:08am CST Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Target Black Friday 2016 ad Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad All Black Friday 2016 ads How to Find Hatchimals Deals Find NES Classic Deals Featured News How to Find NES Classic, Hatchimals, Pokemon Go Plus and New Nintendo 3DS on Black Friday Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Released   Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Ad Released David Blaine Spits out and Swallows Again Live Frog on Tonight Show Latest Science News Marijuana Use can Weaken Heart Muscle, Says Study 33 minutes ago Hands-on Experience Helps Students to Grasp Concepts Much Better 6 hours ago, 3:53pm CST Neanderthal Helped Humans Adapt to Life outside Africa 9 hours ago, 12:34pm CST Smartphone App helps early Detection of Autism 9 hours ago, 12:19pm CST More Latest Science News Stories Latest News Marijuana Use can Weaken Heart Muscle, Says Study 33 minutes ago Hands-on Experience Helps Students to Grasp Concepts Much Better 6 hours ago, 3:53pm CST Best Buy Black Friday Deals on Samsung KS8000 SUHD 4K HDR TVs Sell Early 7 hours ago, 2:27pm CST $1,497.99 60-inch Samsung UN65KS8000FXZA 4K SUHD Smart TV Best Buy Black Friday Deal 7 hours ago, 2:05pm CST More Latest News The Latest ...

But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. “A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way,” says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. “There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less.” On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed “a very rare manufacturing process error” for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be “premature to speculate” on the outcome of its investigations. Read also: Samsung offers financial help over Note 7 “We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes,” Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology, which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. “We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane,” Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light-weight, high-energy Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. Watch He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that “very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny.” Sony, HP, Toshiba and Panasonic have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. “It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety,” Tsuga said. “With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents.” Greater demands Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, “they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be,” said Larsen, the consultant. Read also: Can Samsung bounce back from Note 7 fiasco? “What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology.” But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. “There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store.” Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018. REUTERS Hungry for more business news? Sign up for our daily newsletter!

According to a pre-release from the White House, one of the President’s goals to be discussed in Pittsburgh today will involve expanding human presence throughout the solar system. He hopes that with the leadership of NASA and their private industry partners, humanity can achieve this by pushing innovation and harnessing the spirit of exploration. Making good on his CNN op-ed published earlier this week, the President will enable NASA to send humans to Mars by the 2030’s by allowing them to focus on deep space exploration while private companies take over operations in low-Earth orbit or specifically, the International Space Station. The President will highlight the commercial contracts already in place for SpaceX to ferry astronauts to the ISS with their upcoming Crew Dragon vehicle and for Boeing to do the same with the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. Dragon is on display at the conference while a Starliner simulator will be available for participants. The Obama administration has directed NASA to start working with the commercial space industry to also develop deep space habitats which could safely house astronauts during the long trip to Mars and other destinations. “The idea is that these habitats or “habs” would evolve into spacecraft capable of sustaining and transporting astronauts on long duration deep space missions, like a mission to Mars,” said a joint statement from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and John P. Holdren, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. “Their development would be achieved through new public-private partnerships designed to build on and support the progress of the growing commercial space sector in Earth orbit.” In order to achieve the ambitious goal of a fully space-faring future, the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships or “NextSTEP” program was created to foster the development of the technologies to accomplish what will be the most scientifically complex endeavor ever attempted by mankind. Six companies have received awards to start developing potential habitation systems along with life support and propulsion concepts to protect humans during interplanetary travel. The list includes Sierra Nevada Corporation, Boeing, Orbital ATK, NanoRacks and two companies who are leading the pack with their progress in hardware development, Lockheed Martin and Bigelow Aerospace. Veteran spacecraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin is already a few years into development of the Orion spacecraft—the vehicle that NASA will use to propel humans to deep space atop the agency’s upcoming heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System. While Lockheed has been conceptualizing a multi-purpose logistics module for NextSTEP to initially orbit the moon, they seem to be resetting that plan to build what they are calling a “Mars Base Camp” that will help establish a human presence in Martian orbit and get us there faster than NASA’s current plans to land on the surface. “At Lockheed Martin, we’ve been a part of every NASA mission to Mars for the past 4 decades and we stand ready to support the nation’s goal of making the next giant leap of sending humans there and bringing them safely home. Working in partnership with NASA, we’ve developed, built and flown the Orion spacecraft — the only crewed spacecraft built to withstand the punishing journey to other planets,” said Lockheed Martin Vice President Lisa Callahan in a statement to the Observer. “We’re also advancing deep space habitat designs and mapping out a Mars mission concept, called Mars Base Camp, that suggests a technological roadmap for achieving the first human mission at Mars.” As part of the administration and NASA’s push for the eventual commercial takeover of the space station, they will move forward with the plan to offer private companies docking capabilities and the resources to operate in low-Earth orbit. One of those firms is Bigelow Aerospace, a Las Vegas-based expandable habitat developer that already has their BEAM module attached to the International Space Station for testing. The experimental Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) is connected to the Tranquility node of the ISS and its testing could lead to future versions being used as extra work or living space for astronauts. For the NextSTEP program, Bigelow is developing an accessible 330 cubic meter expandable habitat module to house a human crew. XBASE or Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement as it’s called, would be able to dock with the International Space Station and provide a wealth of space for routine operations as well as mission-specific tasks. The XBASE’s development will be based on the current testing of the BEAM which includes performance reactions to temperature fluctuations, space radiation, and debris impact. Bigelow Aerospace hopes their expandable concepts will lead to the development of habitat spacecraft that will orbit the moon and one day, Mars. “We have submitted a version of a deep space habitat that we call EMMT—Earth Moon Mars Transporter and it can be various sizes and the particular presentation we were given were constrained. We had to shape this spacecraft to a size that would initially fit as a secondary payload under the Orion on a Space Launch System. We really had to shrink it down but these are terrific transporters,” said Bigelow Aerospace founder and president Robert Bigelow in a previous interview with the Observer. “Our philosophy is try to test everything we can. First, close to home because we don’t want any suicide missions. The moon is a perfect testing ground for a really dangerous environment and If you can successfully do a lot of things there, you can learn a lot that would be valuable to bases and human habitats on Mars.” Apart from NASA and their private industry partners that are all developing Mars mission-related capabilities, SpaceX has their own plan for not only reaching the red planet but building a permanent, self-sustaining city on our neighboring world. At the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk unveiled the company’s Interplanetary Transport System which can carry 100 or more colonists to Mars to establish a permanent settlement. The 400 foot tall rocket will be the largest ever built and will launch a 55 feet wide reusable spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center for a trip that could last up to 150 days. SpaceX hopes to launch the maiden voyage in a decade to construct a fuel processing facility on Mars that will enable return flights and slash the costs of interplanetary travel. It’s not clear how SpaceX’s bold mission will coincide with NASA’s plan to launch the Orion crew module atop the Space Launch System to Mars but the company has left the door open for government and industry cooperation. “SpaceX was founded with the ultimate goal of helping make humans a multi-planetary species. As Elon said at his recent talk, it will take a combination of public and private efforts to build a self-sustaining city on Mars,” said a SpaceX spokesperson to the Observer. “It’s exciting to see President Obama advocate for the next frontier in human spaceflight, and we look forward to participating in the journey.” Robin Seemangal focuses on NASA and advocacy for space exploration.

Sobczyk Published: Oct 13, 2016 9:39 a.m. ET Share By MartinM. Sobczyk WARSAW--LOT Polish Airlines said on Thursday it would lease up to 15 Boeing Co. BA, +0.56% single-aisle planes from Air Lease Corp. AL, +1.15% marking the second contract that Warsaw has awarded U.S. aerospace companies over European rival Airbus Group SE (AIR.FR) in as many weeks. The state-owned carrier said it would take delivery of two latest-generation 737 Max 8 and four 737-800 NG airplanes next year, with the rest of the deliveries expected by 2020. The jetliner deal follows Poland's decision to buy military helicopters from Lockheed Martin Corp. earlier this month after abandoning a tentative $3.5 billion deal to buy 50 Caracal helicopters made by Airbus. LOT Chief Executive Rafal Milczarski on Thursday said leasing Boeing planes was the cheapest option, "not emotional or political," and that the timing of the announcement, soon after the government's decision to reject the Airbus helicopter deal, was a coincidence. Mr. Milczarski said the move offers synergies with LOT's existing 737-400 aircraft and allows the company to more easily train pilots to fly the newer planes. Since the early 1990s, LOT has preferred Boeing aircraft for its long-haul as well as narrow-body fleet. Expanding LOT's fleet comes as the airline seeks to grow back its business after nearly going bankrupt in 2008 and 2012. Airbus, in response to Thursday's announcement, said its A320 neo model would have been a better choice for the Polish airline. LOT said it would increase the number of flights operated to major European airports and Tel Aviv, and that it was working on adding flights from its hub in Warsaw to Tehran and Astana. Rescued with Polish tax money in 2012, LOT said it would make between 150 million zlotys and 200 million zlotys ($38.5 million to $51.3 million) in operating profit this year. The airline expects to grow its fleet to some 70 aircraft in 2020 from 45 this year.

SINGAPORE: Lithium-based batteries have been powering our portable devices for 25 years. But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," said Samsung. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL), which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. "We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane," Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light weight, high energy Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that "very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny." Sony, HP Inc, Toshiba Corp and Panasonic Corp have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. "It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety," Tsuga said. "With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents." Greater demands Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

 Samsung's woes highlight explosive limits of lithium batteries Reuters Oct. 12, 2016, 10:38 PM 410 facebook linkedin twitter email print An advertisement of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is seen at a mobile phone shop in Hanoi Thomson Reuters By Jeremy Wagstaff SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lithium-based batteries have been powering our portable devices for 25 years. But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces.  "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL), which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment.   Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries.  In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. "We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane," Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Link to Reuters TV segment: http://www.reuters.tv/v/2P2/2016/10/13/note-7-highlights-the-explosive-risks-of-lithium LIGHT-WEIGHT, HIGH ENERGY Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a U.S. chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that "very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny." Sony, HP Inc, Toshiba Corp and Panasonic Corp have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. "It’s a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety," Tsuga said. "With current technologies, it’s extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents." GREATER DEMANDS Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

Those planes have allowed the Guangzhou-based carrier to launch six nonstop global routes, connecting Guangzhou to London and Rome in Europe, Vancouver in North America as well as destinations in Australia and New Zealand. “The Dreamliners have helped us to achieve initial success in implementing our internationalization strategy in the past few years and enabled us to make our operation and services more appealing to passengers,” Tan Wangeng, China Southern’s CEO, said in a statement. “The additional 787-9s will further increase our capacity and services for our long-haul routes.” Wednesday’s order is valued at $3.2 billion at current list prices, but China Southern said in a regulatory filing that its cost will be “significantly lower than the catalog price ... because of the substantial price concessions granted by Boeing.” China Southern did not say how much it will pay for the Dreamliners, citing a confidentiality demand by Boeing. The disclosure of such costs are usually required by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and China Southern will have to get a waiver from the exchange to proceed. The purchase also must receive shareholder and government approval. China Southern said it will provide more information about the purchase next month. Deliveries of the aircraft are expected to occur between 2018 and 2020, according to the regulatory filing. “China Southern has been a longstanding Boeing customer and we truly appreciate their confidence in the 787,” Ihssane Mounir, Boeing’s senior vice president of Northeast Asia Sales, said in a statement. “The 787-9 will help the airline achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability.” The 787-9 is a stretched version of the earlier 787-8 Dreamliner, with 20 additional feet to fly up to 335 passengers. Built of composite materials, the Dreamliner uses 20 percent less fuel than similar-sized commercial planes. Boeing’s official tally of Dreamliner orders stood at 19 for the year as of Oct. 4. However, that number doesn’t include last week’s order by Qatar Airways for 30 787-9s and Wednesday’s China Southern order. With those deals, Boeing unofficially has 71 Dreamliner orders in 2016 — including 33 from Chinese carriers — compared to 52 for the same period a year ago. “This is another shot in the arm for the 787, which has been selling slowly this year,” Uresh Sheth, an investment banker and Dreamliner analyst, said on his “All Things 787” website. Boeing builds the 787 at its North Charleston campus and at a West Coast plant in Everett, Wash.

Boeing currently has more than a dozen states in competition from coast to coast offering property, billions of dollars of tax breaks, favorable labor deals and customized employee training hoping that Boeing will choose them to assemble its new 777X jetliner. (AP Photo/The Boeing Co.) Updated at 1 p.m.  Boeing marked the completion of its first commercial aircraft facility in the St. Louis area with a grand-opening ceremony Thursday.  Employees at the new 424,000-square foot Boeing Composite Center of Excellence at 8900 Frost Avenue in Berkeley will build composite parts for the 777X, the company’s newest commercial jetliner. Maplewood-based MC Industrial, a subsidiary of McCarthy Holdings, built the facility, which was expanded from an earlier design to include the addition of a paint facility on the south side of the building. Production of the aircraft’s wing edge and tail parts will begin early next year, and the aircraft is targeted for delivery in 2020. The 777X wing will be assembled in Everett, Wash. Parts production in St. Louis is scheduled to start in early 2017. The 777X work is generating 700 jobs locally over the next few years, Chicago-based Boeing said Wednesday. Boeing has spent $200 million so far to construct the facility, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, and plans to spend an additional $100 million to outfit it with final tooling and equipment. That construction met the requirements for Boeing to qualify for subsidies from the state of Missouri that could reach $229 million over 18 years. Boeing would have to increase its St. Louis workforce by 2,000 jobs to qualify for the full subsidy. The unusual agreement allows Boeing to reap smaller payments if it simply keeps employment over 12,500. The 777X is a long-haul, double-aisle airliner designed to carry up to 400 passengers while using less fuel than the competition. Production of 777X wing edge and tail parts is expected to begin at the plant in early 2017, the company said. Boeing had 306 orders for the 777X through September. The 777X replaces the highly successful 777, introduced in 1995.

Jay Nixon, a Democrat, who helped push for incentives for the plant expansion.  Boeing Defense, Space & Security division is based in Hazelwood and the company currently has about 15,000 workers in the St. Louis area.  "This has been Boeing defense, obviously, and to get commercial work here, to broaden that portfolio, especially with these composites which are going to be used in defense and commercial both, gives an asset here," Nixon said, adding Boeing's two autoclaves at the facility that weigh more than 200,000 pounds are unlikely to be moved.   "When they make this level of capital investment, it means not only these 700 jobs but more to come in the future," Nixon said.  Jim Gallagher and Kevin McDermott of the Post-Dispatch and Reuters contributed to this report.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Obama: Getting humans to Mars will require NASA, private companies to team up Los Angeles Times Oct 12, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS President Barack Obama speaks Tuesday at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the White Oak Amphitheatre in Greensboro, N.C. WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama hammered home his goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, while acknowledging that accomplishing it would require public and private collaboration. Obama first said in 2010 he wanted to send astronauts “to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth” by the mid-2030s with “a landing on Mars” to follow. In an opinion article Tuesday on CNN.com, Obama said the ultimate ambition was not only to send humans to Mars and bring them back, but to “remain there for an extended time.” “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way,” he said. Obama’s article comes two weeks after SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk laid out an ambitious plan to eventually send 1 million people to colonize the Red Planet and turn humans into a multiplanetary species within 40 to 100 years. In a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico, Musk similarly called for a public/private partnership. NASA is working with Hawthorne, Calif.-based SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing Co. to develop crew capsules to take astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA relies on SpaceX and aerospace firm Orbital ATK to deliver supplies and cargo to the space station. This week, Obama will speak at the White House Frontiers conference in Pittsburgh, an event that will focus on innovations in science and technology, including a future Mars mission. Executives from companies such as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and moon mining firm Moon Express are also set to speak at the conference. “It just underlines the theme that’s run through the Obama administration, which is encouraging partnerships with the private sector, providing additional opportunities for work and, when appropriate, doing business in a slightly different way,” said John Logsdon, professor emeritus of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. “It’s mainly about leaving a legacy,” he said. Analysts said a public/private partnership recognizes the reality of the space business today, as well as financial limitations. “On the commercial side, there are a lot of innovative ideas,” said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International. “But they need that backing from the government both in the know-how . (and) the government’s financial resources.” Smaller space start-ups that don’t usually work with the government could benefit most from Obama’s goal, said Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation trade group. “I think it gives a level of excitement to a variety of different players,” he said. “You don’t know who the next SpaceX could be, or the next Blue Origin,” referring to the space tourism company started by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. SpaceX, whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has said its first test flight of an interplanetary vehicle could come in four years. A crewed mission could launch in late 2024 and arrive on Mars in 2025. Developing the interplanetary transport system could cost SpaceX $10 billion. In an email, SpaceX spokesman Phil Larson said it was “exciting to see President Obama advocate for the next frontier in human space flight,” and that the company was looking forward to “participating in the journey.” The company’s plan to send an unmanned Dragon spacecraft to the Red Planet as early as 2018 will provide an early chance to demonstrate how private space companies and NASA can work together, said Charles Lurio, publisher of the Lurio Report newsletter on entrepreneurial spaceflight. SpaceX will use the flight to test landing capabilities, interplanetary navigation and other systems. NASA will provide some technical support for the mission because it is interested in the entry, descent and landing data. Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at the Teal Group, estimated that a mission to Mars done the “traditional way” by NASA could cost at least $1 trillion. Oftentimes, large space programs can get delayed if Congress does not grant the requested funding amount, or if there are technical problems along the way. A public/private partnership may speed up the timeline and could lower that cost below $1 trillion, Caceres said. But one of the biggest questions is whether such a program could get funding from Congress, said Ostrove of Forecast International. “There is some desire to do the actual exploration,” he said. “I think that there’s maybe not necessarily the political will to spend the money on these types of programs when there’s so many other things we’re facing now.” One question still to be answered is who will build the massive rockets needed to get to Mars. NASA plans to send its Space Launch System rocket to an asteroid in the mid-2020s and to Mars in the 2030s. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has said he thinks the first person to land on Mars will “arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” a reference to the company’s role on the SLS project. That is a challenge to Musk, who described a rocket booster measuring 39 feet in diameter. When stacked with the SpaceX Mars spaceship, the interplanetary transport system would be 400 feet tall. In a statement Tuesday, John Elbon, vice president and general manager of Boeing Space Exploration, said that sending humans to Mars is “an achievable and inspiration goal for this country.” “This isn’t science fiction,” he said. “We’re building real hardware right now and NASA has a solid plan to get there.” Tags Barack Obama Mars Nasa Human Spacex Mars Featured Businesses Metro OB/GYN 201 Ridge St, Ste 307, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-329-5700 Baxter Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Bellevue 7713 S 19th Cir, Bellevue, NE 68147 402-934-2886 Vehicles Omaha Symphony | Concerts | Orchestra | Pops 1905 Harney St, Ste 400, Omaha, NE 68102 402-345-0606 Curri 1028 S 74th Plz, Omaha, NE 68114 402-614-0009 Midwest Ag Services, Inc. 245 W Broadway, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-323-5353 Coupons Krispy Kreme | 120th St. Omaha | Doughnuts | Coffee 2715 S. 120th Street, Omaha, NE 68144 402-334-9000 Currently Open Popular on Omaha.com Ben Sasse: Everyone’s duty is to hope for Trump, work for America Shatel: Stats aside, we’ll remember Tommy for his toughness Recruiting: Talented players from in and out of Nebraska visit Huskers for Minnesota game Tom's Takes: Playoff chaos, not-so-special teams, bright future at I-back Chatelain: Blackshirt brashness is a welcome sight They said it: Gophers coach praises Tommy Armstrong, credits NU's second-half play Nebraska-Minnesota: Five things we learned, still don't know Goodwill refocuses on mission as more high-paid executives depart, other sweeping changes occur Husker veterans carry the load in fending off Minnesota, getting NU back on track Postgame: Armstrong vows to be ready for final game at Memorial Stadium loading...

The £165m lifeline has convinced the regulator to renew its Air Travel Operators’ Licence (Atol) until next September after granting a last-minute extension to Monarch’s existing licence just four hours before it was due to expire at the end of last month. Central to Monarch’s rescue bid is a restructuring of a $3.2bn (£2.6bn) deal with Boeing for up to 45 aircraft, which is expected to release significant cash back into the business and delay an increase in costs for two years. Monarch boss Andrew Swaffield confirmed that the rejigged deal would include a “sale-and-leaseback agreement” that could see Boeing buy Monarch's order on the condition that the airline agrees to lease the aircraft from 2018 when the first planes are set to be delivered. The company said that the Boeing agreement had “facilitated” the £165m cash injection from Greybull, which holds a 90pc stake in the company after agreeing to pump £125m of capital into Monarch in 2014. Greybull’s latest bailout is the fourth for the airline in the space of five years. The airline had flirted with the loss of its licence Credit: alamy Mr Swaffield declined to comment on the details of the Boeing deal, which includes 30 aircraft and the potential for 15 more, but it is understood each plane will cost about $50m. The heavy cost of the new aircraft is offset by lower maintenance bills and a 20pc energy efficiency advantage over its existing fleet of older Airbus planes, which could bring substantial savings on its £120m annual fuel costs over the lifetime of the aircraft. Mr Swaffield said the deal had given the airline confidence that it can face the ongoing pressures in the industry, which has taken a hit in recent years due to economic jitters and concerns over terrorism in regions previously popular with holidaymakers. Mr Swaffield said that the company expected the market to remain highly competitive, with low ticket prices and rising costs due to the declining value of sterling. The 12-day licence extension came as a relief to thousands of passengers concerned that their flights and holidays would be cancelled if the airline were unable to clinch a deal. Mr Swaffield admitted that its holiday bookings in recent weeks had been dampened as financial talks rumbled on, but added that sales were now returning to normal. He added that the recent collapse of the pound against the dollar and euro had done little to deter UK holidaymakers, many of whom travel with Monarch to visit their holiday homes abroad or are turning to all-inclusive deals to lock in holiday costs.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion In our opinion: Space travel may be closer than you think Deseret News editorial Published: Oct. 12, 2016 12:20 a.m. Updated: Oct. 11, 2016 6:32 p.m. 6 Comments Given the current political environment, some may feel it is a good time to go to Mars. This week, President Obama announced that by the 2030s the United States will send humans to Mars and back. As President Obama wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday by CNN, the nation’s long-term goal is “to one day remain (on Mars) for an extended time.” Those following the newly competitive space race, may see the announcement as little more than a yawn. Before Obama made his statement, space-hungry billionaire Elon Musk announced that his company, SpaceX, would put humans on the Red Planet in the mid-2020s. Moreover, Bas Lansdorp, CEO of the Dutch-based Mars One, said: "We're going to live on Mars in 2027." Not to be outdone, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg declared that whoever gets to Mars first will do so using a Boeing rocket. And then there’s Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space vacation initiative. For a small fortune, Galactic plans to send non-astronaut citizens up to space and bring them back, we hope in one piece. The increased competition and crop of private enterprises engaged in space exploration is a positive development and a credit to NASA's new model of studying and encountering the final frontier. NASA no longer appears to be frittering funds, but is using its budget to spur innovative and financially efficient space exploration corporations. To understand how different the collaborative Mars endeavor is from the original NASA-based moon shot, it's helpful to go back to some early space and aeronautics history. There were initially two very different approaches to the technology of space travel. One was a "flyable" capsule and the other was a "rideable" capsule. There was neither the time nor the money available to pursue both paths simultaneously so they chose the latter, which became the "rideable" Apollo capsule design. Once the moon race was successfully won, attention turned to reducing the cost of space launches. This revived the original concept of the reusable and flyable design. Rather than focus on a far-away target, the goal was to create, support and supply a space station in low Earth orbit. Increasing pressure on both safety and financial stability of NASA opened the modern era of space exploration. For the first time it is now possible for private entities, with government incentives and subsidies, to create multiple competing designs of spacecraft. These designs hold the very real prospect of lowering the cost of space travel such that interplanetary exploration is possible within the next couple of decades. Instead of being the exclusive innovator in space technology, NASA has become the primary funding source and technical clearinghouse for private innovations and investments in space enterprises. The race to Mars is heating up precisely because multiple entities are convinced they can get there first. With that said, some have expressed legitimate concerns about using federal funds to fuel private space exploration. After all, if Blue Origin or SpaceX arrives on Mars first and discovers valuable mineral resources, do they have the right to claim or exploit them? Still others wonder if the nation should spend money in space when there are enough problems worth solving here on Earth. Those who support these investments contend that many of the solutions to pressing earthly problems may yet be found through pushing and exploring extra-earthly boundaries. These queries are worthy of further debate and discussion. However, in the interim, the emerging model for NASA seems to be driving results in a positive direction. Many voters frustrated with this election season may welcome some optimistic news regarding the nation’s progress into space, yet after Nov. 8, some will undoubtedly be disappointed that they can't get there faster. 6 Comments Like that?

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: October 13th, 2016 >> Story Satnews Daily October 13th, 2016 United Launch Alliance and Boeing Reveal Atlas V's New Skirt & Improves Starliner's Service Module Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. (October 13, 2016) – A United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket with the CST-100 Starliner capsule on Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Atlas V carrying Starliner will launch American astronauts from US soil to the International Space Station beginning in 2018. Photo by United Launch Alliance/Boeing The goal of the US transporting astronauts to the International Space Station is finally within reach, something that up until now has required the US relying upon other nations' transport to and from ISS. NASA has paid Russia, and over 12 years could end up paying, more than $3.36 billion. With the thought of being self sufficient, United Launch Alliance (ULA) and The Boeing Company unveiled an updated aerodynamic configuration of the Atlas V that will launch Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule for NASA after encountering unique challenges with aerodynamic stability and loads. This new configuration incorporates an aeroskirt aft of the spacecraft, extending the Starliner Service Module cylindrical surface to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the integrated launch configuration and bring loads margins back to acceptable flight levels. Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of Human and Commercial Services said, “Through incredible coordination and continued innovative thinking, the collective team of NASA, Boeing and United Launch Alliance completed three wind tunnel tests in six months to investigate the aerodynamic stability of various configurations and to anchor our analytical predictions. Based on that information, we updated the configuration for the Atlas V Starliner integrated vehicle stack. This configuration is unique because it combines the Atlas V launch vehicle without a payload fairing with Boeing’s Starliner capsule, resulting in different aerodynamic interactions.”   The aeroskirt is a metallic orthogrid structure designed to be jettisoned for improved performance. In the unlikely event that an emergency occurs during boost phase of flight, the aeroskirt has venting provisions to control over-pressurization if the Starliner’s abort engines are fired. Fabrication of the aeroskirt is scheduled to begin this month at ULA’s factory in Decatur, Alabama, following completion of a Production Readiness Review. John Mulholland, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program stated, "Our testing indicates the solution we chose will sufficiently smooth the air flow around the vehicle during ascent, ensuring crew safety and mission success," said . The ULA team completed the aeroskirt Preliminary Design Review earlier this month. The Atlas V with Starliner has a planned uncrewed flight test in 2018 with operational missions to follow. “We look forward to our continued partnership with Boeing and NASA to ensure mission success and safety for American astronauts flying from U.S. soil on the Atlas V Starliner,” said Wentz. ULA has successfully delivered more than 110 satellites to orbit that provide critical capabilities for troops in the field, aid meteorologists in tracking severe weather, enable personal device-based GPS navigation and unlock the mysteries of the solar system.  http://www.ulalaunch.com   Topical Tags :  Manufacturing    Agencies    Regulatory/Government    Launch    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  North America                     FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News ULA's Successful Cool As A Cube WorldView-4 Launch  A Fairing Kind Of Day For Arianespace AIMing For Didymos Veterans Day, Lest We Forget...  Launch Reminders...

The commander-in-geek was clearly in his element as he stepped off Air Force One in Pittburgh and headed to the event, which showcases thrilling innovations in tech. There, a clearly delighted President fist-bumped a paralyzed man who uses a mind-controlled robotic hand, goofed around with a baby in a Nasa T-shirt and got a taste of astronaut life.  Geek power: Self-confessed science geek Barack Obama hangs out with his ten-month-old counterpart Rowan Wright at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh Thursday Space commander: Obama managed to successfully dock into the ISS using this  official flight simulator, joking that it was like driving an Uber The President beamed as he took docked a virtual shuttle into the International Space Station on a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator that had been installed at the event, held in Carnegie Mellon University. 'Your ride is here, baby,' Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. 'This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we'll be there in five minutes.' But his control of a virtual shuttle was nothing compared to Nathan Copeland's dexterity with the robotic hand protruding from his wheelchair.  Copeland, who is paralyzed, explained that he was able to use his mind to control the arm remotely, and could even feel sensation through it - making him the first person in the world to use such technology.  Hand it to him: Obama was astonished to meet Nathan Copeland (left), who is the first person to use a mind-controlled robotic arm that allows them to feel sensation  'What a story,' Obama said incredulously, before offering up a handshake and a much cooler fist-bump. But the President's cultivated air of cool was no match for the geek power on display at the show. The Harvard-trained lawyer, who has never been shy about his fascination with science and technology, gawked at a self-flying quadcopter, or mini-drone. Brass knuckles? Obama greeted Copeland, who is paralyzed, with a fist-bump - a moment of cool during his enthusiastically geeky day at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University He goofed around with ten-month-old baby Rowan Wright, whom he spotted wearing a Nasa T-shirt. And he showed short shrift for those who 'willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand' on issues like global warming. 'Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn't deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn't have worked,' Obama said.  'No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon.'

The geek-in-chief was in his element Thursday as he toured cutting-edge projects during a White House Frontiers Conference. Obama beamed as he took the chair of a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator, with its panoply of buttons and monitors and futuristic gizmos. "Right, left, left," his trainer said, urging minute course corrections. "Your ride is here, baby," Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. "This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we'll be there in five minutes." Minutes later, the president gawked at a self-directed quadcopter, or mini-drone, used to inspect infrastructure like bridges. As a computer screen showed the drone's preset path, the drone moved up and down, left and right, emitting neon green light and whizzing loudly. He offered a presidential fist-bump to Nathan Copeland, a paralyzed man who is the first person who can feel sensation through his mind-controlled robotic arm. "What a story," Obama said incredulously. The Harvard-trained lawyer has never been shy about his fascination with all things scientific and high-tech. Over the years he's fired off a high-speed marshmallow air cannon at a White House science fair and rubbernecked at robots built by teenagers. He used his appearance Thursday to scoff at those who "willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand," such as those who question global warming. "Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn't deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn't have worked," Obama said. "No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon." Urging a new aspiration for the nation, Obama has set a goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, and in Pittsburgh he got a look at the SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft, part of ongoing research to develop vehicles that could transport astronauts to the red planet. Obama remarked at the white capsule's petite size. "It's like putting up with Sasha and Malia in the back of the car," he said. "It's a long car ride." ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Home World news Obama to campaign for Clinton, Ohio Democrats as 2016 map narrows Obama to campaign for Clinton, Ohio Democrats as 2016 map narrows President Barack Obama will try to rev up Democrats in Ohio during a two-day visit, as the number of states that could swing to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump narrows to just a handful. By: Associated Press | Washington | Published: October 14, 2016 4:23 AM US President Barack Obama. (Reuters) President Barack Obama will try to rev up Democrats in Ohio during a two-day visit, as the number of states that could swing to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump narrows to just a handful. Obama heads to Columbus on Thursday to be the featured speaker at an annual dinner benefiting Ohio Democrats and Gov. Ted Strickland, who is running to oust incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman. On Friday, Obama will hold a rally in Cleveland for Clinton emphasizing early voting, a major focus for Democrats across the U.S. this year. This week Obama entered the final 100 days of his presidency, and he’s increasingly devoting his time to trying to push Clinton over the finish line in the presidential race. With Trump and Republicans threatening to undo much of what Obama has accomplished over the last eight years, campaigning for Democrats is the most productive way for Obama to try to protect his legacy. Before flying to Ohio, Obama planned to speak in Pittsburgh at the ”White House Frontiers Conference,” where aides said he’d announce new funding for technology and research and tout innovations like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. Obama, in an op-ed in the magazine Wired, said the U.S. needed to adapt its skills to address emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant ”superbugs,” cybersecurity and climate change. ”To accelerate that change, we need science,” Obama said. In Pittsburgh, the president checked out a few projects, including a Boeing flight simulator, a drone and a mind-controlled robotic arm, before he addressed the conference. Obama, who has not kept his love for science a secret, appeared to be having too much fun after he sat in what looked like part of a small cockpit, with an abundance of lights, buttons and knobs. He joked about not wanting to crash because ”this is really expensive stuff.” ”Your ride is here, baby,” Obama said, stepping out of the simulator. ”This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we’ll be there in five minutes.” Ohio, with its diverse mix of cities and rural areas, is a coveted prize every four years, seen as a barometer for the shifts in the nation’s political climate. This year, it’s one of just four states that polls suggest are currently toss-ups between Clinton and Trump, along with Nevada, North Carolina and Florida. Trump, too, was setting his sights on Ohio on Thursday, with a speech in Columbus and an evening rally in Cincinnati. The shrinking of the political battlefield reflects demographic shifts that have benefited Democrats in several states and Trump’s struggles to expand his appeal to a broad cross-section of America. But Obama and Democrats have been wary not to take anything for granted, particularly as the final weeks of the campaign have taken a series of unpredictable turns. Obama and his wife, Michelle, are two of the country’s most popular Democrats, making them the most effective voices to vouch publicly for Clinton. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that makes the first couple particularly useful in freeing up Clinton to focus her limited time elsewhere. ”The real value of having somebody as high-profile as the president or the first lady on the stump campaigning for you is that you don’t have to also go there in order to get attention. You’ve got somebody else there who can make a forceful case in support of your candidacy,” Earnest said. Hoping that broad disdain for Trump will sink other Republican candidates, Democrats have been particularly bullish this year about retaking the Senate, which would significantly strengthen Clinton’s hand legislatively should she win the White House. Democrats had expected Strickland’s race to be one of their better prospects to win a GOP-held Senate seat, but he has been running consistently behind Portman in the polls. Yet in a sign of how toxic Trump has become for other Republicans, Portman revoked his support for Trump after video emerged of Trump making offensive comments about women. Portman has said he’s backing Trump’s running mate Mike Pence instead. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Obama remarked at the white capsule’s petite size. “It’s like putting up with Sasha and Malia in the back of the car,” he said. “It’s a long car ride.” ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

By Jennine Zeleznik The Monitor PHARR Fire Marshal Juan Ruiz climbed over piles of discarded metal beams Tuesday morning, making his way toward the fire alarm box in a back room of Pharrs newest nightclub, Graham Central Station. The $2 million club, located in El Centro Mall, has been under construction since March and is slated for a grand opening Friday. Turning to the contractors around him, Ruiz explained what needed to be done to bring the system and other parts of the building up to code in time for the big day. Were going to do everything we can to have it ready by Thursday morning, said Ed Derveda, a fire alarm and sprinkler contractor. When complete, Graham Central will houses seven mini-nightclubs under one roof and should hold more than 3,000 people. It is expected to generate between $3 million and $5 million annually. But first, it has to get done. We will be working day and night, around the clock, to get this club finished, said general contractor George Elizondo of Geoval Properties LLC. Workers on Tuesday were finishing the dance floors in the Tejano, country and disco/80s sections of the club, while others cemented tiles or fine-tuned the laser lights in the entryway. Unconnected wires still hung in bunches from ceilings, and electrical extension cords crisscrossed the brightly striped carpet. Weve got a lot to do, but were tying up the ends there, getting things done, said James DeBerry, supervisor of construction at the club. Were doing the last minute preparations and checks, making sure all the equipment works correctly and all the supplies are in place. Owner Gary Graham said the club employs more than 140 people, between its security, bartenders, waitstaff and an in-house singing group. This is the largest nightclub Ive ever seen and we own 48 others, Graham said, looking around at the 50,000-square-foot complex. For $5, people 18 and older will be admitted to all seven of the miniclubs, which also include salsa/meringue music, karaoke, a sports bar and a Top 40 dance section. The (Rio Grande) Valley certainly lends itself to a variety of music venues, DeBerry said. Folks here seem to like more types of music and enjoy it all. And thats what were here to give them. People under 21 will be issued numbered wristbands in exchange for their IDs, which will be put in a book with the same number as their wristbands. At the end of the night, or when they want to leave, they come back, get the wristband cut off and our employees will reissue them their ID, DeBerry said. In a club so large, this system allows for better alcohol control, he said, and is used by the Grahams other clubs throughout the country. Curtains are scheduled to go up at 8 p.m. Friday for more fun than you can possibly stand, DeBerry said, laughing. Discuss Print Posted in Life on Friday, August 23, 2002 12:00 am.

The commander-in-geek was clearly in his element as he stepped off Air Force One in Pittburgh and headed to the event, which showcases thrilling innovations in tech. There, a clearly delighted President fist-bumped a paralyzed man who uses a mind-controlled robotic hand, goofed around with a baby in a Nasa T-shirt and got a taste of astronaut life.  Geek power: Self-confessed science geek Barack Obama hangs out with his ten-month-old counterpart Rowan Wright at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh Thursday Space commander: Obama managed to successfully dock into the ISS using this  official flight simulator, joking that it was like driving an Uber The President beamed as he took docked a virtual shuttle into the International Space Station on a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator that had been installed at the event, held in Carnegie Mellon University. 'Your ride is here, baby,' Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. 'This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we'll be there in five minutes.' But his control of a virtual shuttle was nothing compared to Nathan Copeland's dexterity with the robotic hand protruding from his wheelchair.  Copeland, who is paralyzed, explained that he was able to use his mind to control the arm remotely, and could even feel sensation through it - making him the first person in the world to use such technology.  Hand it to him: Obama was astonished to meet Nathan Copeland (left), who is the first person to use a mind-controlled robotic arm that allows them to feel sensation  'What a story,' Obama said incredulously, before offering up a handshake and a much cooler fist-bump. But the President's cultivated air of cool was no match for the geek power on display at the show. The Harvard-trained lawyer, who has never been shy about his fascination with science and technology, gawked at a self-flying quadcopter, or mini-drone. Brass knuckles? Obama greeted Copeland, who is paralyzed, with a fist-bump - a moment of cool during his enthusiastically geeky day at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University He goofed around with ten-month-old baby Rowan Wright, whom he spotted wearing a Nasa T-shirt. And he showed short shrift for those who 'willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand' on issues like global warming. 'Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn't deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn't have worked,' Obama said.  'No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon.'

Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial plane-maker after Boeing and Airbus, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated anti-corruption regulations in sales outside Brazil. The company "is looking to finalize definitive agreements with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to resolve the allegations," it said in a statement released Wednesday. It is also in talks with Brazilian authorities to settle a local investigation, it said. Embraer's stock rose more than three percent on the New York stock exchange and 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo Thursday morning. The international corruption probe was opened after officials in the Dominican Republic allegedly accepted a $3.5 million bribe to buy eight of Embraer's Super Tucano military planes. Former Dominican defense minister Rafael Pena Antonio and three other people were arrested in August in the case. Embraer said it would give details on the settlement deals once they were complete. The company had set aside $200 million in the second quarter to settle the allegations. That helped push it into the red as it lost nearly $100 million for the quarter amid falling demand for executive jets.

Weber Published: 18:05 October 13, 2016 Fareed Rahman, Senior Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Abu Dhabi: The trade relations between the UAE and the US are strong with bilateral trade reaching $25.44 billion in 2015, an increase of 2.24 per cent from 2014, Chairman of American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Abu Dhabi told Gulf News in an interview. “The US-UAE trade relations are currently the strongest as have ever been. The UAE is the largest US export market in the Middle East surpassing Saudi Arabia, Turkey and India. This is due to a strong focus on the defence, health care, oil and gas and education sectors,” said Sharief Fahmy. The total US exports to the UAE have reached $22.98 billion (Dh84.33 billion) last year surpassing other regional trade partners including Saudi Arabia ($19.69 billion), India ($21.53 billion), Turkey ($9.56 billion) and Egypt ($4.75 billion, according to figures provided by AmCham Abu Dhabi. The top exports were transportation equipment including aircraft and commercial aviation equipment accounting for $8.7 billion. There is also a huge presence of the US companies in the UAE with the number exceeding more than 1500 in different sectors including aerospace, finance, oil and gas, health care, tourism among others. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon are some of the companies in the defence and aerospace sector. In the oil and gas, Occidental petroleum has a tie up with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) in the development of Shah gas oilfield in the Western region on Abu Dhabi and Exxon Mobil has concession agreement with Adnoc in the development of the emirate’s offshore oilfields. From the UAE side, Abu Dhabi based Mubadala has $6 billion investment in GlobalFoundries, a semiconductors manufacturer based in California. “We’ve seen consistent growth in trade between the two countries and moving forward I see the relationship strengthening further with boost in investment and trade.” With the UAE planning to diversify their economy due to drop in oil prices and the introduction of the bankruptcy law next year, the number of US companies in the UAE is likely to go up. “The introduction of bankruptcy law is going to benefit our SMEs significantly. A lot of companies will feel more secure to invest in the UAE.” The UAE bankruptcy law approved by the UAE Cabinet last month is likely to come into effect early next year. The new law will pave the way for companies in financial distress to restructure and allow the possibility of getting fresh loans under terms set by the law. When asked whether change in the guard in the US after the elections in November will have any impact on the bilateral trade relations, he said business will continue to progress irrespective of whether a democrat or a republican candidate wins the elections. “From a chamber perspective, we are non-partisan. We’ve been fortunate with Obama administration and the policies that came out in the last eight years. We expect the same spirit to continue whether it is Trump or Clinton administration.” He said the Obama administration has attached special significance to the UAE with the US administration sending invitations to Emirati companies to come and be part of the select USA Investments Summit in Washington DC in June this year. Thirteen companies represented the UAE and received special status with private meetings with the US Secretary of Commerce Pritzker, he added. Set up in 1986, AmCham Abu Dhabi is represented by more than 600 American and Emirati companies including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and big corporations with huge investments in the UAE.   More from Investment Amanat posts a net profit of Dh36.8m in 9 months Waha Capital profit down 31% to Dh82m in Q3 Iran mulls new investment rules Paris pact opens $265b business opportunities Dubai, China share big ambitions and projects Buffett cash at record as operating profit rises Early Madoff investor’s estate settles suit B.R.

With the U.K. government poised to decide on the location of a new landing strip to serve pent up demand in southeast England, Cruz said Wednesday that the case for expanding Heathrow is “overwhelming” and that any decision to focus growth on the rival Gatwick airport would be “astonishing.” British Airways, the biggest U.K. carrier, has major operations at both bases. Cruz, who became CEO of BA in April, said Heathrow should not be expanded “at any cost” and that his airline “wouldn’t react very well” if a so-called runway tax was levied against users to fund the plan, arguing that the facility’s shareholders should bear development costs. BA parent IAG SA has hubs at four other airports so that growth could easily be directed elsewhere, though there’s no question of the group abandoning Heathrow, he added. Despite the funding concerns there’s “no business case” for building a second runway at Gatwick, with insufficient demand from airlines and passengers alike, Cruz told British Air Transport Association members in his first speaking engagement since joining BA from IAG’s Vueling discount arm. “That’s why the airport’s two biggest users, ourselves and EasyJet, do not support the idea,” he said, referring to the low-cost carrier that also backs growth at Heathrow. Announcement Due Prime Minister Theresa May’s government could make an announcement on a new runway imminently, according to the British Broadcasting Corp., though other reports suggest one is more likely to come next week. Adding an extra runway would allow Heathrow to handle about 135 million passengers a year, up from 75 million now, at a cost of 18 billion pounds ($22 billion). Politicians have been debating the case for growth at Heathrow for years, with May’s predecessor David Cameron delaying a decision even when a state-appointed commission backed the airport over Gatwick after senior figures in his own Conservative Party expressed concern about the environmental impact. Cruz said that while BA is “nervous” about uncertainty created by Britain’s vote to quit the European Union, the carrier will still increase capacity next year and is set to announce new short- and long-haul routes in coming months. “We just have to get over it,” he said. “We are trying to leverage the currency situation to make Britain a desired destination. Let’s get as many Americans as we can coming to the U.K. because of the stronger dollar in comparison with the pound.” The executive said he met with Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and lobbed him to remove air passenger duty to spur traffic. Cruz reiterated that IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is known, expects to post a “significant” gain in operating profit this year, though the increase won’t match that generated in 2015 in absolute terms. Fleet Plans A capital markets day next month will make clearer the carrier’s fleet plans and any interest that London-based IAG has in taking extra planes including used Boeing Co. 777-300ERs and Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbos, he said in an interview after his speech. Willie Walsh, the group’s CEO and Cruz’s boss, said in February that he was looking at the possibility. Cruz said there is also interest in longer-range single-aisle models, Boeing’s 777X upgrade and the Airbus A330, which is performing well at the Iberia unit. The executive said June 23’s Brexit vote has “muddied the waters a bit” for U.K. airlines aiming to participate further in consolidation because it’s not clear what future rules will allow. While the EU permits mergers among carriers within the bloc, there’s a 49 percent ownership cap for outside operators. Commenting on the rescue of Britain’s Monarch Airlines Ltd. via a 165 million-pound ($202 million) injection from Greybull Capital LLP, Cruz said he was happy the carrier had survived but that the situation presented “an opportunity for some further rationalization of the market and it hasn’t happened.” The CEO praised moves toward German consolidation in the face of increasing competition from Ryanair Holdings Plc, where Air Berlin Plc plans to operate as many as 40 jets for Deutsche Lufthansa AG and is also exploring a merger of its tourism operations with the local airline division of holiday giant TUI AG. “They’re trying,” he said. “They have a huge threat, which is the big bad wolf from Ireland coming in and saying ‘we’re going to take 20 percent market share, get ready.’ For Lufthansa that’s a big threat. The sort of things they’re doing, while a bit controversial, appear to be going in the right direction.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The US Air Force is looking to replace the wings of its 235 single-seat F-15C and twin-seat F-15D aircraft as it looks to maintain the type in service through to 2045. (US Air Force) An industry day for the F-15C Service-Life Extension Program (SLEP) is being held at Robins Air Force Base (AFB) in Georgia on 13 October to consider options for the re-winging of all 235 F-15C/D aircraft in the USAF's inventory to see the type through to its projected out-of-service date of 2045. As noted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, the new wing will be the same stronger unit as that fitted to the F-15E Strike Eagle variant; be capable of 14 years of flying at current worst usage severity before needing depot-level inspections; maintain the current F-15C/D outer-mould line and existing fuselage interfaces; maintain compatibility with the original aerodynamic and structural properties; show airworthiness compliance without additional full-scale durability testing; and be compatible with all existing aircraft and weapons systems to include fuel, hydraulic, electrical, and environment control systems. Industry day briefing slides posted on the day of the event note that the USAF is looking to receive the first three production prototype wing sets in fiscal year (FY) 2020. Delivery of 10 low-rate initial production (LRIP) sets will take place in 2022, to be followed by the remaining full-rate production (FRP) wings at a rate of about 40 a year through to 2028. Companies attending the industry day comprise the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Boeing; current wing manufacturer Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI); and sub-contractors CPI Aerostructures, Yulista Aviation, Constellium, Kitco Defense, Cherokee Nation Aerospace and Defense, FQ&P Aviation Limited, and Herndon Products. A formal request for proposals (RfP) is expected to be issued in the fourth quarter of FY 2017. Want to read more?

China to dominate space within 10 YEARS as it becomes only nation with permanent orbital outpost International Space Station expected to go out of operation in a decade, leaving the People's Republic alone in space by JASPER HAMILL 13th October 2016, 12:10 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments China is expecting to dominate space within the next 10 years. A top military official has claimed the People’s Republic will be the only nation with a permanent base in space by 2024, when the America-backed International Space Station will reach the end of its life. 2 A Chinese Long March rocket and the Tiangong-1 space station, which is currently out of control and expected to hurtle back into the Earth next year Lei Fanpei, chairman of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, told Xinhua that his country “plans to launch the experimental core module of its space station around 2018 with a Long March 5 heavyload carrier rocket, and the 20 ton combination space station will be sent into orbit around 2022”. This could leave “China’s space station may be the only one left in service”, the news service reported. The International Space Station is nearing the end of its life, with no clear agreement to replace it in place. NASA has tasked Boeing with figuring out how to extend the lifespan of the ISS from 2020 to 2028, but it is not yet clear how it will achieve this. Once China’s space station is up and running by 2022, it is likely that Beijing will seek to use space in some sort of military capacity, potentially sparking an orbital arms race. Xu Qiliang, a senior Chinese air force commander, has said the militarisation of space “is a historical inevitability and a development that cannot be turned back”. “As far as the revolution in military affairs is concerned, the competition between military forces is moving towards outer space,” he told the People’s Liberation Army Daily.

Donald Trump recently said he wants to improve the US governments ability to wage war from space. The presidential candidate has said he would focus on enhancing the “combat lethality” of the military space programme. Trumps wish to focus on military aspects of the space programme may have sprung from revelations earlier this year the Chinese and Russia were developing “space weapons”. US Admiral Cecil D. Haney, commander of the US Strategic Command told an audience at the the Centre for a New American Security in January: “Adversaries and potential adversaries are developing, and in some cases demonstrating, disruptive and destructive counterspace capabilities. “Furthermore, they are exploiting what they perceive as space vulnerabilities—threatening the vital, national, civil, scientific and economic benefits to the U.S. and the global community.” A terrifying intergalactic 'blob' is on a collision course with our home galaxy We pay for your stories!

Be prepared for irreversible damage to your brain Written by Akshat Rathi Obsession Life as Laboratory October 13, 2016 Keep dreaming. (SpaceX) Share Written by Akshat Rathi Obsession Life as Laboratory October 13, 2016 You can’t go many days without someone talking about going to Mars. Just in the last few weeks: Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, laid out his plans to sell tickets to the red planet for $200,000; Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of Boeing, vowed to get there before Musk; and US president Barack Obama reiterated his plans to send humans to Mars by 2030. Before these fantasies become reality, there are many problems to overcome. One of them might be the most difficult: how to stop astronauts from suffering irreversible damage to brain functions that are crucial to completing a space mission? This damage is predicted to be caused by space radiation. When we’re on Earth, the planet’s magnetic field shields us from most of it. A spacecraft’s hull can’t provide that level of protection. The result, a 2015 study predicted, would be brain damage that would affect astronauts’ cognitive powers. The study was done on mice, who were exposed to a space-equivalent dose of radiation in the form of charged oxygen and titanium particles. Then, the mice were observed for six weeks and given a battery of cognitive tests. As Quartz reported then: When compared to mice who were not exposed to radiation, the irradiated mice performed far worse. On being shown familiar objects, these mice weren’t interested. They also lacked curiosity towards new objects. Now, the same researchers have gone a step further. They’ve observed irradiated mice for longer and looked in more detail at the sort of damage radiation can cause in the brain. In the new study, published in Scientific Reports, they find that the prefrontal cortex of the mice, which is the area of the brain responsible for making decisions and moderating social behavior, had fewer neural connections than the brains of mice who weren’t exposed. The irradiated mice were more anxious, weren’t able to control fear, and had reduced cognitive powers. Worse still, this brain damage lasted at least 24 weeks with no apparent sign of improvement. The implication is that it was probably irreversible. As Quartz reported previously: Space radiation is so harmful because its high-energy particles leave tracks of damage in cells and tissue that are difficult for the body’s repair system to fix. This occurs because the ionized particles are like bullets inside of bullets: Once the big bullet manages to enter cells or tissue, it causes further damage by firing off many more smaller bullets. Mice are not men, so the study’s results can only estimate how such radiation will affect human brains. It’s worth noting, however, that the dose of radiation used in the study (about 210 milliSieverts, equivalent to about 600 chest X-rays) is smaller than the 300 milliSieverts that NASA estimates (pdf, p. 9) humans would be exposed to during just the first six months of a mission to Mars. Adding metal shielding to spacecraft could help, but it’s prohibitively expensive. The heavier the craft, the more fuel it has to carry for launch. Another option is to take drugs that counter radiation. Perhaps the most inventive idea involves using the astronauts’ urine and feces as shielding. Water shields better against this sort of radiation than metal; the ship could store its water supply in a hull cavity that surrounds the crew quarters, and replace it with human waste as the water supply is used up, stored in special bags that extract the water out of the human waste for reuse.

In particular, the Ground Based Mid-Course Defense or GMD program is one that Huntsville impacts.  "The GMD is our ICBM defense of the homeland, and our only ICBM defense today", said Colonel (retired) Dewey Granger, who works for Boeing now.  GMD works by having a modified ICBM, called a Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) be launched towards an incoming ballistic missile and directly hitting it, called "hit to kill". THis is the equivalent of hitting a bullet with another bullet.  The actual missile was built by Orbital ATK, the warhead by Raytheon, and the command and control system was built by Northrop Grumman. But Boeing has been the prime contractor since 1998.  Right now there are between 30-44 GBI's deployed at Vandenberg AFB in California, and the plan is to reach the full level by the end of 2017.  They're operated by the 100th Missile Defense Brigade, controlled by Space and Missile Defense Command at Redstone Arsenal.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

By: Reuters | Nairobi | Published:October 13, 2016 12:51 pm Kenya Airways said KALPA’s call for a strike was unjustified, adding half-year results due to be released at the end of October would show a surge in passenger numbers and a reduction in losses. (Source: Google maps) Kenya Airways said on Thursday it will be forced to halt ticket sales unless its pilots withdraw a strike threat that has prompted cancellations by worried passengers. The pilots’ union, Kenya Airline Pilots Association (KALPA), has called for an indefinite strike from Tuesday to protest at what it describes as poor management of the airline. “The threatened action is already costing Kenya Airways significant losses as passengers have begun to make cancellations,” the airline said in a statement. “If KALPA does not forthwith retract its statement, Kenya Airways will have to immediately stop selling tickets.” Kenya Airways, which carries 12,000 passengers a day in a fleet on Boeing and Embraer planes, has been hit in recent years by falling earnings triggered by a decline in the number of visitors to Kenya. Tourism has been hurt by security worries stoked by Somali Islamist group al Shabaab’s attacks in the country, in apparent retaliation for Kenya’s military deployment in Somalia. KALPA is pressing for chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze and the chair of the airline’s board, Dennis Awori, to be fired, saying it is not confident in their ability to drive its recovery. Kenya Airways said KALPA’s call for a strike was unjustified, adding half-year results due to be released at the end of October would show a surge in passenger numbers and a reduction in losses. A strike, it said, could cause it to lose the support of financiers and suppliers that it is in negotiations with.

Samsung's woes highlight explosive limits of lithium batteries A Panasonic lithium-ion flexible battery that's just 0.55 millimeters thick: Producers are pushing to develop ever smaller batteries, but there's a safety issue. Photo: Koji Ueda Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Lithium-based batteries have been powering our portable devices for 25 years. But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology, which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. "We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane," Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light-weight, high energy Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 per cent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that "very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny." Sony, HP, Toshiba and Panasonic have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. "It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety," Tsuga said. "With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents." Greater demands Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 per cent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

But, for several reasons — including the end of the Cold War, budget constraints, or technical challenges — humans haven’t yet stepped foot on another planet. But President Obama wants to stake his legacy on that dream. In an op-ed penned for CNN, he laid out a plan to send people to Mars and return them safely to Earth by the mid-2030s. He opens the piece by describing the profound effect that space flight had on him as a child. Growing up in Hawaii, he got to see astronauts coming back to Earth from their brief forays into space. President Obama, as many other scientists, historians, and leaders before him, believes in the power of space travel to inspire and encourage generations of young people to literally reach for the stars. Citing the recent discoveries of water on several of Jupiter’s moons, new knowledge about the Martian surface pouring in each day from the Curiosity rover, and the remarkable prevalence of Earth-like circling other stars, President Obama believes that exploring space isn’t just something we should do, it’s something we have to do. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” he wrote. “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.” This sort of deep public-private partnership is emblematic of how the US tends to do its bigger projects, but this sort of collaboration is as yet unheard of in space flight. Part of that comes from the broader conflicts of interest. Governments can spend a huge amount of money ($25.4 billion, or $150 billion today for the Apollo program) on these sorts of plans. That lets agencies like NASA focus on safety and other goals that might not have a direct profit motive, but President Obama and the businesses NASA will likely be partnering with are confident that they can succeed. SpaceX’s Elon Musk revealed his own ideas for an interplanetary transport system (though we’d need to make huge advances in safety and rocket reliability to make that viable), Blue Origin managed an exceptional launch test earlier this month, and Boeing’s CEO said that he was “convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket. These are major steps in private space flight that demonstrate the sectors’ willingness to accept the tremendous upfront costs on the hopes that we might become a two planet species. That said, there’s still a lot more to be done. According to the National Research Council, the US still isn’t allocating enough public funds to achieve President Obama’s lofty goals. Even so, it’s clear President Obama wants to inspire the nation just as President Kennedy did in his 1961 “We choose to go to the Moon” speech. “Someday,” President Obama writes, “I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We’ll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we’ll know that because of the choices we make now, they’ve gone to space not just to visit, but to stay — and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.” The president is expected to further detail his plan to colonize Mars at the White House Frontier Conference later this week in Pittsburgh. There he will lay out his plan for five “frontiers of innovation” that include the personal, local, national, global, and interplanetary which are expected to include policy discussions ranging from health care to climate change and space travel.

But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. “A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way,” says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. “There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less.” On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world’s largest smartphone maker blamed “a very rare manufacturing process error” for the problems.  It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries.  Samsung says it would be “premature to speculate” on the outcome of its investigations. “We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes,” Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL), which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung’s Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire.  The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. “We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane,” Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light-weight, high-energy  Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume — making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire.  Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that “very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny”. Sony, HP Inc, Toshiba Corp and Panasonic Corp have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithiumion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. “It’s a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety,” Tsuga said.  “With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents.” Greater demands  Before the era of smartphones, users didn’t require much of their device — a few phone calls, a few SMS messages.  The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces.  And however sophisticated the materials, “they’re not 100 per cent safe and they never will be,” said Larsen, the consultant. “What we’re seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology.” But experts are divided on that point.  Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. “There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store.” Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries.  It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018. — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week The best action cams for winter sports Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Xbox at 15: Five of the very best original games Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Apple now sells refurbished iPhones China unveils first satellite smartphone Samsung apologises for Galaxy Note phones in US ads Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Two killed as powerful earthquake hits New Zealand Reuters Video: Trump picks Priebus as White House chief of staff Reuters Video: Supermoon rises in Spain Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Related Articles Samsung’s folding smartphone could be taking shape Samsung ads on Note 7 fires: We are truly sorry South Korea’s Park willing to relinquish some power Samsung raided over probe into South Korea political scandal Samsung set to launch AI assistant service for Galaxy S8 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this weekend Entertainment 'Robot Revolution' at Philly's Franklin Institute: See the future Robot Revolution, the new exhibit at the Franklin Institute, features more than 40 cutting edge robots. (CONTRIBUTED PHOTO / The Franklin Institute) Kathy Lauer-WilliamsContact ReporterOf The Morning Cal From robots that can do surgey to robots that can take on dangerous search and rescue missions, the most innov Standing in front of Cube Solver, one of 40 cutting-edge robots in a new exhibit at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, I twisted and turned a Rubik's Cube, jumbling the colors as fast as I could. After I returned it to the display, Cube Solver picked up the cube with its robotic arm. After flipping it around several times to examine every face of the cube, it started twisting and turning it. Eighteen seconds later the cube was solved, all faces matching in color. It's just one example of the amazing capabilities of today's robots. Across the room is Baxter, a robot whose face is a screen displaying hooded eyes that watch as it play tic-tac-toe with visitors. Baxter, developed to work alongside humans in factories, can even play two people simultaneously. From robots that can do surgery to robots that can take on dangerous search and rescue missions, the most innovative are on display in "Robot Revolution." The exhibit features robots curated from companies and universities across the world. More than half of the contraptions are interactive or can be operated. Many have rarely been seen in public.

Leonard Cohen was a singer-songwriter who produced and performed music up until his death on Nov. 7, 2016. "This exhibit shows the depth and bredth of robotics," says Larry Dubinski, president of Franklin Institute. "It is an ever-growing field and people want to learn more and engage more." It is the East Coast debut for the show which Dubinski says offers "the most compelling examples of robots today." It is was developed by the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, and is supported by Google.org, the charitable arm of Google, and The Boeing Company. John Beckham, curator and "chief robot hunter," says he helped hand-pick the machines. He describes them as the most "advanced and exciting robots from Japan to Poland to China." "The exhibit shows the amazing things robots can do for us and what they will do in the future," he says. "This is an unprecedented collection that showcases a diverse range of skills." The exhibit is organized into four sectors, each focusing on various aspects of robotics: Cooperation, Skills, Smarts and Locomotion. In the Smarts area, visitors see how machines are able to sense, plan and then act, while comparing and contrasting the ways in which humans and robots learn. In a simulation of a Google self-driving car, visitors can experience a drive, learn how the car operates using LiDAR sensors that assess road conditions and "see" obstacles in 360 degrees. Robotis-OP can follow a person's face and make "eye" contact using its visual tracking software. Visitors can see how a Roomba robotic vaccuum works and try out simple coding with a friendly robot guide. In the Skills area, visitors learn about the skills robots possess that mimic human capabilities. There are numerous types of "grippers" that pick up objects to try out. One demonstrates how robots can select and sort items with precision and speed by picking up M&Ms and sorting them by color. A five fingered gripping hand has nine motors and 20 joints and a bionic arm was inspired by the structure of an elephant trunk A humorous looking "two-armed bandit" robot will even challenge visitors to a game of blackjack. In the Cooperation area, visitors see robots that can enhance the lives of humans. The most adorable is Paro, a therapeutic fuzzy baby seal robot which has sensors that respond to touch. Pet it and it moves and makes a crying sound. Paro has been used with people suffering from dementia in nursing homes and hospitals in Australia, Europe, the U.S. and Japan. One display shows off the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic system through which surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery for a wide range of operations.

But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL), which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. "We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane," Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. LIGHT-WEIGHT, HIGH ENERGY Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a U.S. chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that "very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny." Sony, HP Inc, Toshiba Corp and Panasonic Corp have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. "It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety," Tsuga said. "With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents." GREATER DEMANDS Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

Chuck Edwards are running to represent the 48th N.C. Senate District, which takes in all of Henderson and Transylvania counties and several Buncombe County communities just north of the Buncombe-Henderson line, including Arden, Avery's Creek, Bent Creek and Upper Hominy. Norm Bossert Party: Democrat Home: Pisgah Forest Current job: Principal, Black Mountain Elementary School Experience: Is in his 44th year as a professional educator with 27 of those years spent as a classroom teacher Education: B.S. in elementary education, Old Dominion University; masters in school administration, Western Carolina University Age: 65 What would be your top priorities over the next two years? My top priorities will be to restore the public school budget and stop the downward spiral of our public education system. ... Protect our environment: Encouraging alternative energy sources, ending the notion of offshore drilling and fracking. Holding corporations (such as Duke Power) accountable for the cleanup of their coal ash mess. … Jobs in Transylvania County, and working with local officials to create affordable housing options throughout the 48th District. Require a living wage to be phased in so that people need not be beholden to public services.  Create 23,000 jobs statewide by expanding Medicaid. What, if anything, do you think the state should do next on House Bill 2? Repeal, repeal, repeal!  All citizens are entitled to equal protection under the law. Writing discrimination into the law is unacceptable!  … The intrusion of state government into a local governing body’s ability to pass lawful ordinances is unacceptable. What steps should state government take to grow the North Carolina economy? Let’s start by repealing HB2! After that, incentivize manufacturers (for a period of time and with cooperative agreements with local government) to come here. Let’s get back to economic growth zones that seek out businesses to come to our community. For example … a team of people could visit with Boeing, or BMW, to find niche industries that could help them and us. We should work, too, to be certain that our infrastructure is up to date and available for industry. Over the last four years, the state has reduced some taxes and shifted more of the tax burden from income to sales taxes. What is your view of this trend and should it continue? Everyone should pay their fair share. Every corporation should pay its fair share. Right now, the fees and service taxes (and sales taxes) our state is using to raise the revenue they need for their $22 Billion budget falls unfairly (in terms of percentage of income) on the backs of our middle income and lower income families. Not fair! The state will do whatever it needs to reach its revenue goals. I think corporations and the uber rich need to share fairly in raising these funds. What are the next steps you think the state should take regarding education? We need to empower our school board to make more local decisions on such matters as the school calendar. We need to reinstate pay for teachers completing advanced degree work. We need to restore due process protections by reinstating career status. We need to increase per pupil expenditures to 2010 numbers. We need to reinstate our teacher scholarship program. … We need to get up to date textbooks in our classrooms and build a requirement to study civics back into the curriculum. We need to do away with vouchers. We need, too, to put all charter schools under the aegis of our school boards. ... Chuck Edwards Party: Republican Home: Flat Rock Current job: Appointed as state senator in August, owner of McDonald's franchises and other businesses, bank director Experience: Edwards said he has "extensive business experience from starting my own business and growing it by a multiple of 10 to a strong reputation of business, economic, and community involvement." Education: West Henderson High School graduate, studied business curriculum at Blue Ridge Community College Age: 56 What would be your top priorities over the next two years? Growing our state’s economy in a way that good paying jobs are available for our citizens, our children, and future generations should be among our top priorities. We must have a strong economy to fuel our inevitable population growth, and to afford us the ability to provide key government services -- such as to provide raises to teachers and ensure we have adequate transportation funding. My real world experiences are as a business owner and by working alongside organizations whose top priorities are to drive our economy. I have learned the skills needed to help build a strong economy. What, if anything, do you think the state should do next on House Bill 2? HB2 was in response to the Charlotte city ordinance that effectively makes it illegal to distinguish women’s bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms from those of men. The situation created by Charlotte lacks common sense and decency. The leaders of that city should be called upon to rescind their action that created such division among our citizens. What steps should state government take to grow the North Carolina economy? “Get out of the way, and we’ll figure it out” was the response a local farmer recently replied when I asked him that exact question while touring his greenhouses. N.C. has created a bureaucracy of over 21,000 burdensome regulations on businesses and many of them prevent jobs from being created. Additionally, we must keep the costs of doing business and our taxes lower than our neighboring states. We must be sure our education system is adequately preparing our youth for skilled jobs that employers today require. We must be known as the friendliest state to small businesses. Over the last four years, the state has reduced some taxes and shifted more of the tax burden from income to sales taxes. What is your view of this trend and should it continue? We know broadening the tax base while reducing rates on working families and small businesses will put more money in our citizens’ pockets, provide relief for job creators, and create a more stable revenue source to fund key state priorities like infrastructure and public schools. We need to do whatever is necessary to continue creating a business-friendly tax climate that is conducive to investment and unshackles the entrepreneurial spirit of private sector job creators. What are the next steps you think the state should take regarding education? Our children deserve an education system that is designed to serve their needs, not that of a state-run bureaucracy. I don’t believe the existing administrative structure in our state is properly serving that purpose and my fresh perspective will be essential. We should not spend valuable tax dollars trying to make the system what we wish it would have been in the past. More autonomy should be granted to local school boards and parents. More monies spent should make it into the classrooms where they are most needed, and we must ask where the lottery money is going.

(Image from SpaceX presentation) SoCal Aerospace Companies Could Power Obama’s Mars Vision Times of San Diego Southern California aerospace companies are poised to be major beneficiaries of President Obama’s vision for public-private colonization of Mars in the next decades. In an op-ed published on CNN.com Tuesday, Obama outlined a vision for what he called the “Mars generation.” “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth,” he wrote, “with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” Companies like General Atomics in San Diego, which makes compact nuclear reactors that could power settlements, and SpaceX in Los Angeles, which builds rocket boosters, would be among the key private companies involved. Obama said his administration’s encouragement of private investment in space technology is paying off with significant new business for American companies “Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it,” he wrote. “More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.” He noted that within the next two years, both SpaceX and Boeing will begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station on private rockets. __________________________ Freedoms Park, New York, a memorial to President Franklin D.

(Credit: San Diego Museum of Art) Louis Kahn: The Power of Architecture A retrospective of the world-renowned architect’s work The San Diego Museum of Art welcomes “Louis Kahn: The Power of Architecture,” the first retrospective of the American architect’s work in two decades. On view Nov. 5 through Jan. 31, 2017, the exhibition presents over 200 objects related to Louis Kahn’s selected buildings and projects in the form of architectural models, plans, original drawings, photographs, films and more. The late Louis Kahn is regarded as one of the leading architects of the 20th century. With complex spatial compositions and a mastery of light, Kahn created buildings of dignified beauty and powerful universal symbolism, believing buildings should be monumental and spiritually inspiring. Among his most famous architectural works are the Salk Institute in La Jolla; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas; and the National Assembly Building in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Kahn was an esteemed lecturer and professor at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania for many years; however, he did not experience his international breakthrough as an architect until he was nearly 60 years old, as his early work in the 1940s and ’50s was devoted to residential building and urban planning.

Homes on the tour range from a historic 1930s bungalow in Kensington to a Downtown San Diego condo given a “modern glam” aesthetic to a Carlsbad home updated and transformed for aging in place. The tour will also include the personal residence of the new ASID San Diego Chapter President Lena Brion, who created a timeless look for her 1980s tract home in Vista. “This tour shows how designers can create beautiful interiors while working within the budgets, lifestyles, and tastes of homeowners,” said Lu Costigan, industry partner and co-chair of the event. Tour sites are located in the San Diego communities of  Downtown and Kensington and the North County communities of Carlsbad, Oceanside and Vista. Tickets, priced at $25, are available at ASIDSanDiego.org.  Tickets will also be available at all tour sites the day of the tour and addresses will be posted on the ASID San Diego website the day of the tour.  Information is available at (858) 566-3345. __________________________ Election Officials Mail 1 Million Ballots for Nov. 8 General Election By City News Service County elections officials sent out around 1 million mail ballots, which could begin arriving at the homes of registered voters around the San Diego region as soon as Tuesday. Considering the length of the ballot — which fills the front and back of two cards — voters are asked to return them as soon as they can. “If you know how you want to vote, grab that mail ballot when you get it, vote it and send it back in right away,” said Registrar of Voters Michael Vu. “The sooner we get the ballot back, the sooner we can start processing it so it will be counted right when the polls close at 8 p.m. on Nov. 8.” Because it’s so big this year, the postage to mail each ballot is 67 cents, according to Vu. Registered voters have until Nov. 1 to request a mail ballot.

North America is the major revenue-generating regional market and would continue to be the leader until 2022. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) would continue to be the most consumed raw material for manufacturing CFRP during the analysis period. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140911/647229 ) Summary of the CFRP Market Report can be accessed on the website at https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastic-cfrp-market The CFRP market is driven by the increasing demand for lightweight products in the automotive industry and growing need of high-performance products in the aerospace & defense industry. Aerospace & defense projects such as Boeing and Airbus are the primary drivers for growth and development of the CFRP market. Structural material in aircraft such as paneling interiors are made using CFRP products. Excellent mechanical properties such as high tensile strength, fuel efficiency, impact resistance, and reliability make them ideal for use in the aerospace & defense industry. CFRP, being the lightweight material, would improve fuel consumption. Furthermore, the increase in number of electric vehicles fuels the need for CFRP products in the automotive industry. CFRP products are employed in the manufacture of hoods, wheels, front gearing, spars, wings, root, fairings, nacelle, flight controls, and engines in different industries such as automotive & defense and wind turbines. However, high costs of CFRP and long production cycles is expected to restrain the market growth. The thermosetting segment accounted for more than two-thirds of the market revenue in 2015 and would continue to lead the market until 2022. This was attributed to its mechanical properties such as tensile strength, compressive strength, hardness, and temperature independence. Thermosetting resins are mostly applicable in high-temperature applications, such as encapsulations, as they retain their mechanical properties over a wide range of temperature. The epoxy resin segment accounted for more than 60% share in global thermosetting CFRP market, in terms of both market volume and revenue, in 2015. The polyester resin and Vinyl resin thermosetting CFRP market segments exhibit potential growth opportunities during the forecast period. The consumption of vinyl resin thermosetting CFRP was about 7,708 tons in 2015 and would reach 15,010 tons by 2022, growing at CAGR of 10%. Pultrusion & winding is the most commonly adopted manufacturing process as the process generates high production volumes in minimal time; approximately 23,565 tons CFRP was manufactured using this process in 2015. The aerospace & defense industry generates the highest revenue, which generated about $5,576 million revenue in 2014. Eswara Prasad, Team Lead Chemical Research at Allied Market Research states that, "CFRP material would substitute metals in various automotive applications, primarily to reduce fuel consumption. This rise in demand for lightweight CFRP products in automotive industry to set new trends in the market". Key findings of the study North America is expected to continue to lead the market throughout 2014-2022 in terms of revenue, followed by Asia-Pacific. Thermosetting CFRP market volume is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.3%. Wet lamination & infusion is the fastest growing manufacturing process used for CFRP production, in terms of revenue, with a CAGR of 9.2%. Polyacylonitrile (PAN) raw material segment accounted for the largest share in the CFRP market by raw material, both in terms of volume and revenue, in 2015. Polyester resin is projected to grow at the highest CAGR of 8.5%, in terms of revenue. PEEK segment accounted for the largest share in thermoplastic CFRP market, both in terms of volume and revenue, in 2015. North America and Asia-Pacific collectively contributed more than two-thirds share to the market revenue in 2015. In the same year, Asia-Pacific dominated the market, in terms of volume, owing to increased demand for CFRP products in the automotive and sports industry. Japan and China dominated the Asia-Pacific CFRP market as the leading manufacturers of low tow carbon are headquartered in these countries. The emerging markets of the developing countries such as South Korea, India, and Taiwan are expected to grow at the highest rates due to increasing demand for CFRP products in numerous industries.

Hemal Vora First Posted: Oct 12, 2016 05:54 AM EDT Elon Musk and SpaceX are not the only ones planning such an expedition, Boeing, and NASA are in the race too. But what is the real cost of a trip to mars? (Photo : Brendan Smialowski / Getty Images) At the 67th International Astronautical Congress, and Elon Musk had revealed the SpaceX's indentations of colonization of mars and build a city on mars. Elon Musk and SpaceX are not the only ones planning such an expedition, Boeing, and NASA are in the race too. Advertisement But what is the cost of a trip to mars? Not financially but healthwise. There are millions of volunteers who are ready for a one way trip to mars. There are people who don't mind dying on or on the way to mars. But it is still worth knowing what will a trip to mars cost. Scientists at the University of California-Irvine have conducted a study to research a condition they call as "space brain." Astronauts will be exposed to high energy cosmic rays with charged particles that represent a GCR. Since the particles are high energy they would easily penetrate the spacecraft and enter the tissues of the human body. The real cost of a trip to mars could be a long term cognitive dysfunction if the results of recent experiments on the rodents are to be believed. Rodents exposed to cosmic radiation exhibit performance decrements pertaining to persistent hippocampal and cortical functions. "Exposure to these particles can lead to a range of potential central nervous system complications that can occur during and persist long after actual space travel," said UCI professor of radiation oncology, Charles Limoli, as reported in Cnet. The irradiation also caused significant reductions in spine density, dendritic complexity, and altered spine morphology. Cosmic radiation also disrupted synaptic integrity and increased neuroinflammation that persisted more than 6 months after exposure. Advertisement The real cost of a trip to mars would also be a decreased "fear extinction." The Astronauts who return from mars would not be able to overcome simple fears arising out of an untoward incident. Although amid all these rising fears about irradiations, Elon Musk,said, The radiation thing is often brought up, but I think it's not too big of a deal." With a long way to go before a trip to mars becomes a reality it would be in best interests of mankind to figure out the real cost of a trip to mars.

Tech entrepreneur and founder of a private space-exploration firm, Elon Musk announced in September he intended to send people to Mars. He also outlined a philosophy that would see humans become a multi-planet species. Not content to just have people visit the Red Planet, Musk envisions sending a million people to live there by the end of the century. His technical ambitions are impressive: he plans to start sending transports carrying 100 people per trip to Mars within the next decade, using and reusing a transportation system including a rocket 3½ times as powerful as NASA’s biggest, the Saturn V. Far from scoffing at the prospect, observers are taking Musk seriously — and so they should. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has already announced his company will get a human to Mars before Musk’s does. Underlying the scope of such an undertaking is a bigger question, though: why go? Humans have a long history of colonizing, in many waves, whether it’s through Africa, Eurasia, Australia, the Pacific or the Americas — in fact, settling everywhere on this planet except possibly Antarctica. But the prospect of not just going to Mars, but staying there, raises the question: do we need another planet? Based on the way we’ve been treating this one, it’s a question worth considering. Greenhouse gas emissions have led to a troubling milestone for our atmosphere: this year, for the first time on record, carbon did not drop below 400 parts per million. All evidence points to the fact that not only is our climate changing, but the seven billion humans on this planet have something to do with it. Mars, from what we know, is inhospitable to human life. A colony could thrive there as long as people are protected from the environment and would require the best in technology to achieve it. Why then shouldn’t the Earth, currently the only planet we have, get the same kind of respect? Should the climate change drastically — and it could, to a sort not seen since before humans walked the Earth — we may find things pretty inhospitable here, too. Science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson predicted this 20 years ago in his landmark novel "Red Mars." As settlement on the Red Planet turned to efforts to manipulate its climate to become more Earth-like so people could live on the surface without spacesuits, runaway climate change on Earth caused problems there. In describing the irony, one of the characters remarked the best and brightest had to turn their efforts to making Earth inhabitable as well. Thankfully, we’re not at that point yet. And with inventors like Musk still actively believing that change is possible, perhaps there is still hope. While Musk has set his sights on the Red Planet, he has not ignored this one. The South African-born Canadian-American is not only the founder and CEO of SpaceX, but also the co-founder, CEO and product architect of automaker Tesla Motors — which is famous for its mass production of electric cars —and the co-founder of SolarCity, a California company that designs and installs solar power systems. Certainly the road to saving Earth’s environment will not be easy, and we need our politicians and our citizenry to be on board, just as much as our scientists and engineers. We need more men like Musk who have the ability to dream and think big and understand that change in our lifestyles and economies as a necessity. The effort to settle on Mars will be a feat of human ingenuity, engineering and creativity — the same rigour that will be required to save this planet as well. After all, it’s home. » Winnipeg Free Press & The Brandon Sun Republished from the Brandon Sun print edition October 12, 2016 Print E–mail Tweet Report Error Rate this This article has not yet been rated.

Jordan Jaffe, Spectre's CEO and co-founder, commented "Demand for express freighters is at an all-time high, with hundreds more required in the coming years to meet the demand created by rapid growth in e-commerce and expansion of the global middle class. The classic freighter feedstock is becoming increasingly scarce and overly expensive for their age. We intend to leverage our ability to purchase in fleet-sized transactions to offer next-generation freighters with attractive economics. Spectre's order means that 737-700 and 737-800 freighters will be available on a turnkey basis for lease and purchase to forward-thinking customers beginning from Q1 2017 (-700F) and Q3 2017 (-800F), with Spectre taking the attendant technical, financial and schedule risks inherent with aircraft acquisition and PTF modification programs such as these."

Trading activity is likely to be somewhat subdued, however, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The minutes of the meeting may attract more attention than usual, as last month's decision to leave interest rates unchanged was far from unanimous. Reflecting division within the central bank, Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren voted to raise rates by a quarter point. U.S. stocks fell sharply on Tuesday amid a pullback in oil prices and a rough start to the third quarter earnings season following Alcoa's (AA) weaker than expected results. The major averages opened lower and declined steadily until late trading before moving sideways around the lower levels. The Dow Industrials lost 200.38 points or 1.09 percent before ending at a 2-week low of 18,129, the S&P 500 Index ended down 26.93 points or 1.24 percent at a 3-week low of 2,137 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,247, down 81.89 points to 1.54 percent. Twenty-six of the thirty Dow components ended the session lower and one stock ended unchanged, while the remaining three stocks advanced. Merck (MRK), UnitedHealth (UNH), Intel (INTC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP) and Boeing (BA) were among the biggest decliners among the Dow components. The market witnessed broad based weakness, with gold, housing, semiconductor and biotechnology stocks spearheading the losses. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are inching up $0.02 to $50.81 a barrel after sliding $0.56 to $50.79 a barrel in the previous session. The previous session's pullback came amid the release of the IEA's monthly oil market report, which showed an increase in OPEC production in September. Some price drag also came from profit taking following Monday's rally. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold for December delivery is currently trading at $1,254.40, down $1.50 from the previous session's close of $1,255.90. On Tuesday, gold fell $4.50. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.91 yen compared to the 103.51 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1023 compared to yesterday's $1.1054. Asia Most Asian markets retreated, tracking the weak lead from Wall Street overnight. The Singaporean and Japanese markets led the retreat in the region, although the South Korean and Taiwanese markets notched modest gains. The Japanese market retreated as the yen sell-off stalled. The Nikkei 225 Index opened lower and moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session. The index ended down 184.76 points or 1.09 percent at 16,840. Food, retail, textile, chemical, pharma, resource, financial, real estate, export and utility stocks all came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index also languished below the unchanged line, although amid some volatility. The index ended 7 points or 0.13 percent lower at 5,555. Material, IT and energy stocks were among the worst hit, but financial, healthcare, telecom and real estate stocks found some strength. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 23,407, down 142.47 points or 0.60 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite ended down 6.75 points or 0.22 percent at 3,059. On the economic front, data released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that core machinery orders fell 2.2 percent month-over-month in August, smaller than the 4.6 percent drop expected by economists. Annually, orders rose a better than expected 11.6 percent. The results of a survey by Westpac showed that confidence among consumers in Australia rose in October, with the corresponding index rising 1.1 percent to 102.4. Europe European stocks opened lower and showed volatility in early trading. The major averages in the region are currently in the red. In corporate news, gold miner Fresnillo reported higher third quarter gold production and said it is on track to meet its fiscal year production guidance. On the economic front, the German Federal Statistical Office reported that wholesale prices in Germany fell at a slower annual rate in September, with the 0.3 percent drop the slowest since July 2013. A report released by Eurostat showed industrial production in the euro area rising more than expected in August, both sequentially and year-over-year. France's inflation doubled as initially estimated in September, final data from statistical office Insee showed. Consumer prices advanced 0.4 percent annually, faster than the 0.2 percent increase seen in August. This was the fastest growth since October 2014, when inflation was 0.5 percent. U.S. Economic Reports Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George is scheduled to give a speech about payment systems at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's Annual Payment Symposium at 9:40 am ET. The speech will be followed by an audience Q&A. The Treasury Department is set to announce the results of its auctions of 3-year and 10-year notes at 1 pm ET. At 2 pm ET, the Federal Reserve is due to release the minutes of the September FOMC meeting, when the Fed chose to stand pat. Stocks in Focus Shares of Ericsson (ERIC) are likely to come under pressure in early trading after the mobile networking company warned its third quarter results will be significantly lower than expectations. Cybersecurity company Fortinet (FTNT) may also see early weakness after lowering its guidance for third quarter earnings and revenues. On the other hand, shares of Voxx International (VOXX) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the consumer electronics company reported a second quarter profit compared to a year-ago loss. PC makers are likely to be in focus after Gartner announced that worldwide PC shipments totaled 68.9 million units, a 5.7 percent year-over-year drop. This marked the 8th consecutive quarterly decrease. Lenovo was the leader of the pack, as it increased its market share to 20.9 percent from 20.2 percent in the year-ago quarter, although unit shipments fell 2.4 percent. HP Inc. (HPQ) grew its shipments by 2.3 percent and increased its market share by 1.6 percentage points to 20.4 percent. Dell also saw market share and unit shipment growth. Apple (AAPL) saw a 13.4 percent slump in shipment growth and lost share. Nasdaq announced that Shire (SHPG) will become a component of the NASDAQ-100 Index and the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index prior to the market open on October 19, 2016. Packaging Corp. of America (PKG) announced an agreement to buy substantially all the assets of Columbus Container for $100 million in cash. With the deal, the company expects its containerboard integration levels to increase by over 30,000 tons. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Top Stories Asian Markets Mostly Lower AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary VP-Elect Pence To Take Over As Head Of Trump Transition Team Airlines Struggle With Computer Glitch Trump To Drop Out Of Trans-Pacific Partnership Within First 100 Days Gohmert Says Congress Can Help Fund Border Wall Singles Day: Alibaba Sales Skyrocket Pence Holds "Warm And Professional" Meeting With Biden Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy GrubHub CEO: I Did Not Tell Trump Supporters To Quit U.S. Consumer Sentiment Rebounds To Six-Month High In November Trump Victory Inspires Mixed Feelings Of Fear And Relief <<Previous        138 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

By Weston Williams, Staff October 11, 2016 Save for later Saved An evenly layered rock, photographed by NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover, suggests bodies of liquid water on Mars. NASA released the image on Dec. 9, 2014. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of The Martian rover Opportunity is making another historic first on the surface of Mars. The highly successful probe will spend the next two years exploring a Martian gully that scientists suspect may have been carved out by an ancient water source. The mission is the latest challenge for the aging rover, which was originally intended to function for three months and is now in its 13th year. Data gathered by Opportunity and similar rovers have shaped an ever-greater understanding of Mars. As NASA, Boeing, and SpaceX all set their sights on human missions to Mars in coming decades, they will depend on this data to help them know what to expect when they touch down on an alien planet for the first time. Recommended:In Pictures Exploring Mars with rovers Curiosity and Opportunity When Opportunity and its companion rover, Spirit, landed on Mars in 2004, their missions were expected to last only 90 Martian days (about 92.4 Earth days). Both probes far surpassed these estimates, with Spirit finally dying in 2010, and Opportunity still going strong. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! In Pictures Exploring Mars with rovers Curiosity and Opportunity Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend With Opportunity's newest mission, NASA hopes to find evidence that liquid water created the gully, located in in the "Bitterroot Valley" portion of the western rim of the Endeavour Crater. "Fluid-carved gullies on Mars have been seen from orbit since the 1970s, but none had been examined up close on the surface before," said Opportunity principal investigator Steve Squyres of Cornell University in a statement. "One of the three main objectives of our new mission extension is to investigate this gully. We hope to learn whether the fluid was a debris flow, with lots of rubble lubricated by water, or a flow with mostly water and less other material," he explained. The mission faces a few hurdles. Opportunity is an old rover, and its now-outdated flash memory for holding data overnight no longer functions properly, meaning that scientists have to beam information to Earth immediately or risk losing it forever. That could be complicated by a threatened  global dust storm on the planet as soon as October 29th. Recommended:In Pictures Mars Spirit rover: What a long-range trip it's been "Once in awhile, several storms will start up at once and they will blow up larger and larger until they basically cover the entire planet," James Shirley, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Pasadena Star-News. "They’re probably the most spectacular weather event that we can see in the solar system. I don’t think there’s really anything like it anywhere else." The last storm, in 2007, was one of the first major threats to Spirit and Opportunity. "We had to take special measures to enable their survival for several weeks with little sunlight to keep them powered," recalled John Callas, project manager for Spirit and Opportunity, in a statement. "Each rover powered up only a few minutes each day, enough to warm them up, then shut down to the next day without even communicating with Earth. For many days during the worst of the storm, the rovers were completely on their own." If the global dust storm does occur, the aging Opportunity might have trouble continuing its mission. But NASA is confident enough in the probe to approve the mission extension that will take the rover all the way to the bottom of the 14-mile-wide Endeavor Crater. "We have now exceeded the prime-mission duration [of Opportunity] by a factor of 50," said Opportunity project manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a statement. "Milestones like this are reminders of the historic achievements made possible by the dedicated people entrusted to build and operate this national asset for exploring Mars."

The order by Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliners. The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing’s 787 order tally for the year. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from commercial banks, the Guangzhou, China-based airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group SE in the past year as more people fly in the world’s most populous nation. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an order for 300 jets valued at $38 billion on a state visit to the U.S. as Chinese carriers expand their fleet in a nation set to become the biggest travel market in two decades. China Southern, the country’s first Boeing 787 customer, already flies 16 Dreamliners on operating and financial lease, according to data the airline released in August. The carrier had a total fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world’s largest aviation market. Boeing had netted 19 orders for the Dreamliner this year prior to Qatar’s announcement, bringing total sales for the plane to 1,161. Airbus netted 25 sales of the A350, its most advanced jetliner, through the end of September. Both planemakers have contended with slowing demand for widebody aircraft as moderating fuel prices and a glut of used Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 models tempers demand.

The White House was calling attention to government contracts awarded to six companies to build prototypes for “habitats” that could sustain human life in deep space. One such privately developed habitat — an inflatable room — is already attached to the International Space Station. Obama also said that within two years, private companies like SpaceX and Boeing will taxi astronauts to the space station with NASA as a customer. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth, something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars,” Obama wrote in an op-ed on CNN’s website. He said the ultimate goal is for humans eventually to stay on the red planet “for an extended time”. NASA officials and outside space experts said there is little new in what’s coming out of the White House on Mars, something NASA has taken to calling its “Journey To Mars”. “There’s nothing big here at all, unless you haven’t been paying attention,” said former George Washington University Space Policy Chief John Logsdon. “It’s a refocusing of the fact that he set these goals and NASA has been pursuing them.” Alan Ladwig, a former top NASA official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said he likes the intent, “but it’s a bit late in the term to shine a light on the humans to Mars exploration”. The president planned to discuss the initiative further when he meets with scientists, engineers and academics at an innovation summit Thursday in Pittsburgh. Obama first set a goal in 2010 to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, but the initiative has attracted little attention since then. Numerous Government Accountability Office reports have warned of the challenges in meeting that goal, most notable a lack of substantial US government funding. Obama did not elaborate on what a Mars mission would cost or how the US would pay for it. But he said it will require years of patience, testing and education. “The question is why and how does this support US national interests,” said Scott Pace, a NASA associate administrator during the George W Bush administration and space policy chief at George Washington University. He said returning to the moon instead of going to Mars makes more sense for both commerce and international cooperation. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1.

Will the beautiful game ever be the same? Over the last two years, Beijing’s top planners have worked to morph the nation into a “soccer powerhouse” to complement its rising economic clout. The campaign is well underway with China Inc. purchasing France’s FC Sochaux-Montbeliard, Spain’s RCD Espanyol, Italy’s AC Milan...

(NASA via AP) By JOSH LEDERMAN and SETH BORENSTEIN, Associated Press Published: October 11, 2016, 11:06 PM A   A WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama sought Tuesday to reinvigorate his six-year-old call for the U.S. to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, a mission NASA has been slowly trudging away at. The White House was calling attention to government contracts awarded to six companies to build prototypes for “habitats” that could sustain human life in deep space. One such privately developed habitat — an inflatable room — is already attached to the International Space Station. Obama also said that within two years, private companies like SpaceX and Boeing will taxi astronauts to the space station with NASA as a customer. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth, something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars,” Obama wrote in an op-ed on CNN’s website. He said the ultimate goal is for humans eventually to stay on the red planet “for an extended time.” NASA officials and outside space experts said there is little new in what’s coming out of the White House on Mars, something NASA now calls its “Journey To Mars.” “There’s nothing big here at all, unless you haven’t been paying attention,” said former George Washington University space policy chief John Logsdon. “It’s a re-focusing of the fact that he set these goals and NASA has been pursuing them.” The president planned to discuss the initiative further when he meets with scientists, engineers and academics at an innovation summit Thursday in Pittsburgh. Obama first set a goal in 2010 to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, but the initiative has attracted little attention since then. Numerous Government Accountability Office reports have warned of the challenges in meeting that goal, most notable a lack of substantial U.S. government funding Obama did not elaborate on what a Mars mission would cost or how the U.S. would pay for it. But he said it will require years of patience, testing and education. “The question is why and how does this support U.S. national interests,” said Scott Pace, a NASA associate administrator during the George W. Bush administration and space policy chief at George Washington University. He said returning to the moon instead of going to Mars makes more sense for both commerce and international cooperation.

NASA Takes Next Step in Green Aviation X-planes Plans by Jim Banke for NASA Aeronautics News Washington DC (SPX) Oct 12, 2016 Lockheed Martin's hybrid wing body concept. Image courtesy Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company. For a larger version of this image please go here. At the 39th meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization, 191 countries reached a global climate deal to reduce carbon emissions from aviation. At the same time, NASA is working to create new experimental aircraft that will demonstrate new "green aviation" technology intended to dramatically reduce fuel use, emissions and noise - with the goal of cutting emissions from the nation's commercial aircraft fleet by more than 50 percent, while also reducing perceived noise levels near airports to one-half the level of the quietest aircraft flying today. To that end, NASA recently awarded six-month contracts to four companies, who will each define the technical approach, schedule, and cost for one or more large-scale, subsonic X-plane concepts. These concepts are in support of NASA's ultra-efficient subsonic transport research goals. The companies are Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation of Manassas, VA; Dzyne Technologies Incorporated of Fairfax, VA; Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company of Ft. Worth, TX; and The Boeing Company of Hazelwood, MO. "Engaging these contractors now to gather this information will help us move forward efficiently and expeditiously when we're ready to commit to building the X-planes themselves," said Ed Waggoner, NASA's Integrated Aviation Systems Program director. Each company is to detail their specific X-plane system requirements for a piloted experimental aircraft capable of sustained, two to three hours of powered high subsonic flight, as well as conducting at least two research flight sorties per week over the course of a year-long program. The requested information is to be built around a plan that would see the selected experimental aircraft eventually flying no later than 2021. NASA's return to flying large-scale X-plane technology demonstrators - a staple of its aeronautical research heritage - is part of New Aviation Horizons, an ambitious 10-year accelerated research plan developed and announced by NASA earlier this year. The five X-plane concepts envisioned for possible further development and the contractor responsible for providing NASA with the required information include: + Aurora Flight Services for the D8 "Double Bubble," a twin-aisle, largely composite airliner in which the fuselage is shaped to provide lift - enabling smaller wings - and the jet engines are mounted atop the rear tail area, which takes advantage of the air flow over the aircraft to both improve engine efficiency and reduce noise in the cabin and on the ground below. + Dzyne Technologies for a smaller regional jet-sized aircraft that features a blended wing body (BWB) design in which the lines of a traditional tube and wing airliner are shaped to become one continuous line in which the seam between the wing and fuselage is nearly indistinguishable. As an aerodynamic shape, this configuration increases lift and reduces drag. + Lockheed Martin for its Hybrid Wing Body, which includes features of the BWB on the forward part of the fuselage but has a more conventional looking T-shaped tail, with its jet engines mounted on the side of the hull but above the blended wing. Increased lift, reduced drag and quieter operations are all potential benefits. + Boeing for both its BWB concept - versions of which the company has flight tested with its subscale X-48 program in partnership with NASA - and a Truss-Braced Wing concept, which features a very long, aerodynamically efficient wing that is held up on each side by a set of trusses connecting the fuselage to the wing. Otherwise the aircraft appears more conventional than the other X-plane concepts under consideration. Preliminary design work already has begun on a half-scale X-plane called the Quiet Supersonic Technology, or QueSST, a piloted supersonic aircraft that generates a soft thump, rather than the disruptive boom currently associated with supersonic flight. Work also is underway on the X-57 Maxwell, a general aviation-sized electric research airplane. Maxwell will fly for the first time in early 2018 and demonstrate battery powered, distributed electric propulsion. Transport-sized electric aircraft could reduce energy use by more than 60 percent and harmful emissions by more than 90 percent. This was the first project to get an X-plane number designation in a decade. NASA's other green aviation initiatives include reducing airline emissions and flight delays. Working in partnership with airlines and air traffic controllers at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, NASA is beginning the first-of-a-kind demonstration of new technologies that coordinate operational schedules for aircraft arrivals, departures, and taxiing.

Obama: Getting humans to Mars will require NASA, private companies to team up By SAMANTHA MASUNAGA and JIM PUZZANGHERA Los Angeles Times Oct 11, 2016 0 wx104 Image by NASA WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama hammered home his goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, while acknowledging that accomplishing it would require public and private collaboration. Obama first said in 2010 he wanted to send astronauts “to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth” by the mid-2030s with “a landing on Mars” to follow. In an opinion article Tuesday on CNN.com, Obama said the ultimate ambition was not only to send humans to Mars and bring them back, but to “remain there for an extended time.” “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way,” he said. Obama’s article comes two weeks after SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk laid out an ambitious plan to eventually send 1 million people to colonize the Red Planet and turn humans into a multiplanetary species within 40 to 100 years. In a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico, Musk similarly called for a public/private partnership. NASA is working with Hawthorne, Calif.-based SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing Co. to develop crew capsules to take astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA relies on SpaceX and aerospace firm Orbital ATK to deliver supplies and cargo to the space station. This week, Obama will speak at the White House Frontiers conference in Pittsburgh, an event that will focus on innovations in science and technology, including a future Mars mission. Executives from companies such as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and moon mining firm Moon Express are also set to speak at the conference. “It just underlines the theme that’s run through the Obama administration, which is encouraging partnerships with the private sector, providing additional opportunities for work and, when appropriate, doing business in a slightly different way,” said John Logsdon, professor emeritus of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. “It’s mainly about leaving a legacy,” he said. Analysts said a public/private partnership recognizes the reality of the space business today, as well as financial limitations. “On the commercial side, there are a lot of innovative ideas,” said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International. “But they need that backing from the government both in the know-how … (and) the government’s financial resources.” Smaller space startups that don’t usually work with the government could benefit most from Obama’s goal, said Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation trade group. “I think it gives a level of excitement to a variety of different players,” he said. “You don’t know who the next SpaceX could be, or the next Blue Origin,” referring to the space tourism company started by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. SpaceX, whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has said its first test flight of an interplanetary vehicle could come in four years. A crewed mission could launch in late 2024 and arrive on Mars in 2025. Developing the transport system could cost SpaceX $10 billion. In an email, SpaceX spokesman Phil Larson said it was “exciting to see President Obama advocate for the next frontier in human space flight,” and that the company was looking forward to “participating in the journey.” The company’s plan to send an unmanned Dragon spacecraft to the Red Planet as early as 2018 will provide an early chance to demonstrate how private space companies and NASA can work together, said Charles Lurio, publisher of the Lurio Report newsletter on entrepreneurial spaceflight. SpaceX will use the flight to test landing capabilities, interplanetary navigation and other systems. NASA will provide some technical support for the mission because it is interested in the entry, descent and landing data. Marco Caceres, of the Teal Group, estimated that a mission to Mars done the “traditional way” by NASA could cost at least $1 trillion. Oftentimes, large space programs can get delayed if Congress does not grant the requested funding amount, or if there are technical problems along the way. A public/private partnership may speed up the timeline and could lower that cost below $1 trillion, Caceres said. But one of the biggest questions is whether such a program could get funding from Congress, said Ostrove of Forecast International. “There is some desire to do the actual exploration,” he said. “I think that there’s maybe not necessarily the political will to spend the money on these types of programs when there’s so many other things we’re facing now.” One question still to be answered is who will build the massive rockets needed to get to Mars. NASA plans to send its Space Launch System rocket to an asteroid in the mid-2020s and to Mars in the 2030s. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has said he thinks the first person to land on Mars will “arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” a reference to the company’s role on the SLS project. That is a challenge to Musk, who described a rocket booster measuring 39 feet in diameter. When stacked with the SpaceX Mars spaceship, the interplanetary transport system would be 400 feet tall. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

The nonprofit was formed in 2011 to better coordinate land, incentives and economic tools that make Oklahoma City even more attractive to companies and developers. In traditional anniversary gift protocol, the five-year gift is wood. While that doesn’t seem romantic in terms of lasting love, it does seem appropriate for the alliance’s work – enabling companies and developers to build and invest in our city. Before the alliance was formed, Oklahoma City was already on the transformative path with development projects like Devon Energy’s headquarters downtown. We have all enjoyed the positive ripple effects of that investment, which included the renovation of the Myriad Gardens and the surrounding area. What the public did not experience was the magnitude of coordinating four agencies’ resources and paperwork to make possible incentives and support from the city. Today that process is streamlined with the alliance’s leadership, making it more effective in time, decision-making and selection for the best types and levels of support necessary. In addition to managing several economic entities, such as the Oklahoma City Urban Renewal Authority and Oklahoma City Redevelopment Authority, the alliance works in collaboration with public and private entities to begin or invigorate development projects. The 10 tax increment financing districts in Oklahoma City, covering more than 4,000 acres, are excellent examples of public-private investment with transformative impact. The recent openings of the GE Global Research Center, 21c Hotel and Boeing also highlight public-private investments coordinated by the alliance. Through the Strategic Investment Program, the organization helped encourage Boeing to expand its operations and relocate employees to Oklahoma City. Following Oklahoma City’s $6 million Strategic Investment Program package, Boeing has nearly doubled its new jobs, invested $80 million in a new facility and is expected to have a $640 million economic impact on our state. Those stories are possible because five years ago our city leaders had the vision to maximize the development process by forming the alliance. In that short time, it has been proven to work. I look forward to our 10-year report. There are several exciting projects underway that will be completed, or near completion, that will further highlight the economic transformation of our great city.

SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP San Francisco Autonomous Drone Company Starts Delivering Blood in Rwanda Starting today, Zipline's drones will deliver up to 150 bags of blood daily to health centers in western Rwanda. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Zipline's team has launched its blood delivery drone service in Rwanda. CREDIT: Zipline Advertisement In the U.S., drone delivery is still in the research and development phase. But in Rwanda, starting today, American-made drones will deliver blood to patients in need. Zipline, an autonomous robotics company based in San Francisco, has partnered with the Rwandan government to make up to 150 deliveries each day to 21 different transfusion clinics in the western half of the country. During a ceremony in the Muhanga District in Rwanda on Friday morning (Thursday night in the states), Rwandan president Paul Kagame launched the first drone to mark the beginning of the nation's drone delivery service. Rwanda's drone delivery service will focus on blood at first but will soon expand to vaccines, medical supplies, and other medicines through a partnership between UPS and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Zipline's aircraft will expand its delivery route to the eastern half of the country by 2017. Over the next three years, Zipline CEO and co-founder Keller Rinaudo says, the startup and the Rwandan government can save thousands of lives, and he hopes Zipline can eventually provide medical supplies to all of the 11 million Rwandan citizens in need. In Rwanda, many patients die each year because blood and medical supplies cannot get to medical centers in rural areas because of poor infrastructure and impassable roads. Most "last-mile" deliveries are done by motorbike, but in emergency situations the motorbikes cannot make deliveries fast enough. During the country's rainy season, the roads connecting cities to remote villages can wash out and prevent ground transportation entirely. But the drones, which reach a top speed of 140 kilometers per hour (about 87 mph), can fly in rain and heavy wind and can deliver the blood before it spoils. The drones can make a delivery 75 kilometers away (about 47 miles) within 30 minutes. "The inability to deliver life-saving medicines to the people who need them the most causes millions of preventable deaths each year around the world," says Rinaudo. "Zipline will help solve that problem once and for all. We've built an instant delivery system for the world, allowing medicine to be delivered on-demand and at low-cost, anywhere." This is how Zipline's drone delivery system works: When a patient needs a blood transfusion, a doctor, nurse, or health center technician will send Zipline a text message and a drone from its fleet of 15 aircraft will airdrop the needed supplies in half an hour. The drone will send a message to the health center when it is two minutes away and the package, equipped with a parachute, will fall safely to the ground. The craft will then return to the launch site all by itself. Zipline, which was founded by Keller Rinaudo, Will Hetzler, and Keenan Wyrobek in 2011 in California, has raised $18 million in funding from investors including Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The company is composed of aerospace employees from NASA, SpaceX, and Boeing. The private-public partnership between the Silicon Valley company and Rwanda was padded by a $1.1 million grant from the UPS Foundation. The UPS Foundation grant will help Zipline expand its offerings to vaccines and other supplies. (UPS delivered Zipline's infrastructure, the launch pad, and the fleet of 15 drones to Rwanda.) Thanks to regulatory hurdles, Zipline is not currently operating medical supply deliveries in the U.S. The Federal Aviation Administration currently does not allow autonomous drones. The FAA's rules require a pilot on the ground to keep the aircraft in line of sight at all times. Once approved by the U.S. government, Zipline hopes to bring the same model to the U.S. by next year and plans to serve Native American reservations in Maryland, Nevada, and Washington State.

At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. The issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. Scroll down for video  Images show a a Samsung Note 7 exploding as pressure is applied to its fully charged battery during a test at the Applied Energy Hub battery laboratory in Singapore. It is claimed the firm has been unable to find out exactly what causes the problem. The Federal Aviation Administration has taken the unusual step of warning passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage.

Share this article Share 221 shares The first airline to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines.  The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. HOW THEY WORK  The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire.  The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit.  American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires.  Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades.  The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire.  The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit.  The sell for $1,800 each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount. Virgin America has installed fire-containment bags on all its planes, said spokeswoman Jennifer Thomas.  The airline, which is based in Burlingame, California, has about 60 jets. Delta Air Lines noted Thursday on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags.  The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant.  Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year.  In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners. The return kits contain a series of boxes, and protective bags, including one with a special fire resistant coating. The inner box has a ceramic fiber lining, and Samsung says gloves must be used around it. 'This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events,' Durrant said. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires.  Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades.  WHY ARE LITHIUM BATTERIES SO DANGEROUS?   Lithium batteries are use in a range of consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing.  Photos showing the aftermath of the explosive test reveal the charred remains of the smartphone and its battery If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control.  Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, told reporters in Seoul: 'The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together.' It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 221 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

NorthwestMilitary.com Menu Home News Military Life Vets Restaurants Music & Culture Travel Guides PROMO View Full Site Back to People Rule Twins reflect on lifetime of military service 132 years of experience with Civil Air Patrol By Rio Fernandes/JBLM PAO on October 13, 2016 Photo by Washington Wing Deputy Public Affairs Lt. Col. Eleanor Baker, left, and Lt. Col. Evelyn Lundstrom-Weiss, right, celebrating their 86th birthday last August at the Washington Wing of the Civil Air Patrol headquarters on McChord Field. Lieutenant Colonel Evelyn Lundstrom-Weiss and Lt. Col. Eleanor Baker have spent nearly a lifetime with the Washington Wing of the Civil Air Patrol at McChord Field. The only thing they might have committed more time to than their service is each other. The two sisters, often referred to as “the twins,” are still as close as when they started their service in 1950. “She lives about 13 miles away from me now,” Baker said. “That’s probably the farthest we’ve ever lived apart. We’ve always belonged to things together. We worked with the Seattle Squadron at one of the first ever Seafair parades.” The two 86-year-old women have a combined 132 years of experience with the Civil Air Patrol. They’ve seen the formation and fall of the USSR, the eruption of Mount St. Helens, the 9-11 terrorist attacks and much more. Through all of the changes in the country and the world, the two sisters have remained constant for the Civil Air Patrol. They currently head up the department’s history program. Their years of service and time with the department have allowed them to witness firsthand the change and growth it has gone through. “When we first started, we had to study out the Boeing manual, and it was so boring,” Lundstrom-Weiss said while laughing. “We know that they do a much better job training the cadets. It’s improved so much.” The two agree that the lifetime working for the CAP has been worth it. They have traveled the world, helping people during natural disasters and pushing each other to always become better at their jobs. “We’ve been involved in every aspect of Civil Air Patrol,” Baker said. “Whether it be disaster relief, summer encampments, search missions, whatever you can think of.” While working with one’s sibling might sound daunting to some, Lundstrom-Weiss and Baker agree it’s been a fantastic experience. They’ve been able to use each as other as confidants and also as healthy rivals, as they both tried to become the best versions of themselves. They’d also encourage anyone who is interested in learning about aerospace to look long and hard at a program, because they know it’s a fantastic way to get introduced. “You’ll be able to learn as much as you possibly can,” Lundstrom-Weiss said. “There are also so many activities and opportunities that you can accept if you’re ambitious.” While it would be easy for the two to call it quits, they both agree that they enjoy working for Civil Air Patrol too much to walk away. “It keeps you young to keep busy,” Baker said. “I just enjoy doing everything so much still. Hopefully, we can keep doing this for a while longer!” Read next close Attractions Fall fun continues in the South Sound Ruth Kingsland/JBLM PAO on October 13th, 2016 More Across Northwest Military The Puget Sound Military Market The military personnel at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Naval Base Kitsap make up the LARGEST...

At a September 27 conference, Defense News quoted Giuseppe Bono, CEO of Italian shipyard Fincantieri, as saying, "We must work together — today there is competition between European firms, but the competition should be between European firms and the rest of the world."  © Photo: Pixabay Airbus Joins Orbital ATK in Contract to Build Satellite for Europe, North Africa Bono expressed his desire to collaborate with the DCNS French naval yard, and noted that while Paris often competes with Italy during export campaigns, the two navies have partnered on programs like the FREMM and Horizon frigates for the last twenty years. "The integration and consolidation of the industry in Europe is important and the French are saying the same thing. Industry will do this before politicians, who will then follow," he said, adding that if a naval Airbus is not  developed in Europe, "every chance of growth in Europe will disappear. European firms cannot compete abroad alone anymore." Gen. Claudio Graziano, the Italian Chief of General Staff said at the conference that "in the future there will be a greater need to find the right balance between the protection of national competitiveness and an ever greater cooperation and integration at European level."  © AFP 2016/ LEX VAN LIESHOUT / ANP Brussels and Washington at Loggerheads Over Airbus, Boeing Illegal Subsidies Centro Studi Internazionali, the Roman think tank hosting the conference, published a report stating that an official military relationship between Italy and France would likely be able to secure funds from the European Union for the joint planning. The report comes as Germany, Italy and France revive talks of a unified European military after Britain’s exit from the EU in June. Proposal notes acquired by the Times just before the vote read, "The EU can step up its contribution to Europe’s security and defence," and, "Our external action must become more joined up across policy areas, institutions and member states…Greater unity of purpose is needed across the policy areas making up our external action." Bono clarified that the Airbus, once developed, would not only be available to Rome and Paris, but would open to all of Europe. He pointed out European groups that have recently been shortlisted to build nine new frigates for Australia. "We are talking to everyone," he said, "In Australia there are three European firms shortlisted — BAE, Navantia and us — which shows you there is a problem." ...

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → October → ETF Picks for a Clinton or Trump Presidency ETF Picks for a Clinton or Trump Presidency Tom Lydon October 13, 2016 0 Comment Aerospace & Defense, Banks, Current Affairs, Emerging Markets, EWW, Financial, Global ETFs, Health Care, Healthcare, ITA, KBE, Latin America, Lead, Mexico, PPA, QMEX, Sector ETFs, VHT, XLF, XLV Election day is right around the corner and the markets are sitting on edge. With a new president and administration, investors can expect some major changes that could ripple through the stock market and potentially lead to targeted exchange traded fund opportunities. For instance, Republican nominee Donald Trump has called for cutting back on regulations that have gripped the financial industry in response to the 2008 financial downturn and favored expanding the military in the ongoing fight against terrorism. Trump has said he would “dismantle” financial reform, or the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, that have caused big banks to take on increased capital requirements to obviate another depression event associated with high-risk debt. On the other hand, Democratic runner Hillary Clinton has defended Dodd-Frank as a means of cracking down on perceived risky banking practices. With Trump in office, investors may look more favorably on banks and financial stocks, along with sector-related ETF options like the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSEArca: KBE), which targets some of the largest U.S. banks, or the broader Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLF), which includes a hefty bank sub-sector tilt, along with other financial services names. Trump has also called for the elimination of the sequester on defense spending and increasing military spending to bolster troops and the number of war vehicles in an attempt to prepare the country against the number of treats we continue to face. The nominee has also stressed the need to upgrade current defense systems, such as modernizing Navy cruisers. Consequently, if elected, Trump could be a boon for the aerospace and defense industry, along with related ETFs, like the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEArca: ITA) and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (NYSEArca: PPA), which include industrial names like Boeing (NYSE: BA), United Technologies (NYSE: UTX), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon (NYSE: RTN), among others. Alternatively, if Clinton wins out on election day, we may see continued support for the healthcare sector from the ongoing Affordable Care Act, or so-called Obamacare, and improved relations with trade partners whom have been targeted under Trump’s more protectionist rhetoric. While Clinton has put a spotlight on high-priced drugs in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical space, she may continue to back Obamacare and support the broader healthcare industry, with more insured Americans using healthcare services. Investors may look to broad healthcare options like Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSEArca: VHT) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLV) for exposure to industry. Additionally, Mexican assets are seen as an election barometer, weakening when Trump advanced in polls and strengthening when the Republican nominee lost ground. Trump has questioned NAFTA and free trade, vowed to add tariffs on Mexican imports, pledged to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and wanted to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. If Clinton wins out, investors may ride a potential rally with country-specific ETF options like the iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (NYSEArca: EWW), which holds broad range of companies in Mexico, and SPDR MSCI Mexico Quality Mix ETF (NYSEArca: QMEX), which tracks a more customized basket of Mexico stocks that were selected based on metrics like value, quality and low volatility.

The Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base is overseeing the government’s new fighter jet demonstration project known as SHiELD, or Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator. The program aims to place small-scale laser pod defense systems on older military aircraft, with the first system demonstration scheduled for 2021. The Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base is overseeing the government’s new fighter-jet demonstration project known as SHiELD, or Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator. (Morgan Petroski/Albuquerque Journal) To build it, the Air Force lab awarded an initial $39 million contract in late August to Northrop Grumman to create a new laser beam control system. Two more contracts will follow in the coming months, one for a laser pod that contains the system’s power, thermal management, battery and cooling technology, and another to develop the laser itself, said SHiELD program manager Richard Bagnell.

The AFRL’s project team will oversee all contract work – including systems alignment, integration and testing – in New Mexico. “Northrop will work out of Redondo Beach, but we have significant staff on the government side at Kirtland, plus contractors supporting it off base,” Bagnell said. “We expect testing eventually will be done at Kirtland and White Sands Missile Range, because we have the infrastructure here to effect the best test we can.” The project’s total cost is not yet known, but the upcoming pod contract will be for about $40 million. In addition, the AFRL expects to spend $25 million to $50 million over the next five years on local contractors. Once fully built, the pod-based laser system would be mounted on the outside of aircraft. The Air Force has not yet identified which planes would get the system or which targets it would be used against. But it would, at least at first, be used for defensive purposes, such as shooting down incoming air-to-air missiles. It’s part of a broad Department of Defense effort to incorporate laser systems for defensive and offensive purposes on ground, maritime and air vehicles, said Shaun McDougal, Forecast International’s North America military market analyst. “It’s a growing area of interest for all the services,” McDougal said. Separate programs are underway to mount lasers on armored trucks and Navy ships. Boeing Co. has contracts for a lot of that work, much of which is at its facility in Albuquerque. Mounting lasers on aircraft can, however, offer many tactical advantages. Advertisement Continue reading For one, it gives weapons operators a better line of sight to see targets over hills and buildings compared with ground-based lasers, McDougal said. It’s cheaper than conventional weapons and offers unlimited fire power, with no need to land and reload. SHiELD is one of the first major efforts to build scalable laser systems for fighter jets since the massive Airborne Laser Program ended in 2011. That project, also headed by Boeing at a cost of $5 billion over 15 years, aimed to mount a chemical laser on a Boeing 747. That program successfully demonstrated basic laser technology, but funding ended, in large part because the system was huge, difficult to manage and expensive. SHiELD will build on lessons from the Airborne Laser Program and other projects, Bagnell said. In particular, it will use electronic lasers that can be designed to occupy much less space. “We want it to be compact with the right size, weight and power to fit inside a pod on potentially any aircraft,” Bagnell said. Northrop Grumman will focus on building a robust beam control system to withstand extreme turbulence on aircraft, which can affect laser accuracy. The beam control, pod and laser components will be built simultaneously, and then later integrated for full system testing within five years. “This investment is another example of the military’s growing appreciation for directed energy and the game-changing potential for our national security,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. “New Mexico is home to AFRL and a number of industry leaders who are working to develop and deploy this technology.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Albuquerque News Business From the newspaper Front Page Most Recent Biz News New Mexico News News Technology Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

President Barack Obama fist-bumped a robotic hand controlled by a quadriplegic man's mind as if it was his own. The president shed his suit coat and sat behind the controls of a spaceship simulator. "Your ride is here, baby," he joked after successfully docking with the International Space Station during the simulation. Obama launched an autonomous drone that could be used to inspect bridges and other hard to reach places, and he inspected a space capsule. "You almost want to get in and take off, don't you?" Obama said about the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Obama got a hands-on look at cutting edge science, technology and innovation Thursday as he hosted the first-ever White House Frontiers Conference at University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. He thanked both for turning their Oakland campuses into a "science fiction novel" for the day. "I confess. I'm a science geek. I'm a nerd," Obama said in an address to the conference. "I don't make any apologies for it. It's cool stuff." Obama toured an exhibit hall at Pitt's Alumni Hall with university Chancellor Patrick Gallagher. He then went to Carnegie Mellon University and met up with President Subra Suresh to check out self-driving cars and the spacecraft before appearing on stage for his speech. After his speech, Obama joined a panel on medical innovations. He then disappeared backstage and taped a skit with The Late Show Host Stephen Colbert that will air Monday night, the White House said. The conference at Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh brought together about 100 speakers to discuss topics ranging from health to space exploration. "Why are we trying to get 100 hospitals to talk to one another? Why aren't we trying to get 100 hospitals to talk to one patient," David Okonkwo, a UPMC neurosurgeon, asked during a panel discussion on the future of health. Ellen Stofan, chief scientist at NASA, led a discussion about going to Mars, working and living there. Zoë Keating, a cellist, composer and patient advocate, gave a moving performance that pushed the boundaries of music. Obama used the conference to announce more than $300 million in new funding for science, technology and innovation and new federal initiatives including $70 million for brain research and $165 million in public and private dollars to tackle traffic congestion. White House officials said they expect momentum from the conference to continue even after Obama leaves Washington in three months. John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said much of the president's agenda on science, technology and innovation is, for the most part, nonpartisan and bipartisan in nature. Some aspects, like investments in clean energy, may be a tough sell across the aisle but most are universally favorable, he said. "It doesn't really matter whether you a republican or democrat, you're generally in favor of advances in biomedicine and public health. There's nobody who doesn't want to cure the diseases of the brain. There's nobody who doesn't want to defeat cancer," Holdren said Wednesday. "There is nobody on either side of the aisle who doesn't want to build the economy with new products, new services and new jobs, so we think a lot of this will continue irrespective of what party is in the White House or what party controls Congress." Kristie Canegallo, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Implementation, added that the president has pursued advancements in science and technology through building private sector partners outside the government and immune to shifting administrations. Toward the end of his speech, Obama talked about meeting Nathan Copeland, the quadriplegic man with the robotic hand. Copeland, 30, of Dunbar in Fayette County was paralyzed at age 18 when he broke his neck in a car crash. A team at Pitt and UPMC built Copeland a robotic hand he can control with his brain. The hand also sends signals back to his brain allow him to feel when people touch and press against it. The two bumped fists. Obama was amazed. "That's what science does," Obama said later during his speech. "That's what American innovation can do. Imagine the breakthroughs that are around the corner. Imagine what's possible for Nathan if we keep on pushing the boundries." Aaron Aupperlee is a Tribune-Review staff writer. Reach him at 412-320-7986 or aaupperlee@tribweb.com.

Here’s what you need to know about the Portland Trail Blazers and a potential uniform ad partnership. by Eric Griffith@DeeringTornado Oct 13, 2016, 9:13am PDT tweet share pin Rec Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Ads are coming to NBA uniforms next season. So far, the Sacramento Kings and Philadelphia 76ers have signed deals with Blue Diamond Almonds and StubHub, respectively, agreeing to afix corporate sponsorship patches to the shoulder of their uniforms. The Blazers, and 27 other teams, are still negotiating the sale of their jersey space. With that in mind, here’s a quick primer on what is currently known about the Blazers’ uniform ad situation. What will the ads look like? The only detail known about the ads so far is that they are restricted to a 2.5-inch square patch on the left shoulder. Players have worn similar patches at All-Star events for several seasons: Foot Locker advertisement patch on standard team jerseys during 2014 NBA All-Star Saturday: pic.twitter.com/CmV2Jgq7L3— Chris Creamer (@sportslogosnet) October 30, 2015 The ads on jerseys for the 2017-2018 season will be roughly the same size as the All-Star weekend patches, but it is unclear if the corporate partners will be asked to create alternate logos that match the team’s colors. So far, the Sixers have matched their StubHub patch color scheme to their uniforms, whereas the Kings have gone with a non-matching blue for Blue Diamond Almonds: BREAKING: @Sixers sign 1st jersey ad deal in North American major sports, 3-year deal with @StubHub pic.twitter.com/EZa52rQEQm— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) May 16, 2016 FIRST LOOK: @SacramentoKings sign @BlueDiamond as jersey ad sponsor starting next season pic.twitter.com/iSDbnDT2LE— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 10, 2016 While the Blazers black and white jerseys will pair well with most logo color-schemes, it is easy to imagine the red alternates clashing significantly with several brands (e.g. the OHSU patch on the team’s practice uniforms). How much will the Blazers get? So far, the 76ers and Kings have both signed 3-year, $15 million deals with their respective sponsors. Other teams, however, have asked for significantly more; ESPN’s Darren Rovell has reported that the Warriors are seeking $65 million, the Cavaliers want $50 million, and the Nets are asking for $25 million. All of those contracts would be spread over the maximum three years the NBA is allowing for a trial run of uniform ads. But how much can the Blazers expect to get for their ad space? Interestingly, if Rovell’s reports are correct, the market seems to be driven at least partially by recent on-court success. The Nets and 76ers both play in major east coast cities, and the Nets are one of the most valuable franchises in the league according to Forbes, yet those teams are drawing relatively modest payments. Meanwhile, the NBA’s most recent champions are expecting no more than triple the 76ers/Kings price, despite the fact that Cleveland is only the No. 12 most valuable franchise and not in an ideal market. The current trend could work in the Blazers’ favor as the team (hopefully) continues its on-court upswing, especially if they get off to a hot start this season. It feels safe to speculate that fans can expect the Blazers to net a better deal than the 76ers or Kings - possibly in the $8 million per year range that the Nets are currently asking for. Either way, it may be some time before fans get a final answer. Rovell noted that many teams are playing negotiation hardball at the moment as they wait for the market on uniform ads to be more firmly established. Who will the Blazers sign a deal with? With no rumors emerging about any pending negotiations, it is almost impossible to pinpoint which corporation is most likely to sign a deal with Blazers team president Chris McGowan. What is known, is that, per league rules, the Blazers will not be allowed to sign a deal with any company that trades in the following: Alcohol, tobacco, or gambling Media content Sports equipment (the league already has a deal with Spalding and Nike) Watches (the league has a deal with Tissot) Additionally, Rovell notes teams will have to work to keep their local television partners and star players happy (seriously, go read his article on uniform ads, it’s worth the time). That means that corporate sponsors that conflict with Damian Lillard’s personal sponsorships may be problematic, and that the Blazers will have to be careful not to undermine their partnership with CSN by selling ads to a company that would otherwise buy commercial airtime during game broadcasts. The Blazers may also opt to sell their jersey ad space as part of a larger package. The Kings’ deal with Blue Diamond included concessions and on-court logo placement. The Kings also touted Blue Diamond’s commitment to healthy eating and locally-sourced food. Given McGowan’s recent emphasis on local food for concessions, it’s not hard to imagine the Blazers taking a similar path. Unofficially, the Blazers may also want to avoid annoying the community. With ballot measure 97 engendering criticism of out-of-state conglomerates, the team could place an emphasis on finding a local sponsor. With all that said, the simplest route would be to expand a current partnership to include jersey ads under the assumption that those companies already satisfy all of the above requirements. Wells Fargo and McDonald’s already have deals with the team and have the cash to pay for additional premium ad space. If the Blazers do want to stay local, Alaska Airlines and OHSU have both shown that they are interested in uniform ads. Of course, there are any number of currently un-contracted companies that could also decide the team is right to get into the NBA (e.g. Jeld-Wen, Microsoft, Boeing, PGE, etc.). Will the ads appear on replica uniforms purchased by fans? The league does not appear to have made an official decision about whether or not replica jerseys sold to fans will include ads. Teams seem to have some flexibility on this decision; the 76ers have opted to include ads on the jerseys sold at their team stores, but not on those shipped to national suppliers. From an ESPN article: Jerseys sold to fans nationwide will not have the corporate sponsor logo on them, but O'Neil said the Sixers will sell jerseys with a StubHub logo at their team locations. "We have a very strong opinion that little Scottie, [a hypothetical consumer] who is 9 years old, will want to wear what the players are wearing on the court," O'Neil said. Will the uniform ads affect the salary cap? Proceeds from jersey ads will be classified as Basketball Related Income (BRI) by the NBA and thus will cause a slight boost to the league’s salary cap. With the Blazers perilously close to the luxury tax threshold, larger ad contracts could help the team avoid huge tax payments in future years. With that said, the league brought in roughly $7 billion last season, so even if teams average $10 million in additional revenue, the extra $300 million will have only a minor effect on the cap.

However, PR experts say, Samsung Electronics bungled in not just misdiagnosing the fault afflicting its top-end phones but appearing uncommunicative with an aloof bedside manner. As a result, the South Korean company has its work cut out as it embarks on a vast and costly exercise to win back trust and prove that it is still a byword for quality at a time when its rivals are going full tilt in the smartphone wars. “The basis of crisis management is to make sure that when you give a solution, it’s the right solution and it is going to enable you to move forward,” Andy Holdsworth, a crisis management specialist at the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). That has not been the case with Samsung. Perhaps reluctant to lose too much ground to rivals such as Apple and Google, who were busy launching their own new models, the company rushed out replacements for its Galaxy Note 7 ‘phablet’ series when some in the first global batch spontaneously caught fire. The incendiary problem persisted, however, and now Samsung has been forced to scrap the entire line in an embarrassing setback for a brand image that took years to build up. Some airplanes had banned passengers from boarding with the phones. Social media is rife with anger and ridicule. One video, of a Burger King employee in South Korea gingerly handling a smoking Note 7 with oven gloves, has gone viral. Disjointed response Holdsworth said Samsung’s response throughout had been “disjointed”. “I would question the investigation and I would question why Samsung said last night the product is safe if this morning (Tuesday) they then decide to recall all units and stop production. There seems to be a slight miscommunication somewhere. “You kind of lose faith in it because your remedy (suffered) the same problem and this problem is quite a dangerous one.” The family-run corporations, or “chaebol”, which dominate the South Korean economy are used to running their businesses their own way. As companies like Samsung and LG have become global brands, their corporate governance and PR cultures have improved as they have adapted to the rigours of international markets, but analysts say the old family-run structure, with its rigid top-down decision-making, leaves them vulnerable to a crisis. Who’s in charge? In Samsung’s case a generational leadership transfer, with family patriarch and group chairman Lee Kun-Hee bedridden since suffering a heart attack in 2014, may have contributed to the company’s failure to deal efficiently with the Note 7 crisis. “In chaebol like Samsung, the all-powerful chairman makes key decisions and these are swiftly translated into actions by his underlings,” said Chung Sun-sup, head of corporate analysis group Chaebul.com. “But if such a patriarchal leader is somehow absent, such a decision-making structure may fall into limbo. The current crisis at Samsung is related with this corporate structure. If Lee was in charge, he might have sorted it out, bringing in every available expert from both inside and outside the company. But Samsung just tried to tinker with the problem and failed,” Chung said. It could be worse. There has been no loss of life, unlike other PR disasters such as the 2010 explosion at BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig which now features in a Hollywood movie. And other companies have also struggled with the challenge of extracting more power and faster charge times from the lithium-ion technology used in smartphones today. Boeing suffered electrical fires from the lithium-ion batteries aboard its new 787 jet, and Dell with self-combusting laptops, noted ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of operations management and supply chain at Cass Business School in London. But Samsung erred in striving to “fix the problem too quickly”, he said. Now, with the total shutdown of Note 7 production, “it sends a bad signal to the market that there is panic in the boardroom”. There may be no quick fix to undo the past few weeks, during which it appeared that Samsung’s official response appeared to lag that of national regulators, airlines and mobile phone carriers. But Samsung should at least shed any inhibitions it may feel about being more forthright with its customers, said Yves Robert-Paul, who heads crisis communications for French advertising group Havas. Since Samsung started recalling the phablets last month, he said, it has offered only “a pragmatic response, devoid of all emotion”. “They’ve run it like an industrial disaster but they forgot to think about their customers.” Share.

By Rosemary Feitelberg on October 13, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk SAS Airlines had uniforms designed by Carven in the Sixties and by Christian Dior in the early Seventies. In honor of its 70th anniversary on Tuesday, SAS Airlines will suit up its pilots, cabin crews and ground staff in newly updated uniforms from Swedish designer Ted Bernhardtz. Executives at the Stockholm-based company have spent the past year reviewing the logo, font and color scheme to ensure a cohesiveness to what it describes as its “Blue on Blue” identity. “Over the past year we have had a strong focus on SAS visual expression, and we have worked with everything from logo, text and color to the material. Designers tried to keep in mind three key words — ‘recognizable,’ ‘Scandinavian’ and ‘uncluttered,'” Brand manager Pi Åhnberg said, “The work has been important for us so that there is a visual context and similarity in all of our parts. The uniforms are an important and essential part in meeting our customers, and are a perfect illustration of the SAS visual refresh.” The redesign has been an 18-month process that resulted in nearly 91,000 pieces for SAS’ 8,000 uniformed employees. More than 17 years have passed since the airline last retooled its uniform. That incarnation was created by three Scandinavian designers: Christopher Bjercke of Norway, Susanne Levring Rützov of Denmark and Pernilla Forsman from Sweden. But the airline has a rich fashion heritage since Christian Dior and Carven are among the designer brands that once designed the uniforms. In 1971, the introduction of Dior’s turquoise designs coordinated with the interiors of its new Boeing 747s that transported passengers on the Copenhagen-New York and Copenhagen-Tokyo routes. The updated uniforms, which include a polo shirt and poncho among other styles, are meant to make SAS staffers more identifiable for travelers navigating busy international airports. The airline has 805 daily departures and services 119 markets. In 2014, SAS ferried 28.1 million passengers. Working from his design firm in Gothenburg, Bernhardtz relied on SAS uniformed employees and staffers in the company’s trademark department for close assistance. He has extensive experience in design, textiles and manufacturing both his own collections and uniforms for big companies. Considerable wear testing was done before the final designs, fit and fabrics secured approval. Bernhardtz did not respond to requests for comment. SAS has also partnered with Amandah Andersson, the Swedish designer behind the AMA AWE brand, to design an exclusive scarf. The blue-on-blue base has a graphic design of sand, which is meant to be Andersson’s view of how the Scandinavian countries look from the air. The accessory is also imprinted with SAS. “There were many details to consider when I got the offer to create a design that suited the SAS brand and look, while fitting with my own artistic expression. My first thought was to use the image of Scandinavia seen from above as inspiration, just as you see it when you look out the airplane window,” Andersson said. You're missing something!

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:20 AM, October 14, 2016 BRUSSELS - The European Union launched an appeal on Thursday against a World Trade Organization (WTO) panel finding last month that it had failed to rein in billions of dollars of subsidies to planemaker Airbus <AIR.PA>. The WTO's 574-page ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, still raging after 12 years of arguments. The WTO said the EU and four nations - Britain, France, Germany and Spain - had failed to comply with earlier rulings against all but two of 36 contested measures, including billions of dollars of European government loans to Airbus. However, the EU disagreed with the conclusion that, even though most of the subsidies challenged by the United States had ended, the EU had not yet fully complied with a previous ruling, the European Commission said in a statement. The EU also considered that the panel made several errors in its assessment of the alleged harm that these subsidies caused to Airbus rival Boeing <BA.N>. U.S. officials said Airbus had failed to undo subsidies worth $22 billion, including $4 billion for the A350, on which Airbus's prospects in the wide-body jet market largely depend. The European Commission said the $22 billion figure reflected the face value of all repayable loans granted to Airbus and had nothing to do with the actual amount of subsidies. It also said the WTO panel had sided with the EU on some points, such as that there had been no prohibited subsidies for the Airbus 350 XWB or A380 models and that most of the other subsidies challenged by the United States had come to an end. "The present appeal should be seen in the context of two on-going WTO challenges brought by the EU against billions of U.S. subsidies to Boeing for its aircraft production," the Commission added.

The Saudis took the occasion of a funeral in Sana, the Yemeni capital, of a patriarch of a large, prominent family to carry out a three-wave bombing attack on the hall where the ceremony was being held. One argument that President Barack Obama’s administration uses to sustain America’s policy of continued support for the Saudi-led coalition is that the intelligence the United States provides its air war against Yemen enables its planes to be more precise in hitting military rather than civilian targets. What that line of argument would lead to this time is either that it isn’t an accurate description of what is occurring, or that U.S. intelligence helped the Saudis target the attack on the funeral. Neither “explanation” is acceptable to American principles. What is likely more accurate is to refer to the fact that the United States has sold the Saudis and the other Sunni Persian Gulf Arab states the aircraft and technology that they are using to wage war against the Shiite Houthis in Yemen. The figure for sales to the Saudis is $100 billion during the Obama years. Companies profiting from the sales include Boeing, General Dynamics and United Technologies. The Department of Defense has yet to assure there are no U.S. co-pilots in the Saudi aircraft carrying out attacks in Yemen. The other argument used to justify continued U.S. support of the Saudis in their intra-Islamic war is that America is placating the kingdom, based on its opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement concluded last year. The Shiite Islamic republic exchanged its nuclear program for the immediate and middle future in return for an alleviation of economic and financial international sanctions against it. Unfortunately, at this time, Yemenis — citizens of the poorest country in the Mideast — are paying the price in blood to please the Saudis and their theocratic regime for the Iran deal. Saturday’s slaughter makes it clear that the time is long since past when the United States should stop using U.S. companies’ arms sales and defense of the Iran deal as reasons to continue to help Saudi Sunnis slaughter Yemenis, even if they are supported to a degree by Iran. A lethal attack on a funeral is simply an atrocity that qualifies as a war crime. The United States should disassociate itself from Saudi war-making quickly: Cancel the contracts if that is what is required to end U.S. involvement in this war. — Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Pittsburgh Post-Gazette esanchez Follow esanchez Close Get email notifications on esanchez daily!

"The present appeal should be seen in the context of two on-going WTO challenges brought by the EU against billions of U.S. subsidies to Boeing for its aircraft production," the Commission added.

They both called out the airline this week with Toju Foyeh sharing her displeasure four days ago while Do2dtun vented about the airline yesterday. Toju Foye wrote: I usually don’t do this but I’m PISSED to the MAX!!! This pathetic excuse of an airline @flyarikair needs to be put on blast for the world to know the unprofessional and mediocre service they are operating. My advice is, if you @flyarikair cannot operate a decent service especially on an international flight it is better to CLOSE SHOP, than take our hard earned money in return for outright stupidity, that is THEFT!!!!! Flight for Accra was meant to leave at 7.20, after being treated as hungry refugees and hurried to check in, the unprofessional staff at check in had the audacity to hold on to my ticket and passport until I paid for excess luggage of 6kg!!! I was confused and frustrated, I got to the ticket office only to find out my passport and ticket were being withheld for a mere N6,000!!!! Are you kidding me???? The ticket to Ghana costs N135,000 and you withhold and international passport for about 5% of the cost of a ticket??? Are you that hungry and desperate for cash? If so…CLOSE SHOP Moving on, finally checked in only to find out the plane wasn’t even on ground….so what exactly was the fuss about??? After waiting for an hour the plane finally arrives….no apology…why would they apologise?? After all we are Nigerians right? We don’t deserve any form of courtesy??? You take what you get? No Arik…CLOSE SHOP. After arriving in Accra, to my surprise our suitcases did not arrive….please let me explain…NO SUITCASES were boarded on the flight….so about 50 passengers and NO SUITCASE on the conveyor belt??? Once again….no apology? Because we are animals right??? Tired and frustrated, we all left the airport on the promise that out suitcases will arrive on the 5pm flight…..can you guess what happened next??????? Our suitcases STILL not here…we are told it MAY be on the next flight or tomorrow morning????? You pathetic @flyarikair still have no form of decency to even apologise or find a solution. In my opinion your pathetic excuse of an airline @flyarikair needs to SHUT DOWN, you are HIGHLY INCOMPETENT! I don’t want an apology just give me my suitcases in ONE PIECE! Will NEVER fly this airline again, in my opinion #boycottarikair Do2dtun wrote: Ah! @flyarikair please give it up! Why I kept my cool until you did this today. I checked in my bag in Lagos to come to London and my wristwatch, bling Danshiki and Perfume were stolen. No issues, i kept my cool. Delayed the flight into London for 2 straight hours, I no talk. I paid for a Business class ticket but you didn’t think it was right to apologize when you changed the plane to a Boeing rubbish caravan that had no Entertainment system, had a bad announcer, chairs with no bed rest, no refunds etc ..

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: An unmanned Delta 4 rocket is launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Wednesday to put a communications satellite into orbit for the U.S. military and its partners, including Australia, which paid for the spacecraft and launch services. Liftoff of the sixth Wideband Global Satcom, or WGS, spacecraft took place Wednesday evening. The orbital network is used to relay television broadcasts, video conferences, images and other high-bandwidth data to and from ships, aircraft, ground forces, operations centers, the U.S. Department of State, the White House and select partners worldwide. In an unusual partnering arrangement with the U.S. Air Force, Australia paid $707 million for Boeing to build the satellite and for United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to put it into orbit. In exchange, Australia can use a percentage of the WGS network through 2029, when its 22-year agreement with the Air Force expires. The Air Force has a similar agreement in place with Canada, Denmark, Luxemburg, Netherlands and New Zealand, which are banding together to pay for the ninth WGS spacecraft. The U.S. military currently is seeking one or more partners to finance follow-on satellites.

provided by Insitu Oct 13, 2016, 07:00 ET Share this article BINGEN, Wash., Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ScanEagle N202SE was the first unmanned aircraft to perform an FAA-approved commercial beyond visual line of sight flight in the United States' National Airspace System. Now through a donation of the historic aircraft to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, visitors have the opportunity to view this ScanEagle and learn more about the part it has played in aviation history. Continue Reading ScanEagle N202SE completes the first-ever unmanned, FAA-approved commercial beyond visual line of sight flight. ScanEagle N202SE's most notable accomplishments are in commercial airspace, beginning with its historic first commercial flight on September 12, 2013. ScanEagle launched from the converted fishing vessel Westward Wind and completed a 36-minute flight over the Chukchi Sea off the northern Alaskan coast to gather data pertaining to ice floe forecasting. The flight was in collaboration with ConocoPhillips, Olgoonik Fairweather LLC, and Aldrich Offshore Services LLC. Most recently, ScanEagle N202SE conducted the first beyond visual line of sight commercial operation with a certified UAS in the contiguous 48 states. The event was part of a week-long supplemental track inspection operation for Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway, and took place between Belin and Clovis, New Mexico. The operations were in support of the FAA's "Pathfinder" initiative, a partnership with industry to explore the next steps in unmanned aircraft operations. "At a time when the unmanned aviation industry is advancing faster than ever, we take great pride in the pioneering work Insitu has done to help shape this path," said Ryan M. Hartman, Insitu president and CEO. "We are honored to be represented in the place that embodies the spirit of aviation that we strive for each day."   ScanEagle N202SE will reside in the Boeing Aviation Hangar at the museum's Steven F.

The test was conducted at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland to authorise KC-767A to refuel the US Navy F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, AV-8B Harrier and EA-6B Prowlers. The Italian Air Staff 3rd Department has appointed the Italian Flight Test Unit to support the testing and certification activities. The Italian Flying Test Unit collected the information required to authorise the US aircraft to refuel from ITAF's KC-767A. The refuelling trials were conducted for ten weeks, of which six were dedicated to flight testing. The Boeing-built KC-767A is a military aerial refuelling and strategic transport aircraft that is derived from 767-200ER twin-aisle jetliner. "The refuelling trials were conducted for ten weeks, of which six were dedicated to flight testing." The first KC-767 tankers have officially entered service with the ITAF in 2011. The ITAF accepted delivery of these tanker aircraft to replace the B-707T/T fleet. The KC-767 has an aerial refuelling boom with a remote aerial refuelling operator station, as well as wing pod and centerline hose and drogue systems, and a refuelling receptacle, Boeing said in a statement. It features an advanced two-person, all-digital flight deck, military avionics, navigation and communications, and an optional defensive aids suite with radar warning receivers and electronic and opto-electronic countermeasures.
