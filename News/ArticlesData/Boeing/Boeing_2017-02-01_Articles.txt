KUWAIT: Following the arrival of its first two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, in December 2016 and January 2017, Kuwait Airways, the official national carrier of the State of Kuwait, has welcomed the arrival of the third of 10 aircraft on order, landing at Kuwait International Airport (KWI) at 16:30 hours local time, on Tuesday. Sporting Kuwait Airways’ new livery and branding, the third wide-bodied, “Extended Range” aircraft has been named “Kathma” – following the theme of naming the new aircraft after place names in the country. Kathma is a town situated just North West of the capital, Kuwait City. The new Boeing 777-300ER will enter service within the week and will be immediately deployed on some of Kuwait Airways’ most popular, long-haul routes, including: New York, London, Paris and Rome; with other routes – namely to the airline’s Far East destinations – to have use of the new aircraft sometime during the upcoming Summer Schedule. The arrival of the third aircraft matches the schedule outlined between Kuwait Airways and Boeing to have all 10 aircraft delivered and in commercial service before the end of Q3 2017. Kuwait Airways’ “Transformation Strategy”, as revealed in September of last year, is the driving force behind the many changes and fleet additions being seen at the airline, over the last few months; additional fleet acquisitions with Airbus – 10 A350 and 15 A320neo aircraft – will also be part of a 35-strong fleet of brand new aircraft. The Airbus aircraft are set to start delivery in 2019. With these new additions, Kuwait Airways’ claim is that it will have the youngest commercial airline fleet, in the world, by 2021. “The ongoing progress we have been witnessing at Kuwait Airways, in recent months, is something of great pride that we want to share with the Kuwaiti people and the nation as a whole. These new fleet acquisitions are part of the bedrock of our new philosophy and commitment to see the official national carrier of Kuwait continue to grow market share, passenger numbers and regain its place as a competitive regional player in the aviation sector,” said Rasha Al-Roumi, Chairperson and CEO of Kuwait Airways. “I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders – and true patriots of Kuwait – who continue to offer their unwavering support for Kuwait Airways’ ambitions; a mission that will reassert a sense of pride in the official national carrier, as well as the country’s international standing in both the aviation and travel communities,” Roumi added.

The online retailer will open its own cargo air hub in Northern Kentucky, where it plans to employ 2,000 people, it announced today. The Amazon facility will be the eventual home to 40 Amazon Prime Air planes the company is leasing to transport packages between its own warehouses. Amazon said 16 of the planes are already in service. The Cincinnati Business Courier pegged the cost of the project at $1.49 billion and said Amazon is in line to get $40 million in tax incentives from local governments. The company has received approval to lease 900 acres in total, the publication reported. Amazon has said it began leasing planes to keep up with customer demand for packages that shipping partners like UPS can’t handle. CEO Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon isn’t trying to compete directly with UPS, though the Wall Street Journal has reported otherwise. The company’s foray into air cargo has come with some bumps. This holiday season, hundreds of pilots that operate Amazon’s planes went on strike to protest understaffing issues. Beyond planes, the company has bought thousands of its own truck trailers and is also starting to act as an ocean freight shipping operator to move goods between China and the U.S. Subscribe to the Recode Newsletter Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.

The U.S. Navy wants to arm its littoral combat ships with a missile engineered to meet certain technical specifications regarding its seeker, fire control mechanisms and fuze effects, service officials detailed. The Navy plans to solicit industry proposals for a new over-the-horizon attack missile able to attack targets at longer ranges and deliver a direct strike in some difficult scenarios, according to a draft Request For Proposal for the ship-launched missile system. Some of the major weapons being considered for this new weapon, which will arm the Littoral Combat Ship and emerging Navy Frigate include a Boeing-built Harpoon, Raytheon-Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile and a Lockheed high-tech Long Range Anti-Ship Missile. The draft RFP, outlining some of Navy requirements for the missile, calls for extensive simulations to explore certain desired technical parameters.   The simulations to include GPS-denied and extended GPS-denied environments; seeker discrimination; seeker aim-point determination; lethality to include specified fuze effects; fire-control launch sequencing; and mission planning software. To get such an advanced missile, the Navy is willing to make tradeoffs. “In order to promote full and open competition to the maximum extent practicable, the Navy intends to structure the RFP to allow for flexibility in meeting the missile range and Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP-C) requirements contained in the OTH-WS Top Level Requirements Document (TLRD),” the draft RFP says. The Navy says, “The intent is to allow the Government to potentially consider an award to an Offeror whose existing OTH-WS does not meet either the missile range or the SWaP-C TLRD requirement. Offerors will have the opportunity to propose improvements to their missile range or SWaP-C to meet the TLRD requirements. However, in order to be considered for award, the existing system must meet either missile range or SWaP-C requirements (i.e., an existing system that does not meet both the missile range and SWaP-C TLRD requirements will not be eligible for award).” The Navy wants the winner to “manufacture, assemble, test and deliver fire control systems, each consisting of an operator interface, a means of interfacing to the ship, means of interfacing to the launcher(s), and an engagement planning system, to include a Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System.” If the contractor’s existing OTH-WS does not meet either the defined range requirements or SWaP-C requirements, “then the contractor shall modify their system to meet all of the requirements listed in the TLRD. The draft calls for the winner to manufacture, assemble, test and deliver launching mechanisms (LMs) capable of storing and launching four encanistered missiles. “The LM may consist of one four-celled launcher or two two-celled launchers. Ship sets will range from one to four LMs to provide ships the capability to fire from four to 16 EMs. The draft also includes provisions for improved LMs. The draft RFP does cite some specifics for fire-control system components. “While the step ladder quantities for the Fire Control Suites … indicate a potential maximum ordering quantity of 42, the government expects to procure not more than 40 FCSs across all fiscal years,” the draft says. “While the ‘step ladder quantities; for the encanistered missiles … indicate a potential maximum ordering quantity of 671, the government expects to procure not more than 320 missiles across all fiscal years.” The proposal includes a provision to order a maximum of 105 test-configured encanistered Missiles (EM-T), the Navy expects to procure not more than 15 EM-Ts across all fiscal years. For inert operational missiles, the proposal indicates a potential maximum ordering quantity of 56, the Navy expects to procure not more than eight IOMs across all fiscal years. The actual RFP was expected to be released by the end of January, will now likely be delayed by a week or more, according to industry officials and defense analysts familiar with the program. Naval Sea Systems Command says it is waiting for the precise date of the RFP release. The missile system, expected to provide offensive punch for small Navy surface combatants that has been lacking, say admirals in charge of operational forces.

In the battle between corporate crony kingpins Boeing and Big Labor (in this case IAM, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers) we don’t know who to support. On the one hand, unions are cancers – “sucking the life out of every industry they infect,” as we’ve previously noted.  Of course crony capitalism is another form of cancer, infecting our healthy free market and fostering all sorts of corruption. Not to mention starving taxpayers – and by extension the consumer economy – of the oxygen it needs to grow and thrive. Speaking of starving, Boeing has received more than $1 billion in incentives from South Carolina taxpayers for its North Charleston, S.C. facility – which has struggled to keep its schedule for producing the company’s next-generation passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. No doubt those incentives have benefited Boeing shareholders, but what have they done to improve the broader South Carolina economy? We believe the answer to that question is “not much.” Crony capitalism doesn’t work, people.  Just look at South Carolina’s low-paying jobs, low incomes and weak economic growth as evidence. Anyway, IAM made its initial bid to unionize Boeing’s South Carolina plant back in early 2015 – but ultimately withdrew its petition before a vote could be held. News of the initial IAM unionization push was exclusively reported by this website back in August of 2014. Our sources described this first foray as “a probing action,” intended to “gather information and to test Boeing’s defenses.” What about the latest effort? (Click to view) (Via IAM) More than 3,000 Boeing employees will participate in an election on February 15 to determine whether they wish to unionize – or “to have a voice in the workplace,” according to IAM organizer Mike Evans (above). This vote – which will be conducted under the auspices of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) – is not expected to go the way the IAM wants. “Boeing is in a much better place than it was last time and the union has made no progress,” a source close to the vote tells us.  “Additionally, when the union came last time it was taking a baseline temperature – and (that) baseline was pretty poor for the union.  So I’m not worried about it.” That sentiment was echoed by the state’s manufacturing leaders – who unilaterally oppose the IAM’s unionization bid. “I don’t think the IAM is well organized to get a win,” one told us. Interesting … Supporters of Boeing and the IAM have been blanketing the Palmetto Lowcountry with television, radio, internet and other advertisements – hoping to sway workers to their side in these critical days leading up to the big vote. Will it matter?  According to our sources, “no.”  The outcome is a “done deal,” they tell us. If Boeing prevails, it would not only be a big win for the company, it would mark a political victory for new S.C. governor Henry McMaster – who took office last month after Nikki Haley left to become America’s next ambassador to the United Nations. Haley built her political brand in no small measure on aggressive anti-union advocacy, although as we noted that position was rarely consistent with the facts. For workers to reject a union during the first month of McMaster’s tenure would give him an opportunity to brand himself as Haley did. Ironically, a Boeing win would also represent a political victory for Catherine Templeton – a Charleston, S.C. labor lawyer who is still considering running against McMaster for governor in 2018.

Go For Launch Willing to hear your thoughts about Pluto News NASA, Space and Science Go For Launch A first look at the path NASA astronauts will walk when the U.S. launches humans into space again New space suits for commercial craft astronauts When NASA’s Commercial Crew Astronauts make their first trip to the International Space Station aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, they’ll be outfitted in new custom-designed spacesuits. When NASA’s Commercial Crew Astronauts make their first trip to the International Space Station aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, they’ll be outfitted in new custom-designed spacesuits. Christian Davenport, (c) 2017, The Washington Post Privacy Policy CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - They'll take the elevator 175 feet above the shoreline, then march 15 steps across the platform and another 13 down the grated gangplank to the double doors that open to a small white room. There the astronauts will make their final preparations, adjust their space suits, check their equipment, before stepping into the spacecraft. This is the walk the astronauts will take as part of the NASA's effort to restore human spaceflight to U.S. soil by 2018, ending an ignominious hiatus that has endured since the space shuttle was retired in 2011. Now, NASA is depending on two commercial companies-Boeing and SpaceX- to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station, under contracts worth billions. Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post The crew access arm extends from the newly-built tower at Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

Ebenhack for The Washington Post) Both companies have faced technical and design challenges that have forced them to push back the dates of their initial flights- delays that could prove costly. But there are growing signs that the companies are making progress, and this week Boeing opened up some of its new facilities here for the first time, and unveiled its new space suit, for a glimpse of what's to come. The a new crew tower at Launch Complex 41, the last place on Earth the astronauts will walk before stepping into the company's Starliner spacecraft, is one example of the company's progress. It's a massive structure, made of 1.4 million pounds of steel, that adds yet another point to the cape's skyline and offers a Penthouse-like view of the shoreline. Boeing has also built a new mission control room at the Kennedy Space Center, with rows of computer consoles that will one day monitor the rocket's health, its avionics and communications, its fuel and navigation systems. Astronaut Sunita Williams Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post Astronaut Sunita Williams stands on the roof of the newly-built tower at Launch Complex 41 during an exclusive look at some of the things that Boeing is doing as they prepare to fly astronauts from their facilities in Cape Canaveral, Fla.

(Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) Then there's the new sleek and blue Boeing spacesuit that at 20 pounds, weighs 10 pounds lighter than the one worn by shuttle astronauts. It comes with gloves that work on touch screens, and light-weight boots designed by Reebok that feel like slippers. Instead of having a huge fish-bowl bubble helmet, as the shuttle astronauts did, the new suit's helmet slips over the head like a hood. "We like to think this represents the future of what protective space gear will be," said Chris Ferguson, a former NASA astronaut who is now Boeing's director of crew and mission systems. Because it's so lightweight and flexible, the former Navy fighter pilot said, "it feels a lot more like a flight suit than a spacesuit." Elon Musk's SpaceX is designing its own suit, which it has not yet unveiled. But just across the cape, SpaceX has made visible progress with its new launch site, the historic pad 39A that was used during the Apollo and shuttle eras. That launch site, which years ago was rusting away in the salt air, has been completely renovated. Nearby, the company has built a massive hangar for its rockets that has the SpaceX logo emblazoned across it-a potent symbol that the private sector is putting its stamp on the venerable government facility. SpaceX plant at Cape Canaveral Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post A SpaceX processing building sits next to Launch Pad 39-A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. MUST CREDIT: Photo for The Washington Post by . A SpaceX processing building sits next to Launch Pad 39-A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. MUST CREDIT: Photo for The Washington Post by . (Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) SpaceX plans to christen the pad within days, launching the first rocket from 39A since the last shuttle mission, some six years ago. The work by SpaceX and Boeing are part of a broader effort to transform the Cape Canaveral from an area once dominated by the government, to what NASA calls a "multi-user spaceport," one that is home to several commercial companies. Jeffrey Bezos' Blue Origin is also leasing a launch site here. The company is also building a massive 750,000 square foot facility where it wants to build its New Glenn rocket, which it plans to fly from here by the end of the decade. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Moon Express, which is vying to land a spacecraft on the moon as part of the Google Lunar X Prize, has also had a partnership with NASA to test its lunar lander at the Kennedy Space Center. But nothing will represent the cape's renaissance more than the return of human spaceflight from its shores. Currently Boeing and SpaceX are competing to see which company will fly first. SpaceX says its first test flight with passengers on board is scheduled for May 2018. Boeing plans to make its first uncrewed flight in June 2018, with a two-person test flight in December of that year. Both companies, however, have faced delays that NASA's inspector general office warned last year could force NASA to buy more seats from the Russians, who now take U.S. astronauts to the station. The IG found that the cost Russia charged to ferry U.S. astronauts jumped 384 percent over the last decade, growing from $21.3 million in 2006 to $81.9 million last year. In its report, the watchdog said it believed that neither company would "achieve certified, crewed flight to the ISS until late 2018." In the past, funding shortfalls led to the delays, the IG said. But "technical challenges with the contractors' spacecraft designs are now driving the schedule slippages," it said. Boeing's spacecraft, the Starliner, has had problems with its mass and the effects of vibrations during launch. SpaceX's delays came when it changed its capsule design to land in the water instead of on land, it said. Boeing's Ferguson said that, "turning from the design effort to the manufacturing effort became more of a challenge than we anticipated." The company has "slogged through some of the real engineering challenges, and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it's time to get on to the rubber meeting the road," he said. Sunita Williams, one of four NASA astronauts chosen to fly on the first commercial flights, said she is "pumped" by the prospect of launching again from American soil. "We're getting closer and closer," she said. But she acknowledged that the companies still have "a long road and they have a lot to do. But I am really encouraged and excited at the pace at which both companies are taking this challenge. . . . Things are ticking along. It's going to happen."

Pearlman, collectSPACE.com Editor | January 31, 2017 01:14pm ET MORE Chris Ferguson, Boeing director of crew and mission systems and a former astronaut, checks out the new, blue Starliner spacesuit in a mockup of the company's commercial crew spacecraft. Credit: Boeing A new astronaut garb has grabbed attention for its distinctive blue color, but for those familiar with history, it shares the shade with spacesuits past. The Boeing Company recently revealed its new pressure garment that NASA crews and commercial passengers will wear for flights on board its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, starting as soon as 2018. The suit, which features Reebok-inspired footwear and touchscreen compatible gloves, was designed to be lighter and less bulky than prior launch and entry outfits. And it is blue. "It feels good to walk around in Boeing Blue," stated Chris Ferguson, Boeing's director of CST-100 Starliner crew and mission systems and a former astronaut who commanded the final space shuttle mission. "Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle." [Boeing's Awesome New Spacesuit in Pictures] Blue is Boeing's dominant trademark color and it matches elements of the Starliner's interior. Astronauts will wear the dark-hue, form fitting suit during launch and re-entry. They will sport either a Boeing logo or a NASA insignia patch — depending on who they represent — on the right shoulder, an American flag on the left, and Starliner patch and name tags across the front. Permanent logos are sewn into the spacesuit's fabric while mission-specific emblems attach by Velcro, said Boeing. Beyond its aesthetic appearance, the Starliner suit sports zippers to increase comfort and shed weight, and features a hood-like soft helmet with a wide polycarbonate visor for expanded peripheral vision. Overall, the garment provides greater pressurized mobility and is about 40 percent lighter than previous spacesuits. Clad in blue Although the public might think of silver, white and orange as the more traditional colors of spacesuits, the company behind Boeing's Starliner attire has worked in blue fabrics before. The David Clark Company pioneered spacesuit design by developing the pressure garments worn on the X-1 and X-15 rocket planes and later, the suits donned by the Gemini astronauts. More recently, it produced the launch and entry suits used by space shuttle crews and the full pressure suit worn by Felix Baumgartner for the Red Bull Stratos high-altitude, supersonic skydive in 2012. [Watch: Boeing's Bold Blue Starliner Spacesuits] David Clark also designed the pilot's protective assembly worn to fly Lockheed Martin's U-2 and SR-71 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. Although the suit was more often seen with a yellow-gold outer layer, the company did make prototypes and at least one model in blue, based upon the desire by U.S. Air Force pilots (according to "Dressing for Altitude" by Dennis Jenkins, 2012, NASA). The company modified its high-altitude suit for use on the space shuttle in the wake of the 1986 loss of space shuttle Challenger. Although, ultimately, all of the launch and entry suits astronauts wore into space had bright orange Nomex covers — better to assist in search and rescue efforts had the crew needed to ditch into the ocean in an abort — the first suits David Clark delivered to NASA in 1987 sported dark blue exteriors. The STS-26 and STS-27 crews, which were the first to fly after the Challenger tragedy, trained for their missions with the blue suits.  STS-27 crew members train for their mission inside a space shuttle simulator wearing both the orange and blue versions of the launch and entry suits produced by the David Clark Co. in 1987.

When the U.S. Air Force needed spacesuits for its Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), a planned space station based on Gemini and Titan vehicles for classified reconnaissance — it turned to Hamilton Standard (now UTC Aerospace) in 1967. [The Evolution of the Spacesuit in Photos] Although they never flew in space, at least 15 of the model MH-7 suits — some with a blue nylon outer layer — were built for training before the program was canceled in 1969. Hamilton Standard was also part of the team that designed and manufactured the suits for NASA's Apollo program to send astronauts to the moon. The lunar suits would become iconic for their bulky, white look, however, their restraint layer — the fabric under the exterior cover that gave the suit its shape and included the mobility elements needed to enable the astronaut to move — was in fact, blue. Early Apollo crews trained for their missions while wearing the "blue" spacesuits, sans their white Beta cloth layer. Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman, Bill Anders and Jim Lovell take part in recovery training wearing prototype spacesuits. Credit: NASA Boeing Blue Boeing considered other color combinations before settling on solid "Boeing Blue." "The final Boeing spacesuit design required a significant amount of give and take from those who provided input," stated Boeing in a company publication. "A blue and white suit was considered but it wasn't as cost-effective as one that was all blue." Though not the only spacesuits to sport the hue, Boeing's Starliner garments will become the first blue pressure suits to enter orbit in the next few years.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. Meets Guidance in 2016; Issues Increased 2017 Guidance for Revenue, EPS, and Cash 1 February 2017Military News WICHITA, Kan., Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Fourth Quarter 2016 Results Full-Year 2016 Results Issues Full-Year 2017 Guidance – Absorbs rate changes announced by OEMs Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc., [NYSE: SPR] reported fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results driven by strong operating performance of mature programs. „2016 was a strong year for Spirit,” Spirit President and CEO Tom Gentile said.  „We successfully negotiated a global settlement with Airbus on the A350, refinanced our debt after achieving an investment grade credit rating, returned $650 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases, initiated our first dividend of $0.10 per share, made a seamless leadership transition, and laid the groundwork for a successful 2017.” Revenue Spirit’s fourth quarter 2016 revenue was $1.6 billion, down by two percent compared to the same period of 2015, primarily driven by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 and 777 programs, partially offset by higher activity on non-recurring programs. Revenue for the full year increased two percent to $6.8 billion, primarily due to higher production deliveries on the Airbus A350 XWB and Boeing 767 programs, partially offset by lower revenue recognized due to the impact of pricing terms on the Boeing 787 program and lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 program. (Table 1) „I am proud of the way the Spirit team executed in 2016. We overcame several challenges and operationally did better than 2015. We delivered a record 1,583 shipsets compared to 1,457 shipsets in the prior year. The number includes 127 787s, 96 777s, 500 737s, 69 A350s, and 574 A320s,” Gentile added. Spirit’s backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was approximately $47 billion, with work packages on all commercial platforms in the Boeing and Airbus backlog. Earnings Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $161 million, compared to $206 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to one-time incentive payments received in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating income for the full year was $725 million, compared to $863 million in 2015, with the decrease primarily resulting from forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter reported EPS was $0.89, compared to $1.01 EPS (or $0.95 adjusted EPS* excluding the impact of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance) in the same period of 2015. Full-year EPS was $3.70 (or $4.56 adjusted EPS* excluding the impact of certain one-time items), compared to $5.66 EPS (or $3.92 adjusted EPS* excluding the impact of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance) in 2015. (Table 1) „In the fourth quarter, our operations in Kinston, North Carolina, were impacted by the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew resulting in higher abnormal operating costs of $12.1 million, equivalent to approximately $0.07 of EPS. We are submitting appropriate claims with our insurers,” Gentile said. Cash Free cash flow* in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $45 million, compared to $177 million (or adjusted free cash flow* of $131 million, adjusted to remove the impact of the 787 interim pricing agreement) in the same quarter last year. Full-year free cash flow* was $463 million, compared to $930 million in 2015. Full-year adjusted free cash flow* (adjusted to remove the impact of the 787 interim pricing agreement) was $420 million in 2016, compared to $738 million in 2015. (Table 2) Cash balance at the end of the year was $698 million, reflecting the purchase of 14.2 million common shares for $650 million during the year. The company’s $650 million revolving credit facility remained undrawn at the end of the year. „Despite no share repurchases in the fourth quarter due to the uncertainty from the presidential election and our limited trading window, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. We have our entire authorization of up to $600 million available as we enter 2017,” Gentile commented. Financial Outlook and Risk to Future Financial Results „A major focus in 2017 will revolve around executing our supply chain strategy, improving our productivity, digitizing our shop floor, and meeting our customers’ requirements for production rate changes,” Gentile concluded. Risks to our financial guidance are described more fully in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release and in the „Risk Factors” sections of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Segment Results Fuselage Systems Fuselage Systems segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $819 million, which was slightly lower than the same period last year, due to lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 and 777 programs, partially offset by higher production deliveries on the Boeing 737 and 767 programs and higher activity on non-recurring programs. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 15.6 percent as compared to 17.5 percent during the same period of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recorded pretax ($6.8) million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on mature programs and net forward losses of ($0.4) million. Propulsion Systems Propulsion Systems segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased seven percent from the same period last year to $404 million, driven by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 and 777 programs and lower net revenues recognized on the Boeing 787 program in accordance with pricing terms, partially offset by higher revenue recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 18.6 percent as compared to 22.8 percent during the same period of 2015. Year-over-year change was primarily driven by one-time incentive payments received in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the segment recorded pretax $3.0 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on mature programs and $4.1 million of favorable changes in estimates on forward loss programs. Wing Systems Wing Systems segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 slightly decreased by one percent from the same period last year to $347 million, primarily due to lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 program, lower wing-related activity on the Boeing 777 program and lower non-recurring revenue on certain Boeing programs, partially offset by higher net revenues recognized on the Boeing 787 due to model mix. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 14.1 percent as compared to 10.7 percent during the same period of 2015. Year-over-year change was primarily driven by charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the segment recorded pretax $7.6 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on mature programs.

Appendix Management believes that the non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures (indicated by *) used in this report provide investors with important perspectives into the company’s ongoing business performance. The company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently. Free cash flow is defined as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Management considers special items, which may include termination charges, settlement charges and other items that arise from time to time, to be outside the ordinary course of our operations. Management believes that excluding these items provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s operating performance and allows more accurate comparisons of the Company’s operating results to historical performance. The tables below provide reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures which have been adjusted for special items. *Non-GAAP financial measure, see Appendix for reconciliation   SOURCE Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.

This 1997 Flight Sim Let You Fly the F-35 Years Before It Was Ready I first flew the F-35 as a nine-year-old. Flying at 20,000ft above the scorched Afghan landscape, my F-35 Lightning II's active radar lights up and a nearby AWACS E-3D Sentry chimes in with an updated threat-picture of the target area. A duo of Russian Su-27 fighters have seemingly appeared out of the dunes 50 nautical miles northwest of us. I order my three wingmen to break off, hit the deck and deal with the bandits. I stay on course, however, diving to 2,000ft while activating my Joint Strike Fighter's next generation synthetic object overlay to map the rolling dunes ahead of me. Stealth is the name of the game in this mission, and flying as low as I can will help surprise the enemy. Closing in, I break the contoured lines of the F-35's sleek body by opening up the internal weapons bay. My radar signature blooms, alerting a nearby Russian SA-13 missile system, but it's already too late for my target. Video games are a befitting home futuristic technologies, and flight simulators in particular have a legacy of putting avid gamers in the pilot's seat of next-generation fighter jets. F-19 Stealth Fighter for DOS, released in 1988, let players soar in what was essentially a Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk before it was even revealed to the public (the F-19 was based off a Testor's model kit that predicted America's next stealth fighter), while NovaLogic's F-22 Raptor flight sim was released just one month after the fifth-generation fighter's first ever flight in September 1997. So to me, a nine-year-old, budding pilot learning to fly in his bedroom in the late 1990s, getting the chance to strap into the cockpits of two relatively unheard of, cutting-edge fighter jets designated the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 was a tantalizing prospect. * I found my old copy of the 1997 PC game Joint Strike Fighter a few weeks ago whilst staying at my childhood home over Christmas. I remember vividly the day my dad bought it for me for around £2 at a local boot sale. It must have been around 1999.  My parents dutifully keep anything that they think may be of nostalgic worth, and this was the jackpot, hidden in a box of other games next to my bed. I loved this game so miuch, and what with the current presidential fracas surrounding the F-35—in which President Trump has forced Lockheed Martin to the bargaining table after suggesting Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet could do a better job—the find seemed timely. Delving into the box, I flicked through all of the physical paraphernalia that came as standard with video games before the digital age: manuals, maps, jewel CD case, a quick tips reference card. Would it still work? Inside the cockpit of the X-35 over the Korean Peninsula. Image: Ben Sullivan "Let me just rewind, this is a long time ago," laughs Rune Spaans, who's speaking to me over Skype from his home in Oslo, Norway. It's been two decades since Rune was lead designer on the first ever game about the then-mysterious Lockheed Martin F-35 (then designated the X-35), and its Joint Strike Fighter program competitor the Boeing X-32. "My first job was doing video games for a company in Norway called Funcom," says Rune. "We were at this little group in Funcom working for Nintendo, and Nintendo weren't that happy with the company, so [Nintendo] asked if we wanted to start our own company with them helping us out with finding an investor. So we did that, back in 1997. And I was the only graphic artist, together with...it must have been five programmers I think, and a producer. We then started looking for game ideas amongst ourselves." That company was called Innerloop Studios (which actually started in 1996, sorry Rune), and the team possessed some brand new graphics technology to flaunt to the gaming world. The team, including Rune heading up the art direction, graphics, and 3D design, set to task deciding what type of game could best demonstrate this new graphics technology. "The programmers had made this amazing landscape technology that was fractal based, and that could progressively add detail as you moved closer to the surface of the landscape," remembers Rune. "We were looking for games that would work with that technology. I think one game we thought about was a sports game, and there was possibly a war strategy game, and then there was this airplane game idea. We started thinking about those great flight games we played on the early PC and Amiga." "We started out in these free offices in a shopping mall. It was here we did the game pitches," says Rune. Image: Rune Spaans Rune mentions flight sim classics such as A-10 Tank Killer and Strike Commander as inspirations for their yet-to-be decided Joint Strike Fighter simulation. I also namedrop F/A-18 Hornet, my own first flight sim experience. "We really liked those games and I remember airplane games at that time were turning into pretty hardcore simulations," he says. "There was this trend of simulations becoming more and more real, even though that was pretty much impossible with the computing power we had back then. We had to fake everything anyway, but still. That was the way everything was going." Rune recalls how the team at Innerloop Studios had a basic game text for a flight simulator, when the game studio's new publisher, Eidos, bought into the idea. "I'm thinking that [Joint Strike Fighter] might have actually been suggested from the publisher because our producer took all these game ideas and travelled around in the US trying to get an investor for our company, and Eidos, who ended up purchasing half our company, well they really fell for the flight simulator idea." In 1997, the Joint Strike Fighter program was already four years into development, but the Pentagon was still three years away from eventually selecting a winner out of the two remaining competitors: Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Having already fended off McDonnell Douglas and Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Boeing were vying for the favor of the Department of Defense with their radical prototypes for a fifth-generation fighter aircraft that could be flown from conventional airbases as well as aircraft carriers, and eventually replace America's F-16, A-10, and F/A-18 aircraft: the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35. "My desk. I had one machine with DOS for 3D modeling, and one with Windows for testing the game and using Photoshop," says Rune. Image: Rune Spaans "Actually, I think it was almost starting to be public, because we had this consultant who helped us out to do research. I think it was just starting to come out, and to me it was completely new," says Rune. "We talked about the competition going on between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, so we thought it would be fun to have both those planes in the game, so that the player could decide for themselves which one was best." And that decision was a joy. Sitting somewhere between hardcore flight sim and an arcade-style flight sim, JSF came bundled with a wealth of technical information as well as cockpit options, many of which fell beyond the grasp of my immature brain. The game came with four physical maps representing the four theaters of war in-game (Afghanistan, Korea, Russia, and Columbia), and a hefty flight manual that includes a detailed history of the JSF program as well as cockpit tutorials and information on in-game vehicles. Clickable MFDs (multi-function displays) in the cockpit made for an immersive gaming experience, as well as new concept technologies such as a Satellite Landing System and advanced night vision.  Players could fly alongside three wingmen in quick dogfights or get stuck in on multi-sortie missions in the campaign mode that came with its very own mission editor. The maps felt alive, too. There were cities, ports, armored columns of targets. Weather effects were modelled, as well as a day and night cycle. One particularly fun, yet time wasting, easter egg was the ability for your pilot to walk around on the ground with a pistol after having ejected. It served no purpose, but showed off the impressive level terrain detail. It was an outstanding feat for the small studio, based out of their native Norway, and is a milestone simulator in my video gaming personal history. "We were a super small team, we all actually took a part of the manual and wrote it. I actually wrote the part about enemy aircraft. I think there were around ten people working on the game," recollects Rune. As the chief designer, Rune's job was to design two airframes with very little information available. Unlike most other aircraft, it was pretty hard to be get hold of accurate images of the JSF prototypes, but Rune says he managed to find a few low-resolution photographs online, with the consultant for Eidos helping to bring in other images needed for the project. "This is the kind of images our US plane expert would send us, and we would update our game every time we got these bits of info," says Rune." Image: Rune Spaans Map designer Johan Basberg and programmer Thomas Hagen discussing the game. Image: Rune Spaans It paid off. Joint Strike Fighter was released to positive reviews. Gamespot said the game had "most detailed, fluid, impressive graphics of any combat simulation" then available, while this reviewer noted that the "flight model is good, featuring stalls, damage, speed bleeds in turns, and angle-of-attack effects". Obviously, the flight model had to be completely hypothetical as Rune and his team were trying to emulate a still experimental aircraft, but for 1997, the game was to many ahead of its time, both content-wise and for graphics. * Fast forward twenty years, and the Joint Strike Fighter program, now in the form of the Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II, hasn't quite turned out how many people thought it would back in 1997. Dogged by overspending, delays, and software issues, it was only in January of this year when the F-35 was for the first time deployed by the United States military overseas, 24 years after it started development. Rune's native Norway hasn't had the smoothest ride with the F-35, either, with spiraling costs and delays worrying Norway's government ahead of its F-16 fighter phase out. "I'm divided on the F-35. Politically I am very opposed to it, but personally I think it's a beautiful plane," says Rune. "But it's a huge cut into our small national budget and I don't see the point of Norway having it. Norway has this weird duality, because we have the Nobel prize and we work really hard with peacekeeping in the Middle East, but then we have one of the biggest weapons manufacturers in the world—Kongsberg Gruppen. I think there's a bit of paranoia here since we're so close to the Russian border. There's lots of pressure from NATO in terms of having a certain size of military." "When you completed the game with the F-35. I made it purposefully downbeat, even added a whip behind the back of the colonel," says Rune. Image: Rune Spaans A Boeing X-32 in the Afghanistan campaign. Image: Ben Sullivan But, while Norway still waits for its first F-35 Lightning II delivery, it's clear it's not something that's been troubling Rune. Since finishing up on the JSF game, and helping to create a few more Innerloop games such as Extreme Sports for the Sega Dreamcast, Rune left the company in 1999 to pursue a career in film and illustration. Most recently, Rune says he's turned to directing, winning an award for the best children's film at the 2015 Norwegian International Film Festival. Just before that, Rune helped create a particularly memorable moment in the successful Norwegian monster mockumentary Trollhunter. "I was responsible for the troll that's on the bridge," smiles Rune. As for myself, while not a fighter pilot, I like to think I've kept up with the latest and greatest in the world of flight simulators. I'm now mostly proficient in flying the A-10 Warthog and F-15 Eagle in the ruthlessly accurate sim Digital Combat Simulator. As is obvious from some of the images, I managed to get my 20-year-old copy of Joint Strike Fighter up and running on a Windows 10 machine especially for this article. The nostalgia flooded back instantly, it's time to fly the F-35 again. Main image: The programmers in a London cab, heading for the European Computer Trade Show to demo the game for the first time.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 1 February 2017 | MYT 5:00 PM Trump travel ban stirs faint corporate outcry beyond Silicon Valley Walking on eggshells: A file photo of Trump with PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, Cook, Oracle CEO Safra Catz and Musk during a meeting with technology leaders at Trump Tower in New York on Dec 14, 2016. While many tech leaders have openly denounced Trump's ban, many of their counterparts in other industries either declined comment or responded with company statements reiterating their commitment to diversity. — Reuters NEW YORK/BOSTON: Most US corporate bosses have stayed silent on President Donald Trump's immigration curbs, underscoring the sensitivities around opposing policies that could provoke a backlash from the White House.  While the leaders of Apple Inc, Google and Facebook Inc e-mailed their staff to denounce the suspension of the US refugee programme and the halting of arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries, many of their counterparts in other industries either declined comment or responded with company statements reiterating their commitment to diversity.  The difference in response shows the pressure large swathes of corporate America faces to avoid tussling publicly with the new administration.  Companies such as aircraft maker Boeing Co and automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co have already had run-ins with Trump over other issues, and they have much at stake in policy decisions that the administration will make on tax, trade and regulatory matters.  Before office, Trump attacked Boeing over the cost of the future Air Force One programme. Boeing chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg met with him earlier this month and said he and Trump had made progress on the Air Force One issue and the potential sale of fighter aircraft.  Representatives from Boeing, General Motors and Ford declined to comment on Trump's immigration curbs.  Wall Street, meanwhile, is hoping the new administration will ease some of the regulations introduced in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis and adopt a lighter touch in their enforcement.  Industries including banking, healthcare and auto manufacturing “see themselves on the cusp of a new era of deregulation, and they do not want to do anything that would offend the new emperor,” said Cornelius Hurley, director of Boston University’s Centre for Finance, Law & Policy.  So far, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, is the only major US bank boss to speak out directly against the executive order.  "This is not a policy we support," Blankfein said in a message sent to staff on Sunday evening. "Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be."  Representatives of Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Trump's immigration order.  Wells Fargo & Co said in a statement that it was reviewing the executive order and its implications for staff and its business.  JPMorgan Chase & Co's Operating Committee, which includes CEO Jamie Dimon, sent a note to staff saying it was reaching out to all employees affected and noted that the country was, “strengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us.”  To be sure, some CEOs were more outspoken.  Nike Inc CEO Mark Parker said the company did not support the executive order.  "Nike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the power of diversity," he said in a statement. "Those values are being threatened by the recent executive order in the US banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven Muslim-majority countries."  Brent Saunders, CEO of US drugmaker Allergan Plc, tweeted: "Oppose any policy that puts limitations on our ability to attract the best & diverse talent."  But many boardrooms kept quiet. Representatives for some energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp, for example, declined to comment.  Good corporate citizens  As the idea of corporate social responsibility has taken root, so companies have increasingly championed a range of causes, including gay rights, diverse workplaces and a global view.  Many in corporate America are still trying to work out how to deal with a new government that takes a more conservative stance on some social issues and has an anti-globalisation platform.  Those non-tech companies that did issue statements over the weekend tended to emphasise their role as good corporate citizens rather than openly criticise Trump's policies.  Starbucks Corp CEO Howard Schultz has put the coffee chain in the national spotlight before, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.  In a letter to employees, he said Starbucks was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years across dozens of countries, but he did not directly criticise Trump's order.  “I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack,” he wrote.  In his statement, General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt told staff that the company would engage with the US government.  "We will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and Congress, and reiterate the importance of this issue to GE and to the business community overall," he wrote.  One of the most immediate ways for corporate bosses to communicate with Trump about the immigration order will be the first meeting of his advisory panel of business leaders next week.  Of the 19 leaders on that panel, only two, Elon Musk, who founded Tesla Motors Inc and SpaceX, and Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc, have spoken out against Trump's immigration curbs.  A spokeswoman for Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief executive of Blackstone Group LP whom Trump tasked to set up and chair the panel, declined to comment. — Reuters You May Be Interested Irish calculation similar to EU on Apple tax estimate: minister Microsoft asks for exception programme on Trump orders Facebook, Microsoft said to circulate immigration open letter Amazon profit jumps while revenue misses mark Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Apple to expand iconic NYC ‘Cube’ store in lift for Fifth Avenue Others Also Read U.S. warns North Korea of 'overwhelming' response if nuclear arms used Former MIC legal adviser Selva Mookiah awarded datukship Fishermen who saved 20 from boat mishap get RM2,000 advertisement Latest News Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Snap signed five-year, US$2bil deal to use Google’s Cloud Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough Most Viewed in Tech Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

The fate of a landmark deal for Boeing to sell 80 passenger aircraft to Iran has been thrown into doubt following President Donald Trump’s executive order barring travel by Iranians to the US. Boeing announced a $16.6 billion agreement with the national carrier Iran Air in December, saying the orders were on course to support nearly 100,000 new jobs in the United States. The deal, however, has already run into opposition in the Republican-run Congress and Trump's travel ban further makes it impossible for pilots, cabin staff and maintenance crews to enter the US for training. And given the kind of people who have gathered around Trump - from 13 pro-Israeli politicians in his administration to anti-Iran aides - the agreement might be headed for his chopping block. "We think the president's travel ban could have negative implications for orders from Iran and Iraq," James Corridore, an aerospace analyst at CFRA Research, has been quoted as saying. Boeing issued a statement Monday in response to media inquiries. “We’re continuing to assess any impact the executive order might have and are closely monitoring congressional, administration and judicial actions,” a spokesman said. Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan has warned that Iran would seek return of "prepayments with interest" if the Boeing deal were thwarted by Trump’s administration. The aircraft have to be delivered over 10 years, beginning in 2018. The agreement includes orders for 50 narrow-body 737 passenger jets and 30 wide-body 777 aircraft. Boeing has said the deal was reached under the conditions of a US government license issued in September. A Boeing 747-200 of flag carrier Iran Air undergoes repair work in a hangar at Tehran's Mehrabad airport in this file photo from September 2002. (Photo by Getty Images) While the value of the contract has been put at $16.6 billion, Fakhrieh Kashan has said it may be worth only half that given the type of orders and the specifications Iran has chosen. Iran, a country of 80 million people, is a critical market for Boeing which is in the midst of cost-cutting in its commercial aircraft division and facing tough competition from Airbus. Airbus has a deal with Iran Air for the delivery of 98 aircraft, including 46 single-aisle airplanes and 52 wide-body jets, worth about $8.4 billion. It rushed to deliver the first airplane to Iran in January, making the deal a fait accompli. According to vice president with industry consulting firm Avitas Adam Pilarski, Airbus was smart. “They immediately delivered a plane, so it’s hard to step back,” he was quoted as saying Tuesday. The first of the airliners, a brand new 189-seater of the A321 type, flew into Tehran last month. On Tuesday, Iran’s Transport Minister Abbas Akhundi said two more Airbus aircraft will join the Iranian fleet in the next four weeks. A new Airbus A321 passenger aircraft, Iran's first direct purchase since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, arrives at Tehran's Mehrabad airport on Jan. 12, 2017.  On Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault traveled to Tehran with a trade delegation to assure Iran of Europe's support for better relations. He said a deal between ATR with Iran Air for the sale of at least 20 turboprop aircraft was "practically sealed."  As for Boeing, Pilarski said the travel ban could be bypassed and waivers granted if the Trump administration chose to let the group sell airplanes to Iran but he saw it unlikely. “During the election campaign, Trump and a number of people close to him said they hate the Iran nuclear deal,” said Pilarksi. “A number of his military advisers have been strongly anti-Iran.” Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst with the Teal Group, was even more alarmist, saying he believed Trump might reinstate the sanctions the US agreed to lift under a nuclear deal with Iran in January 2016. “My assumption has been they are going to re-impose sanctions, so it’s probably dead anyway,” he said.

Facebook Twitter Telegram Google Reddit LinkedIn Home » News & Views » Business and Economy » Trump Negotiates Down 90 F-35s by $600 Million By: David Israel Published: February 1st, 2017 Facebook Twitter Telegram Google Reddit LinkedIn Printer-Ready Page Layout Several U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II aircraft fly in formation Photo Credit: U.S. Department of Defense President Donald Trump says he managed to cut down the price of 90 Lockheed Martin F-35s be $600 million, using his White House advantage, US media reported. But despite the manufacturer’s reported surrender, the president is still asking Boeing to compete with their own stealth fighter. Israel should pay close attention, seeing as it is one of Lockheed Martin’s biggest customers for the F-35s. “I got involved in that about a month ago,” Trump small business owners in a White House meeting last Monday. “They were having a lot of difficulty, there was no movement,” he added, “I was able to get $600 million off of those planes.” Doing the math, this would mean a $6.67 million cut for every F-35s in that particular contract, although it isn’t clear whether the president’s reported victory was real – Lockheed had already committed to cutting the cost of its F-35A down to between $80 and $85 million per aircraft by Fiscal 2019. The original price tag was more than $102 million when the Obama Administration was doing the shopping. “I appreciate Lockheed martin for being responsive and that will be appreciated,” Trump says.   The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016   On December 12, 2016, Trump tweeted: “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.”   Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016   Then, on December 22, Trump tweeted: “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump thanked Boeing for responding to his request for a competing bid, saying, “I appreciate Boeing for coming in and competing, and now they will be competing during the process for the rest of the planes because there are thousands of more airplanes coming.” And the new president has promised to buy all those thousands of airplanes and much more military equipment without raising taxes! In mid-January, Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said the next bulk contract for F-35s will be much cheaper, reminding Americans that her company is already adding nearly 2,000 jobs as part of the F-35 program. “I’m glad I had the opportunity to tell [Trump] that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft and moreover it’s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States,” Hewson told reporters.

Devika Krishna Kumar and Ross Kerber NEW YORK/BOSTON — Reuters Published Monday, Jan. 30, 2017 5:04AM EST Last updated Monday, Jan. 30, 2017 12:08PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Most U.S. corporate bosses have stayed silent on President Donald Trump’s immigration curbs, underscoring the sensitivities around opposing policies that could provoke a backlash from the White House. While the leaders of Apple Inc, Google and Facebook Inc e-mailed their staff to denounce the suspension of the U.S. refugee program and the halting of arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries, many of their counterparts in other industries either declined comment or responded with company statements reiterating their commitment to diversity. The difference in response shows the pressure large swathes of corporate America faces to avoid tussling publicly with the new administration. Related: How does Trump’s immigration ban affect you? A Canadian guide Read more: Would-be Americans have dreams dashed by Trump’s executive orders on immigration Read more: Trump immigration ban 'a boon' for Canadian tech industry, say executives Companies such as aircraft maker Boeing Co and auto makers Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co have already had run-ins with Trump over other issues, and they have much at stake in policy decisions that the administration will make on tax, trade and regulatory matters. Before office, Trump attacked Boeing over the cost of the future Air Force One program. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg met with him earlier this month and said he and Trump had made progress on the Air Force One issue and the potential sale of fighter aircraft. Representatives from Boeing, General Motors and Ford declined to comment on Trump’s immigration curbs. Wall Street, meanwhile, is hoping the new administration will ease some of the regulations introduced in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis and adopt a lighter touch in their enforcement. Industries including banking, health care and auto manufacturing “see themselves on the cusp of a new era of deregulation, and they do not want to do anything that would offend the new emperor,” said Cornelius Hurley, director of Boston University’s Center for Finance, Law & Policy. Trump had targeted both the tech industry and Wall Street during his presidential campaign, but once elected, he tapped former investment bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity investors to join his administration. With friends in high places, Wall Street may have less reason to be as outspoken about the new restrictions. “Bankers have direct access to this White House,” said Erik Gordon, who teaches at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. “They don’t have to protest publicly.” Representatives of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Trump’s immigration order. Wells Fargo & Co said in a statement that it was reviewing the executive order and its implications for staff and its business. JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Operating Committee, which includes CEO Jamie Dimon, sent a note to staff saying it was reaching out to all employees affected and noted that the country was, “strengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us.” To be sure, some CEOs were more outspoken. Nike Inc CEO Mark Parker said the company did not support the executive order. “Nike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the power of diversity,” he said in a statement. “Those values are being threatened by the recent executive order in the U.S. banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven Muslim-majority countries.” Brent Saunders, CEO of U.S. drug maker Allergan Plc, tweeted: “Oppose any policy that puts limitations on our ability to attract the best & diverse talent.” But many boardrooms kept quiet. Representatives for some energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp, for example, declined to comment. GOOD CORPORATE CITIZENS As the idea of corporate social responsibility has taken root, so companies have increasingly championed a range of causes, including gay rights, diverse workplaces and a global view. Many in corporate America are still trying to work out how to deal with a new government that takes a more conservative stance on some social issues and has an anti-globalization platform. Those non-tech companies that did issue statements over the weekend tended to emphasize their role as good corporate citizens rather than openly criticize Trump’s policies. Starbucks Corp CEO Howard Schultz has put the coffee chain in the national spotlight before, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. In a letter to employees, he said Starbucks was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years across dozens of countries, but he did not directly criticize Trump’s order. “I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack,” he wrote. In his statement, General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt told staff that the company would engage with the U.S. government. “We will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and Congress, and reiterate the importance of this issue to GE and to the business community overall,” he wrote. One of the most immediate ways for corporate bosses to communicate with Trump about the immigration order will be the first meeting of his advisory panel of business leaders next week. Of the 19 leaders on that panel, only two, Elon Musk, who founded Tesla Motors Inc and SpaceX, and Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc, have spoken out against Trump’s immigration curbs. A spokeswoman for Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief executive of Blackstone Group LP whom Trump tasked to set up and chair the panel, declined to comment.

The deals for 80 Boeing jets and 100 from Europe’s Airbus struck last year are seen by Western investors as a crucial test as they seek business in Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal that led to the lifting of most sanctions. People involved in the airline deals say it is too early to assess the impact of the United States visa ban but worry that hardening rhetoric in Tehran and Washington can only add to a list of complications that could slow, if not endanger, the jet sales. While Airbus planes come from Europe, the administration of US President Donald Trump can veto the sale of all the planes to Iran because of the widespread use of US parts in the aircraft which need US export licenses. The visa ban could also prolong a hiatus in talks about financing deliveries of jets, with European and Chinese banks reluctant to put up money to back Iranian jet purchases for fear of a backlash against their US operations. “It will make people more nervous, more risk-averse, more inclined to wait and see,” said a senior Western financier, who asked not to be named. Iranian officials say that even before Trump imposed restrictions on travel to the United States from seven mainly Muslim countries, concerns about what the new US president might do had already put the brakes on post-sanctions business. During his election campaign, Trump criticised the nuclear accord six major powers struck with Iran and his victory in November increased uncertainty around Iran’s investment drive. “The process has been very slow… foreign investors were very interested to work in Iran, but since Trump’s election the process has almost stopped. Investors are worried about possible US punishments if they work with Iran,” a senior economy ministry official said. Final decisions on whether the plane deals go ahead may well lie with Trump and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate broker in the country’s politics who has the last say on key matters. Since taking office this month, Trump has largely ignored the Iranian jet deals in public, even as he lambasted US aerospace firms including Boeing about other projects. For now, at least, Boeing appears comfortable that Trump won’t automatically block its deal, though questions also remain over further approvals from Iran, two industry sources said. Still, any long-term US travel curbs could also undermine the case for long-distance jets capable of linking Tehran with expatriate communities in cities such as Los Angeles. Boeing plans to start delivering its large 777 jets in 2018. IranAir has already cancelled orders for Airbus A380 superjumbos, initially meant to signal its ambitions to compete on equal terms with the hubs of Gulf rivals. Besides the Boeing and Airbus orders, state airline IranAir is planning to buy 20 small Franco-Italian ATR turboprops to help expand economic development to smaller Iranian cities. But officials say a final deal has been held up due to uncertainty over some licences for engines made by a Canadian subsidiary of Pratt & Whitney, America’s top military engine maker and supplier to the F-35 fighter project.— Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Tax ideas roil oil markets, favour Gulf Coast refiners Impediments for foreign investments in Arab states → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman, Russia cement ties Britain lays out Brexit blueprint Tough phone calls needed: Trump Read More ...

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Friday, February 3, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Economy Obama Makes Big Pitch on Boeing and Manufacturing Policy Economy Obama Makes Big Pitch on Boeing and Manufacturing By E.R. Barnette - 4:00pm February 20, 2012 1072 16 SHARE Facebook Twitter Last week, President Obama flew to Everett, Washington, where he toured a Boeing 787 Dreamliner Plant. Obama referred to it as “the plane of the future”, citing the manufacturer’s use of composite materials which makes it “lighter, faster and more fuel efficient than any airplane in its class.” During the tour Obama praised the company and its workers for helping bring “jobs and manufacturing back to America.” The plant was also the location Obama chose to deliver his weekly address from.  There was a clear theme in the message: manufacturing is still the key to economic success. In terms of location, politics and symbolism, the President could not have chosen a better location. Boeing employs tens of thousands of Americans in its factories and facilities across the country, and the supply chain for its products reach into every state in the nation—supporting thousands of additional jobs. The company is also one of our top exporters, selling its commercial planes to 53 countries in the last five years. The 787 Dreamliner, assembled in Everett, is the world’s most advanced commercial airplane. Nearly 8,000 people were directly employed in building the Dreamliner, and many more by the companies that supply its parts. And of the 870 orders already placed for the Dreamliner, about 80 percent of the planes constructed in the United States will be shipped to other countries. “…the Dreamliner.  It’s an impressive sight.  And, to be honest, part of why I came was to see it up close.  But I also came because this is a great example of how we can bring jobs and manufacturing back to America,” Obama said to the crowd made up mostly of Boeing employees. With Boeing as the backdrop, the President used an opportunity to illustrate investment in and support of businesses like Boeing – which is hiring thousands of Americans across the country.  Policy initiatives in the pipeline are steps such as removing tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas and giving them to companies that create jobs at home. “…tax breaks should go to manufacturers who set up shop here at home.  Bigger tax breaks should go to high-tech manufacturers who create the jobs of the future.  And if you relocate your company to a struggling community, you should get help financing that new plant, that new equipment, or training for new workers,” he said. There was a bit of posturing directly at Congress from the Boeing stage. “It’s time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding businesses that create jobs here in America,” argued the President. “And Congress should send me that kind of tax reform right away.” While many are focused on the technology sector the President pointed out that manufacturing should not be ignored: it still represents nearly 60% of total U.S. exports. “Another thing we’re doing is to make it easier for companies like Boeing to sell their products all over the world, because more exports mean more jobs. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.  And we’re on track to meet that goal – ahead of schedule.” No doubt Boeing is contributing significantly to Obama being on track as it had more $34 billion in total exports in 2011, up over 45% since 2006. In this year’s State of the Union Address, the President laid out a Blueprint for an America Built to Last. A significant portion of the blueprint focuses on manufacturing as the White House recognizes the vital role it must play in continuing to strengthen the economy. “We have a big opportunity right now to build not only an economy that will help us succeed today, but an economy that will help our kids and their kids succeed tomorrow,” said the President. “We know what we need to do.  We need to strengthen American manufacturing.” TAGS 2012 african american politics African-American auto bailout auto makers bailout Barack Obama barack obama boeing everett bay bridge black black policits black politics black republicans boeing Congressional Black Caucus congressional hispanic caucus conservatives Democrats Detroit Dreamliner 787 election elizabeth smart Everett everett washington exports GOP hispani Hispanic hispanic politics Latino latino politics Liberals manufacturing minorities Motown news Politics President Obama presidents day Ralph Everett Republicans tax reform voting rights White House SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleRepublicans Have Issues with Detroit’s Comeback Next articleQueer Eye for Bible Thumping Black Conservatives E.R.

Those employees should remember Obama and his corrupt unions stopped Boeing from building a factory in South Carolina. How can this guy claim to be pro-business and pro-free enterprise when he behaves like this?

Reply C'mon man 6:31pm February 20, 2012 at 6:31 pm Actually, the South Carolina plant was never “stopped”, as a matter of fact the complaint that the union and the NRLB submitted was withdrawn with an unprecedented contract negotiation approved by the union and its members through a vote in Dec. of 2011. I can understand that you wanna bash Obama and unions but at least get your facts straight. If it weren’t for unions there would be no middle class left in America. Companies would rather pay you $4.50 an hour with no benefits and no increased pay for overtime, evolution should have weeded you out a long time ago. Reply florian_schach 9:54pm February 21, 2012 at 9:54 pm Obama’s Manufacturing Initiative is indeed a good idea and one that should really take of here in the states. But to realize the initiative that he’s put forth business owners really need an incentive to bring both their businesses back here and create jobs. Though there might be a tax incentive for them to return, it can’t do much good if regulation and compliance costs are a constant nuisance making it hard for them to operate. With the cost of annual regulation being so high (http://eng.am/sTM3nH) we actually are working against ourselves for our own goals. Until we fix this we won’t be able to truly move forward in our economic recovery process. Reply eric 11:15pm February 21, 2012 at 11:15 pm Simple, tax them good if they go offshore.

The e-commerce giant has secured 900 acres of land in Kentucky that will one day be home to 40 Amazon Prime Air planes – 16 of which are currently in service.

Scroll down for video  Amazon is set to open a $1.49 billion cargo air hub to take on FedEx and UPS. The e-commerce giant has secured 900 acres of land in Kentucky that will one day house 40 Amazon Prime Air planes – 16 of which are currently in service. Picture taken at a Boeing hangar in Seattle, WA AMAZON AIRPORT  Amazon is set to open a $1.49 billion cargo air hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG) in Hebron, Kentucky. The facility will be home to the firm's 40 Amazon Prime Air planes – 16 of which are currently in service. The hub will let Amazon handle more in-house shipping, allowing them to ship packages faster and cut costs - they can start weeding out third parties that ship their orders. And the facility that will sit on 900 acres of land will create more than 2,000 jobs in the area.  Amazon has been an active member of the business community in Kentucky for nearly 20 years, employing more than 10,000 people in full-time jobs across 11 fulfillment center locations. And the air hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG) in Hebron is expected to create more than 2,000 new jobs. 'As we considered places for the long-term home for our air hub operations, Hebron quickly rose to the top of the list with a large, skilled workforce, centralized location with great connectivity to our nearby fulfillment locations, and an excellent quality of living for employees,' said Dave Clark, Amazon Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations. 'We feel strongly that with these qualities as a place to do business, our investments will support Amazon and customers well into the future.' 'We couldn't be more excited to add 2,000-plus Amazon employees to join the more than 10,000 who work with us today across our robust operations in Kentucky.'

Share this article Share 12 shares The northern Kentucky location - not far from UPS's major hub - puts Amazon's aircraft in shooting distance of top cities. It also lets Amazon's trucks reach 11 fulfillment centers in state. And a large operation of Deutsche Post DHL there lets Amazon transfer packages easily abroad, said Brian Clancy, managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital & Strategy LLC. The air hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG) in Hebron is expected to create more than 2,000 new jobs. Pictured is a Boeing 767 with an Amazon.com 'Prime Air' emblem flying over Lake Washington in Aug. 2016 'Amazon's Prime Air hub promises to revolutionize the fulfillment industry worldwide, and Kentucky is excited to partner with them as they embark on this disruptive, transformative and exciting venture,' said Gov. Bevin. 'Kentucky's ideal location, proven workforce and an already extensive shipping and logistics industry have been the backbone of our relationship with Amazon for nearly 20 years.' 'This new project will pay dividends to both the company and our state, and we are truly grateful for the jobs and economic impact it will bring to the commonwealth.' As part of the investment, Amazon anticipates it will spend nearly $462 million on building and improvements over an unspecified number of years, according to a report by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. The hub will let Amazon handle more in-house shipping, allowing them to ship packages faster and cut costs. Pictured is one of the leased Boeing 767 planes parked in a Boeing hanger in Seattle, WA The authority's board tentatively approved $40 million in tax incentives for Amazon over ten years if it meets hiring commitments, with average wages including benefits targeted at $26 per hour, the report said. So far, Amazon has loaded its aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the United States.   Amazon's new site compares with about 1,220 acres UPS has in Louisville. FedEx has more than 900 in its Memphis hub, a 2010 airport plan showed.

An AH-6i testbed aircraft being displayed to reporters at Boeing's Mesa production facility in June 2016. The type was accepted by the Saudis in August, and the first 12 will be delivered to the 1st Aviation Brigade in May. (IHS Markit/Gareth Jennings) Speaking at the IQPC International Military Helicopter conference in London, Major General Frank Muth, program manager, US Army Office of the Program Manager SANG, said that, with 24 Sikorsky UH-60M Black Hawk and 12 Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters already delivered, the planned arrival of the first 12 of 24 AH-6is in May (some nine months after the type was formally accepted by the service) will see the 1st Aviation Brigade fully stood up at Khashm Al An airfield near Riyadh. "With the first helicopters delivered to the Ministry National Guard [MNG] Aviation Brigade in 2013, the SANG currently has 24 UH-60Ms and 12 AH-64Es. The 1st Aviation Brigade will be at full strength later this year when it receives the SANG's initial 12 AH-6is in May. The 2nd Aviation Brigade will follow in 2019, and the 3rd Aviation Brigade in 2021," Gen Muth said. As noted by the general, the development of the SANG's aviation capabilities has been meteoric in its progress since the concept was first created in 2008. "The SANG as an aviation force didn't exist eight years ago, and as of 18 months ago it had no [operational] aircraft at all [12 MD Helicopters Inc MD 530F training helicopters were delivered in 2013]," he said, adding that this new force has had to be built entirely from new, and from the ground up. "When building up the capability it's not just about the aircraft - it's the people, it's the training, it's the life-cycle maintenance; it's the facilities; and all the rest. Want to read more?

(STEPHEN YANG/REUTERS) A trader at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Dec. 30, 2016. (STEPHEN YANG/REUTERS) The short seller who crushed Valeant has a new target Add to ... Sridhar Natarajan, Anders Melin and Oliver Renick Bloomberg News Published Wednesday, Feb. 01, 2017 10:38AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 01, 2017 2:16PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Andrew Left sure knows how to pick a fight. A little more than a year after his improbable takedown of Wall Street darling Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the blustery short seller is at it again. And the head of Citron Research is using the same blueprint as he sets his sights on TransDigm and its founder and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Howley. To hear Mr. Left tell it, TransDigm is another Valeant waiting to happen. He alleges the same price-gouging and debt-fueled financial engineering to explain how the aircraft-parts supplier delivered Valeant-like stock returns exceeding 1,500 per cent in the past decade -- and made Mr. Howley one of America’s best-paid executives. In the past five years alone, he took home $278-million. At Boeing, a company 30 times the size, CEO pay was less than half that. “There’s a thin line between brilliant and being crazy,” Mr. Left told Bloomberg. “While it works, you’re brilliant, but when it fails, you’re irresponsible.” The accusations rankled long-time investors and were met by howls on Wall Street for being inflammatory, flawed or inaccurate. Greg Rufus, who was TransDigm’s CFO for 15 years and was one of the chief architects of its growth, also strongly disputed Mr. Left’s assertions. Both Mr. Howley and the Cleveland-based company declined repeated requests for comment. “If the guy was here, I’d read him the riot act,” said Mr. Rufus, who retired in September. “This company is nothing like Valeant.” Still, some aren’t taking any chances. Since Citron published its report on Jan. 20, shares of TransDigm have slumped 14 per cent, prompting it to delay a loan refinancing deal. And as President Donald Trump squeezes defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, Left foresees an even bigger comedown. Conflicting Opinions TransDigm hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing by regulators and few on Wall Street agree with Left. (He sees TransDigm, which last traded at $218.03 a share on Wednesday, falling to $166 and possibly lower. Analysts say the stock should be closer to $300 in the next 12 months.) But if nothing else, Mr. Left’s public campaign has raised thorny questions about the aggressive business and pay practices of a company that even its media-shy CEO said was one of the biggest that “no one ever heard of.” By almost any measure, TransDigm has been a big success since the 64-year-old Howley, a mechanical engineer and Harvard Business School grad, started the company with a former colleague two decades ago. Since going public in 2006, Mr. Howley has completed roughly 30 deals, most of them debt-financed, and turned his initial $50-million investment into a company with $11.6-billion in market capitalization. His business model, which reflects a private-equity ethos of its former owner Warburg Pincus, relies on repeatedly acquiring key, hard-to-manufacture aerospace parts and then raising their prices -- much like Valeant did with drugs. For example, after TransDigm bought Aerosonic in 2013, it quadrupled the price of its vibration panels to $271 from $67.33, according to trade publication Capitol Forum, which provides analysis on government contracts. That kind of pricing power has pushed TransDigm’s gross margins above 50 per cent in every quarter since becoming a publicly traded company, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s also helped shareholders reap returns averaging almost 30 percent a year. “Their margin structure is the best in the industry and has been since the beginning,” said Ted Scalise, a money manager at TIAA Investments, which is among TransDigm’s top 20 shareholders. “If you write down a list of everything you’d use to evaluate management, it’s all been strong.” Mr. Left sees that as a red flag and says the price increases mask a lack of growth and a burgeoning debt load, which now exceeds $10-billion. “The stock has done well but it has not grown based on organic growth, it’s based on acquisitions,” he said. The risk is that “one day, like everything else, you run out of things to buy and prices to raise.” TransDigm’s aggressive expansion can be directly explained by an equally aggressive, if uncommon, pay structure. Mr. Howley and his lieutenants receive the bulk of their pay in stock options that vest only if the company succeeds in increasing its intrinsic share price -- an internal measure derived from pro-forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, minus net debt -- by at least 10 per cent a year. It differs from most other public companies, which have largely scaled back options and tend to use a variety of financial metrics. Pay Incentives And in some ways, it echoes the pay program of former Valeant CEO Michael Pearson, who was mainly compensated with restricted stock tied to ambitious shareholder return targets. Mr. Pearson oversaw Valeant’s meteoric rise before probes into its business practices, accounting and drug pricing caused its stock to plummet more than 90 per cent. Valeant says it has been fully cooperating with authorities throughout the investigation and “intends to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct.” TransDigm’s compensation also resembles the rewards packages granted by consumer-brands company Jarden Corp. In 2014, it promised executives big restricted-share payouts if per-share earnings rose above levels so ambitious that even the company called them “improbable.” The awards paid out in full when Jarden was acquired by Newell Brands in 2016. “It’s a great story to tell shareholders that basically all of your compensation is performance-driven,” said Steven Hall Jr., an executive-compensation consultant at Steven Hall & Partners. Still, “how do you balance an aggressive growth strategy with not incentivizing either excessive risk-taking or actions that are detrimental to the company? There’s no easy answer.” TransDigm itself says its metrics are consistent with those of high-performing private equity firms. From the start of its 2013 fiscal year, the company has heaped $4.6-billion of dividends to shareholders, including top executives. CEO Windfall About $83-million of Mr. Howley’s windfall came from such payouts. The remainder consisted of salary and bonuses, proceeds from option exercises and share sales, and the value of perks. In all, Howley took home almost twice as much as the nearest top-earning CEO among TransDigm’s compensation peers who have served at least five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That might seem outlandish for any CEO, especially for one who is, by all accounts, frugal in just about every other way. Other than an occasional scotch and cigar, colleagues say Howley has few indulgences. Most days, he brings in a packed lunch from home. For most shareholders, Mr. Howley’s been worth it. Even after the recent tumble, the stock has more than tripled in the past five years, including dividends. “Who cares if he’s paid a lot,” said Umberto Fedeli, chairman of the Fedeli Group, an insurance company based in Independence, Ohio, and a long-time associate of Howley’s. “We do live in a capitalistic society and if you perform well and do well, you get paid.” TransDigm’s debt burden still means Mr. Howley doesn’t have much room for missteps. In its fiscal year ended September, leverage reached the highest since 2004, suggesting its EBITDA growth didn’t keep pace with its debt. Some of its obligations are now rated as low as CCC+ by S&P -- a level that reflects a company’s vulnerability to default. Rising interest rates will only make things more difficult, according to hedge fund Riposte Capital, which exited its TransDigm position, according to a Jan. 26 investor letter. Mr. Left, for his part, offers naysayers a cautionary note. “You’re playing a dangerous game,” Mr. Left said. Right now, “Howley is the most respected name in the aerospace industry. At one point, Michael Pearson was the smartest man in the pharmaceutical industry.” Report Typo/Error   VRX-TValeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc Latest Price$18.55 0.00 (0.00%) TDG-NTransDigm Group Inc Latest Price$221.77 0.00 (0.00%) Updated February 2 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Stocks dipped for Boeing when Trump, as President-elect, tweeted about the cost for the company to build Air Force One, and they slumped again for Lockheed Martin when he called the expenses of its F-35 jet "out of control." Similar stock drops affected automakers Toyota Motor Corp., General Motors and Ford after Trump railed against all three on Twitter about building vehicles in Mexico. From afar, the staff of the Texas-based digital marketing firm The Think Tank (T3) -- like much of Wall Street - has watched in wonder, trying to figure out what to do about the unpredictable Twitter habits of their next commander in chief. Then a staffer in T3's New York office had an idea: What if they found a way to short sell stocks moved by Trump tweets, then used the money for something good? (Short selling means placing a market bet on a share price going down rather than up.) Within days, "Trump & Dump" was born. They created an ultrafast Twitter bot and algorithm that follows @realDonaldTrump, reviewing each tweet he sends. When a publicly-traded company is mentioned, the bot triggers a "sentiment analysis," T3 President Ben Gaddis told The Washington Post, which scans the words surrounding the company name to determine if the tweet has a positive or negative slant. If it leans negative, the algorithm tells a connected E-Trade account to short-sell the stock - which, if done properly, nets T3 a profit. All that happens very quickly. (Think hard before you try this at home. High-frequency traders have reportedly been doing the same thing with automated programs capable of executing thousands of trades in a millisecond. But how effective this could be using a retail platform like E-Trade, which on its website guarantees a 2 second trade execution, is open to question.) But Gaddis said "it's been really successful so far," though he declined to say how much money they had made in the three weeks since it launched. In an explanatory video about the bot, though, T3 described their profit size with a play on one of Trump's favorite words. "YUUUUGE," they said. And early Monday morning, when President Trump started his day with a tweet referencing Delta Air Lines, the algorithm went to work. T3 made a trade before the stock dropped, Gaddis told The Post, then saw a 4.47 percent return when the short sale was completed. "The Trump & Dump bot was all over it," Gaddis said. T3 is far from the first company to capitalize on Trump's targeted tweet-storms, made evident by the almost instantaneous market response to his online remarks, analysts told the LA Times in mid January. "It's in the algorithms," said Joe Gits, chief executive of Social Market Analytics Inc. "They've done it." What likely sets T3's system apart, though, is its beneficiaries. They wanted the money to go toward a cause that would generate minimal controversy, Gaddis said, so T3 settled on one they figured everyone could get behind: puppies. And kittens. And whatever other animals the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is caring for these days. "We didn't want to pick an organization that was really political," Gaddis said, "and who doesn't love dogs and cats?" When a short sale is made, Gaddis and his team are notified through Slack, a corporate messaging service. They can check the trade to be sure it went smoothly, then collect their profits and donate them to ASPCA. "THE RESULTS," T3's website says, "Tweets Analyzed. Stocks Shorted. Puppies Saved." A spokeswoman for ASPCA confirmed that T3 had submitted donations to the animal nonprofit, emphasizing that the organization was not directly involved with the Trump & Dump bot but that "we appreciate their support." T3 is investing company money in the endeavor, Gaddis said, and plans to release tracking data on donations in monthly intervals. Based in Austin, Texas, the company brands itself an "innovation agency," working with Fortune 500 companies like UPS and Allstate to enhance their digital marketing, mobile applications and website development. But T3 also works to make brands work for their users - the precise goal of Trump & Dump. They ask themselves questions like, "how can we make an insight or data like this," -- Trump's tweets and the corresponding stock market dips - "actionable." Thus far, the feedback has been positive, Gaddis said. "I don't think companies love it when he tweets about them," Gaddis told The Post, which is why T3 thought they would try to "use something that most people are upset about and turn it into some kind of good." The algorithm only works - and the puppies are only saved - if the president continues to use his Twitter in ways that move stocks. If that sort of tweeting stops, so do the trades. But, Gaddis said, "our prediction is it probably won't." Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.

The contract tasks the company with performing services for VC-25, E-4B, C-32A, C-40B/C, E-8C, and NT-43 aircraft. Boeing will also provide analysis and technical instructions needed to overcome maintenance issues. Most of the services are for military passenger planes used by high-ranking U.S. government officials. The VC-25, or Air Force One, is built specifically for transporting the president of the United States. Boeing's contract award follows months of tension between the company and President Donald Trump over the cost of the Air Force One program. Before entering office, the president threatened to cancel the ongoing contract with the aerospace manufacturer in December. Work will be performed in Oklahoma City, Okla., and is expected to be complete by the end of January 2027. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the contract award was the result of a sole-source acquisition. Boeing received $61.8 million in Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds at the time of the award. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center in Oklahoma is listed as the contracting activity.

A little more than a year after his improbable takedown of Wall Street darling Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the blustery short seller is at it again. And the head of Citron Research is using the same blueprint as he sets his sights on TransDigm and its founder and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Howley. Andrew Left Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg To hear Left tell it, TransDigm is another Valeant waiting to happen. He alleges the same price-gouging and debt-fueled financial engineering to explain how the aircraft-parts supplier delivered Valeant-like stock returns exceeding 1,500 percent in the past decade -- and made Howley one of America’s best-paid executives. In the past five years alone, he took home $278 million. At Boeing, a company 30 times the size, CEO pay was less than half that. “There’s a thin line between brilliant and being crazy,” Left told Bloomberg. “While it works, you’re brilliant, but when it fails, you’re irresponsible.” The accusations rankled long-time investors and were met by howls on Wall Street for being inflammatory, flawed or inaccurate. Greg Rufus, who was TransDigm’s CFO for 15 years and was one of the chief architects of its growth, also strongly disputed Left’s assertions. Both Howley and the Cleveland-based company declined repeated requests for comment. “If the guy was here, I’d read him the riot act,” said Rufus, who retired in September. “This company is nothing like Valeant.” Still, some aren’t taking any chances. Since Citron published its report on Jan. 20, shares of TransDigm have slumped 13 percent, prompting it to delay a loan refinancing deal. And as President Donald Trump squeezes defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, Left foresees an even bigger comedown. Conflicting Opinions TransDigm hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing by regulators and few on Wall Street agree with Left. (He sees TransDigm, which last traded at $219.68 a share on Wednesday, falling to $166 and possibly lower. Analysts say the stock should be closer to $300 in the next 12 months.) But if nothing else, Left’s public campaign has raised thorny questions about the aggressive business and pay practices of a company that even its media-shy CEO said was one of the biggest that “ no one ever heard of.” By almost any measure, TransDigm has been a big success since the 64-year-old Howley, a mechanical engineer and Harvard Business School grad, started the company with a former colleague two decades ago. Since going public in 2006, Howley has completed roughly 30 deals, most of them debt-financed, and turned his initial $50 million investment into a company with $11.6 billion in market capitalization. His business model, which reflects a private-equity ethos of its former owner Warburg Pincus, relies on repeatedly acquiring key, hard-to-manufacture aerospace parts and then raising their prices -- much like Valeant did with drugs. For example, after TransDigm bought Aerosonic in 2013, it quadrupled the price of its vibration panels to $271 from $67.33, according to trade publication Capitol Forum, which provides analysis on government contracts. Comparative returns: TransDigm vs. Valeant That kind of pricing power has pushed TransDigm’s gross margins above 50 percent in every quarter since becoming a publicly traded company, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s also helped shareholders reap returns averaging almost 30 percent a year. “Their margin structure is the best in the industry and has been since the beginning,” said Ted Scalise, a money manager at TIAA Investments, which is among TransDigm’s top 20 shareholders. “If you write down a list of everything you’d use to evaluate management, it’s all been strong.” Left sees that as a red flag and says the price increases mask a lack of growth and a burgeoning debt load, which now exceeds $10 billion. “The stock has done well but it has not grown based on organic growth, it’s based on acquisitions,” he said. The risk is that “one day, like everything else, you run out of things to buy and prices to raise.” TransDigm’s aggressive expansion can be directly explained by an equally aggressive, if uncommon, pay structure. Howley and his lieutenants receive the bulk of their pay in stock options that vest only if the company succeeds in increasing its intrinsic share price -- an internal measure derived from pro-forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, minus net debt -- by at least 10 percent a year. It differs from most other public companies, which have largely scaled back options and tend to use a variety of financial metrics. Pay Incentives And in some ways, it echoes the pay program of former Valeant CEO Michael Pearson, who was mainly compensated with restricted stock tied to ambitious shareholder return targets. Pearson oversaw Valeant’s meteoric rise before probes into its business practices, accounting and drug pricing caused its stock to plummet more than 90 percent. Valeant says it has been fully cooperating with authorities throughout the investigation and “intends to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct.” TransDigm’s compensation also resembles the rewards packages granted by consumer-brands company Jarden Corp. In 2014, it promised executives big restricted-share payouts if per-share earnings rose above levels so ambitious that even the company called them “improbable.” The awards paid out in full when Jarden was acquired by Newell Brands in 2016. “It’s a great story to tell shareholders that basically all of your compensation is performance-driven,” said Steven Hall Jr., an executive-compensation consultant at Steven Hall & Partners. Still, “how do you balance an aggressive growth strategy with not incentivizing either excessive risk-taking or actions that are detrimental to the company? There’s no easy answer.” TransDigm itself says its metrics are consistent with those of high-performing private equity firms. From the start of its 2013 fiscal year, the company has heaped $4.6 billion of dividends to shareholders, including top executives. CEO Windfall About $83 million of Howley’s windfall came from such payouts. The remainder consisted of salary and bonuses, proceeds from option exercises and share sales, and the value of perks. In all, Howley took home almost twice as much as the nearest top-earning CEO among TransDigm’s compensation peers who have served at least five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That might seem outlandish for any CEO, especially for one who is, by all accounts, frugal in just about every other way. Other than an occasional scotch and cigar, colleagues say Howley has few indulgences. Most days, he brings in a packed lunch from home. For most shareholders, Howley’s been worth it. Even after the recent tumble, the stock has more than tripled in the past five years, including dividends. “Who cares if he’s paid a lot,” said Umberto Fedeli, chairman of the Fedeli Group, an insurance company based in Independence, Ohio, and a long-time associate of Howley’s. “We do live in a capitalistic society and if you perform well and do well, you get paid.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up TransDigm’s debt burden still means Howley doesn’t have much room for missteps. In its fiscal year ended September, leverage reached the highest since 2004, suggesting its Ebitda growth didn’t keep pace with its debt. Some of its obligations are now rated as low as CCC+ by S&P -- a level that reflects a company’s vulnerability to default. Rising interest rates will only make things more difficult, according to hedge fund Riposte Capital, which exited its TransDigm position, according to a Jan. 26 investor letter. Left, for his part, offers naysayers a cautionary note. “You’re playing a dangerous game,” Left said. Right now, “Howley is the most respected name in the aerospace industry. At one point, Michael Pearson was the smartest man in the pharmaceutical industry.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

William Cooley joined Israeli Ministry of Defense representatives in a ceremony marking the delivery. "Arrow-3 is the result of many years of development efforts, based on a solution designed by Israeli Aerospace Industries, which have today come to fruition," said Boaz Levi, Israel Aerospace Industries vice president and general manager of the Systems, Missiles and Space Group. "This is a milestone for the Israel's Defense Establishment, and for Israel's defense industries." Arrow-3 will complement its lower-range predecessor, Arrow-2, and a short-range missile-defense system known as the Iron Dome. The new missile has half the weight of an Arrow-2, and, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, offers users better "control and monitoring abilities while also expanding radar detection range." Arrow-3 is reported as being able to destroy targets as high as 62 miles, the boundary of outer space, also known as the Karman line. When the missile reaches a desired altitude, its warhead splits into individual 'kamikaze satellites' that can track and destroy targets, including long-range and intercontinental missiles. If an Arrow-3 fails, the shorter-range and lower-altitude Arrow-2 will serve as a backup. However, it is unclear whether Arrow-3 can actually hit a satellite, since 'low orbit' begins at the altitude of about 100 miles. According to public data, since 2008, the United States has contributed almost $600 million to the development of the Arrow-3. In September 2016, the US and Israel signed a 10-year military-aid deal assuring Israel $5 billion in missile-defense funding from fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2028, according to Defense News.

Instead, Cramer worried that there is something much bigger that lurks beneath that is freaking out executives and shareholders. "They are worried that President Trump may be willing to sacrifice whole international markets that our companies have fought hard to penetrate in order to further the jobs agenda that he campaigned on," the "Mad Money" host said. While the loss of sales to partners could be made up with Trump's platform of tax cuts, deregulation and repatriation of foreign assets, Cramer warned that he could fail to get his agenda through Congress. "In other words, maybe it's zero sum," Cramer said. Getty Images President Donald Trump meets with representatives from PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 31, 2017 in Washington, DC. Just after Arconic reporting a quarter that was slightly lighter than expected on Tuesday, activist Elliott Management launched a proxy fight against the company. Arconic is the maker of engineered products that was created after the old Alcoa broke itself up in November. Arconic was supposed to be the high-value added part of the company, while Alcoa would represent the aluminum portion of the business. However, since the break-up, the opposite has occurred. Alcoa's stock has rallied 70 percent, while Arconic is up only 6 percent. Elliott, which already has three seats on Arconic's board, announced it would be nominating five independent directors to the company's board. In particular, Elliott took issue with the leadership with CEO Klaus Kleinfeld, and requested to replace him with former CEO of Spirit Aerosystems Larry Lawson. Cramer spoke with Kleinfeld about a potential challenge to his leadership prior to the Elliott news being announced, and asked him what he will do if there is a challenge. "We have to look at it and as always, the board and management will engage with shareholders. We've done that continuously, we've listened to what they have to say and we will come to a conclusion of what is best, and I hope this will be a joined agreement and how we go about it," Kleinfeld said. Cramer was prepared for President Donald Trump to go into his meeting with top pharmaceutical executives on Monday with a baseball bat in hand. Instead, he merely jawboned them about charging less for drugs. The U.S. government is the biggest buyer of drugs in the world. It has tremendous bargaining power, Cramer said, but chooses not to use it. Instead, it lets the drug companies decide pricing; this in contrary to almost every other country in the world. It was clear to Cramer that Trump doesn't want to do that, which for the first time seemed at odds with the message he campaigned on. "This is an important departure for a president who has been sticking to his guns on his campaign promises," Cramer said. Getty Images Coca-Cola is the classic steady stock that tends to work, even when the economic environment is uncertain. Cramer spoke with Larry Williams to take a closer look at the stock and determine what the charts predict for the future. Williams is a technician who has traded futures, commodities and stocks for more than 50 years. He has written 11 books, and created various technical indicators used on Wall Street and teaches people to become better traders at IReallyTrade.com. "If you believe that the Trump rally has truly gotten off track, than Coca-Cola is exactly the kind of stock you should be buying," Cramer said. For those that think the sell-off is simply a pause, Cramer advised to only own Coke for the purpose of diversification and additional income from its 3.36 percent yield. Ever since the election, the market has been in anticipation that President Trump's policies will be a major boost to the economy. However, Cramer noted that many cyclical industrial companies were already in great shape, and the American heavy industry could be doing better than many think. "That may not be true across the board, but I have got to tell you, after some of the numbers we have seen this earnings season, it is certainly true in some individual cases," Cramer said. Illinois Tool Works is the maker of specialized industrial equipment, and when Cramer called the company the "greatest industrial company you have never heard of" last April, it turned out that every single pullback was a buying opportunity for the stock. And the good news is that he thinks the stock has more room to run, and he said it's not too late to buy it. Cramer believes its hungry management team will consistently improve and take share for years to come. "It is the ideal stock to buy when the market loses faith in the Trump agenda, but you still want to own an industrial that can put some big points on the board," Cramer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on various stocks from callers: Teck Resources: "If you think that worldwide growth is going to continue, then this remarkable stock is going to keep going higher. I happen to prefer Freeport at this time, FCX, but Teck, if you think the world goes higher — Teck goes higher with it." Molina Healthcare: "Let's understand each other that I am only recommending one in that group, and that stock is UnitedHealth, UNH, which I think will go up 10 points while Molina meanders."

The way the week ended, with thousands of Americans protesting Trump’s executive order on immigration and travel, was probably not how he planned it. Among Trump’s list of countries from which air travel is restricted are Iran and Iraq. Both have large, firm orders with Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). Following the deposition of Saddam Hussein, Iraq ordered 40 Boeing passenger planes, 10 787s and 30 737s. At the end of December, all 10 787s and 18 of the 737s remain to be delivered. The 10 undelivered 787-8s in Iraq’s order have a current list price value of $224.6 million each, or about $2.5 billion in total. The 18 undelivered 737-800s are priced at $96 million each for a total order value of about $1.73 billion. Iran and Boeing struck a deal at the end of last year for 80 Boeing jets, 50 737 MAXs, 15 777-300ERs and 15 777-9s. As of December 31, the company has not included the listing of orders by country. This deal, worth $16.6 billion at list prices, is surely the most vulnerable to cancellation. On the other side of the Atlantic, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (aka Brexit) threatens to force investors in two of Europe’s leading low-cost carriers to sell their shares. Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: RYAAY) and London-traded easyJet operate under European licenses and flying rights that require majority control and ownership by EU nationals. If Brexit happens, as seems likely, Dublin-based Ryanair’s percentage of stock owned by EU nationals drops from 60% to 40%, according to a report in the Financial Times. It is also worth noting that Ryanair is one of Boeing’s largest customers with unfilled orders for 100 737s and 100 737 MAXs on the company’s December order book. U.K.-based easyJet is currently 84% owned by EU nationals, but the percentage drops to 49% after Brexit. However the airline’s founder and largest stockholder is dual UK-Cypriot national, which is now classified as a U.K. owner. Following Brexit, and assuming no change in this status, easyJet will be just 16% owned by EU nationals. London-based IAG, owner of British Airways, also must force non-EU investors to sell their shares within 10 days if the airline’s license is threatened, but the firm has declined to say what percentage of its shareholders would meet the EU national requirement. The U.K. airlines affected by the licensing restrictions face the real likelihood of having to buy back their British shareholders’ stock at a premium. Unintended, unforeseen consequences, both for Trump and Brexit. And for investors and shareholders.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump will likely face questions about his executive order restricting some travel to the United States when he meets with the CEOs of major U.S. companies at the White House on Friday. Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president's business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trump's order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big U.S. companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize Trump's move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday. Trump's executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that "the ban will impact many innocent people — an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump’s first business advisory group meeting." Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone (BX.N), who chairs the panel and assembled it at Trump's request. Four topics will be discussed -- regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure -- with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape “how the administration should be thinking,” according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trump's penchant for rebuking companies publicly. "Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid," said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday's meeting. "I'm sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully." It was not clear if all 19 members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday's meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co (F.N) Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump's order "undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations." The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump's immigration orders include Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

"Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid," said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday's meeting. "I'm sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully." It was not clear if all 19 members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday's meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co (F.N) Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump's order "undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations." The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump's immigration orders include Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

Alia Al Mansoori’s proposal to study how exposure to space affects the health of live organisms at cellular level was chosen by a panel of experts as the winner from five teams of eight pupils who made it to the final round of judging. Alia, 14, will see her experiment blasted into space from the Kennedy Space Centre between March and July to be tested by astronauts on the International Space Station. "I was like, ‘Oh my God, here’s the spaceship I’m going to Mars on,’ because I feel like I’m getting closer to that big goal," the Al Mawakeb School Al Barsha pupil said. "I’ve always felt that this is what I’m born to do, this is for me." The award was presented by Dr Mohammed Al Ahbabi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, who congratulated all of the students who took part. "I think all of you are winners because the idea is gaining knowledge," said Dr Al Ahbabi. "Young people like you, you are the future. One day, inshallah, we will see one of you as an astronaut." The UAE is the first country outside the US to host the Genes in Space competition. When it was launched by the UAE Space Agency, Boeing and The National in November 2015, it challenged children from Grades 7 to 12 to come up with an experiment that applied DNA analysis to real-life challenges in space exploration. Organisers received more than 100 submissions from 75 schools, involving about 300 pupils and teachers from across the country. "For a nation the size of the UAE, that’s about 10 times the engagement we had in the US," said Dr Sebastian Kraves, a molecular neurobiologist. Dr Kraves co-invented a device called the miniPCR DNA Discovery System, which the pupils used to carry out their experiments. Five teams of pupils from Cranleigh Abu Dhabi, Brighton College Al Ain, Brighton College Abu Dhabi, Gems Modern Academy and Al Mawakeb School Al Barsha were selected as finalists in November. Each team won a miniPCR for their school and were paired with mentors to fine-tune their entries. "Judges were impressed not only by the quantity, but by the quality and breadth of the submissions," Dr Kraves said. "They ranged from experiments to protect astronauts’ DNA from cosmic radiation to protecting their bones from degradation in ways that can cause us to not only travel to space better, but live healthier lives here on Earth." The teams presented their experiments to a room full of scientists, academics, journalists and a panel of five expert judges gathered for the final day of the Global Space Congress in Abu Dhabi. Each presentation was followed by gruelling questions from the judges. Eighty per cent of the judging had been made in the lead-up to the presentations. "When we present our work, we are used to having our work criticised and challenged. This is part of being a scientist," said Dr Luisa Cochella, a Genes in Space judge from Austria’s Research Institute of Molecular Pathology. "The only way in which we grow and learn is by challenging what we know. This is what you want to develop in a scientist – a critical, curious mind." Kevin Foley, head of Boeing’s global sales and marketing, called Genes in Space an extremely successful event. "It’s been an impressive display of how talented the UAE youth and education system are," Mr Foley said. "The students were brilliant, their proposals were incredible. Our winner is going to be a tremendous representative for UAE youth." Dr Kraves said his team, with experts from Boeing and the Space Agency, would work with Alia for the next 60 days to prepare her experiment for space. For Alia, this will be the first step towards achieving her ultimate dream. "I’ve always wanted to be an astronaut," she said. "When I go to Mars, hopefully I’ll be taking an Emirati flag with me and I’ll be planting it on the planet." Rashid Murooshid, Editor-in-Chief of The National, said: "On behalf of The National, I’m very pleased to congratulate Alia on her incredible achievement today and the exciting future that lies ahead. "We are incredibly proud to have supported such a rewarding competition, particularly since this is the first edition of Genes in Space to take place outside the US. "The support offered by The National is a reflection of our deep commitment to education, and forms part of our contribution to transitioning the UAE." rpennington@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Science Alia Al Mansoori, UAE Genes in Space winner 2017 - video Winner of Genes in Space competition hopes to plant UAE flag on Mars Earth is our spaceship and we must explore, Abu Dhabi conference told Emirati girl wins Genes in Space competition - in pictures MOST VIEWED Uae | All Etisalat to offer data and minutes to UAE customers affected by service disruptions Abu Dhabi archaeologists unearth rare, well-preserved Stone Age house Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed meets with emir of Qatar UAE weather: Significant drop in temperature and chance of rain Dubai theme parks chief addresses customer complaints Winner of Genes in Space competition hopes to plant UAE flag on Mars Lion cub roams streets of Khalifa City A Dubai International Airport welcomes Air India’s first 787 Dreamliner from Kochi Starving puppy with legs broken in fight for life at Dubai vet Demand for desalinated water puts pressure on Gulf ecosystems More Most Viewed Etisalat to offer data and minutes to UAE customers affected by service disruptions Abu Dhabi archaeologists unearth rare, well-preserved Stone Age house Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed meets with emir of Qatar UAE weather: Significant drop in temperature and chance of rain Winner of Genes in Space competition hopes to plant UAE flag on Mars Dubai theme parks chief addresses customer complaints Sawiris raw as deal for Greek islands for refugees falls flat Half lion, half tiger: Meet the extremely rare liger that sleeps in his owner’s bed Big cats have no place in UAE villas Omanis call for government cap on fuel prices in first protest since 2011 More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Portrait of a Nation: Emirati whose personal goal is to help others achieve theirs Stormy conditions don’t put off adrenaline junkies at Sharjah Sports Desert Festival Latest Lest We Forget exhibit tells UAE’s history with tales and heirlooms Starving puppy with legs broken in fight for life at Dubai vet FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Dubai tenant wants lower rent on apartment facing construction, but landlord wants to raise it ADCB unveils digital age lender uBank About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

CVG officials have pegged the investment from Amazon at around $1.5 billion. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal,” CVG CEO Candace McGraw told Cincinnati.com. “It’s truly transformational.” Amazon said it will add 2,000 new jobs to support the air hub. Seattle-based Amazon last year struck deals with Purchase, New York-based Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Wilmington, Ohio-based Air Transport Services Group to wet lease 20 Boeing 767Fs from each company to create a dedicated air cargo network for its online retail operations. Amazon said 16 of those 40 freighters featuring the Prime Air livery are already operating Amazon-dedicated flights. “As we considered places for the long-term home for our air hub operations, Hebron quickly rose to the top of the list with a large, skilled workforce, centralized location with great connectivity to our nearby fulfillment locations, and an excellent quality of living for employees,” Amazon SVP-worldwide operations Dave Clark said in a statement.  Amazon said the “Prime Air hub at CVG will support Amazon’s dedicated fleet of Prime Air cargo planes by loading, unloading and sorting packages.” McGraw said in a statement that “adding thousands of new jobs through establishing this hub at CVG will certainly be transformational for the local economy and local businesses.” Aaron Karp aaron.karp@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk February 1, 2017 Northrop Grumman Corp. and BAE Systems are the latest team to drop out of the T-X Trainer competition, they announced Tuesday. The companies said in a statement they “have decided not to submit a proposal for the T-X Trainer program, as it would not be in the best interest of the companies and their shareholders.” According to the statement, the decision comes after a careful examination of the Air Force’s T-X Trainer request for proposal. The service announced Dec. 30 it has begun accepting bids for the contract, which is expected to be awarded this year. The Air Force wants a replacement for its T-38 Talon trainer aircraft, first produced by Northrop in 1959. The Talon is used to prep pilots for “front-line fighter and bomber aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, F-15C Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, B-1B Lancer, A-10 Thunderbolt and F-22 Raptor,” according to the service. It hopes to buy 350 new trainer jets. Northrop was the only aerospace company going up against Boeing Co. for a new, “clean-sheet” design for the program, though other companies are working on modified designs of existing trainers. It conducted training tests last summer in the Mojave Desert. Northrop spokeswoman Katherine Thompson confirmed to Defense News at the time that photos, which first surfaced on social media, were of its trainer. Northrop’s plane also took its first flight during the training tests, according to a report from Aviation Week. Northrop was also partnering with its subsidiary Scaled Composites on the project. Earlier on, the team had involved L3 Communications and Rolls-Royce to produce an augmented Hawk T2/128, made by BAE. Northrop and BAE later decided to go with a new concept design. The news comes days after Raytheon Co. and Leonardo-Finmeccanica, offering a modified design of the T-100 jet trainer, dropped out of the running over cost. Raytheon and the Italian defense company butted heads over Leonardo’s inability to drop costs by nearly a third, Defense News first reported. Boeing, collaborating with Saab, is now the only team to offer a brand-new design. The company’s  plane — which flew for the first time last month — sports a twin canted vertical tail design, mimicking fourth- and fifth-generation fighter jets such as the F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and F/A-18 Hornet. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Korea Aerospace Industries are offering modification designs to the T-50, but are not competing in clean-sheet designs. Sierra Nevada Corp. and Turkish Aerospace Industries are also reportedly partnering on their own design for a T-X trainer, one that could be more fuel-efficient, according to Aviation Week.

In a symbolic move, the man in charge of making Airbus jets has reluctantly agreed to leave his office by the vast factories in Toulouse and move to a new corporate headquarters in the same southern French city, people familiar with the matter said. At first sight, it might seem an obvious move following the restructuring in which the planemaking division became the mainstay of the overall structure of a company that also manufactures space rockets, helicopters and military jets. But close watchers of the predominantly Franco-German firm, still bruised by decades of infighting, fear the decision to put planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier in the new HQ alongside his boss Tom Enders could test a fragile internal power balance. For Bregier, it may only be a move of about a kilometre on the ground, but it shifts him ever so slightly away from the company's economic nerve centre that drives its share price, revenue and profits. And it comes at a critical time for the world's second largest planemaker as it strives to boost output. "(Bregier) isn't happy, but he is going to make it work," said one person close to the company, who asked not to be named. Airbus agreed last year to merge its jetliner division with its parent group to reflect the stronger bias towards civil manufacturing that started in 2013, after the failure of a planned merger with British defence firm BAE Systems. After the latest internal restructuring, Bregier gave up his title as chief executive of the Airbus commercial airliner business, but remained its president while also becoming chief operating officer and number two for the group as a whole. "Airbus is now an aircraft manufacturing company with two other divisions, so after the merger the focus on the core business is much tighter," an Airbus spokesman said. Enders, 58, is now drawing core people and functions around him at the new HQ to secure his vision of forging the integrated company he believes is necessary to remain on a par with arch-rival Boeing and fend off new competition. He has pledged to make Airbus a "normal company" after French and German political interference was curbed in 2014 by a change in its corporate governance following the failure of the BAE deal. CRITICAL TASK But plucking Bregier from a domain in which he is undisputed leader - having overseen record plane output and an improved industrial performance - and accentuating his other role as deputy to Enders is seen by some as a potential loss of focus. Airbus is confronted with the critical task of raising its jet output fast to fill thousands of orders on its books, and investors are especially sensitive to any risk its top managers become distracted by internal politics. "What is unusual is to have restructuring happening at a time when production is increasing sharply," one European aerospace analyst said. At the same time, a raft of top managers in the planemaking business involved in operations, sales, programmes and engineering are nearing retirement age. Publicly, Airbus managers have closed ranks behind the CEO's plans. Many recall the industrial chaos and tensions between French and German government shareholders - and their proxies within the company - that hammered Airbus shares a decade ago. Enders, who is German, and Bregier, a 55-year-old Frenchman, have occasionally appeared uneasy partners. Both are major industry figures in their own right and aspire to the top job. But they also demonstrated a pragmatic ability to work together in 2007-12 at what was then the jet division of EADS, later renamed Airbus Group, again with Enders in the lead role. The latest overhaul cements Bregier's position as heir apparent as he is now operational chief of the whole group but it also means he may have to wait longer for the top job. Both men have pledged to make jet production their top priority and company insiders say Bregier had initially suggested he would keep a physical presence in each camp to ensure this. But his office move is just the latest example of a steady shift of key oversight functions towards the centre, consolidating the power of Enders and prompting reports of fresh tension in one of the industry's key personal relationships. The Airbus spokesman dismissed such concerns. "They worked together well when both at Airbus and both their roles have significantly increased, so there is no overlap." The insistence on unity does not end there. Airbus has quietly axed separate brands for its divisions, including the ball-shaped Airbus logo used on its first flight in 1972. Brand experts say the design was worth less than the name, but the loss of a historic symbol underscores the jetmaker's reduced independence within the corporate structure.

Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/Tokyo Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, which announced a fifth delay in the delivery of its passenger jet last week, plans to boost the number of engineers at a Seattle facility by more than a third as it steps up flight tests to meet an extended deadline. The maker of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet will increase staff to more than 200 from about 150 at the engineering centre, which opened in 2015, Yugo Fukuhara, vice president of sales and marketing, said in an interview Tuesday in Tokyo. It will also fly a fourth jet to the US within about a month for testing, he said. “We want to make sure we have good coordination with our flight tests in Washington and engineering in Seattle and Nagoya,” Fukuhara said. The Nagoya-based builder of Japan’s first home-made passenger jet last week pushed back delivery to its launch client ANA Holdings Inc to 2020, two years later than the previous estimate, after needing changes to some electrical configurations to meet certification requirements. Fukuhara said Mitsubishi has kept its customers informed of the delays and there’s been no talk of cancellations. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, the owner of the aircraft maker, has said the development costs are likely to increase about 30% with the latest delay, as the conglomerate attempts to break the dominance of Brazil’s Embraer SA and Canada’s Bombardier Inc on jets with less than 100 seats. The MRJ can seat as many as 92 people and made its first flight in 2015. In a separate interview with Bloomberg Television’s Rishaad Salamat, Fukuhara said the flight test program will continue, declining to provide details of cost escalation. The company is seeking to tap local talent for its Seattle centre because the area offers a lot of people who have previously worked for Boeing Co, Fukuhara said. “One of the reasons we made a base in that area is because there are so many Boeing people there,” he said. ANA, Japan’s biggest airline, said last week it was “disappointed” at this latest delay, but will continue to support the development of the jet as its launch customer. The carrier will maintain its order of 25 planes, including options, it said. St George, Utah-based SkyWest Inc, which has placed an order for 200 planes including options, said last week that its firm orders for the MRJ aircraft “remain unchanged” and are dependent on flying contracts and scope availability. Bridgeton, Missouri-based Trans States Airlines Inc, which has 100 MRJs on order, said in an e-mail that it was “disappointed” by the additional delay. Mitsubishi isn’t the only manufacturer struggling to meet deadlines. Embraer, which is upgrading engines on its jets with less than 100 seats, last month said it was pushing back the entry into service of its E175 E2 jet, which can seat as many as 88 people, to 2021, from 2020. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

As Fred Katayama reports, ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Possibly new competition for FedEx and UPS. Amazon.com - which already leases Boeing planes like this one to handle more of its own deliveries - now plans to spend $1.5 billion to build a huge air cargo hub in northern Kentucky. State officials said the online retailer will lease 900 acres of property near the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky airport. That's about as big in space as the hubs of top cargo airlines, and analysts suspect Amazon's ambitions are larger. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said, "We estimate a $400 billion-plus market opportunity for Amazon in delivery, freight forwarding, and contract logistics." Amazon expects its cargo hub will create more than 2,000 jobs. It hasn't said when it'll open. The company is already using 16 of the 40 767 widebody jets it's leasing from Boeing. The Kentucky location, which is near UPS's major hub, puts Amazon's fleet near several top cities. Amazon shares, up nearly 10 percent this year, getting an additional lift in early trading.

Carsten Spohr has been among U.S. and European airline executives critical of the massive expansion of state-owned Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways Ltd. He and others have accused the trio of using government subsidies to steal traffic and funnel passengers through their respective Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha hubs. The Mideast carriers deny the charge. "This industry needs to see a healthier relationship between offer and demand," Mr. Spohr said. "Limiting growth maybe needs to be discussed and will play a bigger role in the next 12 months than in the last 10 years." The Persian Gulf carriers have grown fast on the back of massive fleet orders with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. They have lured passengers with low prices and lavish amenities. But a prolonged slump in fuel prices and overcapacity have crimped their plans. Etihad and Emirates have cut jobs in recent months as lower oil prices have dented demand for business travel in the Middle East. Etihad has delayed taking some new planes and Emirates has pushed back delivery of some Airbus A380 superjumbos after a 75% drop in first-half profit this financial year. Mr. Spohr suggested an end may be in sight to decades of unbridled expansion for the Gulf airlines. "There's more and more indication that also, as we say in German, trees don't grow into the sky," he said. Mr. Spohr was in Abu Dhabi to announce details about a series of agreements with Etihad Aviation Group. The two airline conglomerates on Wednesday signed a $100 million catering deal and said they would explore cooperation in plane repair and overhaul services. They had already agreed a code-share pact that allows them to sell seats each other's flights on select routes. Emirates Airline already cooperates with Qantas Airways. Qatar Airways is an alliance partner with British Airways, American Airlines Group Inc. and others. Etihad recently announced it is reviewing its strategy of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy stakes in struggling airlines such as Alitalia and Air Berlin PLC to build up scale and catch up with its bigger domestic rival Emirates. James Hogan, who oversaw that strategy and is set to step down as head of Etihad Aviation Group this year, defended that approach but said Etihad would fine-tune it. "Partnerships are at the heart of our strategy," Mr. Hogan said. Even as Lufthansa and Etihad announced their deeper cooperation, Mr. Spohr reaffirmed his view on state aid while sitting aside Mr. Hogan. "It is not a secret that Lufthansa has always been and remains an opponent of state subsidies," Mr. Spohr said.

How a Trade War Could Affect Your Portfolio By John Persinos on February 1, 2017 Just login with your email address to instantly generate a PDF of this content. Privacy Policy Worried about a trade war? Well, here’s at least one bit of encouraging news: Scottish-made haggis may soon come to a table near you. President Trump wants to lift the trade ban on British meat that’s been in effect since the “Mad Cow” epidemic in Britain in 1986 — and haggis makers in Scotland are thrilled. In case you don’t know, the Scottish delicacy of haggis is comprised of sheep offal (heart, liver and lungs) stuffed inside the animal’s intestine. Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland and who operates a golf course there, reportedly promised the Scots that he would lift the meat ban. For other industries, though, the situation is less upbeat. President Trump threatened last Thursday to slap a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to help pay for his promised border wall, an announcement that triggered anxiety on Wall Street, punished U.S. stocks, and caused Mexico’s president to cancel his planned trip to the United States. Trump also has threatened to punish China for supposed trade violations by imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports. What’s it all mean for your portfolio? Let’s turn for insights to Jim Pearce, chief investment strategist of Personal Finance and Director of Portfolio Strategy for Investing Daily. The Art of (Trade) War… Jim Pearce accurately predicted that Trump’s first order of business would be to shelve the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Signing the executive order against TPP was easy. But as Jim explains, now comes the tough part: “The difficulty comes from replacing it with something Congress and our Asian trading partners can all agree on, a feat that will require extraordinary tact and diplomatic finesse. Because this will be the first time these nations will negotiate with our new president, they will want to set terms that they can live with for at least the next four years. For that reason, I don’t expect to see the trade pact replaced with a new deal this year. The upshot will be a disruption in trade, with large multinational consumer goods manufacturers and many information technology companies hurt the most. To placate these businesses, many of which currently hold large sums of cash overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, Trump will dangle tax reform as a carrot… If a tech trade war between China and the United States materializes, the Chinese already have a ready stable of Asian vendors to ply its markets with almost all the hardware it needs…” Who wins, who loses? Trump has pressured U.S.-based companies to keep and create jobs in this country and has lambasted via tweets several American businesses that have operations abroad. Some analysts warn that if a trade war erupts, no one wins and you should dump stocks altogether. We wouldn’t go that far. But keep in mind, particularly at risk would be U.S.-based multinationals with extensive operations and revenue sources in China and Mexico. The most serious ramifications would occur in the world’s second-largest economy, China. Topping this list of vulnerable global players are familiar Big Pharma names such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Probably the worst affected stock would be Chicago-based aerospace/defense giant Boeing (NYSE: BA), the largest manufacturer of aircraft in the world and America’s number one exporter. If Trump slaps China with high tariffs for “unfair” subsidies and trading practices, China would almost certainly retaliate and give its substantial aircraft business to Boeing arch-rival Airbus Group (OTC: EADSY). Of course, other companies would suffer as well — and many of them are blue chip stocks popular in retirement portfolios. Caught in a trade war crossfire would be sales of aircraft jet engines made by General Electric (NYSE: GE); autos made by General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F); iPhones and laptops made by Apple (NSDQ: AAPL); soybeans and corn grown by Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM); and consumer products made by Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL). Just to name a few. However, Trump intends to offset the pain of trade restrictions by granting global corporations significant tax cuts on cash hoards that are repatriated from overseas. That would be a boon for a few of the aforementioned companies, specifically General Electric, Apple and Pfizer, as well as IBM (NYSE: IBM), Microsoft (NYSE: MSFT) and Intel (NSDQ: INTC). Lower taxes on repatriated cash would especially benefit Silicon Valley, because deep-pocketed technology giants probably would use the proceeds to launch a wave of acquisitions, which in turn would stimulate innovation and job creation. As you can see, sorting out the winners and losers of a trade war isn’t so simple. For now, sit tight and don’t make any impulsive moves based on fear. Our investment strategists are monitoring these fast-moving developments; continue following their advice. We’ll provide guidance as events warrant. In the meantime, who knows? Perhaps haggis will one day show up on the White House menu. Got any questions about how a trade war could affect your investments?

By: PTI | Mumbai | Published: February 1, 2017 9:20 PM The enclave has a big hangar and a large dispersal, on land owned by the Navy, adjacent to the runway and taxi track. (PTI) Vice Admiral Girish Luthra, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command inaugurated the Indian Naval Air Enclave in suburban Santacruz here today. “This (enclave) is a significant development from the point of view of naval operations, since it now provides the Indian Navy the capability to stage through all types of fixed wing aircraft held in the naval inventory, including the highly potent and versatile Boeing P8I Long Range Maritime Reconnaissance (LRMR) aircraft,” a Defence spokesperson said. This gives a major boost to the surveillance and offensive measures on the Western seaboard, he said. The P8I LRMR aircraft are presently operating from their base at Arakkonam, near Chennai. With the operationalisation of the NAE at Santacruz, the Navy can now operate them from this enclave, thereby enabling them to operate for longer durations in the Arabian Sea, resulting in vast area coverage. You May Also Like To Watch this: The enclave has a big hangar and a large dispersal, on land owned by the Navy, adjacent to the runway and taxi track. All relevant clearances and approval have been obtained, he said. Vice Adm Luthra lauded the efforts of those involved in creating this facility. He also thanked personnel from MIAL, CISF, Air India and AAI Mumbai for their support and cooperation in operationalising it. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz The F-35 Is Winning the War Against Its Greatest Foe (And Its Not Russia, China or Donald Trump) Andrew DaviesJames Mugg February 1, 2017 TweetShareShare The new US President has taken a very hands-on approach to defense procurement, particularly in the case of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. On December 21, then-President-elect Trump met with the CEO of Lockheed Martin, Marillyn Hewson, after a casual tweet wiped billions off the company’s stock market value. Days later, Trump again took to Twitter to announce that he’d asked Boeing to propose a ‘comparable’ Super Hornet-based alternative to the F-35 (though analysts were quick to point out that the term was an oxymoron), and Lockheed’s share price suffered again—as did defense analysts worldwide. President Trump’s latest claim is that he’s managed to shave US$600 million off the price of the next batch of F-35s; LRIP-10, or the tenth ‘low rate initial production’ order of F-35s. And for a program that only a month ago was being described as being "out of control" and "not very good", mirabile dictu, apparently the F-35’s now "a great plane" and the program is "in good shape". If only that sort of program management skill could be bottled. But (like many others who’ve been watching the program closely) we don’t think this is the Lazarus-like recovery it’s being touted as. On December 20, the day before then President-elect Trump met with Lockheed Martin’s CEO, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office, Lt. General Chris Bogdan said that LRIP-10 aircraft would likely be "somewhere on the order of 6-7% [cheaper] per aeroplane, per variant". That hasn’t been lost on Defense commentators, who’ve already established that the LRIP-10 cost reductions announced by General Bogdan on December 20 would amount to roughly $600m in savings. It appears that President Trump is claiming credit (paywalled) for something that was going to happen anyway. Mind you, a 6-7% percent cost reduction is still impressive, regardless of how it happened. And it’s consistent with a program that’s starting to hit its stride. As we’ve covered here on The Strategist, costs for all three F-35 variants have been coming down steadily, consistent with industry standard practice, for the past few years (F-35A here; B & C here). LRIP-9 aircraft reportedly cost 3.7% less on average than LRIP-8 aircraft, which were in turn 3.5% less than LRIP-7 aircraft. Once the design and development is completed, the most important determining factors in reducing tactical aircraft production costs (or, for that matter, any manufactured good) are economies of scale, and refining the production methodology to reduce inefficiencies. Economies of scale works for the inputs to production; buying larger quantities of materials and components generally allows for more efficient ordering, and provides leverage to help drive down prices. LRIP-10 numbers are more than 50% higher than LRIP-9. Improvements to the production methodology are often called the ‘learning effect‘. By working out new ways of doing things, and as the work force becomes more practiced at the hands-on elements of construction, each new aircraft is produced slightly more efficiently than the last, resulting in a gradual cost saving per aircraft which can result in big cumulative savings across the production run.

Fourteen-year-old Aliah Al Mansouri’s project was selected the winner in the UAE Genes in Space competition, which encouraged students in grades 7 to 12 to develop DNA experiments that could help solve real-life space exploration problems. The student from Al Mawakeb School in Dubai was awarded on the sidelines of the Global Space Congress, a two-day conference and exhibition that saw 600 industry experts meet with government officials and investors to develop the space sector. “Youth engagement and education are important aspects in our strategy to develop national capacity [for the space sector]. We want young people to know and understand that science and technology developed through experimentation and testing in space can greatly improve the quality of their lives,” said Dr Mohammad Alahbabi, director-general at the UAE Space Agency. The agency is responsible for developing the country’s space industry, and organised the Genes in Space contest in collaboration with aircraft manufacturer Boeing. “In fact, we hope that participating in today’s competition encourages the children enough to have them eventually journey into space,” Dr Alahbabi added. The UAE has already invested about Dh20 billion in the space sector, including the launch of a number of commercial satellites. In 2014, it also announced the Hope Mars Mission, which is set to send an unmanned probe to the Red Planet by 2020, and the Mission is being carried out by a team composed solely of Emirati engineers. Al Mansouri’s experiment was among 60 others submitted for the Genes in Space contest. She hypothesised that heat shock proteins, which play a protective role by helping other cellular proteins maintain their shape, might be triggered in space due to factors like cosmic radiation, mental stress and the presence of other microorganisms. Al Mansouri will get a chance to travel to the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida later this year to witness the launch of her experiment in space. “I have always been intensely passionate about Space, watching hours and hours of the Star Wars movies and searching through encyclopedias to learn more. But knowing that my experiment will be tested in space feels surreal. It also tells me I’m a step closer to going to Mars,” Al Mansouri told Gulf News. The ambitious young student added that she dreams of becoming the first Emirati astronaut, and also of one day landing on Mars. Once the mission carrying Al Mansouri’s experiment is launched, it could take about six months for it to return, said Kevin Foley, responsible for global sales and marketing at Boeing. In addition to the Genes in Space contestants, about 25 other children also participated in a series of Little Engineer workshops organised by aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The students were taught to build rockets, and familiarised with how space stations help coordinate missions. “The young generation plays a great role in furthering the space sector in countries where the industry is still emerging. Our programme has so far trained about 3,000 budding young space enthusiasts around the world, and its presence in the UAE is simply part of our partnership with the country’s space initiatives,” said Nicolas Chammusy, executive vice-president and head of space systems at Airbus.

The market for VR and AR is growing as more businesses realise the potential benefits of the technologies - one report from Digi-Capital predicts the VR/AR market to be worth $£95bn by 2020. The technologies have been used in both civil aviation and the military for simulated training for several years, but only now are we seeing them implemented to fulfil a key requirement in MRO – the shortage of skilled engineers. Expansion too quick for training to keep pace The rising passenger demand for air travel has resulted in a global expansion for airlines, but maintenance expertise is struggling to keep up. The Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions in particular are witnessing huge growth in aircraft procurement. Both regions saw year-on-year growth of over 10 percent in air passenger demand in 2016, eclipsing the growth in demand of North American and European carriers. According to Boeing, the ME and APAC regions also took the most deliveries of large and medium wide-body aircraft in 2015, an indicator of the serious fleet expansion and modernisation of airlines. In addition, as western military air forces have reduced warfighter numbers in support areas, the traditional pool and outflow of mid-career engineers into more stable civil careers is rapidly reducing. Training not easy in a highly-regulated industry There is a lag of some 5 years to get a B1 or B2 EASA licence as a qualified aircraft engineer and in many countries there is simply not yet the training infrastructure to drive this. Even in the US, it can take up to eight elapsed years for a maintenance professional to become fully licensed. Most of this time needs to be spent doing on-the-job training and classes, which can further be delayed by difficulties in providing access to the practical EASA Part-145 training. With a highly-regulated industry such as aviation MRO, tasks are qualifications oriented. Specific training enables engineers to do specific jobs, on specific aircraft and no more. The result is a global shortage of maintenance professionals, particularly in the APAC, Middle East, and the more remote locations serviced by Western airlines. At last year's Airline Engineering & Maintenance Middle East Conference, John Bowell, Managing Director of the newly-formed ADA Millennium, a management consultancy joint venture between the Abu Dhabi Aviation and UK-based jcba Limited, predicted Middle East aircraft maintenance would require 11 million man hours a year. The first Emirates Airbus A380 overhaul required a round-the-clock 55-day maintenance programme. To put this into perspective, Ashley Davies, senior lecturer of aircraft maintenance at Abu Dhabi Polytechnic, also discussed resource shortages at the same conference, reporting only 342 UAE nationals were licensed as aircraft engineers. Globalisation of routes In civil aviation, routes are evolving so fast that operational hubs are both expanding and globally dispersing. In Europe and North America, major airports are supported by a wealth of qualified engineers and facilities to get aircraft back in the air as soon as possible. There are also established networks of 3rd party MRO providers. In other geographies, many experiencing rapid growth, there is no such pool of maintenance engineers. If an airline is to expand its network or an aircraft is forced to land in remote locations, the challenges of being able to quickly return it to operational status are a lot more complex. Three options, one clear winner Maintenance operators are faced with three options: Strategically position maintenance engineers aligned to aircraft routes An option is for civil aviation operators is to strategically place more qualified engineers on the ground across global flight paths - either indigenous or contracted 3rd party – but that has to be unrealistic in most cases. The average pay for one aircraft maintenance engineer is £40,000 per year. You need both senior and junior engineers in place as well as managing shift patterns. There are also the overheads to provide human support in remoter areas in terms of travel, accommodation and expenses, not to mention the maintenance facilities required. Operate a 'fix when required' approach Should airlines risk leaving an aircraft sitting idle in a remote location and fly a qualified engineer out to fix it on a case-by-case basis? This would possibly be feasible on busier routes close to global airport hubs, but fully qualified engineers are already in scarce supply. In extreme circumstances, if an aircraft must land in a remote location it may take several days of travel for a suitably qualified maintenance engineer to reach the aircraft. Boeing estimates that, depending on the operator and age of an aircraft, an aircraft on ground (AOG) for one or two hours can cost anywhere between £8,000 and £120,000. When returning an aircraft to operational status, time means money – the further an operator can spread their maintenance engineers, the less revenue they lose. The Third Way - Augmented and Virtual Reality Using remote guidance via a wearable or mobile device, engineer skills can be ‘augmented’ as more qualified technicians provide expertise from any location at any time. Virtual reality simulation can even speed the training process itself. At the 2016 MRO Europe conference in Amsterdam, ICF International vice-president Oliver Jonathan Berger predicted virtual reality could shave one or two years off traditional maintenance engineer training programmes. AR and VR could be of particular interest to MROs in the coming years – reducing training times, improving maintenance efficiency and bringing huge cost savings. Enter Augmented reality Current mobile solutions support collaboration and drive in better data capture and compliance but in themselves do not solve the skills ‘not in the correct place’ problem. Maintenance staff could of course contact senior engineers via Skype video or on normal phone to ask questions. However, there is no way of seeing or even demonstrating or interacting with how a task should be executed. These are airworthiness decisions after all. Integrating augmented reality with a configuration-controlled solution adds the necessary rigor to remote maintenance tasks. Australian Engine MRO specialist and IFS customer TAE has developed fountx, a telepresence and data transmission solution that connects onsite operators with a technical expert anywhere in the world, in real-time. Through wearable augmented reality systems, fountx gives maintenance workers in remote locations access to a virtual pair of expert eyes and hands to guide them through complex tasks. The headset includes a near-eye display and a camera, which provides the remote expert with immersive communications without affecting the user’s spatial awareness – important in dealing with maintenance in tight spaces. The remote user can access the internet or a controlled 'live document' to assist with the task at hand and fountx has the ability to record operations, enabling evidence gathering. The system also enables the remote expert to mark up the image the technician is viewing, for example by circling areas or using pointing arrows. The expert just uses his or her hands and a touch screen. Partnering for the future IFS is already working with AR specialists XMReality on remote guidance through augmented reality into the field-based environment, enabling engineers involved in a repair to contact colleagues back at base. With this remote guidance, a support technician can watch, show and guide the engineer through every step of the repair without having to leave base. Using smart glasses or a mobile device, engineers can see a real-time and interactive demonstration of the repair job right in front of their eyes. These skills can be leveraged anywhere, anytime with the capability of modern mobile technology. What’s next – signing off aircraft through augmented reality When these AR and VR technologies are integrated with an aviation ERP or MRO solution, the maintenance operator can quickly execute and report repair jobs – getting equipment back up and running as soon as possible. The next step has to be developing these solutions to the point where a ‘virtual sign-off’ is considered by airline authorities as safe as a sign off on the tarmac. Augmented reality has a vital role to play from start to finish. With augmented reality maximising engineer efficiency, operators will no longer have to ‘mind the gap’ when it comes to maintenance resources.   View Original Article Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Investors shifted their money to less risky investments for the second day in a row. For the second straight day, stocks started with substantial losses. Industrial companies, which have climbed lately, fell the most as UPS tumbled after a weak fourth-quarter report. Banks also slipped. Investors bid up assets that are traditionally seen as less risky, including gold, government bonds, and stocks that pay big dividends. Drug companies also rallied after President Donald Trump met with industry executives and discussed ideas including faster drug approvals and lower taxes. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said investors are looking for safer investments because the change from Barack Obama’s administration to Donald Trump’s has created so many changes in government. “More than anything right now, it’s just the pace of news,” he said. “It is so dramatic.” The stock market made huge gains after Trump was elected last fall, and Paulsen said it’s not a surprise that investors would sell some of their holdings, take some profits, and move to lower-risk investments at some point. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 107.04 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,864.09 as companies like Goldman Sachs and Boeing returned some of their recent gains. The S&P 500 lost 2.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,278.87. It fell as much as 13 points early on. The S&P 500 has fallen for four days in a row. While that is its longest losing streak since before the presidential election, the losses have been small. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.07 points to 5,614.79. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 9.49 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,361.82. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks rose than fell. Athletic apparel maker Under Armour plunged after investors were disappointed with its fourth-quarter report, which included higher expenses. Under Armour also issued a weak full-year forecast and said its chief financial officer is leaving. The stock tumbled $7.45, or 25.7 percent, to $21.49. It dropped 30 percent last year and is now trading at its lowest price in two years. United Parcel Service sank after the package delivery company forecast an annual profit that was far smaller than analysts expected. UPS expects to earn no more than $6.10 a share this year while FactSet says experts expected $6.15 per share. UPS gave up $7.90, or 6.8 percent, to $109.13 and FedEx fell $4.14, or 2.1 percent, to $189.11. That helped pull industrial companies lower. Drug companies jumped after Trump said he wants less regulation on prescription drugs because that could speed up drug approvals. While Trump again said he wants to reduce drug prices, investors seemed pleased with proposals that could reduce drugmakers’ costs and boost their profits, as well as with the tone of the meeting. Just three weeks ago Trump said drugmakers were “getting away with murder” on prices. The Nasdaq Biotech index climbed 2.8 percent. Companies that make both generic and name-brand drugs traded higher, as did prescription drug distributors. After the market closed, Apple reported a bigger profit and greater sales than analysts expected as iPhone sales bounced back from a recent slump. The tech giant’s stock rose 2.6 percent in after-hours trading. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.46 percent from 2.49 percent. That hurt financial stocks, as lower bond yields reduce interest rates and the profits banks make from lending. Investors who want income also bought stocks that pay outsize dividends, including real estate investment trusts and utility companies. Shopping mall operators Simon Property Group and GGP both traded higher after their quarterly reports. Simon gained $6.03, or 3.4 percent, to $183.77 and GGP rose 88 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $24.84. The price of gold and silver made their biggest jumps in two weeks. Gold rose $15.40, or 1.3 percent, to $1,211.40 an ounce. Silver gained 39 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $17.54 an ounce. Copper picked up 7 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.73 a pound. That was its largest move in three weeks. Another day of protests against parts of Trump’s agenda and challenges for some of his cabinet nominees who haven’t been confirmed by Congress made investors a bit more nervous early in the day. The VIX, an index known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” jumped 9 percent around midday, but finished only 1 percent higher. It had climbed Monday. U.S. crude oil rose 18 cents to $52.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, added 47 cents to $55.70 a barrel in London. However energy companies continued to decline. After big gains over the last year, especially in November and early December, energy companies have done worse than the rest of the market. Exxon Mobil lost 97 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $83.89. Natural gas companies fell as the price of that fuel fell 12 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $3.12 per 1,000 cubic feet. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.61 a gallon. The dollar fell to 112.76 yen from 113.67 yen. The euro rose to $1.0803 from $1.0695. Germany’s DAX lost 1.3 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.7 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.7 percent. The South Korean Kospi lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan were closed for Lunar New Year holidays. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

Print XClose Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Defence 01-February-2017 16:05 IST Indian Naval Air Enclave at Santa Cruz Inaugurated Vice Admiral Girish Luthra, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command inaugurated the Indian Naval Air Enclave, Santa Cruz (NAE Scz) at Santa Cruz, Mumbai today. The new Indian Naval Air Enclave has a big hangar and a large dispersal, on land owned by the Navy, adjacent to the Runway and the taxi track. This is a significant development from the point of view of Naval Operations, since, it now provides Indian Navy, capability to stage through all types of fixed wing aircraft held in the Naval Inventory including the highly potent and versatile Boeing P8I Long Range Maritime Reconnaissance (LRMR) aircraft. This gives a major boost to the surveillance and offensive measures on the areas of interest in the Western Seaboard. P8I LRMR aircraft are presently operating from their base at Arakkonam, near Chennai. With the operationalization of the NAE at Santa Cruz, the Indian Navy can operate the P8I’s from this enclave thereby enabling them to operate for longer durations in the Arabian Sea resulting in vast area coverage. In his address, Vice Admiral Girish Luthra complimented the efforts of all those involved in creating this facility. He said that the city of Mumbai and Indian Navy have had long standing relations which were not restricted to the Dockyard or harbour areas. He amplified that, decades ago, naval helicopters and Super Constellation surveillance aircrafts operated from the same airport. He thanked, among others, Airport Authority of India, MIAL, CISF, Air India, contractors and Military Engineering Service for their support and co-operation in operationalizing this facility and solicited their continued support and cooperation in the future. ***** RS/SDR/NV

NEW YORK — Stocks fought their way to a mixed finish Tuesday as drugmakers rallied, which mostly canceled out losses for industrial companies. Investors shifted their money to less risky investments for the second day in a row. For the second straight day, stocks started with substantial losses. Industrial companies, which have climbed lately, fell the most as UPS tumbled after a weak fourth-quarter report. Banks also slipped. Investors bid up assets that are traditionally seen as less risky, including gold, government bonds, and stocks that pay big dividends. Drug companies also rallied after President Donald Trump met with industry executives and discussed ideas including faster drug approvals and lower taxes. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said investors are looking for safer investments because the change from Barack Obama's administration to Donald Trump's has created so many changes in government. “More than anything right now, it's just the pace of news,” he said. “It is so dramatic.” The stock market made huge gains after Trump was elected last fall, and Paulsen said it's not a surprise that investors would sell some of their holdings, take some profits, and move to lower-risk investments at some point. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 107.04 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,864.09 as companies like Goldman Sachs and Boeing returned some of their recent gains. The S&P 500 lost 2.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,278.87. It fell as much as 13 points early on. The S&P 500 has fallen for four days in a row. While that is its longest losing streak since before the presidential election, the losses have been small. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.08 points to 5,614.79. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 9.49 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,361.82. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks rose than fell. Athletic apparel maker Under Armour plunged after investors were disappointed with its fourth-quarter report, which included higher expenses. Under Armour also issued a weak full-year forecast and said its chief financial officer is leaving. The stock tumbled $7.45, or 25.7 percent, to $21.49. It dropped 30 percent last year and is now trading at its lowest price in two years. United Parcel Service sank after the package delivery company forecast an annual profit that was far smaller than analysts expected. UPS expects to earn no more than $6.10 a share this year while FactSet says experts expected $6.15 per share. UPS gave up $7.90, or 6.8 percent, to $109.13 and FedEx fell $4.14, or 2.1 percent, to $189.11. That helped pull industrial companies lower. Drug companies jumped after Trump said he wants less regulation on prescription drugs because that could speed up drug approvals. While Trump again said he wants to reduce drug prices, investors seemed pleased with proposals that could reduce drugmakers' costs and boost their profits, as well as with the tone of the meeting. Just three weeks ago Trump said drugmakers were “getting away with murder” on prices. The Nasdaq Biotech index climbed 2.8 percent. Companies that make both generic and name-brand drugs traded higher, as did prescription drug distributors. After the market closed, Apple reported a bigger profit and greater sales than analysts expected as iPhone sales bounced back from a recent slump. The tech giant's stock rose 2.6 percent in after-hours trading. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.46 percent from 2.49 percent. That hurt financial stocks, as lower bond yields reduce interest rates and the profits banks make from lending. Investors who want income also bought stocks that pay outsize dividends, including real estate investment trusts and utility companies. Shopping mall operators Simon Property Group and GGP both traded higher after their quarterly reports. Simon gained $6.03, or 3.4 percent, to $183.77 and GGP rose 88 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $24.84. The price of gold and silver made their biggest jumps in two weeks. Gold rose $15.40, or 1.3 percent, to $1,211.40 an ounce. Silver gained 39 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $17.54 an ounce. Copper picked up 7 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.73 a pound. That was its largest move in three weeks. Another day of protests against parts of Trump's agenda and challenges for some of his cabinet nominees who haven't been confirmed by Congress made investors a bit more nervous early in the day. The VIX, an index known as Wall Street's “fear gauge,” jumped 9 percent around midday, but finished only 1 percent higher. It had climbed Monday. U.S. crude oil rose 18 cents to $52.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, added 47 cents to $55.70 a barrel in London. However energy companies continued to decline. After big gains over the last year, especially in November and early December, energy companies have done worse than the rest of the market. Exxon Mobil lost 97 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $83.89. Natural gas companies fell as the price of that fuel fell 12 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $3.12 per 1,000 cubic feet. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.61 a gallon. The dollar fell to 112.76 yen from 113.67 yen. The euro rose to $1.0803 from $1.0695. Germany's DAX lost 1.3 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.7 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.7 percent. The South Korean Kospi lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan were closed for Lunar New Year holidays.

A cornerstone of the 63rd Legislature’s reform agenda was the Public Information Act of 1973, which empowered the people to see what their government officials were doing and hold them accountable. Lawmakers clearly stated the public’s right to know, in most cases, should prevail over other interests because information is key to accountability. But the Texas Supreme Court ignored this fundamental principle of the law and overlooked decades of prior interpretations when deciding two recent cases regarding public information: Boeing v. Paxton and Greater Houston Partnership v. Paxton. In both cases, the court chose to protect the interests of private entities that benefit from public funds over the rights of the people. The press and various watchdog groups raised the alarm when these opinions were released in 2015. But now that the 85th Legislature is in session, it’s incredibly important that Texans understand what is at stake, too. Every year, our state and local governments enter into thousands of contracts with private entities such as engineers, accountants, road-builders, foster care agencies, food service providers, information technology companies, social service groups and so many more. These contracts, which together are worth billions, dictate what we as the taxpayers will pay, what we’ll receive in return and who’ll reap the financial benefit. And now, in many instances, those contracts can be kept hidden from those of us who are picking up the tab. This process is ripe for abuse, as we’ve seen time and again from recent contracting scandals. Has a company failed to deliver on time and on budget? Has a state or local official struck a self-serving deal? People will generally behave better if they know someone could be watching. To be good watchdogs, the public must first be able to see government contracts. Increasingly, these court decisions are being used to shield basic information that would have been released before. In 2016, the state Attorney General’s Office ruled in about 600 cases that information may be withheld under the competitive bidding exception; that’s compared with about 250 in 2014, the year prior to the Supreme Court ruling. We’re not talking about protecting a company’s trade secrets here. Those are covered elsewhere in the Public Information Act. Examples of withheld information have been well-documented and include: how much the city of McAllen paid Enrique Iglesias to perform in a holiday parade; how many licenses Houston issued to Uber; and how public money is spent by the Greater Fort Bend Economic Development Council on behalf of local cities, schools and special districts. In each of these cases, the public is now unable to trace public funds. Unfortunately we can only expect this problem to get worse as more private businesses and public entities try to push the bounds of what can be withheld under these rulings. At the same time, state and local governments are increasingly outsourcing public services. In fact, Boeing and Greater Houston Partnership create a perverse incentive to channel public money through private entities to avoid disclosure. If you think this sounds like the next Sharpstown scandal waiting to happen, you’re on the right track. The good news is the Legislature will soon have an opportunity to close the loopholes the court created in Boeing and Greater Houston Partnership, and we have filed legislation to do just that. We hope Texans will appreciate the need for this legislation and encourage its adoption. Only then can we restore government accountability and avoid the kind of scandal that led to the Public Information Act’s passage in the first place.

Alex Hicks Spartanburg Herald-Journal i Zach Fox Spartanburg Herald-Journal LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Cherokee County school officials hope a significant gift from BMW Manufacturing Co. will help train students for the workforce of tomorrow. BMW donated $300,000 to the Cherokee County School District to fund Project Lead the Way programs at four district middle schools. Project Lead the Way is a nonprofit organization that provides science, engineering, technology and math education to students in schools nationwide. The program was already available in middle schools across Spartanburg and Greenville counties. It's expected to begin at Gaffney, Blacksburg, Ewing and Granard middle schools this fall. "One of the reasons BMW considered its first U.S. plant in the state of South Carolina was because of superb technical colleges and a steadily growing, well-educated workforce," said Johannes Trauth, vice president of human resources. "The industry's workforce must be ready to meet future technological challenges. These young people are our future engineers, designers and inventors." Statewide, BMW joined Boeing as corporate partners helping fund Project Lead the Way in schools. University of South Carolina College of Engineering and Mathematics staff will provide training for Cherokee County teachers working to implement the STEM curriculum in classrooms. "Project Lead the Way really provides a transformative learning experience," Superintendent Quincie Moore said. Rex Bolinger, senior vice president and chief partnerships officer for Project Lead the Way, said other major companies in South Carolina should follow the lead of BMW and Boeing to invest in the future workforce. Companies using advanced technology have a lot to gain from a well-educated, well-trained workforce, he said. Sky Foster, communications manager with BMW Manufacturing, said the company wanted to reach beyond established partnerships with state colleges and universities. "BMW has a strong presence in four-year colleges and universities. We have a strong presence in the two-year technical colleges. Our next step was to find ways to engage students at the middle schools levels," she said. "This is the place where students begin to develop a passion for determining career aspirations." The donation was made after researching the impact BMW could have on Cherokee County education, given how many employees make the drive from the county each day, Foster said. Moore said the county's current Project Lead the Way program will move from Gaffney High School to the Cherokee County Career and Technology Center when it opens next year on the county's Spartanburg Community College campus. That way, Gaffney and Blacksburg high school students will be able to get involved. "They (BMW) could've picked anybody, but they picked us," she said. "For me, the new Career and Technology Center is a game-changer for economic development. This type of curriculum combined with that is going to provide the kind of workforce the community needs to sustain that economic development."

Budget 2017: Budget 2017 is out: Read how it impacts you and India Unlike Barrack Obama’s inauguration as US President eight years ago, when brands were more than happy to chime in, the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th US President was, relatively, a muted affair. In part it’s the fear of a “mean tweet” broadcast to over 21 million people from the handle @realDonaldTrump that kept away the more cautious American marketers in the latter half of 2016 from providing pithy commentary on Trump. Naturally, marketers are even more restrained now as it is Trump tweeting as POTUS. Companies in the US across sectors are busy Trump-proofing their brands and bracing themselves against backlash triggered by any kind of association – supportive or critical, direct or indirect - to Trump. Pepsi, Kellogg’s, New Balance, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, GM, Ford and Toyota are just some companies who have seen their share values and brands take a serious hit over Trump. It’s a ‘Trumped if you do, Trumped if you don’t’ kind of situation. Now some marketers want nothing to do with the man who occupies the most powerful office in the world. According to reports, American marketers are asking their ad buyers to steer clear of news about Trump, an “unprecedented” move according to a US based trade website. Yet many fear being pulled into a black hole of controversy, not of their doing or choosing. As a result business is booming for communication consultants who are helping companies deal with the eventuality of a direct Trump-attack. Their recommendations include Rapid Response teams for Twitter and Facebook. Quartz recently reported that a global strategy firm issued a company-wide directive that categorises Trump’s tweet in the same class as a “natural disaster”; a singular, random event that leaves behind a huge clean-up job. A brand launching a direct assault on Trump seems nuts. Nevertheless, that’s exactly what this Lebanese brand of nuts did. With no fear of a classic Trump mean tweet or a call for boycott or a tsunami of hate, Al Rifai published one of the boldest and bluntest work we’ve seen from any brand anywhere in the world. On inauguration day, Al Rifai and its agency Republique Beirut ran an ad on the front page of The Daily Star, nestled below a Trump headline, with just this copy: ‘The world has gone nuts’. The agency’s managing director Fadi Mroue tells us the ad was thought of, executed, approved and published in a span of 24 hours. “The idea came from the general mood around us,” he says, “The US is viewed as a beacon of democracy and people were confused about a Donald Trump presidency. This was not just the sentiment in Lebanon, but around the world as well.” Incidentally, the most positive reactions to the ad came from the US. On any other day or page of the paper, Al Rifai’s ad wouldn’t have had the kind of impact it did. Mroue says, “It was meant to complement a headline we predicted was going to appear. We went with print because we needed to respond to a headline and in press we felt this would be more impactful.” However, the ad’s biggest audience was on social media, naturally, where it spread like a “news” forward of dubious provenance. Like most topical advertising, only one thing could have derailed Republique’s plans: News more pressing, catastrophic or with much wider implications than the crowning of Donald J Trump as the President of America.

After years of losing ground to index funds, portfolio managers and wealth advisers say Trump's assertive moves, like singling out individual companies, may create a chance to set their investment strategies apart — even if they think some of Trump's verbal assaults are just bluster. “If he’s going to create volatility, we're going to take advantage of it,” said Ross Gerber, president of California wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki Inc. Professional stockpickers are under pressure to improve returns as investors increasingly turn to cheaper passive investments — redirecting tens of billions of dollars each month. Trump's pledge to shake up regulations affecting sectors such as finance, autos and healthcare, as well as his promise to cut taxes, could create big corporate winners and losers. That could give active fund managers an opportunity, in theory, to showcase their skills. “This administration was elected with many people hoping for change, and that's going to upset the apple cart with old losers coming back in favour,” said Scott Schermerhorn, chief executive of Granite Investment Advisors in New Hampshire. So far, Schermerhorn has made few changes to his portfolios, like the Granite Value Fund. With Trump in office less than two weeks, he is waiting for clearer signs on what new policies will be introduced. Schermerhorn also said he has talked some clients out of bailing on stocks such as Boeing or drugmakers after Trump criticised them publicly on Twitter — tweets Schermerhorn said he read as simply negotiating positions. Gerber has already acted on Trump. After the then-president-elect slammed Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet programme as too expensive on Dec 12, Gerber bought Lockheed shares. Trump said on Monday his administration was able to cut US$600 million (RM2.65 billion) from its latest contract for the jet, but Gerber said the case for the stock remains its longer-term outlook. “Bullying companies ultimately won't change the economics,” he said. Dispersion The turn to passive management reflects how many active managers have failed to produce the higher returns that would justify their more costly fees. In theory, if Trump produces winners and losers in corporate America, then active managers could be helped by a rise in “dispersion,” a measure of the gap in returns among stocks. During December, dispersion in the S&P 500 index was 14 per cent, the lowest in two years, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. “The friend of active management is high dispersion, and transitions. We think we have both of those,” said Collin Bell, a managing director at Goldman Sachs' asset management division. But dispersion is a double-edged sword if fund managers wind up on the wrong side of a trade — a distinct possibility given Trump's willingness to talk policy on social media and re-evaluate key foreign policy principles. His recent move to curb immigration has sent major US stock indexes plummeting. “Trying to react to his tweets, for a long-term investor, I think is a very dangerous game to play,” said John Linehan, portfolio manager of the US$23 billion T Rowe Price Equity Income Fund. He said he spends more time following policy discussions, after years in which Washington's actions did not affect particular stocks so much. Linehan cited the on-again, off-again talk of a “border adjustment tax” as the sort of issue to keep an eye on. A recent jump in volatility has been a boon for day traders, who have a short-term horizon. But Trump's tweets are too sporadic for many of the quantitative strategists from hedge funds and banks, who track patterns and trends. Indeed, higher dispersion could provide a business opportunity for active stockpickers' arch-rivals, the passive funds. To shield investors from stock gyrations, Michael LaBella, portfolio manager at Legg Mason Inc's QS Investors unit, said it encourages investors to consider diversification products like its Low Volatility High Dividend ETF in case promised policy changes do not actually emerge. “Because there is so much policy uncertainty, you can't differentiate what's policy and what's just bluster,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Uphill task for Geely if Proton deal goes through, research house says Chatime owner accuses Malaysian franchisee of using unapproved ingredients KL shares higher at mid-day If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Moody’s eyes downgrade for Sime Darby after planned units spin-off Jakim’s new certification enables Halal Pharmaceuticals to expand locally, globally US airlines tumble amid fear Trump travel ban will spread An iPhone made in America?

CreditPhotograph by Goh Seng Chong / Bloomberg / Getty Over the weekend, Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, the venerable manufacturing conglomerate that dates back to 1892—and Thomas Edison—issued a statement to G.E.’s employees distancing the company from Donald Trump’s travel bans on people from predominantly Muslim nations. “We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,” Immelt pointed out. He said the firm would “stand with” its employees and customers in the countries affected by Trump’s discriminatory policy. That was a laudable statement, and Immelt, a longtime G.E. executive, deserves credit for issuing it. On the same day it was issued, however, the National Association of Manufacturers, which has representatives from G.E. and many other large U.S. companies on its board of directors, was striking a very different pose toward the Trump Administration. It ran ads on the Sunday talk shows urging congressional confirmation for Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, whom Trump has chosen to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has close ties to the oil-and-gas industry. He is an archenemy of federal regulations and laws that are designed to tackle global warming and other environmental threats, but which one of the trade association’s ads describe as “job-killing regulations slapped on manufacturers, energy producers, and farmers.” If Pruitt is confirmed, he will almost certainly roll back many federal directives, lowering the financial costs facing big companies like G.E. The juxtaposition of Immelt’s statement with the expression of support for Pruitt summed up corporate America’s Janus-faced attitude to the Trump Administration. On the one hand, many senior executives welcome the promises to cut corporate taxes and make a bonfire of federal regulations. They also fear incurring Trump’s wrath and appearing on his Twitter feed. At the annual Alfalfa Club dinner, in Washington, on Saturday, a long-established get-together for corporate bigwigs, one C.E.O. approached a rival and inquired how he could condemn Trump’s executive order “without poking the bear,” the Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin reports. The answer to the anonymous C.E.O.’s query was that it probably can’t be done. Trump is a vengeful figure who takes careful note of slights and sometimes brings them up months or years later. As President, he has the power to punish firms and individuals that cross him. For some Fortune 500 companies, such as defense contractors like G.E. and Boeing, and the big pharmaceutical companies, representatives of which met with Trump at the White House on Tuesday, the federal government is a big customer: huge contracts are at stake. Banks and other financial firms require good relationships with the federal agencies that regulate them. Corporate mergers, such as the pending one between A.T. & T. and Time Warner, require approval. In a normal Administration, it might be outlandish to suggest that the President would interfere with the workings of specialist federal agencies, such as the Justice Department’s antitrust bureau. But of course, there is little that is normal about Trump or his Presidency. Shortly before he took office, he met with Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of A.T. & T. Afterward, A.T. & T. officials insisted that the pending merger didn’t come up in the discussions, but public-interest groups pointed out that the meeting violated long-standing tradition that Presidents (and Presidents-elect) avoid direct contact with parties that have important regulatory decisions pending. In this environment, it is understandable that C.E.O.s, mindful of their shareholders and their own hefty stock-and-option packages, are reluctant to criticize the new Administration’s policies, let alone Trump himself. But it’s also becoming evident that, in many areas, the long-term interests of America’s biggest corporations, far from being aligned with the Trump Presidency, run directly counter to it. In terms of outlook, organization, and revenues, firms like G.E., General Motors, Caterpillar, Apple, Google, and Facebook are globalists. The Administration is isolationist—its slogan is “America First.” Multinational corporations prosper from free trade, open markets, and offshoring; the Administration is protectionist and intent on preserving U.S. manufacturing jobs. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, describes himself as “an economic nationalist.” To gain access to foreign markets and foreign talent, the multinationals rely on America’s “soft power”—the ability to get other countries to act in the interest of the United States and its citizens, including its corporate citizens, without using force. Trump is undermining U.S. soft power by the day. Demonstrations against him have been held all over the world, and many foreign governments increasingly view his America as a rogue nation. Pointing out that, in the past, big companies have coöperated with authoritarian regimes won’t make this conflict of interest go away. The U.S. economy isn’t an autarky like Germany in the nineteen-thirties, where Volkswagen, Bayer, Siemens, and other German corporations benefitted from protectionism, the outlawing of independent trade unions, and big government contracts. In today’s economy, firms like G.E., Intel, and Apple get most of their revenue from overseas, and their operations are spread all over the world. What matters to them most is the preservation of a global trading system that took decades to build. Trump, with his chauvinistic rhetoric, his opposition to multilateral trade deals, and his casual denigration of multilateral organizations like the European Union and NATO, represents a threat to that system. So far, no well-known C.E.O. has come out and said all this explicitly, although Immelt did hint at some of it. “There would be no GE without our smart dedicated colleagues from all over the world,” he wrote. “We are a global team, and we will stand together as the global political situation continues to evolve.” In another significant development, Netflix’s Reed Hastings expostulated the ethical argument against the ban as well as the economic one. “Trump’s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all,” Hastings said on Facebook. “It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.” (My colleague Vauhini Vara wrote about Silicon Valley’s reaction to the travel bans.) In the weeks and months ahead, it will be interesting to see which, if any, corporate leaders summon the courage to follow Hastings’s lead. Tax cuts and regulatory relief are one thing. But for some of America’s biggest and most successful companies, the issues here are much bigger. With Trump and Bannon in the White House, their entire ecosystem is under threat.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has snapped out of the first sales slump in the iPhone's decade-long history, but the upturn doesn't mean that the pioneering company has broken out of its innovation funk. If anything, the numbers released Tuesday in Apple's fiscal first-quarter report served as the latest reminder of the company's growing dependence on the iPhone while fruitlessly trying to come up with another breakthrough product since its chief visionary, Steve Jobs, died in 2011. ___ A rare swing and miss from Under Armour in 4Q; shares plunge BALTIMORE (AP) — Under Armour, typically a star on earnings day, suffered a rare miss in the fourth quarter, sending shares plunging 23 per cent. The company's extended streak of soaring revenue growth going back years rose 12 per cent, just over half what the Baltimore company has established as its norm. ___ Stocks battle to a mixed finish as drugmakers rally NEW YORK (AP) — US stocks finish mixed as industrial companies and banks fall, but investors bid up stocks that pay big dividends, like utilities. Health care companies rally after a meeting between President Donald Trump and drug company executives. The Dow Jones industrial average falls as recent gainers like Goldman Sachs and Boeing decline. ___ At a moment of uncertainty, Fed likely to leave rates alone WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is all but sure to leave interest rates alone when it ends a policy meeting Wednesday at a time of steady gains for the U.S. economy but also heightened uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration. ___ CEO Jeff Bezos says Amazon backs suit opposing Trump order SEATTLE (AP) — Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says the Seattle-based company supports a lawsuit filed by Washington state's attorney general against President Donald Trump and the administration over Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees. Fellow Washington state-based companies Microsoft and Expedia are also supporting the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday. ___ Exxon reports big drop in 4Q profit, takes gas write-down DALLAS (AP) — Exxon Mobil posted its smallest quarterly profit in more than 17 years as low oil and gas prices pushed the company to write down the value of some natural gas holdings in the United States. The 40 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profit capped Exxon's weakest year since 1998. ___ Pfizer swings to 4Q profit after rough year, hikes 2017 view Drugmaker Pfizer Inc. is forecasting slightly higher sales and profit this year after a difficult 2016, though reduced spending on overhead and lawsuits helped it swing to a fourth-quarter profit, following a loss a year earlier. The biggest U.S. drugmaker still missed analysts' profit expectations, but it edged past revenue expectations. ___ US consumer confidence slips in January from 15-year high WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence slipped this month after surging to a 15-year high in December. The Conference Board says its consumer confidence index dropped to 111.8 in January from a December reading of 113.3, which had been the highest since August 2001. ___ Trump to sign order strengthening cybersecurity WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order to improve the government's ability to protect its computer networks and fend off hackers. The move puts the Office of Management and Budget in charge of cybersecurity efforts within the executive branch and directs federal agency heads to develop their own protection plans. Such a review has become a familiar move for an incoming administration. This year, it follows allegations of election-season hacking by the Russian government. ___ Wal-Mart dumps its version of Amazon Prime for new path NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is replacing a program that offered free shipping but had an annual fee with one that has a lower free shipping threshold and faster delivery. It's one of the first big moves by Walmart.com's CEO Mark Lore, whose company Jet.com Wal-Mart bought last year as it hopes to answer Amazon's powerful Prime membership success. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average sank 107.04 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 19,864.09. The S&P 500 lost 2.03 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,278.87. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.07 points to 5,614.79. U.S. crude oil rose 18 cents to $52.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, added 47 cents to $55.70 a barrel in London. Natural gas fell 12 cents, or 3.6 per cent, to $3.12 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Glenn, the famed astronaut, died Dec. 8 at age 95. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) (John Minchillo) Print Email Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 01, 2017 at 3:30 PM, updated February 01, 2017 at 3:54 PM comments Former NASA administrator Charles Bolden Jr., who stepped down Jan. 20 after eight years at the helm of the space flight and aeronautics agency, said in an interview he's concerned President Trump's administration may hinder some of the agency's key scientific efforts, including collecting climate data.  Bolden also expressed concern about the future of NASA's international relations work under Trump. But he said he's excited about the space agency's programs, including missions to explore a near-Earth asteroid, send a rocket around the moon and put American astronauts into deep space.  Bolden, a retired Marine Corps major general and NASA's first African-American administrator, talked with The Times-Picayune about NASA's future as well as his work with Blue Star Families, a military family support organization that is working with New Orleans native Mary Matalin to host a local fundraiser. The event, originally set for Feb. 3., was postponed this week because of scheduling conflicts. It will be rescheduled for a date this summer. Bolden, who grew up in South Carolina, flew more than 100 combat missions in North and South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in the 1970s and later traveled to orbit four times as a NASA astronaut. Speaking Monday (Jan. 30), Bolden still used a colloquial "we" to reference the space agency he led under President Barack Obama's administration. Here is the interview with Bolden, edited for length. You're leaving NASA after eight years at the helm. What is your hope for the agency? That the agency will be allowed to continue on the course it's presently embarked upon in areas like aeronautics, where we're looking at building new experimental airplanes; science, where we're looking at extending our knowledge of the universe; and human space flight, where we're getting ready to introduce commercial crew capability to take American astronauts from American soil instead of being reliant on the Russians. Also, continuing to be very active in planning for the journey to Mars for humans. Those are things that are all well under way and many of them you'll actually see the initial fruits of our labor here in the next two years. NASA has yet to receive specific marching orders from the Trump administration, but you have voiced concerns. What is on your mind? I'm having a difficult time adjusting to the turmoil of the first week of the Trump administration. Coming out of NASA and being a former military commander we are very dependent on understanding what is going on in the environment and understanding the need for climate data before we can deploy Marines and sailors and airmen. Finding an administration that doesn't understand that and day-by-day seems to be curtailing the availability of valuable data to decision makers concerns me. Can you be more specific? We provide a lot of (climate and environmental) data through over-flights and satellite data. That's what I think is threatened if we're not careful with the policies of the new administration. Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans East has built NASA launch vehicles for decades, though with fewer workers. What is the future for Michoud and facilities like it? In keeping with everybody's efforts to try to right size, we are trying to do some consolidations. If you look at the way Michoud is now, it is almost like a city that has a lot of government and private activities going on under the same roof. It is a great example of the new model. Michoud is involved in building the Orion capsule and Space Launch System, which is set for its first manned flight in 2021. What does support look like for that program? We think SLS has sufficient support across the board in Congress -- Democrats, Republicans, everybody. So, the exploration program with SLS and Orion won't be bothered by the Trump administration. Those are the indications we're getting. SpaceX and Orbital ATX are flying robotic cargo missions to the International Space Station. How do you view the future of commercial space flight? If the past is any indication of the future, we've been very successful. We're a year or two away from SpaceX and Boeing flying the first crewed launches to the International Space Station aboard American vehicles. It's very important. Research still shows big gaps in women and minorities entering science, technology and engineering fields. How is NASA doing on diversity? The numbers, the raw numbers, are disappointing. We're still not doing well in terms of women and minorities in engineering fields, in STEM fields, in leadership positions. Where I am very happy is in the progress that we've made in inclusion, which means everybody feels that they get a say at the table. There's nobody who comes up with an idea who doesn't at least have their idea considered. That will not be helped at all by the Trump administration's hiring freeze. The poor numbers that we have today will remain poor. What advice do you have for minorities and women trying to crack into STEM fields? Don't try to explain why you're there. Do your best and people will recognize the fact that you belong, that you're not there because of a quota. What drew you to work with Blue Star Families? When a military service member is deployed, the family is left behind, sometimes at a military base, but more frequently nowadays in some urban environment where there may not be very many people around who can share their experiences in life. Blue Star families can reach out to them wherever they happen to be and bring them into social activities, bring social activities to them. I find that to be incredibly valuable. What NASA program are you most excited to watch? We have the potential to advance aeronautics research to the point where we return to the days of building experimental airplanes. We have five models that are on the drawing board. One is already in the works, an all-electric airplane called (X-57) Maxwell. We've also got what's called a low-boom, super sonic airplane that would be a human piloted prototype.

The deal represents a rare case of Tokyo talking down the price of military hardware from its U.S. ally and underscores progress for the Lockheed Martin Corp.-run F-35 program, which has faced criticism for cost overruns and other problems. U.S. President Donald Trump, who called the program as “out of control” in December, said on Monday he had been able to shave some $600 million from the latest U.S. deal to buy about 90 F-35s from Lockheed. But defense analysts and sources downplayed news of the cuts, saying the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed for months and would apply to other countries committed to the program. Lockheed and the Pentagon did not directly respond to questions regarding the Japanese deal. A representative for the U.S. Defense Department office that runs the F-35 program said negotiations over the current batch of fighters, known in the industry as the LRIP 10, were continuing. “For every nation that buys an F-35 in LRIP 10, the base price of the F-35 will be the lowest in F-35 history,” Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said. The price of the F-35 has been dropping with each new batch as Lockheed and the U.S. government ramp up production, helping to lower overall costs. Four sources told Reuters that Japan had further trimmed the price for its latest order, largely on ground support costs such as parts, logistics and technical assistance. “We went through each item in detail and negotiated with the U.S.,” said one of the sources in Japan with knowledge of talks. In a budget request last year, the Defense Ministry pegged the price of the six F-35s at ¥15.7 billion ($136.81 million) each. That had been cut to ¥14.6 billion when the budget was approved in December, in line with the 6 to 7 percent per plane reduction flagged by the Pentagon late last year. The cost of support equipment dropped significantly, to ¥30.9 billion from ¥42.3 billion, according to the publicly available documents. Cost cuts on such deals are typically done by removing some equipment or swapping out expensive components for cheaper ones. Officials from a new Japanese defense procurement agency and Pentagon personnel met several times in Tokyo between August and December before agreeing on the lower price, said one of the sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. The total cost for the Japanese deal was just over $1 billion, around 12 percent lower than budgeted in August. The cost to the United States for its latest F-35 contract is expected to be around $9 billion, with the price per plane falling below $100 million. Japan’s higher budgeted per aircraft costs of around $128 million include the engines and additional funds to have 38 of the 42 F-35s it plans to buy assembled in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Japan does not buy the fighters directly from Lockheed but from the U.S. government through its Foreign Military Sales system, which Washington uses to keep tight control on sensitive military equipment. The U.S. government typically charges a 3.8 percent sales fee for those transactions. Until now Japan has rarely questioned the price of equipment purchased from its U.S. ally, making it a lucrative market for the likes of Lockheed, Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Co. Japan is equipping its military with American equipment to help reinforce maritime holdings along the southern edge of the East China Sea where it is locked in a dispute over territory with Beijing. In addition to the F-35s, Japan is buying the Bell Boeing Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk drone. Japan’s splurge on U.S. equipment has put a strain on its finances. In 2016 procurement through the Foreign Military Sales system totaled ¥485.8 billion, compared with ¥117.9 billion three years earlier. Tokyo will begin deploying the first of its stealth fighters around the end of this year.

Trump is following through on his promise for the advisory group of 16 chief executives, which was created in December, representing a wide array of multinational entertainment, technology and financial firms, to begin meeting in February, The Wall Street Journal reported. ADVERTISEMENT Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman is heading up the strategic and policy forum that will provide policy advice to the Trump administration. The group includes Bob Iger, chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Co,; Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, BlackRock; Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores;  Jim McNerney, former chairman and CEO, Boeing; Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co; Ginni Rometty, chairman and CEO of IBM. Since taking office, Trump has held a series of meetings with leaders from the nation's automakers, small business owners, manufacturers and pharmaceutical firms. Trump has warned U.S. companies that move their businesses overseas may face punishment in the form of tariffs on the goods they ship here.  To deter offshoring, the president is vowing to dramatically reduce regulations and significantly lower taxes for American firms.

Allegiant posted a fourth-quarter 2016 net profit of $41.3 million, down 27.2% from $56.7 million in net income for 4Q 2015. Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $335.9 million, up 8% from 4Q 2015. Allegiant chairman and CEO Maurice Gallagher described 2016 as a transformational year. “We finalized a single fleet type plan, signed our first pilot contract agreement … and announced the appointment of John Redmond as president of Allegiant,” Gallagher said. “Each of these actions is critical in the evolution of our business model in the coming years.”  Allegiant plans to transition to an all-Airbus fleet by 2019. The airline ordered 12 A320ceos in July 2016. In a Jan. 31 conference call with analysts, Gallagher announced a new senior management tier for the company, executive vice president (EVP). Allegiant’s current senior vice presidents (SVPs) Jude Bricker, Scot Allard and Scott Sheldon were all elevated to the new EVP level. Four VPs were concurrently promoted to SVP status: Greg Anderson, to SVP and principal accounting officer; Lukas Johnson, to SVP planning; Trent Porter, to SVP financial planning; and Rob Wilson, to SVP systems. Gallagher described the new positions as “allow[ing] more pathways upwards for our ... managers.” Allegiant’s total 2016 operating revenue was $1.4 billion, up 8% from $1.3 billion in 2015. Operating expenses increased 11.4% year-over-year (YOY) to $992.3 million, reflecting a 27.1% rise in salaries and benefits, a 21.3% increase in station operation expenses and a 20% increase in maintenance and repairs costs, offset by 60.3% YOY drop in aircraft lease rental expenses ($924 million in 2016, compared to $2.3 billion in 2015). Allegiant’s operating income for the year was $370.6 million, down 0.3% from $371.8 million in 2015. Allegiant’s 2016 traffic grew 15% in 2016 to 10.3 billion RPMs on a 17.6% rise in capacity to 12.4 billion ASMs, producing a load factor of 83.1%, down 1.9 points from 2015. Allegiant’s fleet as of Dec. 31, 2016, totaled 84 aircraft, up four aircraft from 2015, comprising 47 MD-80s, 17 Airbus A319s, 16 A320s and four Boeing 757s. The airline intends to retire its 757 fleet in 2017; two 757s are planned for retirement by the end of the 2017 first quarter. Two A319s and one A320 are set to enter service during 1Q 2017. Allegiant Air, which historically specializes in flights from smaller US cities to US vacation destinations, said it has now been profitable for every quarter for 14 consecutive years. The airline increased its network 21.6% in 2016, operating 360 routes as of the end of the year, compared to 296 in 2015. During 4Q 2016, the airline started flying to Newark, New Jersey and San Juan, Puerto Rico and opened up Trenton, New Jersey as an origination city. In May and June this year, Allegiant plans to launch a combined 17 new routes from origination airports in Louisville, Kentucky and Destin/Fort Walton Beach, Florida.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor The Hangar Our Spaceflight Heritage: The legacy of STS-107 Lloyd Campbell February 1st, 2017 The STS-107 crew includes, from the left, Mission Specialist David Brown, Commander Rick Husband, Mission Specialists Laurel Clark, Kalpana Chawla, and Michael Anderson, Pilot William McCool, and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon. Photo Credit: NASA On Jan. 16, 2003, when the Space Shuttle Columbia (flight STS-107) lifted off from Launch Complex 39A, her crew was finally embarking on the mission they had waited five years to launch. Originally slated to fly in May of 2000, changes in flight priorities for supply and assembly of the Space Station, along with a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission also flown aboard Columbia, had shuffled the mission’s target date numerous times. They had spent 16 days in space performing over 100 science experiments in the SpaceHab module in Columbia’s payload bay. Most of their findings were sent back to Houston. The Crew Launch of the Space Shuttle Columbia on flight STS-107. Photo Credit: NASA As is well known, their doomed flight ended over Texas when Columbia broke up during re-entry on February 1, 2003. The crew had consisted of the following: Rick Husband, mission commander, on his second spaceflight after being the pilot on STS-96. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force prior to joining NASA. He loved to ski both on water and on snow. Pilot William “Willie” McCool, also a Commander in the U.S. Navy, was making his first spaceflight. Willie enjoyed many outdoor activities and a good game of chess. Mission specialist 1 David Brown, a U.S. Navy Captain having served as a flight surgeon prior to flying the A-6E Intruder. This was his first spaceflight. Mission specialist 2 Kalpana Chawla was on her second spaceflight, both aboard Columbia. When not busy at NASA, she enjoyed flying gliders and single and multi-engine land and water aircraft. Mission specialist 3 Michael Anderson, a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force, was making his second spaceflight having flown on the eighth Shuttle–Mir Program docking mission, STS-89. Another chess player, he also enjoyed playing tennis. Mission specialist 4 Laurel Clark, another spaceflight rookie, was a medical doctor by trade and an adrenalin junkie in her spare time enjoying scuba diving, hiking, camping, biking, and parachuting. Payload specialist Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli astronaut, was a Colonel in the Israeli Air Force. Like his commander, he loved to snow ski. They all loved being astronauts and worked very hard in order to get their chance to fly in space. All of the crew were humbled to be part of such a select group of people who went on to fly in space. Perhaps David Brown summed it up best in a preflight interview for STS-107: But I absolutely couldn’t identify with the people who were astronauts. I thought they were movie stars. And I just thought I was kind of a normal kid. And so I couldn’t see a path how a normal kid could ever get to be one of these people that I just couldn’t identify with. And so, while I would’ve said, “Hey, this is like the coolest thing you could possibly do,” it really wasn’t something that I ever thought that I would end up doing. NASA’s policies and attitudes Like the Apollo 1 and Challenger tragedies before them, investigations once again revealed deficiencies in NASA’s policies and attitudes that if they had been resolved prior to the accidents, might have prevented them. The shuttle was once again grounded while changes were implemented both in procedures and in equipment. The Space Shuttle Program was also given an “end of life” timeline in such that it would fly to finish the assembly of the International Space Station (ISS) before being retired. As a result, NASA began working with private space companies, such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Orbital ATK, to provide cargo and eventually crew rotation flights to the ISS. Today, despite launch failures, cargo flights to the ISS are becoming more routine and crewed commercial flights are slated to begin in 2018. In the interim, NASA astronauts have been traveling to the ISS via the Russian Soyuz capsule. The seats have increased steadily in price, most recently costing NASA over $60 million for a seat. NASA also began looking to travel out of low-Earth orbit for the first time since 1972 when Apollo 17 flew the last manned mission to the Moon. Today they are getting closer to that goal with the continued development of a new heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), and a new deep space capsule, dubbed Orion, which flew its first unmanned test flight in December 2014. The first flight of the SLS, currently slated for late 2018, will be an unmanned flight taking the Orion capsule on a trip to the Moon and back.   Tagged: NASA Space Shuttle Columbia STS-107 The Range Lloyd Campbell Lloyd Campbell’s first interest in space began when he was a very young boy in the 1960s with NASA’s Gemini and Apollo programs. That passion continued in the early 1970s with our continued exploration of our Moon, and was renewed by the Shuttle Program. Having attended the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery on its final two missions, STS-131, and STS-133, he began to do more social networking on space and that developed into writing more in-depth articles. Since then he’s attended the launch of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover, the agency’s new crew-rated Orion spacecraft on Exploration Flight Test 1, and multiple other uncrewed launches. In addition to writing, Lloyd has also been doing more photography of launches and aviation. He enjoys all aspects of space exploration, both human, and robotic, but his primary passions lie with human exploration and the vehicles, rockets, and other technologies that allow humanity to explore space. Related Reading Reader Comments Brian Winkler February 1, 2017 4:14 pm As a 22 year veteran of the space shuttle program your story has brought back a lot of memories. I was a crew compartment tech on OV99 before its first flight. Later i was working the RTLS (return to launch site ) convoy on that cold January morning in 1986 and witnessed the death of crew and shuttle. Everyone around me was crying in disbelief at what had happened. When we returned to flight once again I was working the RTLS convoy and of course every one was holding their breath the radio call came that SRB separation had taken place and we were on the road back to space. My job at KSC was shuttle recovery where ever it landed and I was in that for the remainder of my career. Fast forward to when they announced the flight of OV102 on STS107. Columbia was the grandma of the shuttle fleet and was to heavy to do the things the newer vehicles could so i was really surprised they send her out again. The mission was just a mishmash of experiments that hadn’t been accomplished on other flights. For some reason that I can’t explain this announcement caused a dread in me. She didn’t need to make this mission but there was no way to express my dread because at NASA the culture is SHOW ME THE DATA. I had declined to go to Edwards AFB for contingency landing support so once again I was at KSC for landing convoy support. After so many years of landing operations you know all the radio calls coming into the covey personnel , where the orbiter is on descent, when to expect the it to cross the runway with its welcoming twin sonic booms. After what seen\med forever I knew she wasn’t coming home. Then the dreaded call to bring all our paperwork to the convoy command vehicle and it was over.. The dread I had felt all those months leading up to launch were now reality. Hail Columbia. Reply Annie February 1, 2017 5:21 pm This article brings back bad memories. It is my guess that NASA knew they probably would not come back when they saw how many tiles had fallen. Rest in peace STS 107. I was up early that morning watching the television in absolute horror. The people in the Southwest saw the shuttle break up. Although they are all test pilots you make a good point that the mission wasn’t absolutely necessary; we didn’t know that. Reply Mike Leinbach February 2, 2017 10:22 am An often overlooked legacy of the loss of Columbia and her 7 astronauts is the on-going research conducted on hundreds of pieces of debris from the Orbiter. Completely different from the reaction to the Challenger loss, which saw the wreckage buried in an abandoned missile silo never to be seen again, NASA has a program to lend Columbia debris to academic and other research institutions to study the effects of hypersonic entry on materials and structures. The program’s principle goal is aimed at designing and building better and safer spacecraft as we go forward in space exploration. It was begun in the months following the accident as a way for Columbia to continue its research mission long after her loss. Reply Spencer Boaz February 2, 2017 11:37 am It was a day I’ll never forget . We had dozens of pieces land on our property . The rumble woke me up , my wife was outside looking up we could see it breaking up . We thought it was a plane then a friend called and said it was the Columbia . The recovery lasted for weeks . Our prayers go out to their family’s . Reply ⚠ Commenting Rules Post Comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Companies whose CEO's are expected to attend the meeting of the president's business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co, General Motors Co, Blackstone Group LP , IBM Corp, Uber Technologies Inc and Walt Disney Co, two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Trump's executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and putting a three-month ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has prompted protests and legal challenges in the United States, and has drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that "the ban will impact many innocent people — an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump’s first business advisory group meeting." It was not clear if all 19 members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday's meeting. Other members include the chief executives of Tesla Motors Inc , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Boeing Co. Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure.. GM has declined to take a position. Trump ordered the restrictions on Jan. 27, saying they were aimed at protecting Americans from the threat of terrorist attacks. The business forum is chaired by Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of Blackstone. Trump is a wealthy New York real estate developer and his transition team announced the group in December, saying "some of America’s most highly respected and successful business leaders, will be called upon to meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda." The White House did not immediately comment Wednesday on the meeting. Trump has held numerous meeting with chief executives since taking office on Jan. 20, including leaders of major automakers, manufacturers, aerospace and pharmaceutical companies. Among the companies that have been most critical of the immigration orders are Netflix Inc, Apple Inc, and Amazon.com Inc, but none of these are represented in the business forum. Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal the company is considering a legal challenge to the immigration order.

News Business Business News US Federal Reserve signals more rate rises still set to follow in 2017 as 'Trumpflation' looms The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC), as widely predicted, voted unanimously to leave its federal funds target at 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent Ben Chu Economics Editor @Benchu_ Wednesday 1 February 2017 23:49 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen Getty The American central bank kept its policy interest rate on hold on Wednesday in its first meeting since Donald Trump took office as US President. But the Federal Reserve also signalled that rates are still likely to increase in 2017 along the previous timetable outlined in December, when it raised rates by 0.25 per cent in response to the prospect of inflationary pressures. The Fed's Open Market Committee (FOMC), as widely predicted by markets and analysts, voted unanimously to leave its federal funds target at 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent. Read more US Federal Reserve raises interest rates Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warns against Brexit Federal Reserve hikes interest rates for first time in seven years Markets are currently pricing in the next rate rise to come from the Fed in June, with two further rises to follow by the end of the year. In its relatively upbeat statement, following its regular two-day meeting, the FOMC said that "measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late". "The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate... however, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data," it added. US stock markets have taken off and the dollar has strengthened in the wake of Trump's November Presidential election victory in anticipation of major tax cuts and infrastructure spending by his administration, which is seen as pushing up US consumer price inflation. The prospect of  "Trumpflation" raises the prospect that the Fed could be forced to raise rates more rapidly than previously planned. Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The Retail Industry Leaders Association and more than 120 other trade groups are backing the campaign, called “Americans for Affordable Products,” which will center on how a border-adjusted tax could increase prices for consumers. Part of the message: that export-focused companies may get their federal taxes drastically cut, maybe even to zero. Behind the scenes, the campaign will rely in part on lobbying by industry executives. The fight is drawing battle lines across corporate America, with net importers on one side and exporters on the other. And there are billions of dollars at stake: The proposed overhaul of the corporate tax code, supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan, would reward companies that sell products outside the U.S. while punishing ones that rely on low-cost overseas suppliers. The idea is to put a levy on U.S. businesses’ domestic sales and imported goods, while exempting exports from their taxable income. “This corporate tax reform is supposed to help all companies, but this particular provision would make it much more regressive on industries like retail, oil and gas, and apparel,” said Caitlin Webber, a trade analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s going to be an absolutely huge fight.” T-Shirt Tax? Supporters say the 20 percent border-adjusted tax would encourage domestic production. But opponents complain that it would just force companies to pass the increases to consumers -- potentially boosting prices for everything from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts -- without spurring a revival of domestic manufacturing. “You’re a consumer: Are you ready to pay 20 to 25 percent more for everything you buy?” said Steve Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. “Because almost everything you buy is imported.” The message to consumers: If you’re used to paying $10 for a T-shirt, it’s going to be $12 or $13. Those $80 pair of sneakers? They’re suddenly going to be closer to $100. Since the proposed tax change is coming from the House of Representatives, garnering support from the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House will be key. President Donald Trump is warming to the idea after previously criticizing it, a senior administration official told Bloomberg News last week. The border-adjusted tax is key to the Republicans’ proposal because it would help pay for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate. Mainstream Impact Opponents say their goal is making the issue more mainstream by showing the effect on U.S. households. The thinking is that House Republicans have underestimated how this idea could resonate with the American public. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Retailers are already on edge after the Trump administration floated the idea of a 20 percent temporary tariff on Mexican imports to pay for a wall on the southern border. The potential changes also come at a time when apparel chains and other brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling: About 5,000 stores have been shuttered in the past 18 months, according to Clarion Partners. Department stores such as Sears Holdings Corp. and Macy’s Inc. have been particularly hard-hit by consumers shifting their spending online. The industry won a major victory in 2011 when it pushed through the passage of financial reform that cut the fees that retailers pay when a shopper uses a debit card. In that “swipe-fee” standoff, the companies defeated some of the world’s financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and payment networks such as Visa Inc. Talk of Town Now retailers are taking on giants like General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Dow Chemical Co. in a showdown that may dwarf the swipe-fee feud. The issue has galvanized much of the industry. At last month’s National Retail Federation convention in New York, the border-adjusted tax dominated conversations. Andrew Burns, a retail analyst at DA Davidson & Co., said 90 percent of the companies he covers are focused on tax reform and trade right now. The big debate is whether the tax proposals are “rhetoric” or a real threat, he said. Last week, lobbyists for retail, car dealers, apparel and footwear companies had a briefing for congressional staffers, and about 130 showed up -- squeezing into a room that would normally fit 75 people. This battle could cause a schism among Republicans. A handful of them in the Senate, which the party controls 52-48, have already raised doubts, including Georgia Republican David Perdue and Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, who said in an editorial in the Federalist magazine that it “could ravage huge swaths of our economy.” Democrats on the Senate finance committee have already hammered the proposal, saying in a December memo that it was “risky, untested and especially vulnerable to unforeseen consequences” like causing consumer prices to skyrocket. “People don’t want to pay more at the grocery store or the gas station,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Webber said. “If they are able to make that case effectively, they could be successful.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Reuters On 2/1/17 at 10:09 AM Close Amazon Given Go-Ahead To Test Drone Delivery In UK Amazon plans to invest $1.49 billion to build a large air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, state officials said on Tuesday, stoking expectations it may one day opt to directly compete with FedEx and United Parcel Service. The world's biggest online retailer has agreed to a 50-year lease for about 900 acres of property from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport—close in size to the global hubs of top cargo airlines. Win an iPhone 7 Sign up to our daily newsletter for your chance to win. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> Amazon is handling more shipping in-house so it can deliver packages to customers faster, as well as cut costs and uncertainty associated with relying on third parties. It has said its moves are designed to supplement, not replace cargo carriers. Analysts suspect it has larger ambitions. "We estimate a $400 billion-plus market opportunity for Amazon in delivery, freight forwarding, and contract logistics," Colin Sebastian, an analyst for Baird Equity Research, said in a note to clients. Amazon, which has not announced a start date for the hub, said it expects to create more than 2,000 jobs when the site opens. The northern Kentucky location—not far from UPS's major hub—puts Amazon's aircraft in shooting distance of top cities. The company said last year it would lease 40 Boeing Co 767 planes, 16 of which are currently in service. It also lets Amazon's trucks reach 11 fulfillment centers in state. And a large operation of Deutsche Post DHL there lets Amazon transfer packages easily abroad, said Brian Clancy, managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital & Strategy. As part of the investment, Amazon anticipates it will spend nearly $462 million on building and improvements over an unspecified number of years, according to a report by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. The authority's board tentatively approved $40 million in tax incentives for Amazon over ten years if it meets hiring commitments, with average wages including benefits targeted at $26 per hour, the report said. So far, Amazon has loaded its aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the United States. This has helped it dodge fees from cargo partners, which are increasingly pricing by volume rather than weight. Amazon's new site compares with about 1,220 acres UPS has in Louisville. FedEx has more than 900 in its Memphis hub, a 2010 airport plan showed.

REUTERS/Regis DuvignauMore By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - After top-level restructuring at Airbus come the musical chairs and a new logo intended to convey unity as the European giant aims to refocus its management without a return to past infighting. In a symbolic move, the man in charge of making Airbus jets has reluctantly agreed to leave his office by the vast factories in Toulouse and move to a new corporate headquarters in the same southern French city, people familiar with the matter said. At first sight, it might seem an obvious move following the restructuring in which the planemaking division became the mainstay of the overall structure of a company that also manufactures space rockets, helicopters and military jets. But close watchers of the predominantly Franco-German firm, still bruised by decades of infighting, fear the decision to put planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier in the new HQ alongside his boss Tom Enders could test a fragile internal power balance. For Bregier, it may only be a move of about a kilometer on the ground, but it shifts him ever so slightly away from the company's economic nerve center that drives its share price, revenue and profits. And it comes at a critical time for the world's second largest planemaker as it strives to boost output. "(Bregier) isn't happy, but he is going to make it work," said one person close to the company, who asked not to be named. Airbus agreed last year to merge its jetliner division with its parent group to reflect the stronger bias toward civil manufacturing that started in 2013, after the failure of a planned merger with British defense firm BAE Systems . After the latest internal restructuring, Bregier gave up his title as chief executive of the Airbus commercial airliner business, but remained its president while also becoming chief operating officer and number two for the group as a whole. "Airbus is now an aircraft manufacturing company with two other divisions, so after the merger the focus on the core business is much tighter," an Airbus spokesman said. Enders, 58, is now drawing core people and functions around him at the new HQ to secure his vision of forging the integrated company he believes is necessary to remain on a par with arch-rival Boeing and fend off new competition. He has pledged to make Airbus a "normal company" after French and German political interference was curbed in 2014 by a change in its corporate governance following the failure of the BAE deal. CRITICAL TASK But plucking Bregier from a domain in which he is undisputed leader - having overseen record plane output and an improved industrial performance - and accentuating his other role as deputy to Enders is seen by some as a potential loss of focus. Airbus is confronted with the critical task of raising its jet output fast to fill thousands of orders on its books, and investors are especially sensitive to any risk its top managers become distracted by internal politics. "What is unusual is to have restructuring happening at a time when production is increasing sharply," one European aerospace analyst said. At the same time, a raft of top managers in the planemaking business involved in operations, sales, programs and engineering are nearing retirement age. Publicly, Airbus managers have closed ranks behind the CEO's plans. Many recall the industrial chaos and tensions between French and German government shareholders - and their proxies within the company - that hammered Airbus shares a decade ago. Enders, who is German, and Bregier, a 55-year-old Frenchman, have occasionally appeared uneasy partners. Both are major industry figures in their own right and aspire to the top job. But they also demonstrated a pragmatic ability to work together in 2007-12 at what was then the jet division of EADS, later renamed Airbus Group, again with Enders in the lead role. The latest overhaul cements Bregier's position as heir apparent as he is now operational chief of the whole group but it also means he may have to wait longer for the top job. Both men have pledged to make jet production their top priority and company insiders say Bregier had initially suggested he would keep a physical presence in each camp to ensure this. But his office move is just the latest example of a steady shift of key oversight functions toward the center, consolidating the power of Enders and prompting reports of fresh tension in one of the industry's key personal relationships. The Airbus spokesman dismissed such concerns. "They worked together well when both at Airbus and both their roles have significantly increased, so there is no overlap." The insistence on unity does not end there. Airbus has quietly axed separate brands for its divisions, including the ball-shaped Airbus logo used on its first flight in 1972. Brand experts say the design was worth less than the name, but the loss of a historic symbol underscores the jetmaker's reduced independence within the corporate structure. Witnesses say workers have put up a new "AIRBUS" sign - with the ball removed - above the commercial offices. The helicopter and defense divisions are now expected to undergo similar surgery.

SpaceX has asked to rent more space at the Port. (Chuck Bennett/The Daily Breeze via AP) By Sandy Mazza, Southern California News Group | PUBLISHED: February 1, 2017 at 7:54 am | UPDATED: February 1, 2017 at 11:38 am Hawthorne-based SpaceX, which is working through a backlog of rocket launches, wants to double the space it leases at the Port of Los Angeles to park and handle recovered space equipment. The Board of Harbor Commissioners will vote at its Thursday morning meeting on a deal to enlarge Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s footprint at San Pedro’s outer harbor. The company hopes to lease 4.6 acres of land and water area along Berths 51 to 53 for $23,735 a month, plus insurance and any incidental costs. In addition to extra space, the lease agreement allows the company to have berthing rights, install a chain-link fence around the property, build a concrete rocket-support pedestal, and add an office trailer, guard shack and portable restrooms, according to a staff report prepared for the commission. This aerial view shows the area (marked in yellow) that SpaceX will rent from the Port of Los Angeles to dock and unload its reusable Falcon 9 rockets when they land at sea, if the Harbor Commission approves deal Thursday. (Courtesy Port of LA)  The cutting-edge Hawthorne rocket maker, founded by billionaire CEO Elon Musk, is the first private company to ever return spacecraft from missions intact. It’s working to rapidly reduce the cost of getting into orbit by building reusable equipment. Already, its launch costs are several times cheaper than those of legacy aerospace companies that held a monopoly on government contracts until SpaceX snagged its first NASA deal in 2014. ORIGINAL LEASE FOR 2 ACRES Last year, SpaceX entered into its first contract to park equipment at the port in San Pedro. It leased about 2 acres to store the specially made barge it uses to recover launched rockets at sea. That vessel, which the company calls an “autonomous spaceport drone ship” named Just Read the Instructions, received the Falcon 9 rocket booster that delivered 10 communications satellites to orbit on Jan. 14 from Vandenberg Air Force Base. This was the seventh successful booster recovery for the company. The 16-story-tall booster was then towed on its barge to the San Pedro parking space on Jan. 17, where it remained until Jan. 26 near Miner and 22nd streets, drawing daily crowds of gawkers. If the Harbor Commission approves the company’s lease expansion, it will provide enough space and access to comfortably park and offload the massive equipment on a regular basis. SpaceX plans at least six launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base through 2018 that will require at-sea landings, which means San Pedro will be getting an eyeful of the company’s rockets. LAUNCHES PLANNED EVERY 2 WEEKS Though SpaceX’s launch manifest is not publicly available, company officials said they intend to launch every two weeks from bases in Florida and California. The company’s next two launches are set to take place at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Most of its launches have been from Cape Canaveral, but a Sept. 1 rocket explosion destroyed the equipment and its launchpad. The port parking spot actually is on the campus of AltaSea marine research facility. Boeing Co. is also working in partnership with AltaSea to lease space in the outer harbor that may be used for its unmanned submarine Echo Voyager. Additionally, marine archeologist Robert Ballard, the scientist who discovered the sunken Titanic in 1985, parks his deep-sea exploration research vessel Nautilus along the AltaSea property. PIONEERING EXPLORATION Los Angeles Councilman Joe Buscaino heralded the SpaceX expansion as the latest step in the region’s increasing transformation to being on the cutting edge of pioneering exploration. “Along with Boeing, Catalina Sea Ranch and the Exploration Vehicle Nautilus, AltaSea and the Port of LA are the home of space exploration and underwater exploration,” Buscaino said in a written statement. “My hope is that Elon Musk continues to see AltaSea and the Port of Los Angeles as an asset to his operations and continues to grow his company’s presence in San Pedro.” Tags:  Elon Musk Space SpaceX Sandy Mazza, Southern California News Group Subscribe Today!

The deal represents a rare case of Tokyo negotiating down the price of military hardware from its U.S. ally and underscores progress for the Lockheed Martin Corp-run F-35 program, which has faced criticisms over cost overruns and other problems. U.S. President Donald Trump, who lashed the program as "out of control" in December, said on Monday he had been able to shave some $600 million from the latest U.S. deal to buy about 90 F-35s from Lockheed. But defense analysts and sources downplayed news of those cuts, saying the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed for months and would apply to other countries committed to the program. Lockheed and the Pentagon did not directly respond to questions regarding the Japanese deal. A spokesperson for the US Defense Department office which runs the F-35 program said negotiations over the current batch of fighters, known in the industry as LRIP 10, was continuing. "For every nation that buys an F-35 in LRIP 10, the base price of the F-35 will be the lowest in F-35 history," Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said. The price of the F-35 has been dropping with each new batch as Lockheed and the U.S. government ramp up production, helping to lower overall costs. Four sources told Reuters Japan had further trimmed the price for its latest order, largely on ground support costs such as parts, logistics and technical assistance. "We went through each item in detail and negotiated with the U.S.," said one of the sources in Japan with knowledge of talks. COSTS DOWN In a budget request last year, Japan's Ministry of Defence pegged the price of the six F-35s at 15.7 billion yen ($136.81 million) each. That had been cut to 14.6 billion yen when the budget was approved in December, in line with the 6-7 percent per plane reduction flagged by the Pentagon late last year. The cost of support equipment dropped significantly, to 30.9 billion yen from 42.3 billion yen, according to the publicly available documents. Cost cuts on such deals are typically done by removing some equipment or swapping out expensive components for cheaper ones. Officials from a new Japanese defense procurement agency and Pentagon personnel met several times in Tokyo between August and December before agreeing on the lower price, said one of the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. LUCRATIVE MARKET The total cost for the Japanese deal was just over $1 billion, around 12 percent lower than budgeted in August. The cost to the United States for its latest F-35 contract is expected to be around $9 billion, with the price per plane falling below $100 million. Japan's higher budgeted per aircraft costs of around $128 million include the aircrafts' engines and additional funds to have 38 of the 42 F-35s it plans to buy assembled in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Japan does not buy the fighters directly from Lockheed but from the U.S. government through its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, which Washington uses to keep tight control on sensitive military equipment. The U.S. government typically charges a 3.8 percent sales fee for those transactions. Until now Japan has rarely questioned the price of equipment purchased from its U.S. ally, making it a lucrative market for the likes of Lockheed, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Co. Japan is equipping its military with American kit to help reinforce maritime holdings along the southern edge of the East China Sea where it is locked in a dispute over territory with Beijing. In addition to the F-35s, Japan is buying the Bell Boeing Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk drone. Japan's splurge on U.S. equipment has put a strain on its finances. In 2016 procurement through the Foreign Military Sales system totaled 485.8 billion yen compared with 117.9 billion yen three years earlier. Tokyo will begin deploying the first of its stealth fighters around the end of this year. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Economy U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes Office The ISM manufacturing index rose to its best level since November 2014 last month while private hiring stepped up. But GM and Ford reported weaker U.S. sales. (© Rainer Plendl/stock.adobe.com) ED CARSON 2/01/2017 Reprints U.S. manufacturing growth accelerated to a fresh two-year high in January while private-sector hiring was robust as Donald Trump entered the White House, pledging an "America First" policy of promoting U.S. jobs, especially in manufacturing. But General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) reported a slight decline in domestic auto sales. The Institute for Supply Management Index rose 1.3 points last month to 56, the fastest pace since November 2014. Economists had expected a reading of 55. Readings over 50 signal growth. Separately, U.S. companies added 246,000 jobs in January, much stronger than the 168,000 that Wall Street expected and up from 151,000 in December. The ADP jobs data has an uneven track record of forecasting the Labor Department's employment report, with the January nonfarm payrolls due on Friday. Manufacturers added 15,000 jobs as the goods-producing sector overall boosted payrolls by 46,000. Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major averages to record highs, but manufacturer Meanwhile, Ford's January U.S. sales fell 0.6% vs. a year earlier, though that was slightly better than expected. But General Motors' January U.S. sales fell 3.9% vs. a year earlier, defying forecasts for a 1.2% gain. General Motors raised its 2017 guidance last month after reporting a robust 10% U.S. sales gain for December. That bullish news helped send GM shares to a 22-month high recently. Ford shares dipped 0.3% toclose at 12.32 on the stock market today. GM stock fell 1.3% to finish at 36.14, trying to find support at its 50-day moving average. President Trump has criticized GM, Ford and other automakers for Mexico factories and exports, urging them to set up more facilities in the U.S. But with U.S. demand plateauing at record levels, Ford says no more domestic plants are needed. One U.S. automaker that is rapidly expanding is Tesla (TSLA), which announced Wednesday it is changing its name to Tesla Inc. from Tesla Motors. Tesla has plans to ramp up from delivering 76,320 vehicles last year to making 500,000 in 2018. It's expanding its Fremont, Calif.-based plant and continuing to expand its just-operational battery Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada. Tesla shares have formed a cup-with-handle base that goes back nearly nine months, with a buy point of 258.57. Tesla shares fell 1.1% to 249.24 at the close. Meanwhile, aerospace giant Boeing (BA) reported stronger-than-expected profit last week, with the 787 Dreamliner finally cash flow positive. Despite somewhat cautious guidance, Boeing stock, part of the Dow industrials broke out of a base to hit all-time highs. Boeing advanced 0.3% to close at 163.97. On the flip side, fellow Dow stock General Electric (GE) has fallen in 2017, especially after GE reported mixed Q4 profit results. GE gave back a penny to 29.69 Wednesday after falling Tuesday to its worst levels in nearly three months.

Klaus Kleinfeld Copyright Alex Wong, Getty Images Advertisement Elliott Management Corp. called for the ouster of Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive officer of Arconic Inc., setting the stage for a battle over control of the aluminum-parts maker that split from Alcoa Corp. last year. The company should consider replacing Kleinfeld with Larry Lawson, former CEO of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., whom Elliott has hired as a consultant, the New York-based hedge fund said in a presentation Tuesday. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also announced five nominees to Arconic’s board. Elliott’s concerns about Kleinfeld have been brewing since at least last year. Days after Arconic shares began trading as a separate company on Nov. 1, Elliott said it had increased its stake and planned to discuss with the new company how to improve performance. The hedge fund is Arconic’s largest stockholder with 10.5% of shares outstanding and already has three representatives on the board, carryovers from Alcoa. A successful proxy fight could give it a majority.

Arconic said its board, which consists of Kleinfeld and 12 directors, “unanimously supports” management. “The board has conducted an intensive and extensive review of Elliott’s allegations and has concluded that many of them are misleading or not substantiated,” the company said in a statement. Kleinfeld Strategy The corporate split marked the culmination of a strategy pursued by Kleinfeld, 59, who took the reins at Alcoa in 2008 before engineering the carve-out of Arconic. The former Siemens CEO relentlessly emphasized Alcoa’s focus on value-added aluminum products while cutting costs at a commodity-aluminum business that was once the world’s largest by volume. Lawson, 58, a veteran of Lockheed Martin Corp., has a reputation as a tough manager who gets results. He led Lockheed’s F-35 fighter program and ran its aeronautics division before joining Spirit AeroSystems as CEO in 2013. Lawson caught analysts off guard in June with an announcement he would retire from Spirit the following month after turning around the aerospace supplier. Under his watch, net income more than tripled as the company expanded its relationship with Airbus Group SE and shed an unprofitable wing production business. Lawson Record But several key executives also departed in Lawson’s last months amid an impasse on a contract agreement with Boeing Co. and a “seriously fractured” relationship with the planemaker, Carter Copeland, an aerospace analyst with Barclays Capital Inc., wrote in a June 9 report. Shareholders admired the CEO for his results “but we get the sense that the employee base doesn’t love Larry Lawson as much,” Copeland wrote. Elliott’s nominees to the Arconic board, all former CEOs of the companies listed, are Christopher Ayers of WireCo WorldGroup Inc.; Elmer L. Doty of Accudyne Industries; Charles M. Hall of AM General; Bernd F. Kessler of SRTechnics AG; and Patrice E. Merrin of Luscar Ltd. Along with Lawson, Ayers and Doty have deep experience dealing with Boeing, the world’s largest planemaker and Arconic’s largest customer, according to a Bloomberg supply-chain analysis. Elliott Activism Elliott has been one of the busiest activist investors under its head of U.S. equity activism, Jesse Cohn. Already this year, Elliott disclosed new positions in power producer NRG Energy Inc. together with Bluescape Energy Partners, and in health-care services and software group Advisory Board Co. Elliott also welcomed oil refiner target Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s announcement it would accelerate a sale of assets to its master limited partnership and consider a spinoff of its gasoline and convenience stores. While most of Elliott’s investments aren’t active -- where it amasses shares and seeks to convince executives and directors to make changes to boost shareholder returns -- it’s those campaigns that often attract the most attention. Elliott recently also went active at South Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics Co.

Our nation’s political debate has become so polarized, it was only a matter of time before your stocks got dragged into the mess. It didn’t take long for CEOs at over a dozen U.S. companies to weigh in against President Donald Trump’s travel restrictions. Let’s not get into the merits of Trump’s policy, aside from the horrendously sloppy execution that was troubling from a guy who ran on his supposed management prowess. Whatever the merits, or lack thereof, the potential downside for you as an investor in the storm that ensued was apparent pretty fast. Trump supporters, for example, immediately promised to unleash a boycott against Starbucks (SBUX) even though the coffee chain’s pushback against the president was fairly innocuous. Essentially, Starbucks said: “We’ll hire more refugees.” Other consumer-facing companies that openly took on Trump, like Ford (F) Amazon.com (AMZN) Twitter (TWTR) Apple (AAPL) Netflix (NFLX) and Microsoft (MSFT) could face similar challenges. Since Trump is unlikely to stop being controversial, and CEOs with big egos are unlikely to stop pushing back when they see fit, now is a good time to ask the following: Is it OK for companies to be messing with your portfolio like this? After all, you’re supposedly the boss as a shareholder, and boards and CEOs are supposedly working for you. The short answer is “yes,” according to several corporate-governance and business experts. Let’s look at their logic first. Then we’ll get into some of the risks to your stocks that experts may be overlooking, just as they may have overlooked Trump’s prospects for victory during the election. Enlightened self-interest One of the most telling Trump pushbacks came from Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to Columbia Law School professor and corporate-governance expert John Coffee. Blankfein left a voicemail to employees saying the policy is bad for the company, and rightly so. “A lot of the companies that have been outspoken get a very large percentage of their revenue internationally. And this looks like an attack on internationalism, which could hurt them,” says Coffee. To his point, a big part of Starbucks’ response was to note that it has opened nearly 600 stores in Mexico since 2002, and that it has bought coffee beans there for three decades. The bottom line: Starbucks wants to build bridges on the border, not walls, said CEO and founder Howard Schultz, in a statement. CEOs have an enlightened self-interest at home, too. “Companies have to be careful with what they do, but they are also members of society and they are affected by the broader society in which they operate,” says Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, which promotes greater transparency in corporate political campaign donations. That includes “the type of market they have and even basic things like the spending power of consumers,” he says. As examples, he cites corporate support for racial integration in the U.S., and opposition to apartheid in South Africa, even if this may have alienated some customers at the time. “There are issues where companies do have a broader responsibility as a member of society. So they have to take a stand, even at a cost to shareholders,” says Freed. Standing by core values It’s also important to remember that just like people, companies can have “core values” they have to stand by, points out Columbia Business School professor William Klepper. CEOs have an obligation to “speak up if an executive order is contrary to their stated values,” he says. One reason is that these “core values” can be part of why customers buy from them. Starbucks’ stated mission is to “inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” So it makes sense that the company would want to support refugees by hiring them, one at a time. Apple has always been outspoken and iconoclastic, and that’s part of what draws consumers to its product. “That is their style. They aren’t to going to hide what their position is,” says Coffee. Next, a lot of large companies are “culturally progressive” because it appeals to their diverse work force, says Eric Dezenhall, CEO of Dezenhall Resources in Washington, D.C., a crisis-management consultancy. “I am not at all surprised that corporate leaders have pushed back on the travel issue because the benefits of appeasing their work force, including not getting sued, outweigh their fears of ticking off POTUS over a policy that has been wildly unpopular in the dominant media culture,” says Dezenhall. As a practical matter, tech companies hire a lot of foreign nationals, so they’re going to naturally resist travel restrictions because that’s in their interest. Boycotts don’t work Then there’s the little matter of the ineffectiveness of boycotts. “It is easy to make pronouncements that you are not going to drink Starbucks coffee and organize a boycott. But it never seems to work,” says Howard Anderson, who has taught at Harvard Business School and MIT’s Tuck School of Business. “I don’t think it makes too much difference. Every airline I have flown on I have sworn I would never fly on again, and guess what. I am still flying.” Motley Fool Inside Value editor Rich Greifner, who follows Starbucks closely as an investor, agrees that boycotts won’t have “a meaningful impact on Starbucks’ long-term ability to generate free cash flow” or its intrinsic value. But is it different this time? All of these points make a lot of sense, of course. But it’s hard not to notice we have moved into a new era politically. And so companies, and you as a shareholder, may face greater risks with their political activism. Just as almost everyone discounted Trump’s potential during the elections, analysts may now overly discount the power of Trump supporters to do real damage to companies via boycotts. There are, after all, a lot of Trump supporters out there, and they are passionate. Besides, boycotts can work. According to consumer surveys, the Chick-fil-A brand took a hit after activists openly challenged the opposition to same-sex marriage espoused by the restaurant’s president, Dan Cathy, points out Ira Kalb, assistant professor of clinical marketing at USC Marshall School of Business. The lesson? In general, companies should avoid getting “embroiled in political issues” if their customers are likely to be split on the topic, he says. Tweetstorms Then, of course, there’s the risk of retaliation from Trump himself. He’s got a track record of being vindictive against perceived antagonists, like the CNN reporter who was openly denied the opportunity to ask a question at a press conference. And Trump’s twitter account can move stocks. He’s shaved tens of billions of dollars off the biotech sector with a single tweet on drug pricing. Other tweets have sparked temporary setbacks in the shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) There’s also the possibility that Trump could roll out government spending or policy decisions fine-tuned to target companies — as he’s threatened to do with Ford over plant locations, and Lockheed and Boeing over the amounts these companies charge the government for aircraft. “Never in my career have I seen a president strike such terror into the hearts of senior corporate leadership,” says Dezenhall, at Dezenhall Resources. “Corporate chiefs now believe they are facing an absolute ruler versus a broad-based government. And they are trying to figure out where on the spectrum of avoidance to confrontation they need to be. As a general rule, avoidance is the better of your bad options.” In short, laying low may mean the presidential tweetstorm moves on to another target. “So why go to war?” Besides, as much as CEOs make, openly taking on the president may be above their pay grade. “It’s not the job of a CEO to be gratuitously tough; it’s the job of a CEO to create and maintain value for shareholders,” says Dezenhall. “Getting into an unnecessary war with POTUS could become a fire-able offense if the share price tanks.” Reform begins at home If this seems overly obsequious, then here’s a modest proposal for you and all the politically activist CEOs who risk tanking their stocks by taking on Trump. Why not start close to home, with your social activism? Many economists lament the widening of the wealth gap under President Obama. They cite it as a continuing source of social unrest, which often turns violent. Lavish CEO pay packages have definitely contributed to the wealth-gap problem, including those at companies now taking on Trump — like Starbucks, Ford, Facebook (FB) Amazon.com and Apple. If the CEOs at these companies really want to make the world a better place, why not take a two-thirds pay cut, sell two-thirds of your company stock, and redistribute all the money to the bottom 20% of your workforce in the form of a pay hike? After all, this would have a measurable impact on the growing wealth gap. And it could even change the world by example. Who knows, it might even help shareholders by putting CEOs more in touch with customers, and reality. “I think this explosion of CEO pay has been very damaging for companies because it puts CEOs in a rarified category,” says Freed, at the Center for Political Accountability. “Many of them are out of touch.” Starbucks, Ford, Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple all declined to comment on whether their CEOs might consider adopting my modest proposal. So in fairness to these companies, I’ll point out that a lot of their CEO pay comes in the form of stock and options grants. So shareholders benefit along with them. And in the cases of Starbucks, Amazon.com and Facebook, the CEOs are founders who deserve a lot of credit for creating solid companies — and lots of jobs.

INDIA BRASIL U.K. MAGHREB JAPAN DEUTSCHLAND CANADA KOREA FRANCE ESPANA WORLDPOST Iran's President Hassan Rouhani Calls Donald Trump A Political Novice Over Travel Ban “It will take him a long time and will cost the United States a lot, until he learns what is happening in the world.” 02/01/2017 09:39 am ET Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani dismissed his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump as a political novice on Wednesday, stepping up criticism of the Republican’s immigration policies including a temporary travel ban on Iranians. Tehran has already said it will take legal, political and reciprocal measures in response to Trump’s order suspending the entry of people from Iran and six other Muslim-majority countries. Rouhani turned the focus on Trump himself in a live address on state television, saying: “He (Trump) is new to politics. He has been in a different world. It’s a totally new environment to him.” “It will take him a long time and will cost the United States a lot, until he learns what is happening in the world,” added Rouhani, who led a rapprochement with Washington under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama. Trump’s has said his travel order, signed on Friday, is needed to protect national security. He has also promised a sharp shift in policy on Iran, calling the nuclear pact that Tehran signed with Washington and other world powers “the worst deal ever negotiated”. The renewed impasse with may further weaken Rouhani’s efforts to attract foreign investors to Iran, particularly if it slows the implementation of the deals for 80 Boeing jets and 100 Airbus struck last year. “Today is not a time for separating nations by walls,” Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to Trump’s promise to build a barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico. Opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration moves spread inside the United States on Tuesday, with Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Washington state joining others suing the administration over the travel ban. France vowed on Monday to defend Iran’s nuclear deal, strengthen trade ties with Tehran, and double the number of visas available to Iranians.

It's going to get very bumpy The complexities of trade, the EU budget, international treaties and more mean the process will take very much longer than 2 years and the instability created will inevitably shake the economy and markets  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 1 February 2017 14:00 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Sir Ivan Rogers EPA Brexiteers don’t much like Sir Ivan Rogers, who abruptly left his post as the UK’s ambassador to the EU last month.  When you live in Brexit la la land and have told the nation that everything will jolly and wonderful and that the economy will just fly after Britain sails off into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to bump uglies with Donald Trump, it can be quite disconcerting to hear a neutral party saying it might not end up like that.  Sir Ivan said his warning that European leaders fear it might be the mid-2020s before a trade deal between the EU and Brexitland is fixed up, was contained in a briefing note to the PM. He did not know, he told MPs on the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee, how it came to be made public.  Read more The vote on the Brexit Bill could weaken Corbyn's leadership EU Court of Justice could amend post-Brexit trade deal, says president Sir Ivan Rogers warns of 'name-calling' and 'fist-fighting' That may be true, but he also, as a senior civil servant, will have been well aware that these things  have a nasty habit of getting out if you put them down on paper, even if you are only doing your job by doing so.  Just as details about the EU exut negotiation the UK is about to embark upon are going to get out, probably every time there’s a session.  One of Theresa May’s more amusing conceits is her repeated insistence that she is not going to give a "running commentary" on the discussions. We’re going to get one anyway.  Journalists covering them will need to be issued with rain coats to cope with the level of leaking. So are the traders, whose screens will be over heating as the various markets they cover react to the news reports.  If the Brexit project crashes and burns in public, some of those markets are going to crash and burn with it and we’ll all get seats to watch one of the scariest horror movies since William Friedkin wandered over to his special effects people and said: “I’d quite like to see if we can make it so Linda Blair’s head spins 360 degrees. That’d give me a really iconic scene for The Exorcist. Think you could manage it?” No longer shackled by his responsibilities as an ambassador, Sir Ivan described the task of extricating Britain from the EU as “humungous” and warned that talks are likely to get feisty with "name calling" and even "fist fighting".  No kidding. With Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and David “any disagreement with me is against the will of the British people” Davis in charge, how could it be any other way?  Cheered on by the tabloid press every time they snarl, how do you think this is going to end?  Part of the problem, as Sir Ivan warned, is that no one’s quite sure where to start from, before they even get to some of the knottier practical issues, such as trade, or the EU budget, or the acquired rights of EU citizens (which should have been guaranteed already) or the impact of Brexit on international treaties.  They are going to tie ministers and their civil servants up in knots. To have told people it can all be done in two years was foolish in the extreme on the part of the Government. With all the uncertainty that will created during the process, the economy is almost inevitably going to start shuddering. The pound will bounce up and down like a ball in the hands of Steph Curry in response to almost every leak. “We just need some certainty,” will be the cry of business leaders. Terribly sorry, but there’s none of that to be had.  Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Reuters With jobs almost sure to be threatened, what do you do if you, as a Government, start to see a bad situation developing that you have overseen the creation of, having ignored all the warnings and advice given to you by people like Sir Ivan?  You force them out. Then you blow a lot of smoke and look for a scapegoat to pin the blame on. You then shout very loudly at that scapegoat, with the help of your friends from the tabloids.  Brussels is already a bogeyman. It’s going to be held up as Exorcist baddie Pazuzu and blamed for all the economic problems that the Government has created for itself as relations deteriorate. Unless, that is, the grown ups somehow find a way of taking control. If they do, it’ll still get very messy. But unfortunately most of them are like Sir Ivan: On the outside looking in.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Etihad Aviation Group And Lufthansa Group Extend Cooperation 1 February 2017Military News ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Etihad Aviation Group and Lufthansa German Airlines, part of Europe’s largest aviation group, today unveiled details of a new commercial partnership. The two airline groups have concluded a US $100 million global catering agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to cooperate in aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul. Addressing a press conference today in Abu Dhabi, the chief executives of both airline groups spelled out plans to broaden their commercial partnership.                  James Hogan, Etihad Aviation Group President and Chief Executive Officer, said: „Partnerships are at the heart of our strategy and remain fundamental for us to compete effectively and efficiently in a complex and competitive global market. „Our collaboration with one of the aviation industry’s most established and recognised brands is undoubtedly the most significant non-equity partnership with an airline we have ever announced. „This partnership is the platform for a much wider strategic collaboration between our two organisations. It demonstrates the commitment of the Etihad Aviation Group Board and Abu Dhabi to our European growth strategy.” Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: „We welcome the opportunity to strengthen our cooperation with the Etihad Aviation Group. Together we can create added value for our customers and shareholders. Partnering with the Etihad Aviation Group fits perfectly with the Lufthansa Group’s global strategy for our passenger airlines and service companies.”  The four-year catering contract will see Lufthansa’s LSG Sky Chefs provide catering services to Etihad Airways in 16 cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. This makes LSG the largest provider of catering services to the UAE’s national airline, outside its Abu Dhabi home base. Etihad Aviation Group and Lufthansa Technik (LHT) also signed an MoU to explore cooperation in maintenance, repair and overhaul services across Etihad Airways and its airline equity partners, and opportunities for synergies with Etihad Airways Engineering. Etihad Airways and Lufthansa are also exploring further cooperation in a number of areas, including freight operations, procurement and passenger services to improve their competitive offering globally and in the European market. The previously announced codeshare between the two airline groups goes on sale today, February 1, for flights between Abu Dhabi and Germany. Lufthansa will place its ‚LH’ code on Etihad Airways’ twice daily flights between its Abu Dhabi hub and both Frankfurt and Munich. Etihad will put its ‚EY’ code on Lufthansa’s long-haul, non-stop intercontinental services between its home base of Frankfurt, the business and commercial capital of Germany, and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and the Colombian capital, Bogota as soon as government approval is obtained. The codeshare agreement will grow both carriers’ global networks, giving Lufthansa increased access to important feeder markets throughout the Indian Subcontinent via Abu Dhabi, while Etihad will gain access into South America through Germany. To facilitate both connectivity and the customer experience associated with this codeshare, the Abu Dhabi-based airline will also move its operations at Lufthansa’s hubs, from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 in Frankfurt, and Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 in Munich. The Lufthansa Group signed an agreement in December 2016 with airberlin, in which Etihad Aviation Group holds a 29 percent stake, for the wet-lease of 38 aircraft. Lufthansa’s point-to-point carrier Eurowings will wet lease 33 aircraft, and Austrian Airlines, a Lufthansa Group airline, will take on five aircraft. The agreement between Eurowings and airberlin, signed on December 16, 2016, will last for six years and is slated to begin on February 10, 2017 when the first aircraft starts operating for Eurowings. About Etihad Aviation Group Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) is a diversified global aviation and travel group comprising five business divisions – Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Airways Engineering, Etihad Airport Services, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners. The group has minority investments in seven airlines: airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia, and Swiss-based Darwin Airline, trading as Etihad Regional. From its Abu Dhabi base, Etihad Airways flies to, or has announced plans to serve, more than 110 passenger and cargo destinations in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas. The airline has a fleet of over 120 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, with 204 aircraft on firm order, including 71 Boeing 787s, 25 Boeing 777Xs, 62 Airbus A350s and 10 Airbus A380s. For more information, please visit: etihad.com. About Lufthansa Group Lufthansa is a global aviation group divided into the three strategic areas of Hub Airlines, Point-to-Point Business and Service Companies. The Group’s network carriers, with their premium brands of Lufthansa, SWISS and Austrian Airlines, serve its home market from their Frankfurt, Munich, Zurich and Vienna hubs. With its Eurowings brand, the Group also offers short- and long-haul point-to-point services in the growing private travel market. And with its service companies, which are all global market leaders in their individual industries (e.g. Cargo, MRO, Catering), the Lufthansa Group has found success in further areas of the aviation business. The Lufthansa Group’s airlines currently serve 255 destinations in 101 countries (i.e. as of winter 2016/2017). The Group’s total fleet comprises some 600 aircraft; and its member airlines will be taking delivery of 214 new aircraft, including A350 and A321neos between now and 2025.

News Business Business News UK inflation expectations for 2017 have hit three-year high, according to new poll In November, the Bank of England predicted that inflation would surpass 2.7 per cent by the end of 2017 Josie Cox Business Editor Wednesday 1 February 2017 17:50 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Inflation jumped to a two-year high of 1.6 per cent in December Getty UK inflation expectations for the coming year have hit a three-year high, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by YouGov and Citigroup and released on Wednesday, shows that short-term inflation expectations (for the coming 12 months) rose to 2.6 per cent in January, the highest level since December 2013 and a small increase from 2.4 per cent in December. Read more UK consumers more cheerful in January but also more reluctant to spend Longer-term inflation expectations (for five to 10 years ahead) were unchanged from December at an average of three per cent per year. The findings chime with the Bank of England’s most recent forecasts. In November, the Bank predicted that inflation would surpass 2.7 per cent by the end of 2017, spurred by a fall in the value of sterling since the UK’s June vote to quit the European Union. Inflation expectations on the rise Citi Inflation already jumped to a two-year high of 1.6 per cent in December. The Bank is due to publish fresh inflation forecasts on Thursday. Read more Influential think tank raises UK economic growth forecast UK economy grows more than expected in final quarter of 2016 UK faces years of rising unemployment and squeezed incomes, says EY IMF upgrades 2017 UK growth but downgrades 2018 Earlier this week, a CBI survey showed that growth in Britain’s private sector and confidence among consumers was solid in the three months to January, but that rising inflation was imminent. The business lobby group said that inflation threatens to erode consumer incomes over the coming months and that investment spending could slow this year as a result of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.  Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

overhaul - Codeshare flights between Frankfurt, Munich and Abu Dhabi go on sale from February 1, with Rio de Janeiro and Bogota to follow - Etihad operations to relocate to Lufthansa terminals in Frankfurt and Munich News provided by Etihad Aviation Group Feb 01, 2017, 07:28 ET Share this article ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Etihad Aviation Group and Lufthansa German Airlines, part of Europe's largest aviation group, today unveiled details of a new commercial partnership. The two airline groups have concluded a US $100 million global catering agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to cooperate in aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul. Continue Reading James Hogan, Etihad Aviation Group President and Chief Executive Officer; H.E. Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel Al Mazrouei, Chairman of the Board of the Etihad Aviation Group; and Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, are seen at the signing of the new collaboration agreement at a press conference in Abu Dhabi today. Addressing a press conference today in Abu Dhabi, the chief executives of both airline groups spelled out plans to broaden their commercial partnership.                  James Hogan, Etihad Aviation Group President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "Partnerships are at the heart of our strategy and remain fundamental for us to compete effectively and efficiently in a complex and competitive global market. "Our collaboration with one of the aviation industry's most established and recognised brands is undoubtedly the most significant non-equity partnership with an airline we have ever announced. "This partnership is the platform for a much wider strategic collaboration between our two organisations. It demonstrates the commitment of the Etihad Aviation Group Board and Abu Dhabi to our European growth strategy." Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: "We welcome the opportunity to strengthen our cooperation with the Etihad Aviation Group. Together we can create added value for our customers and shareholders. Partnering with the Etihad Aviation Group fits perfectly with the Lufthansa Group's global strategy for our passenger airlines and service companies."  The four-year catering contract will see Lufthansa's LSG Sky Chefs provide catering services to Etihad Airways in 16 cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. This makes LSG the largest provider of catering services to the UAE's national airline, outside its Abu Dhabi home base. Etihad Aviation Group and Lufthansa Technik (LHT) also signed an MoU to explore cooperation in maintenance, repair and overhaul services across Etihad Airways and its airline equity partners, and opportunities for synergies with Etihad Airways Engineering. Etihad Airways and Lufthansa are also exploring further cooperation in a number of areas, including freight operations, procurement and passenger services to improve their competitive offering globally and in the European market. The previously announced codeshare between the two airline groups goes on sale today, February 1, for flights between Abu Dhabi and Germany. Lufthansa will place its 'LH' code on Etihad Airways' twice daily flights between its Abu Dhabi hub and both Frankfurt and Munich. Etihad will put its 'EY' code on Lufthansa's long-haul, non-stop intercontinental services between its home base of Frankfurt, the business and commercial capital of Germany, and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and the Colombian capital, Bogota as soon as government approval is obtained. The codeshare agreement will grow both carriers' global networks, giving Lufthansa increased access to important feeder markets throughout the Indian Subcontinent via Abu Dhabi, while Etihad will gain access into South America through Germany. To facilitate both connectivity and the customer experience associated with this codeshare, the Abu Dhabi-based airline will also move its operations at Lufthansa's hubs, from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 in Frankfurt, and Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 in Munich. The Lufthansa Group signed an agreement in December 2016 with airberlin, in which Etihad Aviation Group holds a 29 percent stake, for the wet-lease of 38 aircraft. Lufthansa's point-to-point carrier Eurowings will wet lease 33 aircraft, and Austrian Airlines, a Lufthansa Group airline, will take on five aircraft. The agreement between Eurowings and airberlin, signed on December 16, 2016, will last for six years and is slated to begin on February 10, 2017 when the first aircraft starts operating for Eurowings. About Etihad Aviation Group Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) is a diversified global aviation and travel group comprising five business divisions – Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Airways Engineering, Etihad Airport Services, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners. The group has minority investments in seven airlines: airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia, and Swiss-based Darwin Airline, trading as Etihad Regional. From its Abu Dhabi base, Etihad Airways flies to, or has announced plans to serve, more than 110 passenger and cargo destinations in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas. The airline has a fleet of over 120 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, with 204 aircraft on firm order, including 71 Boeing 787s, 25 Boeing 777Xs, 62 Airbus A350s and 10 Airbus A380s.

Christopher Pike / The National Winner of Genes in Space competition hopes to plant UAE flag on Mars Roberta Pennington February 1, 2017 Updated: February 1, 2017 11:40 PM Related Alia Al Mansoori, UAE Genes in Space winner 2017 - video Genes in Space, the five finalists: Alia Al Mansoori Meet the five finalists for Genes in Space Related Alia Al Mansoori, UAE Genes in Space winner 2017 - video Genes in Space, the five finalists: Alia Al Mansoori Meet the five finalists for Genes in Space ABU DHABI // An energetic Emirati girl from Dubai who dreams of one day planting the UAE flag on Mars is the winner of the national Genes in Space competition. Alia Al Mansoori’s proposal to study how exposure to space affects the health of live organisms at cellular level was chosen by a panel of experts as the winner from five teams of eight pupils who made it to the final round of judging. Alia, 14, will see her experiment blasted into space from the Kennedy Space Centre between March and July to be tested by astronauts on the International Space Station. "I was like, ‘Oh my God, here’s the spaceship I’m going to Mars on,’ because I feel like I’m getting closer to that big goal," the Al Mawakeb School Al Barsha pupil said. "I’ve always felt that this is what I’m born to do, this is for me." The award was presented by Dr Mohammed Al Ahbabi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, who congratulated all of the students who took part. "I think all of you are winners because the idea is gaining knowledge," said Dr Al Ahbabi. "Young people like you, you are the future. One day, inshallah, we will see one of you as an astronaut." The UAE is the first country outside the US to host the Genes in Space competition. When it was launched by the UAE Space Agency, Boeing and The National in November 2015, it challenged children from Grades 7 to 12 to come up with an experiment that applied DNA analysis to real-life challenges in space exploration. Organisers received more than 100 submissions from 75 schools, involving about 300 pupils and teachers from across the country. "For a nation the size of the UAE, that’s about 10 times the engagement we had in the US," said Dr Sebastian Kraves, a molecular neurobiologist. Dr Kraves co-invented a device called the miniPCR DNA Discovery System, which the pupils used to carry out their experiments. Five teams of pupils from Cranleigh Abu Dhabi, Brighton College Al Ain, Brighton College Abu Dhabi, Gems Modern Academy and Al Mawakeb School Al Barsha were selected as finalists in November. Each team won a miniPCR for their school and were paired with mentors to fine-tune their entries. "Judges were impressed not only by the quantity, but by the quality and breadth of the submissions," Dr Kraves said. "They ranged from experiments to protect astronauts’ DNA from cosmic radiation to protecting their bones from degradation in ways that can cause us to not only travel to space better, but live healthier lives here on Earth." The teams presented their experiments to a room full of scientists, academics, journalists and a panel of five expert judges gathered for the final day of the Global Space Congress in Abu Dhabi. Each presentation was followed by gruelling questions from the judges. Eighty per cent of the judging had been made in the lead-up to the presentations. "When we present our work, we are used to having our work criticised and challenged. This is part of being a scientist," said Dr Luisa Cochella, a Genes in Space judge from Austria’s Research Institute of Molecular Pathology. "The only way in which we grow and learn is by challenging what we know. This is what you want to develop in a scientist – a critical, curious mind." Kevin Foley, head of Boeing’s global sales and marketing, called Genes in Space an extremely successful event. "It’s been an impressive display of how talented the UAE youth and education system are," Mr Foley said. "The students were brilliant, their proposals were incredible. Our winner is going to be a tremendous representative for UAE youth." Dr Kraves said his team, with experts from Boeing and the Space Agency, would work with Alia for the next 60 days to prepare her experiment for space. For Alia, this will be the first step towards achieving her ultimate dream. "I’ve always wanted to be an astronaut," she said. "When I go to Mars, hopefully I’ll be taking an Emirati flag with me and I’ll be planting it on the planet." Rashid Murooshid, Editor-in-Chief of The National, said: "On behalf of The National, I’m very pleased to congratulate Alia on her incredible achievement today and the exciting future that lies ahead. "We are incredibly proud to have supported such a rewarding competition, particularly since this is the first edition of Genes in Space to take place outside the US. "The support offered by The National is a reflection of our deep commitment to education, and forms part of our contribution to transitioning the UAE." rpennington@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Science Alia Al Mansoori, UAE Genes in Space winner 2017 - video Winner of Genes in Space competition hopes to plant UAE flag on Mars Earth is our spaceship and we must explore, Abu Dhabi conference told Emirati girl wins Genes in Space competition - in pictures MOST VIEWED Uae | All Etisalat to offer data and minutes to UAE customers affected by service disruptions Abu Dhabi archaeologists unearth rare, well-preserved Stone Age house Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed meets with emir of Qatar UAE weather: Significant drop in temperature and chance of rain Dubai theme parks chief addresses customer complaints Winner of Genes in Space competition hopes to plant UAE flag on Mars Lion cub roams streets of Khalifa City A Dubai International Airport welcomes Air India’s first 787 Dreamliner from Kochi Starving puppy with legs broken in fight for life at Dubai vet Demand for desalinated water puts pressure on Gulf ecosystems More Most Viewed Etisalat to offer data and minutes to UAE customers affected by service disruptions Abu Dhabi archaeologists unearth rare, well-preserved Stone Age house Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed meets with emir of Qatar UAE weather: Significant drop in temperature and chance of rain Winner of Genes in Space competition hopes to plant UAE flag on Mars Dubai theme parks chief addresses customer complaints Sawiris raw as deal for Greek islands for refugees falls flat Half lion, half tiger: Meet the extremely rare liger that sleeps in his owner’s bed Big cats have no place in UAE villas Omanis call for government cap on fuel prices in first protest since 2011 More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Portrait of a Nation: Emirati whose personal goal is to help others achieve theirs Stormy conditions don’t put off adrenaline junkies at Sharjah Sports Desert Festival Latest Lest We Forget exhibit tells UAE’s history with tales and heirlooms Starving puppy with legs broken in fight for life at Dubai vet FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Dubai tenant wants lower rent on apartment facing construction, but landlord wants to raise it ADCB unveils digital age lender uBank About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Tessie the Truthful Engine says you shouldn't get too excited The tale of Thomas the Privatised Franchise Tank Engine doesn’t have a happy ending  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 1 February 2017 16:29 BST Click to follow The Independent Online What would Thomas and his friends make of the shake-up in rail ticketing? Rex Thomas the Privatised Franchise Tank Engine gave his horn a joyful toot as he approached the sheds.  It had been another tough day ferrying tired and grouchy commuters. His carriages had moaned and bitched as usual, and one poor passenger had been sick on account of spending too long impersonating a sardine while crammed inside them. Now they were griping about the non-appearance of their minimum wage cleaners, who’d failed to turn up because the outsourced contractor that employed them had gone bust, but Thomas refused to let it bring him down. He had good news to impart.  Read more Rip-off rail fares to be overhauled in favour of cheaper alternatives Revealed: The ultimate rail ticket dodge. And it’s all legal Rail fares rise again as passenger interests left in siding “Choo, choo,” he cried, as he entered the siding. “Cheer up guys. They’re overhauling the ticket pricing system and ending rip-off rail fares. Our passengers will be happy at last! “They’ll be offered the cheapest available ticket for a through journey instead of having to spend ages totting up whether it would be cheaper to buy individual tickets from each different rail operator on their iPhones. It’ll make ticket vending machines fair at last. Fair fares! “You should be well pleased Gordon the Grim Express Engine. It’ll be your passengers who’ll be the big beneficiaries and they’ll only have to wait until May for it to happen.” “Read the small print Thomas,” said Gordon. “It’s only on selected routes, CrossCountry, Virgin Trains' east and west coast services and East Midlands. They’re calling it a trial. Do I look excited to you?” It was true. Gordon was sitting in his shed glowering at Thomas. He looked like a Brexiteer confronted by an inconvenient economic truth. Deep down he was a compassionate soul, but he’d just had to put up with listening to a customer service agent telling a disabled passenger there was no one to help them get on the train because she hadn’t booked three months in advance and Gordon was now a driver-only locomotive. He was feeling fed up about this and even more fed up that no one else seemed to see it as a problem.  Thomas, however, refused to be deflated. “Toot, toot to you,” he said. “Jacqueline Starr, the director of customer experience for the Rail Delivery Group, says she’s determined to overhaul the system and to cut out red tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for our customers. She’s working really hard with Government to do away with the complex rules that have led to this situation.” “Gordon,” said their friend Harriet, who occupied the shed in between them and had been earwigging. “You’d better send him over to Tessie.” Thomas’s face fell. To tell the truth, he was a little nervous of Tessie. She had been brought in to replace Sylvester the Cynical engine, who’d been fired by Primrose, the rail company’s PR woman, after he was found to have been speaking to the media without getting permission from the Fat Controller.  Tessie, by contrast did her work quietly and without complaint. But if she was asked for an opinion, she would always tell the truth. She’d kept her job largely because nobody ever did. Other than Thomas, that is, when he was sent to see her by the other engines.  Thomas trundled into her shed and explained the situation.  “Oh you poor dear,” she said, shaking her head sadly. “They’ve really got to you haven’t they? Look, here’s how it is. The rail companies blame the Government, the Government blames the rail companies and everyone shrugs their shoulders when our passengers get cross.  “When it starts to look like it's reaching boiling point, they call in Primrose and her pals to find something they can dress up to make it look like they care about making progress. But your passengers will still have to put up with a rubbishy service and overpriced fares that rise faster than inflation. Lots of our people are on strike because the company treats them really badly, but the boss gets a bonus regardless. “At the end of the day, this won’t change the fact that anyone travelling long distance will use Eric the EasyJet Low Cost Airplane if they’ve got any sense because even though it’s environmentally the worst option, it’s cheaper to fly.” “Oh.” “Oh is right. And you want to know the worst of it? Did you see the shiny new coat of paint François the French Engine had when you saw him last week. Or that new horn Gerhardt the German Engine was given? Their rail companies own some of ours. Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Wilson - 02/01/17 06:00 AM EST 19   © Getty Images Businesses are lobbying furiously to shape a proposal from House Republicans that would levy a tax on goods imported to the United States. The idea, known as border adjustment, is part of the “Better Way” plan that House Republicans released ahead of the November elections. Now that Donald TrumpDonald TrumpUS threatens North Korea with 'overwhelming' retaliation if it uses nuclear arms Judge dismisses Melania Trump's lawsuit against Daily Mail: report Nordstrom to reduce stock of Ivanka Trump merchandise: report MORE is president, Republicans are using that blueprint as the starting point for tax reform. ADVERTISEMENT Implementing border adjustment would represent a seismic shift in tax policy — one that Republicans say would level the playing field for domestic manufacturers. In addition to subjecting imports to a U.S. tax, the proposal would exempt from taxes exported goods. But some major businesses are against the plan, fearing the impact it could have on sales and global supply chains. In the last six months of 2016, more than 35 companies and groups specifically lobbied on the border-adjustment tax, with many opposed to it. The groups and companies that have weighed in on the idea include 3M, banking giant HSBC, electronics company Siemens, petroleum refiner Tesoro, and several retail and clothing manufactures such as Target, Gap, Nike and Sears. Global Automakers, an industry group representing international automakers, has also lobbied on the plan. Action on the import tax has escalated quickly in recent weeks. After Trump won the White House, the “Better Way” plan “stopped being a campaign document for House Republicans and became a serious threat to be the opening draft of a comprehensive tax reform plan by the House Republicans,” said David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation. Dollar Tree in January hired its first lobbying firm in almost a decade, Off Hill Strategies, to specifically work on the tax issue. The store’s inventory largely consists of inexpensive imported products. While retailers are among those most concerned about the tax plan, it could also have major repercussions for the oil and gas industry. Petroleum refiners such as Tesoro import billions of barrels of crude oil each year to refine into fuels like gasoline and diesel. The tax on imports could significantly increase their costs.  “No one in the refining sector is leaping at the chance to support this, largely because no one knows what the impact is on their respective companies,” said Stephen Brown, a vice president and counsel at Tesoro. “You can take assumptions from the blueprint, but until you see the actual language ... you’re kind of stymied.” “Bottom line is, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady are friends of Tesoro and friends of the oil and gas industry, so this is not a comfortable place to be,” Brown said, referring to Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanSecond GOP senator phones Australian ambassador after Trump call What happened to the Founders' Congress?

Other companies are not expressing outright opposition to the tax idea just yet but are instead seeking more information about how it would work. House GOP leadership and top Republican tax-writers have fiercely defended border adjustment, saying it would make the U.S. tax system more like the tax systems in other countries and would remove incentives for companies to move their headquarters or jobs overseas.  The White House appeared to signal it is open to the proposal last week when Trump said tax reform could be a vehicle to generate revenue to pay for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The idea also has early support from some big names in the business world. A group of exporters and domestic manufacturers — which reportedly includes Boeing, General Electric and Dow Chemical — is working to form a coalition to support the proposal.  More than 50 businesses have committed to being part of the group or have expressed interest in doing so, according to a source familiar with the planning. Supporters of border adjustment argue that it would not result in higher prices, because the dollar would strengthen and the cost of importing goods would go down. Opponents are skeptical, fearing that it would take a considerable amount of time for the currency adjustment to occur. Critics also argue that the $1 trillion in earnings Republicans say will be garnered from the tax shift could be undercut if certain companies with razor-thin margins go out of business or otherwise shift operations. Lobbyists such as Stephen Lamar of the American Apparel & Footwear Association warn that the tax, as proposed, could hit consumers with higher prices. Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that pushing back against border adjustment is “easily the No. 1 priority for the retail industry this year” and called it the “most galvanizing” issue for the industry in the last decade. The influential GOP donors Charles and David Koch are also opposed to the proposal.  Levi Russell, a spokesman for the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, said the Koch network is generally supportive of tax reform but is concerned about consumers having to pay more for goods under border adjustment. He said that “everything is on the table” in terms of advocating against border adjustment, adding that he hoped House Republicans would start looking at alternatives.

Some of Toyota's 1,500 dealers heeded the call and contacted members of the House of Representatives' tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, urging them to rethink their proposal, according to people familiar with the effort. Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would force consumers to pay potentially thousands of dollars more for vehicles, they warned. The Japanese automaker's mobilization of its army of dealers underscores the growing alarm among some of the world's largest companies that sell imported goods in the United States. They fear a big tax on imports would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products. "Cost is going to go up, as a result demand is going to go down. As a result, we're not going to able to employ as many as people as we do today. That's my biggest fear," Toyota's North America CEO Jim Lentz said in an interview. Toyota dealers employ more than 97,000 people in the United States. While companies and industry groups frequently lobby Congress, the threat of an import tax has mobilized an unusually broad swath of firms at home and abroad. That lobbying effort is taking place largely out of the public eye partly to avoid potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who has attacked companies for manufacturing abroad for U.S. consumers. Earlier this month Trump targeted Toyota, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world's largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico. The White House said last week that a border tax is one option under review to pay for a wall with Mexico, although what exactly Trump is planning to do is still not clear. He has pledged to impose a "big border tax" on Mexican imports. The plan proposed by House Republicans would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose the 20 percent tax on imports. Companies that rely heavily on imports say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax. As car dealers are reaching out to members of Congress in their districts, Toyota and other automakers are lobbying lawmakers in states where they have large manufacturing plants and employ thousands of workers. The No. 3 vehicle seller in the United States behind General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, Toyota imports about 1.2 million vehicles to the U.S. market annually, half of its 2.4 million U.S. sales. It employs 40,000 people directly. BABY SUPPLIES AND BEER Toyota and the automakers are not alone in this lobbying effort. Target Corp's chief executive, Brian Cornell, traveled to Washington to meet members of the House Ways and Means Committee. He told them an import tax could impact consumers' ability to buy essential goods, such as baby supplies that are made overseas and imported to the United States, according to a person familiar with the talks. Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins confirmed the visit. The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy, headquartered down the road from Minneapolis-based Target, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers. It cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss. The flyer, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, argues that foreign Internet sellers like China's Alibaba.com would be able to avoid the tax by making sales online and shipping to U.S. consumers directly, "undercutting U.S. businesses." Company officials have been handing out the flyer to lawmakers and their staff on Capitol Hill, Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman confirmed. Constellation Brands, which brews Corona and Modelo in Mexico, has been pushing lawmakers to exempt products like Mexican beer in any border tax "because it's inherently a Mexican product," CEO Rob Sands said on an earnings call. But if that effort fails, Constellation is prepared to buy more raw materials from the United States instead of Mexico, Sands said. Koch Industries, the second-largest private U.S. company according to Forbes, said in a statement a border tax would have a "devastating" impact on consumers. The company, owned by Republican donors Charles and David Koch, includes oil refining and manufacturing interests. Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political group founded by the billionaire brothers, told Reuters the powerful group has started to educate its network of activists about the tax, so they can lobby against it. AFP says it has two million activists. LOVE AND HATE Not everyone in corporate America is worried about a new border tax. Several aerospace companies including Boeing Co, United Technologies Corp and Raytheon Co said in earnings calls last week that a border tax could be positive for net exporters like them. "We see the aerospace sector as fundamentally having an advantage in that regard," Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said. The American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA), however, called the proposal "heart stopping," in a letter last week to 9,500 dealers selling vehicles like Toyota, Volkswagen, and BMW. Opponents of the border tax may have already found some allies. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, where BMW has a large plant, said the importance of foreign automakers such as BMW and Toyota to the economy needs to be considered when making laws. "I cannot overstate how significant that industry is to my state," Gowdy said in an interview, adding that he and his wife both drive Toyotas.

The deal represents a rare case of Tokyo negotiating down the price of military hardware from its US ally and underscores progress for the Lockheed Martin Corp-run F-35 programme, which has faced criticisms over cost overruns and other problems. US President Donald Trump, who lashed the programme as “out of control” in December, said on Monday he had been able to shave some US$600 million from the latest US deal to buy about 90 F-35s from Lockheed. But defence analysts and sources downplayed news of those cuts, saying the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed for months and would apply to other countries committed to the programme. Lockheed and the Pentagon did not directly respond to questions regarding the Japanese deal. A spokesperson for the US Defence Department office which runs the F-35 programme said negotiations over the current batch of fighters, known in the industry as LRIP 10, was continuing. “For every nation that buys an F-35 in LRIP 10, the base price of the F-35 will be the lowest in F-35 history,” Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said. The price of the F-35 has been dropping with each new batch as Lockheed and the US government ramp up production, helping to lower overall costs. Four sources told Reuters Japan had further trimmed the price for its latest order, largely on ground support costs such as parts, logistics and technical assistance. “We went through each item in detail and negotiated with the US,” said one of the sources in Japan with knowledge of talks. Costs down In a budget request last year, Japan’s Ministry of Defence pegged the price of the six F-35s at ¥15.7 billion (RM606 million) each. That had been cut to ¥14.6 billion when the budget was approved in December, in line with the 6-7 per cent per plane reduction flagged by the Pentagon late last year. The cost of support equipment dropped significantly, to ¥30.9 billion from ¥42.3 billion, according to the publicly available documents. Cost cuts on such deals are typically done by removing some equipment or swapping out expensive components for cheaper ones. Officials from a new Japanese defence procurement agency and Pentagon personnel met several times in Tokyo between August and December before agreeing on the lower price, said one of the sources, who were not authorised to speak publicly about the deal. Lucrative market The total cost for the Japanese deal was just over US$1 billion, around 12 per cent lower than budgeted in August. The cost to the United States for its latest F-35 contract is expected to be around US$9 billion, with the price per plane falling below US$100 million. Japan’s higher budgeted per aircraft costs of around US$128 million include the aircrafts’ engines and additional funds to have 38 of the 42 F-35s it plans to buy assembled in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Japan does not buy the fighters directly from Lockheed but from the US government through its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, which Washington uses to keep tight control on sensitive military equipment. The US government typically charges a 3.8 per cent sales fee for those transactions. Until now Japan has rarely questioned the price of equipment purchased from its US ally, making it a lucrative market for the likes of Lockheed, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Co. Japan is equipping its military with American kit to help reinforce maritime holdings along the southern edge of the East China Sea where it is locked in a dispute over territory with Beijing. In addition to the F-35s, Japan is buying the Bell Boeing Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk drone. Japan’s splurge on US equipment has put a strain on its finances. In 2016 procurement through the Foreign Military Sales system totaled 485.8 billion yen compared with ¥117.9 billion three years earlier. Tokyo will begin deploying the first of its stealth fighters around the end of this year. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Uphill task for Geely if Proton deal goes through, research house says Chatime owner accuses Malaysian franchisee of using unapproved ingredients KL shares higher at mid-day If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Moody’s eyes downgrade for Sime Darby after planned units spin-off Jakim’s new certification enables Halal Pharmaceuticals to expand locally, globally US airlines tumble amid fear Trump travel ban will spread An iPhone made in America?

A handout picture provided by the office of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani shows him speaking at a conference in the capital Tehran. Picture: AFP. Donald Trump Iran US travel ban Hassan Rouhani Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | one day ago DUBAI - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani dismissed his US counterpart Donald Trump as a political novice on Wednesday, stepping up criticism of the Republican's immigration policies including a temporary travel ban on Iranians. Tehran has already said it will take legal, political and reciprocal measures in response to Trump's order suspending the entry of people from Iran and six other Muslim-majority countries. Rouhani turned the focus on Trump himself in a live address on state television, saying: "He (Trump) is new to politics. He has been in a different world. It's a totally new environment to him." "It will take him a long time and will cost the United States a lot, until he learns what is happening in the world," added Rouhani, who led a rapprochement with Washington under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama. Trump's has said his travel order, signed on Friday, is needed to protect national security. He has also promised a sharp shift in policy on Iran, calling the nuclear pact that Tehran signed with Washington and other world powers "the worst deal ever negotiated". The renewed impasse with may further weaken Rouhani's efforts to attract foreign investors to Iran, particularly if it slows the implementation of the deals for 80 Boeing jets and 100 Airbus struck last year. "Today is not a time for separating nations by walls," Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to Trump's promise to build a barrier along the US border with Mexico. France vowed on Monday to defend Iran's nuclear deal, strengthen trade ties with Tehran, and double the number of visas available to Iranians.

The deal represents a rare case of Tokyo negotiating down the price of military hardware from its U.S. ally and underscores progress for the Lockheed Martin Corp-run F-35 program, which has faced criticisms over cost overruns and other problems. U.S. President Donald Trump, who lashed the program as "out of control" in December, said on Monday he had been able to shave some $600 million from the latest U.S. deal to buy about 90 F-35s from Lockheed. But defense analysts and sources downplayed news of those cuts, saying the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed for months and would apply to other countries committed to the program. Lockheed and the Pentagon did not directly respond to questions regarding the Japanese deal. A spokesperson for the U.S. Defense Department office which runs the F-35 program said negotiations over the current batch of fighters, known in the industry as LRIP 10, was continuing.

News Business Business News The world's most valuable brands revealed The monetary value of Google’s brand rose by 24 per cent last year to $109.5bn Josie Cox Business Editor Thursday 2 February 2017 12:18 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The report deemed Amazon the third most valuable brand, at $106.4m, followed by AT&T at $87m, and Microsoft at $76.3m Brand Finance Google has snatched Apple’s title as the world’s most valuable brand, ending the iPhone maker’s five-year reign. According to a study by valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance, published on Wednesday, the monetary value of Google’s brand rose by 24 per cent last year to $109.5bn, propelling it to the top spot for the first time since 2011. Apple’s value fell from $145.9bn in the previous year to $107.1bn. Read more Google parent Alphabet shares fall as profit misses targets “[Google] remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income,” Brand Finance wrote in its report. David Haigh, chief executive officer of Brand Finance, commented that Apple has recently struggled to maintain its technological advantage over rivals. “New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand,” he said. “The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way.” Read more The top 100 brands in the world have been revealed Google overtakes Apple as most valuable global brand These are the 10 most influential brands in Britain But late Tuesday, before Brand Finance’s sturdy was published, Apple posted forecast-beating results for the most recent quarter, reclaiming the throne as the world’s top smartphone seller for the first time in five years – even beating arch rival Samsung. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported in January better-than-expected revenue for the most recent quarter thanks to a fast-growing cloud-computing business and booming YouTube video advertising, but profits were hit by a one-off tax payment. The study of 500 brands deemed Amazon the third most valuable, at $106.4bn, followed by AT&T at $87bn and Microsoft at $76.3bn. Facebook claimed the ninth spot in the rankings with a value of a slither under $62bn. In Wednesday’s report Brand Finance also crowned Lego the world’s most powerful brand, which is defined as one whose enterprise value is most positively impacted by the strength of its brand. The study found that much of the Danish family-owned company’s success is owed to its partnerships with the Star Wars, Harry Potter and Batman franchises. Other brands that made it into the top five “powerful” ranking included Google, Nike, Ferrari and Visa. Walt Disney, which nabbed the title of most powerful brand last year, fell to sixth place. The world’s most valuable brands 10 show all The world’s most valuable brands 1/10 1st - Google Google replaced Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, with a brand value of $109.5bn, according to Brand Finance 2/10 2nd - Apple Apple’s brand value declined from $145.9bn to $107.1bn in 2016 3/10 3rd - Amazon Amazon's brand value rose from $69.6bn to $106.4bn in 2016 4/10 4th - At&t Of the 40 telecoms brands in the ranking, AT&T in 2016 overtook Verizon as the most valuable brand rising to $87bn from $59.9bn the year before 5/10 5th - Microsoft Microsoft's brand value rose marginally from $67.3bn to $76.3bn in 2016 6/10 6th - Samsung Amazon's brand value rose from $58.6bn to $66.2bn 7/10 7th - Verizon Verizon's brand value inched up from $63.1bn to $65.9bn 8/10 8th - Walmart Walmart's brand value rose from $53.6bn to $62.5bn 9/10 9th - Facebook Facebook's brand value increased sharply from $34bn to just shy of $62bn 10/10 10th - ICBC ICBC saw its brand value rise to $47.8bn from $36.3bn. It was the most valuabe financial brand in the world in 2016 replacing Wells Fargo “This may be because its 2016 Star Wars release was a spin-off and less successful than 2015’s reboot of the main franchise, one of the highest grossing films of all time,” Brand Finance wrote in the report. The company noted, however that it “remains a hugely powerful brand and will be closely watched during 2017 when the eighth instalment of Star Wars is released and could propel the brand up the rankings again”.

Home World news Japan secures extra cost cuts on US F-35 fighter jet package: Sources Japan secures extra cost cuts on US F-35 fighter jet package: Sources Tokyo has secured cost cuts on support equipment for its next batch of six U.S. F-35 stealth fighter aircraft of around $100 million, according to sources and Japanese budget papers, on top of savings being finalised for all buyers of the high-tech jets. By: Reuters | Tokyo | Published: February 1, 2017 3:26 PM The fourth U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II aircraft arrives at the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in this April 24, 2013 photo released on May 8, 2013. (Reuters) Tokyo has secured cost cuts on support equipment for its next batch of six U.S. F-35 stealth fighter aircraft of around $100 million, according to sources and Japanese budget papers, on top of savings being finalised for all buyers of the high-tech jets. The deal represents a rare case of Tokyo negotiating down the price of military hardware from its U.S. ally and underscores progress for the Lockheed Martin Corp -run F-35 program, which has faced criticisms over cost overruns and other problems. U.S. President Donald Trump, who lashed the program as “out of control” in December, said on Monday he had been able to shave some $600 million from the latest U.S. deal to buy about 90 F-35s from Lockheed. But defence analysts and sources downplayed news of those cuts, saying the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed for months and would apply to other countries committed to the program. Lockheed and the Pentagon did not directly respond to questions regarding the Japanese deal. A spokesperson for the U.S. Defense Department office which runs the F-35 program said negotiations over the current batch of fighters, known in the industry as LRIP 10, was continuing. You may also like to watch “For every nation that buys an F-35 in LRIP 10, the base price of the F-35 will be the lowest in F-35 history,” Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said. The price of the F-35 has been dropping with each new batch as Lockheed and the U.S. government ramp up production, helping to lower overall costs. Four sources told Reuters Japan had further trimmed the price for its latest order, largely on ground support costs such as parts, logistics and technical assistance. “We went through each item in detail and negotiated with the U.S.,” said one of the sources in Japan with knowledge of talks. COSTS DOWN In a budget request last year, Japan’s Ministry of Defence pegged the price of the six F-35s at 15.7 billion yen ($136.81 million) each. That had been cut to 14.6 billion yen when the budget was approved in December, in line with the 6-7 percent per plane reduction flagged by the Pentagon late last year. The cost of support equipment dropped significantly, to 30.9 billion yen from 42.3 billion yen, according to the publicly available documents. Cost cuts on such deals are typically done by removing some equipment or swapping out expensive components for cheaper ones. Officials from a new Japanese defence procurement agency and Pentagon personnel met several times in Tokyo between August and December before agreeing on the lower price, said one of the sources, who were not authorised to speak publicly about the deal. LUCRATIVE MARKET The total cost for the Japanese deal was just over $1 billion, around 12 percent lower than budgeted in August. The cost to the United States for its latest F-35 contract is expected to be around $9 billion, with the price per plane falling below $100 million. Japan’s higher budgeted per aircraft costs of around $128 million include the aircrafts’ engines and additional funds to have 38 of the 42 F-35s it plans to buy assembled in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Japan does not buy the fighters directly from Lockheed but from the U.S. government through its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, which Washington uses to keep tight control on sensitive military equipment. The U.S. government typically charges a 3.8 percent sales fee for those transactions. You may also like to watch Until now Japan has rarely questioned the price of equipment purchased from its U.S. ally, making it a lucrative market for the likes of Lockheed, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Co. Japan is equipping its military with American kit to help reinforce maritime holdings along the southern edge of the East China Sea where it is locked in a dispute over territory with Beijing. In addition to the F-35s, Japan is buying the Bell Boeing Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk drone. Japan’s splurge on U.S. equipment has put a strain on its finances. In 2016 procurement through the Foreign Military Sales system totaled 485.8 billion yen compared with 117.9 billion yen three years earlier. Tokyo will begin deploying the first of its stealth fighters around the end of this year. Please Wait while comments are loading...

PHOTO: REUTERS TEHRAN: Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani dismissed his US counterpart Donald Trump as a political novice on Wednesday, stepping up criticism of the Republican’s immigration policies including a temporary travel ban on Iranians. Tehran has already said it will take legal, political and reciprocal measures in response to Trump’s order suspending the entry of people from Iran and six other Muslim-majority countries. US Muslim leaders sue Trump over ‘fear-mongering’ travel ban Rouhani turned the focus on Trump himself in a live address on state television, saying: “He (Trump) is new to politics. He has been in a different world. It’s a totally new environment to him.” “It will take him a long time and will cost the United States a lot, until he learns what is happening in the world,” added Rouhani, who led a rapprochement with Washington under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama. Trump’s has said his travel order, signed on Friday, is needed to protect national security. He has also promised a sharp shift in policy on Iran, calling the nuclear pact that Tehran signed with Washington and other world powers “the worst deal ever negotiated”. The renewed impasse with may further weaken Rouhani’s efforts to attract foreign investors to Iran, particularly if it slows the implementation of the deals for 80 Boeing jets and 100 Airbus struck last year. Turkey urges Trump to scrap ‘offensive’ refugee policy “Today is not a time for separating nations by walls,” Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to Trump’s promise to build a barrier along the US border with Mexico. Opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration moves spread inside the United States on Tuesday, with Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Washington state joining others suing the administration over the travel ban. France vowed on Monday to defend Iran’s nuclear deal, strengthen trade ties with Tehran, and double the number of visas available to Iranians.

Article iran Iran's president calls Trump a political novice over travel ban 01 February, 2017 Iran's President Hassan Rouhani attends a news conference in Ankara June 9, 2014. REUTERS/Umit Bektas REUTERS/Umit Bektas By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin DUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani dismissed his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump as a political novice on Wednesday, stepping up criticism of the Republican's immigration policies including a temporary travel ban on Iranians. Tehran has already said it will take legal, political and reciprocal measures in response to Trump's order suspending the entry of people from Iran and six other Muslim-majority countries. Rouhani turned the focus on Trump himself in a live address on state television, saying: "He (Trump) is new to politics. He has been in a different world. It's a totally new environment to him." "It will take him a long time and will cost the United States a lot, until he learns what is happening in the world," added Rouhani, who led a rapprochement with Washington under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama. Advertisement Trump's has said his travel order, signed on Friday, is needed to protect national security. He has also promised a sharp shift in policy on Iran, calling the nuclear pact that Tehran signed with Washington and other world powers "the worst deal ever negotiated". The renewed impasse with may further weaken Rouhani's efforts to attract foreign investors to Iran, particularly if it slows the implementation of the deals for 80 Boeing jets and 100 Airbus struck last year. "Today is not a time for separating nations by walls," Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to Trump's promise to build a barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico. Opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration moves spread inside the United States on Tuesday, with Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Washington state joining others suing the administration over the travel ban. France vowed on Monday to defend Iran's nuclear deal, strengthen trade ties with Tehran, and double the number of visas available to Iranians.

The deal represents a rare case of Tokyo negotiating down the price of military hardware from its U.S. ally and underscores progress for the Lockheed Martin Corp -run F-35 program, which has faced criticisms over cost overruns and other problems. U.S. President Donald Trump, who lashed the program as "out of control" in December, said on Monday he had been able to shave some $600 million from the latest U.S. deal to buy about 90 F-35s from Lockheed. But defence analysts and sources downplayed news of those cuts, saying the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed for months and would apply to other countries committed to the program. Lockheed and the Pentagon did not directly respond to questions regarding the Japanese deal. A spokesperson for the U.S. Defense Department office which runs the F-35 program said negotiations over the current batch of fighters, known in the industry as LRIP 10, was continuing. "For every nation that buys an F-35 in LRIP 10, the base price of the F-35 will be the lowest in F-35 history," Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said. The price of the F-35 has been dropping with each new batch as Lockheed and the U.S. government ramp up production, helping to lower overall costs. Four sources told Reuters Japan had further trimmed the price for its latest order, largely on ground support costs such as parts, logistics and technical assistance. "We went through each item in detail and negotiated with the U.S.," said one of the sources in Japan with knowledge of talks. COSTS DOWN In a budget request last year, Japan's Ministry of Defence pegged the price of the six F-35s at 15.7 billion yen ($136.81 million) each. That had been cut to 14.6 billion yen when the budget was approved in December, in line with the 6-7 percent per plane reduction flagged by the Pentagon late last year. The cost of support equipment dropped significantly, to 30.9 billion yen from 42.3 billion yen, according to the publicly available documents. Cost cuts on such deals are typically done by removing some equipment or swapping out expensive components for cheaper ones. Officials from a new Japanese defence procurement agency and Pentagon personnel met several times in Tokyo between August and December before agreeing on the lower price, said one of the sources, who were not authorised to speak publicly about the deal. LUCRATIVE MARKET The total cost for the Japanese deal was just over $1 billion, around 12 percent lower than budgeted in August. The cost to the United States for its latest F-35 contract is expected to be around $9 billion, with the price per plane falling below $100 million. Japan's higher budgeted per aircraft costs of around $128 million include the aircrafts' engines and additional funds to have 38 of the 42 F-35s it plans to buy assembled in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Japan does not buy the fighters directly from Lockheed but from the U.S. government through its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, which Washington uses to keep tight control on sensitive military equipment. The U.S. government typically charges a 3.8 percent sales fee for those transactions. Until now Japan has rarely questioned the price of equipment purchased from its U.S. ally, making it a lucrative market for the likes of Lockheed, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Co. Japan is equipping its military with American kit to help reinforce maritime holdings along the southern edge of the East China Sea where it is locked in a dispute over territory with Beijing. In addition to the F-35s, Japan is buying the Bell Boeing Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk drone. Japan's splurge on U.S. equipment has put a strain on its finances. In 2016 procurement through the Foreign Military Sales system totaled 485.8 billion yen compared with 117.9 billion yen three years earlier. Tokyo will begin deploying the first of its stealth fighters around the end of this year.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 1 February 2017 | MYT 4:50 PM Amazon to spend US$1.49bil on air cargo hub, fans talk of bigger ambitions Smart move: Amazon is handling more shipping in-house so it can deliver packages to customers faster, as well as cut costs and uncertainty associated with relying on third parties. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon.com Inc plans to invest US$1.49bil (RM6.59bil) to build a large air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, state officials said, stoking expectations it may one day opt to directly compete with FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc.  The world's biggest online retailer has agreed to a 50-year lease for about 900 acres of property from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport – close in size to the global hubs of top cargo airlines.  Amazon is handling more shipping in-house so it can deliver packages to customers faster, as well as cut costs and uncertainty associated with relying on third parties. It has said its moves are designed to supplement, not replace cargo carriers.  Analysts suspect it has larger ambitions.  "We estimate a US$400bil (RM1.77tril)-plus market opportunity for Amazon in delivery, freight forwarding, and contract logistics," Colin Sebastian, an analyst for Baird Equity Research, said in a note to clients.  Amazon, which has not announced a start date for the hub, said it expects to create more than 2,000 jobs when the site opens.  The northern Kentucky location – not far from UPS's major hub – puts Amazon's aircraft in shooting distance of top cities. The company said last year it would lease 40 Boeing Co 767 planes, 16 of which are currently in service.  It also lets Amazon's trucks reach 11 fulfilment centres in state. And a large operation of Deutsche Post DHL there lets Amazon transfer packages easily abroad, said Brian Clancy, managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital & Strategy LLC.  As part of the investment, Amazon anticipates it will spend nearly US$462mil (RM2.04bil) on building and improvements over an unspecified number of years, according to a report by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.  The authority's board tentatively approved US$40mil (RM177.18mil) in tax incentives for Amazon over ten years if it meets hiring commitments, with average wages including benefits targeted at US$26 (RM115.17) per hour, the report said.  So far, Amazon has loaded its aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the United States. This has helped it dodge fees from cargo partners, which are increasingly pricing by volume rather than weight.  Amazon's new site compares with about 1,220 acres UPS has in Louisville. FedEx has more than 900 in its Memphis hub, a 2010 airport plan showed. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Life & Style , Technology You May Be Interested Apple moves closer to iPhone assembly in India Uber CEO quits Trump’s business advisory group Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Samsung in talks with Japan’s Murata for S8 batteries: Nikkei Mobile gaming is box office business Others Also Read Preparations in full swing for a grand chingay show Abe says Japan to show 'unwavering alliance' with U.S. under Trump Kemuning folk want authorities to find culprit causing smog in neighbourhood advertisement Latest News Tabung Haji sets aside RM2bil to invest in UK, Australian properties Honda Malaysia recalls 2012 year models to replace inflators Yinson expects earnings from converted FPSO by Q3 2017 Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Most Viewed in Tech Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

News Business Business News Apple reclaims throne as the world's top smartphone seller Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the US fiscal first quarter ending 31 December, up from 74.78 million the year before Narottam Medhora, Stephen Nellis Wednesday 1 February 2017 15:48 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Apple is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for more than two-thirds of its total revenue Getty Apple has reclaimed the throne as the world’s top smartphone seller for the first time in five years, beating rival Samsung in units shipped for the US “holiday” quarter and boosting revenues with a strong showing for its new, top-of-the-range iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone sales numbers, and a profit of almost $1bn (£790m), both beat Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 3 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Read more Apple misses deadline to pay €13bn to Ireland in illegal tax benefits But the gains were tempered by Apple’s cautious outlook for the current quarter, which it mainly attributed to the strong US dollar, which hurts companies like Apple that sell a majority of their products overseas, by forcing them to raise prices, which depresses unit sales, or sacrifice margins. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the US fiscal first quarter ending 31 December, up from 74.78 million the year before. Analysts on average had expected 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. That beat Samsung’s 77.5 million smartphone sales in the quarter, according to tech data firm Strategy Analytics, the first time that has happened since the fourth quarter of 2011.

Apple may also have benefited from Samsung’s much-publicised recall of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. Apple is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for more than two-thirds of its total revenue. Analysts and investors have already set their sights on Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone, which is expected to feature better touch screen technology, wireless charging and a shift to a higher-resolution OLED display.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

News Business Business News One of the country’s most influential think tanks has raised its economic growth forecast The prediction is still lower than was forecast before the Brexit vote in June 2016 William Schomberg Wednesday 1 February 2017 17:10 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday its latest forecasts pointed to growth of 1.7 per cent this year Getty Britain's economy now looks set to slow only slightly in 2017 after its resilient response to last year's Brexit vote, but growth is still likely to be a lot weaker than if the country had decided to stay in the European Union, a think tank has said. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday its latest forecasts pointed to growth of 1.7 per cent this year. That would be only a moderate slowdown from two per cent in 2016, when Britain outgrew its big rich country peers around the world despite the Brexit shock, delighting politicians who supported the decision to leave the EU. Read more UK economy grows more than expected in final quarter of 2016 Like the Bank of England and many other forecasters, NIESR has progressively revised up its short-term estimates for British economic growth since the referendum, thanks in large part to consumers who kept on spending. In August, a few weeks after the vote, NIESR predicted the economy would grow by only one per cent in 2017. In November, it raised that forecast to 1.4 per cent. The BoE is also expected to announce a higher economic growth forecast for 2017 on Thursday, but is likely to stick to its neutral position on whether its next policy move will be to raise interest rates or cut them. NIESR economist Simon Kirby said he still expected consumers to be pinched by weaker sterling and higher prices this year. But gross domestic product for 2017 would be helped by weaker imports and a smaller positive contribution from higher exports. “These are not necessarily promising figures,” Kirby said. “This is not closing the output gap, even though on the face of it you might think these figures look reasonable.” Before June’s referendum, NIESR’s forecast for British growth in 2017 stood at 2.7 per cent, he said. For 2018, NIESR is now predicting growth of 1.9 per cent. Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Reuters Consumer price inflation was expected to average 3.3 per cent in 2017, lower than a NIESR forecast made in November after a recent partial recovery for battered sterling against other currencies since then.

On Britain's large current account deficit, NIESR said it expected the shortfall to narrow to 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2017 from 4.7 per cent in 2016 and to turn into a surplus in 2019, helped by the fall in the value of sterling.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: Budget 2017 is out: Read how it impacts you and India BENGALURU: The state government is partnering with the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) and MS Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences to set up the Karnataka Aerospace Technology Innovation Centre, a flagship initiative touted to boost research in the sector. A brainchild of the industries and commerce department, this is the first-of-its-kind attempt to bring industry and academia together in the aerospace sector in Karnataka, which faces stiff competition from neighbours. “The idea is to identify technologies that can be hived off for commercial production to benefit small and medium enterprises in and around Bengaluru,“ Commissioner for Industrial Development Gaurav Gupta told ET. The idea is also to allow larger defence PSUs such as the DRDO, HAL and BEL to look at the facility for product development. “We're most likely to go ahead with it because we want some form of academic hand-holding. So then we'll have a research and development unit anchored by NAL, academics, industry participation and the government -all working to boost a lot of new things that can happen in the sector,“ Gupta said. The MS Ramaiah University has offered to provide space for the fered to provide space for the Karnataka Aerospace Technology Innovation Centre on its Peenya campus. “We will give 1,300 sqft of office space for the centre on our campus,“ vice-chancellor SR Shankapal said. The university wants to create an incubation centre to give its students exposure to the aerospace industry , he added. The university currently offers B Tech in aerospace engineer ing and M Tech in aircraft design engineering. Eventually , the centre will move to the Bengaluru Aerospace Park, a 950acre parcel of land at Singahalli be hind the Kempegowda International Airport. Wipro Aerospace, Thyssenkrupp Aerospace and Starragheckert have started functioning there. The government has been trying to position Bengaluru as India's aerospace capital, citing the presence of Boeing, Airbus among other key players in the city. G Raj Narayan, MD at Radel Advanced Technology , was cynical.Narayan, who was part of a 4-member team that built India's first indigenous cockpit simulator, pointed out that the project would add little value without the involvement of the HAL and the Indian Institute of Science.“As of now, the entire domain expertise lies within HAL and the IISc has been catering to the aerospace industry for many decades,“ he said.

The Arrow 3 interceptor, designed to shoot down missiles above the atmosphere, was handed to air force bases in Israel after successful testing by Israel and the United States at the end of 2015. A defence ministry statement said Israel and the US were dedicated to the continued development and enhancement of ballistic missile defence systems as "threats continue to grow and new emerging threats surface". The Arrow project was first launched in 1988 as part of the then Star Wars programme under late US president Ronald Reagan that was abandoned in 1993. Arrow 3 is intended to serve as Israel's uppermost missile interception system. Lower-altitude interception systems are either already deployed or close to being operational. Partly financed by the United States, the Arrow system was developed and produced by Israeli Aerospace Industries in partnership with Boeing. Israel's foe Iran has carried out a number of missile tests in recent months, which the United States and European governments have said are a breach of its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. Western powers say the missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads and therefore go against the deal, while Iran says its missile programme is "non-negotiable". Israel had opposed the deal between Iran and major powers, which lifted a wide range of international sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear programme. jjm/dv BOEING Comment on this article using your Disqus, Facebook, Google or Twitter login.

Investors shifted their money to less risky investments for the second day in a row. For the second straight day, stocks started with substantial losses. Industrial companies, which have climbed lately, fell the most as UPS tumbled after a weak fourth-quarter report. Banks also slipped. But investors bought safe-play assets like gold, government bonds, and high dividend payers. Drug companies also rallied after President Donald Trump met with industry executives and discussed ideas including faster drug approvals and lower taxes. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said investors are looking for safer investments because the change from Barack Obama's administration to Donald Trump's has created so many changes in government. "More than anything right now, it's just the pace of news," he said. "It is so dramatic." The stock market made huge gains after Trump was elected last fall, and Paulsen said it's not a surprise that investors would sell some of their holdings, take some profits, and move to lower-risk investments at some point. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 107.04 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,864.09 as companies like Goldman Sachs and Boeing returned some of their recent gains. The S&P 500 lost 2.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,278.87. It fell as much as 13 points early on. The S&P 500 has fallen for four days in a row. While that is its longest losing streak since before the presidential election, the losses have been small. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.07 points to 5,614.79. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 9.49 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,361.82. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks rose than fell. Athletic apparel maker Under Armour plunged after investors were disappointed with its fourth-quarter report, which included higher expenses. Under Armour also issued a weak full-year forecast and said its chief financial officer is leaving. The stock tumbled $7.45, or 25.7 percent, to $21.49. It dropped 30 percent last year and is now trading at its lowest price in two years.

The company should consider replacing Kleinfeld with Larry Lawson, former CEO of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., whom Elliott has hired as a consultant, the New York-based hedge fund said in a presentation Tuesday. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also announced five nominees to Arconic’s board. Elliott’s concerns about Kleinfeld have been brewing since at least last year. Days after Arconic shares began trading as a separate company on Nov. 1, Elliott said it had increased its stake and planned to discuss with the new company how to improve performance. The hedge fund is Arconic’s largest stockholder with 10.5 percent of shares outstanding and already has three representatives on the board, carryovers from Alcoa. A successful proxy fight could give it a majority. “Despite years of poor performance, a culture of grandiose rhetoric devoid of any real substance or follow-through has been tolerated,” Elliott said in the presentation. “We are seeking sustained improvements at Arconic to benefit all long-term stakeholders.” The stock could trade for $33 to $54 a share after making changes to operations, capital allocation and strategy, Elliott said in a statement after the close of regular trading. The shares rose 1.6 percent to $23.15 at 5:35 p.m. in New York. Arconic said its board, which consists of Kleinfeld and 12 directors, “unanimously supports” management. “The board has conducted an intensive and extensive review of Elliott’s allegations and has concluded that many of them are misleading or not substantiated,” the company said in a statement. Kleinfeld Strategy The corporate split marked the culmination of a strategy pursued by Kleinfeld, 59, who took the reins at Alcoa in 2008 before engineering the carve-out of Arconic. The former Siemens CEO relentlessly emphasized Alcoa’s focus on value-added aluminum products while cutting costs at a commodity-aluminum business that was once the world’s largest by volume. Lawson, 58, a veteran of Lockheed Martin Corp., has a reputation as a tough manager who gets results. He led Lockheed’s F-35 fighter program and ran its aeronautics division before joining Spirit AeroSystems as CEO in 2013. Lawson caught analysts off guard in June with an announcement he would retire from Spirit the following month after turning around the aerospace supplier. Under his watch, net income more than tripled as the company expanded its relationship with Airbus Group SE and shed an unprofitable wing production business. Lawson Record The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up But several key executives also departed in Lawson’s last months amid an impasse on a contract agreement with Boeing Co. and a “seriously fractured” relationship with the planemaker, Carter Copeland, an aerospace analyst with Barclays Capital Inc., wrote in a June 9 report. Shareholders admired the CEO for his results “but we get the sense that the employee base doesn’t love Larry Lawson as much,” Copeland wrote. Elliott’s nominees to the Arconic board, all former CEOs of the companies listed, are Christopher Ayers of WireCo WorldGroup Inc.; Elmer L. Doty of Accudyne Industries; Charles M. Hall of AM General; Bernd F. Kessler of SRTechnics AG; and Patrice E. Merrin of Luscar Ltd. Along with Lawson, Ayers and Doty have deep experience dealing with Boeing, the world’s largest planemaker and Arconic’s largest customer, according to a Bloomberg supply-chain analysis. Elliott Activism Elliott has been one of the busiest activist investors under its head of U.S. equity activism, Jesse Cohn. Already this year, Elliott disclosed new positions in power producer NRG Energy Inc. together with Bluescape Energy Partners, and in health-care services and software group Advisory Board Co. Elliott also welcomed oil refiner target Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s announcement it would accelerate a sale of assets to its master limited partnership and consider a spinoff of its gasoline and convenience stores. While most of Elliott’s investments aren’t active -- where it amasses shares and seeks to convince executives and directors to make changes to boost shareholder returns -- it’s those campaigns that often attract the most attention. Elliott recently also went active at South Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics Co. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Credit: Caltech Harold Rosen (MS ’48, PhD ’51), the father of geostationary satellite communications, passed away on January 30, 2017. He was 90. Modern communications technology relies on a fleet of hundreds of satellites orbiting in fixed locations above the earth’s surface. These geostationary satellites, as they are known, act as communications relays, allowing for near-instantaneous signal transmission across the globe without the need for wired networks. And without Harold Rosen, they would not exist. Harold Rosen was born on March 20, 1926, in New Orleans and graduated from high school at age 15. He showed an early fascination with science and engineering and, as a teen, was an amateur radio operator. Near the close of World War II, the 18-year-old Rosen—by then a senior at Tulane University studying electrical engineering—joined the Navy as an electronics technician. He completed his undergraduate studies when the war ended and in 1947 began graduate research at Caltech under rocket telemetering pioneer Bill Pickering (BS ’32, MS ’33, PhD ’36). During his graduate years, Rosen took a part-time job at Raytheon Company, where he was tasked with improving antiaircraft guided missiles and radar; he continued full time at the company after receiving his doctorate in 1951. His Caltech education, he told a Caltech publication in 2012, “gave me such a good grounding in the fundamentals” that he felt capable of attacking any technical problem in almost any field. “Harold Rosen was an illustrious alumnus who was ahead of his time in promoting interdisciplinary thinking,” says Guruswami Ravichandran, the John E. Goode, Jr., Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and Otis Booth Leadership Chair of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science at Caltech. “The impact of the interdisciplinary fundamental education he received at Caltech is illustrated by his transformational thinking in the field of satellite communications.” Spurred on by the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, Rosen set out to one-up the Soviets. While Sputnik was only capable of transmitting beeps back to the earth, Rosen—who had been hired a year earlier by Hughes Aircraft Company—envisioned placing a full communications relay in space. At the time, long-distance telephone calls were both expensive and difficult, since any call needed to be routed over the limited number of telephone lines that stretched between various locations. The idea that geostationary satellites could overcome these limitations dates back to the late 1920s and was popularized by science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke in a paper written in 1945. But the proposal faced significant challenges. Engineers at the time worried that such a satellite would either be too heavy to launch or would not survive long enough in orbit to be commercially worth the expense. Collaborating with engineers Thomas Hudspeth and Don Williams, Rosen designed a lightweight barrel-shaped solar-powered satellite that spun like a gyroscope to remain stable and used small pulses of thrust to remain aloft. His design convinced the initially reluctant management at Hughes to greenlight the development of a 55-pound prototype. With that prototype in hand, he was able to enlist the support of Caltech alumnus John Rubel (BS ’42), then deputy research director at the U.S. Department of Defense. At the time, Rubel was overseeing an attempt by the Pentagon to build its own communications satellite—but the design had a projected weight of thousands of pounds. Rubel convinced NASA to instead fund Rosen’s Syncom (“synchronous communication satellite”) program. The first Syncom satellite was launched in February 1963 but failed because of a problem with one of its motors. A second attempt in July 1963—with a redesigned motor—was successful, and the satellite soon became operational. In August, President John F. Kennedy used Syncom 2 to telephone the Nigerian prime minister in what was the first live two-way call via satellite between heads of governments. In 1964, Syncom 3 was launched, allowing the transmission of live television signals from Tokyo during the Summer Olympics. “There have been many great engineers but few with Harold’s imagination and even fewer who could fulfill their dreams,” remembers his brother, Benjamin (Ben) Rosen (BS ’54), chairman emeritus of the Caltech Board of Trustees. “Before there were any communications satellites, in 1959, Harold imagined one launched by a small vehicle of the day and spin-stabilized at an altitude of 22,300 miles and thus appearing stationary with respect to an observer (or antenna) on Earth. A couple of years later, when he tried to sell this radical idea to an international technical group at a meeting in the Eiffel Tower restaurant, one of the skeptics pointed outside at the tree line and said, ‘Dr. Rosen, this is as high as your satellite will ever fly.’” Rosen eventually directed the development of more than 150 communications satellites—first with Hughes, then with Boeing after it acquired Hughes—before retiring in 1993. Even in retirement, Rosen continued to consult for Boeing and gave periodic lectures to engineering students at Caltech. Along with his venture capitalist brother Ben, whose fund financed Compaq Computer Corp. and who was its first chairman and CEO, Harold started Rosen Motors, which developed a hybrid-electric automotive powertrain with a microturbine engine and a magnetically suspended very-high-speed flywheel. Later, Rosen started a private aerospace firm called Volacom that specialized in high-altitude, hybrid-propulsion aircraft. In recognition of his groundbreaking work, Rosen received the National Medal of Technology in 1985, was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2003, and was the recipient of the Communications and Computing Prize from NEC in 1985 and the first L. M. Ericsson International Prize in Communications in 1976, among other honors. He was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers and the recipient of its Alexander Graham Bell Medal in 1982; a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; and a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and recipient of its Charles Stark Draper Prize in 1995. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Caltech in 1976. Rosen is survived by his wife Deborah Castleman (MS ’86); sons Robert and Rocky Rosen; grandchildren Josh, Hillary, and Stephanie Rosen; and his brother Ben.

Investors shifted their money to less risky investments for the second day in a row. For the second straight day, stocks started with substantial losses. Industrial companies, which have climbed lately, fell the most as UPS tumbled after a weak fourth-quarter report. Banks also slipped. Investors bid up assets that are traditionally seen as less risky, including gold, government bonds and stocks that pay big dividends. Drug companies also rallied after President Donald Trump met with industry executives and discussed ideas including faster drug approvals and lower taxes. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said investors are looking for safer investments because the change of administration has created so many changes in government. “More than anything right now, it’s just the pace of news,” he said. “It is so dramatic.” The stock market made huge gains after Trump was elected last fall, and Paulsen said it’s not a surprise that investors would sell some of their holdings, take some profits and move to lower-risk investments. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 107.04 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,864.09 as companies like Goldman Sachs and Boeing returned some of their recent gains. The S&P 500 lost 2.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,278.87. It fell as much as 13 points early on. The S&P 500 has fallen for four days in a row. While that is its longest losing streak since before the presidential election, the losses have been small. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.07 points to 5,614.79. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks rose than fell. United Parcel Service sank after the package delivery company forecast an annual profit that was far smaller than expected. UPS expects to earn no more than $6.10 a share this year. UPS gave up $7.90, or 6.8 percent, to $109.13 and FedEx fell $4.14, or 2.1 percent, to $189.11. That helped pull industrial companies lower. Drug companies jumped after Trump said he wants less regulation on prescriptions because that could speed up drug approvals.

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Editorial: Lead by example, Gov. Greitens. Show us the money. By the Editorial Board Jan 31, 2017 (…) David Carson Sheena Greitens and her husband Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens are introduced to the crowd during the Inaugural Ball at the State Capital in Jefferson City on Monday, Jan. 10, 2017. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Gov. Eric Greitens got off to a strong start on his campaign promise to clean up Missouri government, signing an executive order banning lobbyists’ gifts for executive-branch employees and barring anyone who works for him from using the revolving door to come back as a lobbyist. He even said in his first executive order that “this administration will lead by example in order to fundamentally change the culture in Jefferson City and throughout all of state government.” Note those key words: Lead by example. Polls show Missourians favor ethics reform and are eager to change the party culture in Jefferson City. What’s troubling is that Greitens apparently wants to apply this standard to everyone but himself. The Kansas City Star reported Friday that he has refused to say how much money was raised for his inaugural celebration or to list all donors and amounts they contributed. Greitens, who was sworn in Jan. 9, formed a nonprofit corporation to solicit contributions for the inauguration. Nonprofits organized as 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations are not required to disclose donors or comply with recent campaign donation limits. The last governor who did that was Bob Holden, a Democrat, whose $1 million inaugural in 2001 was the most expensive on record. Holden later made his fundraising details public. Democrat Jay Nixon and Republican Matt Blunt each spent less than $250,000 on their inaugurations and paid for them with campaign committee funds. Greitens’ inauguration was more elaborate, including a performance by country music star Sara Evans. He replaced the traditional parade with ceremonies honoring fallen veterans and first responders. Seated on the stage was controversial Silicon Valley investor Michael Goguen, who gave Greitens’ campaign $1 million. Goguen was forced to step down from his job at the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital after a woman sued him alleging he abused her during a 13-year relationship. He denies the allegations. Greitens, a Republican who campaigned as a political outsider determined to root out “corrupt, career politicians,” says nearly 100 “benefactors” contributed to his celebration. Among them were Anheuser-Busch, Boeing, Centene, Enterprise, Express Scripts, Kansas City Power & Light, Kansas City Southern, Monsanto, Pfizer, Wal-Mart and Uber — major companies with important pending business before the Legislature. Legislation affecting them, if passed, would make its way to Greitens to either sign or veto. Uber, a California-based ride-sharing company, is pushing legislation for the second time that would exempt the company from local and municipal taxes and potentially allow it to expand statewide. Missourians need to know who’s pulling the strings — not just in the Legislature but in Greitens’ office as well. Transparency is the only way Missourians can tell whether potential conflicts of interest exist. And whether Greitens truly leads by example or simply talks the talk. Editorial: Eric Greitens condemns backroom dealers, then hides in a back room Gov.-elect Eric Greitens issued a statement condemning St. Louis officials for “backroom wheeling and dealing” regarding public financing of a proposed soccer stadium. He talks about the need for open government. Yet when it comes to sharing the most basic information about his own transition plans, Greitens is a closed book.

A girl who is always in love with space, stars, astronomy will definitely spend time at observatories. That's what makes Noor Rashid different from others. She is the new face of the next generation of space engineers. She is an aerospace engineering student at the prestigious Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and doing exceptionally well. Her university in Arizona is the world's largest, fully accredited university specialising in aviation and aerospace. Noor is an Iraqi-American born and raised in Abu Dhabi. She wants to return to the UAE and use her experience at the UAE space agencies. Noor hopes the UAE will soon have its first UAE astronaut. Have you ever thought of being an astronaut? "No. I want to build something to help them, like satellite, space shuttles, rockets etc. I am getting my private pilot licence." She likes to do her internship in the UAE and also wishes to work here. "My faculty has at least 20 years of industry experience and I can bring that all to table here. I see myself working at the UAE Space Agency," Noor added. Though the UAE, a new player in space sector has got ambitious plans with Mars 'Hope' Mission 2020, there is a worrying factor- There is a dearth of young talents in the country to give wings to this dream. Dr Mohammed Al Ahbabi, director general of UAE Space Agency told Khaleej Times steps are afoot to 'prepare' the next generation of space engineers with scholarships and awareness drive. It is in this light that young scientists like Noor Rashid breathes new hope. Speaking from her flat in the Capital, Noor said: "The UAE Space Agency was created when I started my university. I want many different things to happen in the UAE." She walks the talk too. Noor is on Honor Roll and Dean's List every semester of her four-year course at the university that's called 'the Harvard of the sky'. She is a double minor in technical intelligence and math, and has year-and-half left in her course. In the first semester, she was among select four research-team members in the Society of Women Engineers. "We did research about aerodynamic wings, body and efficiency of wings etc." Talking about a project, she said: "We once build a rover that could work in the moon. We did it perfectly with zero gravity tyres and all." As for fun work, "we built International Space Station out of ice sticks as an after school activity," she said. Her school is affiliated with Nasa, Honeywell, Boeing and Lockheed Martin. She feels the UAE should enter into a partnership with her school, which will help bring more people into this field. "I always wanted to know what's out there because we don't know everything. The earth is very small compared to the whole universe." She also likes other topics. During her school days at the British School - Al Khubairat, she had attended 2011 Global Teen Summit in Seattle on alternative energy. ashwani@khaleejtimes.com Ashwani Kumar Share More > Vote ERROR: Macro /ads/dfp-ads is missing!

Spirit's shares were down 4.59 percent to $57.30 in morning trading. Quarterly revenue was hurt by lower "pricing terms" for Boeing's 787 program and fewer production deliveries on the 747 and 777 programs, Spirit said in a statement. Boeing, which accounts for 84 percent of Spirit's revenue, cut production of its cash cow 777 jetliner by 40 percent this year as it focuses on newer models. Spirit Aero also forecast 2017 profit and revenue below analysts' estimates. The company said it expected full-year earnings of $4.60-$4.85 per share and revenue of $6.8 billion-$6.9 billion. Analysts on average were expecting 2017 earnings of $4.86 per share and revenue of $6.92 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for the quarter fell 2.4 percent to $1.57 billion, missing analysts' estimate of $1.60 billion. Net income fell to $108.2 million, or 89 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $138.3 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. The company said its net income included a charge of 14 cents per share related to severe weather event and voluntary retirement program. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.03 per share. Up to Tuesday's close, Spirit shares had risen 2.9 percent this year, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. aerospace and defense index.

The Adonia, operated by Carnival Corporation’s Fathom brand, is scheduled to continue cruises to Cuba every other week through the last week in May. Havana is also on the itinerary for sailings from Florida in April and May aboard Royal Caribbean’s Empress of the Seas ship and in May on Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Sky. Long-term prospects for cruises and other forms of travel from the U.S. to Cuba remain uncertain under the new administration of President Donald Trump. (Desmond Boylan, File/Associated Press) By Beth J. Harpaz | AP By Beth J. Harpaz | AP January 31 NEW YORK — A demand for more in-depth experiences — from learning how to scuba dive to dining in a private home in port — are shaping what’s new in the cruise industry this year. Other cruise news: a boom in Alaska trips, a few precious sailings to Cuba and potentially game-changing new technology. HIGH SEAS, HIGH TECH Princess Cruises will debut a coin-sized medallion in November aboard the Regal Princess that could dramatically change guest experiences. Passengers will carry or wear the medallion, which will direct them to their cabins, unlock their doors as they approach and alert crew members to their schedules and preferences, whether it’s a class they’ve signed up for or a favorite cocktail. It will also streamline getting on and off the ship. ALASKA Alaska expects 1.06 million cruise passengers this year, likely breaking its 2008 record of 1.03 million visits. The Alaska Travel Industry Association says larger ships are bringing more visitors, and destinations like Sitka, Juneau and Icy Strait Point have built out piers to accommodate bigger vessels. Smaller ships are simultaneously expanding service, specializing in more remote destinations the bigger ships can’t reach. Holland America Line marks its 70th year of exploring Alaska with the redeployment of its Oosterdam ship from Europe to Alaska. Seabourn, a small-ship line, returns to Alaska in June for the first time in 15 years. Lindblad launches a new ship, National Geographic Quest, whose itineraries will include Alaska. Carnival Miracle will do a 14-day round-trip to Alaska from Long Beach, California, that will include Carnival Cruise Line’s first-ever call at Icy Strait Point. Crystal Cruises, which last summer sailed the largest luxury passenger vessel ever through the Northwest Passage, offers a repeat trip from Anchorage on Aug. 15. In 2018, Norwegian Cruise Line will launch Norwegian Bliss, a ship custom-built for Alaska trips. CUBA Long-term prospects for travel from the U.S. to Cuba remain uncertain under the new presidential administration. But for now, a number of cruises are scheduled through spring. Havana is on the itinerary for sailings from Florida in April and May aboard Royal Caribbean’s Empress of the Seas, and in May on Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Sky. The Fathom brand continues seven-night sailings to Cuba every other week through May. NEW EXPERIENCES ONBOARD AND ONSHORE Royal Caribbean is the only cruise line offering scuba-diving certification through the Professional Association of Diving Instructors. Passengers begin the course at home online, continue lessons in a ship pool and finish with four mandatory open-water dives in ports of call. Carnival Cruise Line is offering longer sailings of nine to 15 days with options for more immersive and adventurous experiences beyond beaches and bars. Passengers might visit a school in Mexico or get a home-cooked meal at a private house in Jamaica. “People are looking for meaningful experiences,” said Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer De La Cruz. MSC Cruises launches a wellness experience in April with personalized health assessments and fitness programs, along with a Weight Watchers cruise from Miami to the Caribbean in May. Princess is expanding Discovery at Sea offerings for kids with new programming such as MythBusters science activities and destination-themed programs on culture and nature. Princess is also featuring a new show, “Born to Dance,” produced with famed composer Stephen Schwartz, paying tribute to Broadway’s greatest choreographers and dancers. Holland America Line’s new programs include cooking shows and workshops in partnership with “America’s Test Kitchen,” plus Rijksmuseum at Sea, with interactive displays about the famed Amsterdam museum as a tie-in to the cruise line’s Dutch heritage. HAL has also just rolled out a partnership with BBC Earth, with games, activities and live concerts during screenings showing wildlife and wilderness. Norwegian Cruise Line has opened a new private destination in southern Belize called Harvest Caye with a beach, villas for daily rental, a lagoon for canoeing and kayaking, and “Flighthouse” with a zip line, ropes course and more. The port also makes it easy for guests to explore Belize on shore excursions. Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 this year offers trans-Atlantic cruises themed on space exploration and fashion. Disney Cruise Line will offer Marvel Day at Sea programs featuring Marvel Comics characters in activities, shows, parties and films on seven sailings on Disney Magic from New York City this fall. NEW SHIPS In November, Royal Caribbean debuted the world’s largest cruise ship, Harmony of the Seas, with a 5,479-passenger capacity, two 10-story enclosed dry slides and an escape game room. This year Viking Cruises adds two more ocean-going ships, Viking Sky and Viking Sun, with the Sun embarking on Viking’s first-ever world cruise, 141 days long, in December. Viking is also adding two new river ships, Viking Herja and Viking Hild. Crystal Cruises not only launches two new river ships this summer, Crystal Bach and Crystal Mahler, but the cruise line is debuting AirCruises on a private Boeing jet that will take guests around the world, starting with a 27-day, $159,000 trip. “The world is getting wealthier and the wealthy want to travel,” said Crystal CEO Edie Rodriguez. Silversea Cruises launches Silver Muse in April with eight dining venues including a jazz club and Hot Rocks, where guests can cook their own meat, fish and vegetables tableside. Silversea’s refurbishment of Silver Cloud as an ice-class expedition ship will be done in November, in time for 11 Antarctic and eight Arctic trips in 2018. In July, American Queen Steamboat launches American Duchess, the first contemporary boutique paddle-wheeler vessel built for Mississippi River cruises. The company already operates American Queen on the Mississippi and American Empress in the Pacific Northwest. ___ This story has been corrected to show the name of the Viking Cruises ship is Viking Sky, not Viking Sea.
