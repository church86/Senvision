The name evokes an image of a little fighter jet taking on America’s giant Boeing B-52 bomber. But actually, the name “Boeing Killer” refers to a rather dubious accomplishment of the Su-15: shooting down two Boeing civilian airliners, including Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983. It’s the title of the 2015 book Sukhoi Su-15: The Boeing Killer by Yefim Gordon, perhaps the most prolific historian of Soviet military aircraft. The Su-15, NATO code name “Flagon,” began life in the early 1960s, when the Sukhoi design bureau was in trouble. The engines of its single-engine Su-9 “Fishpot” and Su-11 “Fishpot-C” air-defense interceptors had proven unreliable. The Soviet air defense command (PVO) wanted twin-engined interceptors such as the Yakovlev-28 “Firebar"and Tupolev-128 “Fiddler,” which were thought to be more reliable. At the same time, the United States was deploying the high-altitude B-52 Stratofortress and the (never-built) Mach 3 B-70 Valkyrie. Sukhoi proposed a twin-engined Mach-2 interceptor armed with better radar and two AA-3 “Anab” air-to-air guided missiles. Like many Soviet interceptors, the Flagon was a something of a manned missile, with ground control expected to guide the aircraft close enough to the target to use its onboard radar and missiles. The Soviets feared they would face both slow, high-flying bombers, which interceptors could attack from behind, and fast Mach 2 bombers (like the U.S. B-58 Hustler), according to Gordon’s book. “Without a significant advantage in speed the interceptor stood no chance of destroying such targets in pursuit mode; hence high-speed targets were to be intercepted in head-on mode, and both tactics would be used against slower aircraft.” For high-flying targets above the Su-15’s maximum ceiling of sixty thousand feet, the interceptor ascend into a zoom climb and then fire missiles from below. “The military was not entirely happy with the performance of the production Su-15,” Gordon notes. There were problems with the flight controls and engines. Just as crucial, its radar lacked a “look down” capability to detect the new generation of low-flying bombers. Still, some 1,290 were built between 1965 and 1979, becoming one of PVO’s primary interceptors. It complemented the speedier MiG-25 “Foxbat,” with the latter used to intercept faster bombers. The Flagon was retired in Russian service in 1993, though it flew on for the Ukrainian Air Force until 1996. The Su-15 never saw combat with other warplanes (and neither did its U.S. counterpart, the F-106, though its predecessor the F-102 did see combat in Vietnam). But as a primary air defense fighter during the Cold War, it was involved in many intercepts of aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace. On July 18, 1981, a Canadair CL-44 freighter, flown by an Argentine crew, crossed the Iranian border into Soviet territory. Its mission was to carry Israeli arms to Iran to sustain Iran’s war with Iraq. The CL-44 was intercepted by an Su-15, which signaled the intruder to land. What happened next is debated. The Flagon pilot claimed that he was unable to fire a missile before the freighter left Soviet airspace, and therefore rammed the CL-44, causing it to crash. (However, American aviation historian James Oberg suggests the Soviet pilot accidentally collided with his target and covered up the mistake.) And the “Boeing Killer” moniker? On April 20, 1978, a Korean Air Lines 707 en route from Paris to Seoul entered Soviet airspace near Murmansk. It was intercepted by an Su-15. The Soviets claimed the plane was on a spy mission and ignored commands to land. The South Koreans claimed it was an accidental overflight and the Soviets were trigger-happy. Regardless of the reason, the Su-15 fired two R-60 missiles, one of which hit. The Korean pilot managed to land the 707 on a frozen lake, but two people were killed. The next incident was the most notorious in the history of the Su-15—and Soviet air defense. On September 1, 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007, en route from Seoul to Tokyo, entered Soviet airspace over Sakhalin Island near Japan. The 747 was intercepted by Su-15s, which fired warning shots (the shells were invisible in the darkness to the Korean pilots because the interceptors’ cannon lacked tracer rounds). Before the 747 left Soviet airspace, the Su-15s were ordered to shoot it down. Hit by two missiles, the airliner crashed, killing all 269 passengers and crew (including a hawkish U.S. congressman who was president of the John Birch Society). The Soviets claimed KAL 707 was on a spy mission and ignored orders to land, but President Ronald Reagan denounced the incident as Soviet barbarism. Ilya Grinberg, who writes on Soviet aviation history, doubts that the Soviets referred to the Su-15 as the “Boeing Killer.” “Soviet aircraft did not have such nicknames,” he told the National Interest. “They would be called affectionate names like ‘Sushka’ [‘biscuit’] and ‘Sukharik’ [‘crouton’] for the Su- types.” Unfortunately for the luckless Flagon, it became famous for another reason. It was an Su-15 that collided in 1968 with a MiG-15 flown by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. The collision killed the first human being to fly into outer space.

Trump, who as a candidate said he didn’t think the bank needed to exist, named former New Jersey Representative Scott Garrett, one of the biggest recipients of Wall Street donations among House members, to be the bank’s chairman and president. He tapped former Alabama Representative Spencer Bachus for a seat on the bank’s board of directors. Both positions require Senate confirmation. Trump hinted at a shift in his position on Ex-Im during an interview on April 12. “Actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money; it can make a lot of money,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies.” In 2015, Trump told Bloomberg that the bank’s role amounted to “featherbedding” for some politicians and companies. They guarantee loans for international buyers of products from US companies. Boeing Co Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg is said to have helped change the president’s view of the agency. Boeing is by far the largest beneficiary of the bank among exporters, to the tune of several billion dollars annually, followed by General Electric Co. No quorum Small-government conservatives shut down the bank in 2015 by blocking its reauthorisation. While the bank was revived, its five-member board has lacked a quorum, which restricted it from granting loans of more than US$10 million. Former President Barack Obama’s late-term nominees were blocked by Senate Republicans, including Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. In Garrett, Trump has chosen a critic of a government agency to run it — similar to his appointment of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. “The Export-Import Bank’s long legacy of crony capitalism has hurt the livelihoods and businesses of many Americans who don’t get special treatment from this misguided government programme,” Garrett said in a 2015 statement. Conservative groups, including Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity, oppose the bank for similar reasons. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, urged senators to reject Garrett’s nomination because of his past stance. ‘Act of sabotage’ “In Scott Garrett, the president has nominated someone who helped lead the charge to shut down the Export-Import Bank in Congress against a super-majority that was in favour of keeping it open so it could continue creating and supporting American jobs and exports,” Hoyer said in a statement. “If former Representative Garrett is confirmed to lead the Bank, it would be the ultimate act of sabotage.” Garrett, 57, failed to win re-election in 2016 after seven terms in Congress. He lost the backing of major Wall Street donors after a report that he’d told fellow Republican lawmakers he wouldn’t give money to the party’s congressional campaign arm because it supported openly gay candidates. Bachus, a former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has previously supported the Ex-Im bank, sponsoring a 2012 law that reauthorized the bank. Bachus retired from Congress in 2015. Backers of the bank say that most of its lending supports small and medium-sized businesses. In fiscal 2014, the bank’s last full year of operation, it backed US$27.5 billion in exports — somewhat less than 2 per cent of the US total. This financing supported 164,000 American jobs that year, according to the bank, and about 90 per cent of the bank’s deals helped small businesses. The US Chamber of Commerce has pushed for the bank’s lending powers to be fully restored, saying that without it, jobs might be lost to competitors in China or Russia. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump pick for Export-Import Bank is critical of its mission Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Bursa Malaysia to consolidate next week Mercosur to sign trade deal with EU this year, Argentina says Ringgit expected to climb against US dollar Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Village Grocer buys up Ben’s Independent Grocer Petronas pitches RM4.4b offshore gas project stake to oil firms, sources say Demand for Malaysian palm oil set to rebound, says Council United Airlines CEO won’t resign Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Greek Orthodox Patriarch leads Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem Reuters Video: Beating climate-change odds, a wolverine is born in Belgium Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles In about-face, Trump nominates new head of export bank Obama to US business-owners: Press congress to renew Ex-Im Bank Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Boeing's 737 MAX 9, a fuel-efficient, long-range successor to the 737-900, made its initial flight, a test mission, about 50 years after the 737 first took to the skies on April 9, 1967, and follows the first flight of Boeing's largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, last month, from its factory in South Carolina. The new models are coming to market just as demand for aircraft has slowed. Boeing has committed to making four new 737 versions and is considering a bigger version than the MAX 9, known as the 737 MAX 10X. It could begin delivering that version in 2020 if airlines start ordering it this year, with China emerging as a promising market, said Michael Teal, 737 MAX chief project engineer and deputy programme manager. With the MAX 9 in the air, Boeing is turning more attention to the larger version. It began pre-marketing the plane this year but has yet to formally launch development of the jetliner, which would compete against the popular Airbus A321neo. Teal said the design of the 737 MAX 10X would be firmed up by the end of this year and customers could receive the aircraft in 2020, depending on orders. "We'll determine (the delivery date) when we launch that programme when the customers show the interest and they buy the airplane," he said on a conference call with reporters. CHINA "The China market and airlines there are very interested in the (MAX) 9 and 10 depending on their needs," said Teal. "We're looking at putting together deals for the China market today on both the 9 and the 10." Boeing said in March it had approached India's SpiceJet and Jet Airways about the MAX 10X, which its marketing chief says would offer the best efficiency in that part of the market, a claim Airbus rejects. However, the heads of two major aircraft leasing companies have voiced scepticism about the appeal of the MAX 10X and suggested it would eat into rentals of other MAX models. The 737 MAX 10X would be 66 inches (167 centimetres) longer than the current largest family member, the 737 MAX 9, and add 12 seats. It would require longer landing gear as a result. Teal said the landing gear was still in the development stage, with several concepts in prototype testing. "We won't hit the firm configuration on the gear and, really, the complete airplane until the end of this year," he said. "All of the development tests are proving positive and we are well on our way to firming up that configuration and moving forward into production." The first 737 MAX 9 customer delivery is expected next year, while the first 737 MAX 8 should be delivered next month. "We start with several airplanes in May, more in June and more in July and we start the ramp-up from there," Teal said.

REUTERS/Alwyn Scott U.S. President Trump takes questions during news conference at the White House in Washington prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, his office said, a victory for American manufacturers like Boeing Co and General Electric Co which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump first told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill two vacancies on the agency's five-member board that have prevented the bank from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over US$10 million. Trump's picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. Trump told the Journal that the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank being "featherbedding" for wealthy corporations. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enables them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank’s acting chairman, Charles “CJ” Hall, was not immediately available for comment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who have worked in Congress to kill the bank, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump's about-face on the export bank comes after meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation's aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Trump also met at the White House on Feb. 23 with GE CEO Jeff Immelt and Caterpillar Inc CEO Mark Sutton, both vocal supporters of the bank. It is not known if they discussed the bank at those meetings. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. "This is an encouraging development on a key competitive issue for U.S manufacturers and their extensive supply chains," Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said in statement to Reuters. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which includes companies like Ingersoll-Rand Plc , United States Steel Corp and Pfizer Inc , cheered the move. “Manufacturers are encouraged by President Trump’s vocal support for the bank,” said NAM Vice President of International Economic Affairs Linda Dempsey in a statement. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank's charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines. Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, two groups funded by the Republican donor Koch brothers, worked aggressively for years to kill the bank. Brothers Charles and David Koch have opposed the bank for what they call damaging interference into the free market by government. Nathan Nascimento, Freedom Partners vice president of policy, called the bank on Wednesday "the epitome of what's wrong with Washington." "Reopening the flood gates to Ex-Im’s corporate welfare is a bad deal for hardworking taxpayers and a bad deal for American businesses,” he said. The Club for Growth, which spends heavily in electing conservative candidates and was one of the few groups to campaign against Trump during the Republican primary in 2016, also lamented the change in position. "Ex-Im has a long history of cronyism and corruption that is well-known to many in the Trump Administration, and while we hoped it would be done away with, the administration now has taken on the almost impossible challenge of reforming a federal agency whose mission has been to pick winners and losers with taxpayer dollars," spokesman Doug Sachtleben said in a statement to Reuters.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 15, 2017 at 10:13AM It's been nearly a year now since Boeing (NYSE:BA) Executive Vice President Leanne Caret laid out her new plan for Boeing's defense business. With fighter-jet sales on the wane, Boeing would shift its emphasis to servicing and upgrading fighters it had already built. New plane sales, on the other hand, would lean toward auxiliary aircraft such as KC-46 fuel tankers and P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine warfare jets. Over the ensuing 10 months, of course, Boeing has notched a number of important victories that may spell a reprieve for its fighter jets business -- including the order for a round dozen F/A-18 Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers the Pentagon placed just a few weeks ago. But here's the really good news for Boeing: Whether or not those fighter-jet contracts keep coming, the company's auxiliary military aircraft business is flying high. Boeing's Poseidon is king of the sea -- and king of sales. Image source: Getty Images. Case in point Take last month, for instance. In its daily digest of contracts awarded, on March 30, 2017, the U.S. Pentagon announced that Boeing has won a massive $2.2 billion deal to sell 17 new P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft. Of these, 11 will go to the U.S. Navy, and six more to foreign buyers. With deliveries running through December 2020, this contract promises to add nearly $700 million to Boeing's annual revenue each and every year for the next three years. And that's not all. Fact is, Boeing's Poseidons have been selling like proverbial hotcakes, with: Five P-8A Poseidons heading for Norway in a $1.75 billion sale last year. Nine more Poseidons destined for the U.K. in a $3.2 billion deal, also last year. Eight more Poseidons going down under to Australia (this one dates from 2014) -- garnering another $3.6 billion for Boeing. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy continues buying these planes in batches. The other big order placed in 2014 was for 16 new P-8A Poseidons going to the Navy in a $2.1 billion contract. It's all part and parcel of a string of sales successes that have seen Boeing book no fewer than 55 orders for its new sub-hunter -- $12.8 billion worth of orders in all. Boeing Stock Market capitalization $108.6 billion Revenue $94.6 billion Net profit $4.9 billion DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. What it means to Boeing Although not all this Poseidon revenue will come in one year, the sum of all these contracts adds up to more than 13.5% of Boeing's annual sales -- a sizable pile of money, when you consider that less than one-third of Boeing's sales in any given year come from military aircraft. Even more important, though, is the margins that Boeing earns on these sales. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing sales of commercial aircraft average less than 4.8% in operating profit margin for the company. The only reason Boeing as a whole earns 7.2% operating profit margins, therefore, is the supersized margins it gets from the "defense, space, and security" wing of its business -- and in particular the company's military aircraft division, which builds the Poseidon. There, profit margin runs in excess of 9.8% -- more than twice the margin Boeing earns on its civilian planes. Boeing Stock Price-to-earnings ratio 23.1 Price-to-free cash flow 13.6 Price-to-sales 1.1 Projected 5-year growth rate 16.5% Dividend yield 3.2% DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCE, S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE. Should you buy Boeing stock? Now what does all this mean to investors? With a P/E of 23.1, Boeing stock looks richly valued -- but only at first glance. I prefer to value the company not just on its GAAP "earnings," but also on its actual production of cash profits -- free cash flow. And from this perspective, Boeing stock still doesn't look overpriced to me. To the contrary, adding Boeing's profits growth of 16.5% to the company's dividend yield of 3.2%, I come up with a total return of 19.7% on Boeing stock. Divide that into the stock's 13.6 P/FCF ratio, and you get a total return ratio -- P/FCF/G -- of less than 0.7. While I admit to some concern about the high P/E and the also somewhat elevated P/S ratio at Boeing, when it's valued on free cash flow I still think there's a case to be made that Boeing stock is both cheap and "buyable" -- at least, as long as the Poseidon sales keep rolling in.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Congressman wanted to kill scott garrett Former Rep. Scott Garrett. (Express-Times file photo) Print Email Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 15, 2017 at 9:08 AM comments WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday nominated ex-Rep. Scott Garrett to become president of the Export-Import Bank, an agency the former lawmaker once called "the epitome of crony capitalism." Garrett and other House Republican conservatives fought the bank, which provides government-backed loans to help U.S. businesses sell their products overseas. Last year, the bank helped support $8 billion in U.S. exports and an estimated 52,000 U.S. jobs, according to its annual report. Trump filled a second vacancy on the bank board by nominating former Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.). Both nominations must be ratified by the Senate. N.J. race could be national bellwether  Like Garrett, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus of conservative lawmakers, Trump opposed the Export-Import Bank during the campaign. But he told the Wall Street Journal earlier in the week that he would support the bank. Among the biggest beneficiaries of the bank is Boeing Co., which contributed $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Garrett last year criticized Boeing's multimillion-dollar deal to sell its airplanes to Iran after economic sanctions were lifted in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. "This agreement between Boeing and the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism is extremely troubling and shows that crony capitalism remains alive and well in Washington," Garrett said in June 2016. "Not only has Boeing lobbied for years to keep the taxpayer-backed Export Import Bank alive, it now has also used its powerful position to take advantage of the ill-conceived nuclear deal with Iran.  This agreement is bad news, not just for taxpayers but for our national security." Garrett lost his bid for an eighth term to Democrat Josh Gottheimer in New Jersey's 5th Congressional District last November in a bitter, hard-fought race. Gottheimer raised more in campaign donations than any other House candidate ever in the state. Meanwhile, Garrett was forced on the defensive early following reported remarks that he would not contribute to the House Republicans' fundraising arm because it supported gay candidates. Garrett later said he was referring only to candidates who did not support the Republican platform's opposition to same-sex marriage. Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com.

April 2017 The Hønefoss company, Norwegian Titanium, will supply components for Boeing that are made with a 3D printer. The company is steeply increasing its production in the United States. Advertisement Norwegian Titanium’s structural components are approved by the Federal Aviation Authority FAA, and the company will be the first in the world to deliver parts approved in such a way to Boeing, the world’s largest aircraft manufacturers. ‘We are proud to take this historic step together with an aviation innovator such as Boeing. We will continue to expand the portfolio of products we deliver to Boeing in line with strict safety and legal requirements. It is an honour to receive FAA approval for these components’, said Norwegian Titanium boss,Warren M. Boley, on their website. The Norwegian Titanium components are to be used in Boeing’s prestige model, Dreamliner. The parts will first be produced in Norway, but the company plans to sharply expand capacity at its factory in the US state of New York. ‘We put the first machine in place in Plattsburgh recently, and we have three machines in Norway. During the year, we will move production of Boeing here, and towards the end of the year we will have nine machines in operation here, said marketing director, Chip Yates, to a local North American radio station.   Source: NTB scanpix / Norway Today Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Related SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Next post Related Articles Finance Meat consumption is growing despite climate risks News Distance to delivery room essential News Young offenders commit new crimes while awaiting penalty News The police requests suspended sentence for 16-year-old who filmed sex Be the first to comment on "Norwegian company with Boeing contract expands in the USA" Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Boeing’s first 737 MAX 9 jet takes off on its first test flight from the company’s plant in Renton, Wash. (Boeing Photo / Craig Larsen) The newest sibling in Boeing’s 737 family, the MAX 9, made its first flight today from the company’s assembly plant in Renton, Wash. – 75 years after the Renton plant opened and 50 years after the first 737 took off. The 737 MAX 9’s maiden flight began in Renton at 10:52 a.m. PT and ended a little less than three hours later at Seattle’s Boeing Field, after test pilots put the plane through a series of test maneuvers that ranged from Washington’s Olympic Peninsula to the Spokane Indian Reservation. You can find a recap the flight on Boeing’s website. Today’s takeoff marked the beginning of a flight test schedule that will continue for months, based at Boeing Field. First deliveries of the MAX 9 are scheduled in 2018. The first 737 MAX, the “Dash-8,” took to the air from Renton a little more than 14 months ago. The MAX variant of the time-honored 737 family is designed to be 14 percent more fuel-efficient than the previous generation of the single-aisle jet, thanks to design tweaks as well as the MAX’s LEAP-1B engines. The MAX 9 is a stretch version of the MAX 8. It can accommodate 178 to 220 passengers and has a range of 3,515 nautical miles, with further range improvements to come. In 2019, Boeing plans to introduce the smaller MAX 7 and the higher-capacity MAX 200. There’s also talk of a larger MAX 10X that could make its debut by as early as 2020. Boeing says the 737 MAX is the fastest-selling airplane in the company’s history, accumulating more than 3,700 orders to date from 86 customers worldwide. But the jet is facing tough competition from Airbus’ A320neo series, which has racked up more than 5,000 orders to date. Since the first 737 takeoff in 1967, the jet has become the world’s best-selling commercial passenger airplane, with more than 9,400 deliveries to its name. That first production 737 is now part of the Museum of Flight’s collection in Seattle. It's a success!

Matt Hayes poses with an intact Apollo-era F1 rocket engine at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. (Courtesy of Matt Hayes) As a young boy growing up in rural Western New York, Matt Hayes had an interest in aviation and astronomy that had him flying airplanes by the time he was 16. Life has not stopped moving since, he said, and years later Hayes still looks to the sky for inspiration as executive vice president of Seattle’s Museum of Flight. Hayes, who is GeekWire’s latest Geek of the Week, first came to Seattle in 1995 — he drove out in a 1965 Buick in time to witness the Mariners historic playoff run. Putting to use an accounting degree, he spent nine years with a big firm before becoming involved with non-profits as work and as a volunteer.  The advances, the excitement, the potential, the innovation, the wild-eyed optimism that is becoming reality … it’s exciting to be witness to and it’s a turning point in mankind’s place in the world. For almost 10 years he helped to restore the Museum of Flight’s Boeing B-17 from World War II. “Spending Saturday after Saturday under their tutelage, I learned a lot about life (and bending sheet metal) from WWII veterans, former engineers, and Rosie the Riveters,” Hayes said. “I wouldn’t trade those days, those busted knuckles, and those conversations for anything.” Hayes said the Seattle area and aviation has had a profound impact on him — one of the first things he did when he moved to the area was take a tour of Boeing’s Everett plant. “Being a pilot of small aircraft and flying over some of the most devastatingly beautiful landscapes in the world is something that I craved on the day I flew over Washington and still crave today,” Hayes said. At the museum, Hayes is now on the front lines of an exciting new period, especially when it comes to the prospect of space travel and the Seattle-area companies that are involved. “One could argue that what is happening today with Blue Origin, SpaceX, Boeing, and so many others is commiserate with what happened years ago in Silicon Valley and the PC,” Hayes said. “The advances, the excitement, the potential, the innovation, the wild-eyed optimism that is becoming reality … it’s exciting to be witness to and it’s a turning point in mankind’s place in the world. And in a way, it’s the continuation of centuries of looking to the stars, so to speak. And that is my love … the history of aviation and the future of flight coming together.” Learn more about this week’s Geek of the Week, Matt Hayes: What do you do, and why do you do it? “As a lifelong fan of both aviation and history, I have the amazing and distinct privilege to work alongside hundreds of fellow employees and volunteers to operate the foremost educational air and space museum in the world. Whether it’s preserving and sharing the staggeringly incredible history of flight or providing high school and college credit to young people in desperately needed STEM fields, the Museum strives to always serve the community. For me, it’s an amazing convergence of personal interest, a sense of purpose, and the ability to meet and learn from inspiring and innovative people every day.” What’s the single most important thing people should know about your field? “First, people can come to the Museum any day to have a great time and learn something new. But in addition, at a place like ours, both adults and children can engage over the long term and this can have a tangible impact on their lives. For example, this can happen through their career choices or by being a more informed citizen making life decisions knowing how the world works and how history and science informs the future. Secondly, taking possession of something in a Museum means you are agreeing to care for it in perpetuity…forever and that’s mighty long time. It’s also an awesome, wonderful, and noble responsibility. Finally, geek culture couldn’t be stronger than in the aviation and space worlds. And they are — we are — as excited about the Wright Brothers as we are about nano-space satellites.” Where do you find your inspiration? “People, people, people. Looking at the world as a whole can be tough to swallow at times. But take a look at the person sitting next to you or the person who just came through the door and more often than not, you can see all that is good and amazing and interesting. The people that work for, volunteer with, and visit the Museum are dedicated folks with fabulous ideas, passion, and stories.” What’s the one piece of technology you couldn’t live without, and why? “The wing. Without it, I would not have a hobby or a way to easily visit my family. Or a job.” What’s your workspace like, and why does it work for you? “My work world is filled with some of the most amazing flying inventions – life sized and real – that humankind ever devised. My office is standard, except that the Blue Angels or Air Force One sometimes lands right outside my window. My space is way too messy and usually has people in it and music in the background. That is unless it’s between April and October and it’s after 4:05. Then the Red Sox are on the radio. And I was just gifted a real “panic” button from a World War II bomber that is conveniently within reach of my office chair. Just in case, of course.” Matt Hayes works on the Boeing B-17 at the Museum of Flight. (Courtesy of Matt Hayes) Your best tip or trick for managing everyday work and life. (Help us out, we need it.) “Remember that people are at the heart of it all, and they are individuals. Remember not to let the urgent get in the way of the important. Remember to learn and grow and change, but never to stop being yourself. Changing your core is not worth it, regardless of what ‘it’ is.” Mac, Windows or Linux? “Windows.” Kirk, Picard, or Janeway? “I don’t think any of them were truly pilots, so maybe I’ll go with Snoopy or Han Solo.” Transporter, Time Machine or Cloak of Invisibility? “I work at a Museum … how could I not choose the time machine. Plus, we already have airplanes and they are types of transporters. And Wonder Woman’s invisible jet can act as my cloak anytime.” If someone gave me $1 million to launch a startup, I would … “Find someone that was great at thinking about startups and tell them to do something good for the world. I’ve already got a job I love that keeps me more than busy.” I once waited in line for … “an airshow in Hamilton, Ontario. Flying was as important to me as a kid as it is now. One of the aircraft that flew in that show sits in our Museum today.” Your role models: “My parents, as they somehow (mostly through example) taught about why and how to be a good person. And volunteers of all stripes. To selflessly give back — by giving of yourself — and to have it be personally fulfilling at the same time, seems to me to be at the tip top of Maslow’s and maybe 10 other pyramids.” Greatest game in history: “Game 7 of the 2004 American League Championship Series.” Best gadget ever: “I’m not a smoker, but matches and lighters have to be high up there. Or on the flip side, the smoke detector.” First computer: “In 6th grade with a friend, I made a keyboard from scratch for someone else’s TRS-80. I didn’t have a computer at the time, but man was that the greatest keyboard ever.” Current phone: “Motorola something.” Favorite app: “FlightAware. And Major League Baseball Audio.” Favorite cause: “Senior Services of Seattle & King County (now Sound Generations).” Most important technology of 2016: “The drone.” Most important technology of 2018: “Reusable commercial space vehicles.” Final words of advice for your fellow geeks: “Simultaneously celebrating the geek wonder of today alongside the geek wonder of yesterday is something everyone should do. Together the sum is greater than the individual parts.” Website: Museum of Flight Twitter: @museumofflight LinkedIn: Matt Hayes Geek of the Week profiles the characters of Pacific Northwest tech, science, games, innovation and more.

Sunday, April 16, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets Big business cronies rally to protect Export-Import Bank by Veronique de Rugy | Apr 24, 2014, 12:00 AM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn Employees work on the Boeing 777 assembly line June 13, 2012 at the Boeing Factory in Everett, Washington. (Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) The Export-Import Bank of the United States -- informally known as the “Ex-Im Bank,” but irreverently referred to as “Boeing's Bank” behind closed doors -- is hosting a ritzy conference for power players in Washington this week. It's another exercise in willful deception. Bank beneficiaries and bureaucrats will attempt to conceal their blatant cronyism from the public with misleading platitudes about protecting U.S. exports, job creation, and in particular small businesses. Here's an example: “In FY 2013, Ex-Im Bank approved more than $27 billion in total authorizations to support an estimated $37.4 billion in U.S. export sales and approximately 205,000 American jobs in communities across the country. For the year, the Bank approved a record 3,413 transactions, or 89 percent, for small businesses.” Sounds pretty impressive, no? Americans know small businesses struggle in this uncertain economy, and are understandably inclined to view the bank’s operations in a more positive light when they hear statements like that. There’s one big problem: The claim is misleading. It's true that small businesses account for 89 percent of the total number of deals. But the value of those deals tells a different story. For fiscal year 2013, for instance, only $5.2 billion of the $27.3 billion in total authorization amounts, or 19 percent, was designated as “small business” activity on the Ex-Im Bank's annual report. The bank is also pretty fast and loose with its definition of “small business" to include manufacturing and wholesale firms with 500 to 1,500 employees. Other sectors can contain “small businesses” that earn annual revenues of up to $21.5 million. For instance, in the general construction sector, a firm counts as "small" if it earns anywhere between $13.5 million and $17 million a year. The organization’s definition of “small business” is more expansive than the Small Business Administration’s. With few exceptions, the SBA sets their threshold at 500 employees and average annual receipts at $7 million — considerably smaller than the bank’s. Other government institutions like the Federal Reserve adhere to the SBA’s definitions — thus raising the question of why the Ex-Im Bank in particular found it necessary to create their own standards. It is clear that what is a “small business” to the Ex-Im Bank is not what most Americans think of when they hear the term. Perhaps this can be explained by Ex-Im’s long history of rubbing elbows with the big guys. The Ex-Im Bank has been in the “big business” business for so long it can’t distinguish a publicly traded corporation from a local coffee shop. In truth, the bank's main beneficiaries are giant manufacturing conglomerates and aerospace contractors. The bank's main customer happens to be America's No. 1 exporter and manufacturing giant: Boeing. According to the bank's data, in fiscal year 2013, Boeing procured roughly 66 percent of Ex-Im's loan guarantees. Ex-Im reports that Boeing was designated primary exporter for 55 deals (including insurance, loans, and guarantees) valued at roughly $8.3 billion in total assistance. Sometimes, the bank doesn’t report where the money goes at all. The second-largest exporting beneficiary, topping off at $2.9 billion in Ex-Im assistance in fiscal 2013, is simply labeled as "unknown." And the top 10 exporter beneficiaries received roughly 75 percent of total assistance last year. Diane Katz, a Heritage Foundation regulatory research fellow, assembled a helpful list of some of the biggest beneficiaries. The list reads like a “who's who” of powerful exporting empires: General Electric, Dow Chemical, Bechtel, Caterpillar, and John Deere all enjoy the bank's support of “small business” and “job creation.” The bank’s transparent “small business” pitch should bother us. But the truth is it's unrealistic to expect Americans to monitor every deal and bald-faced half-truth that comes out of Ex-Im reports and balance sheets. This is the tragic conclusion of public choice economics: Private benefits for Boeing and Caterpillar continue unabated because the costs are dispersed among millions of taxpayers who simply don’t have the time and energy to fight this injustice. Big business lobbyists have “all hands on deck” at this year's conference to protect their cash cow. But that's no reason for us to buy what they are selling.

Scott Garrett Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg Trump, who as a candidate said he didn’t think the bank needed to exist, named former New Jersey Representative Scott Garrett, one of the biggest recipients of Wall Street donations among House members, to be the bank’s chairman and president. He tapped former Alabama Representative Spencer Bachus for a seat on the bank’s board of directors. Both positions require Senate confirmation. Trump hinted at a shift in his position on Ex-Im during an interview on April 12. “Actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money; it can make a lot of money,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies.” In 2015, Trump told Bloomberg that the bank’s role amounted to “featherbedding” for some politicians and companies. The guarantees loans for international buyers of products from U.S. companies. Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg is said to have helped change the president’s view of the agency. Boeing is by far the largest beneficiary of the bank among exporters, to the tune of several billion dollars annually, followed by General Electric Co. No Quorum Small-government conservatives shut down the bank in 2015 by blocking its reauthorization. While the bank was revived, its five-member board has lacked a quorum, which restricted it from granting loans of more than $10 million. Former President Barack Obama’s late-term nominees were blocked by Senate Republicans, including Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. Read about the Ex-Im bank’s path from star to snuffed to saved: QuickTake In Garrett, Trump has chosen a critic of a government agency to run it -- similar to his appointment of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. “The Export-Import Bank’s long legacy of crony capitalism has hurt the livelihoods and businesses of many Americans who don’t get special treatment from this misguided government program,” Garrett said in a 2015 statement. Conservative groups, including Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity, oppose the bank for similar reasons. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, urged senators to reject Garrett’s nomination because of his past stance. ‘Act of Sabotage’ “In Scott Garrett, the president has nominated someone who helped lead the charge to shut down the Export-Import Bank in Congress against a super-majority that was in favor of keeping it open so it could continue creating and supporting American jobs and exports,” Hoyer said in a statement. “If former Representative Garrett is confirmed to lead the Bank, it would be the ultimate act of sabotage.” Garrett, 57, failed to win re-election in 2016 after seven terms in Congress. He lost the backing of major Wall Street donors after a report that he’d told fellow Republican lawmakers he wouldn’t give money to the party’s congressional campaign arm because it supported openly gay candidates. Spencer Bachus Photographer: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Bachus, a former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has previously supported the Ex-Im bank, sponsoring a 2012 law that reauthorized the bank. Bachus retired from Congress in 2015. Backers of the bank say that most of its lending supports small and medium-sized businesses. In fiscal 2014, the bank’s last full year of operation, it backed $27.5 billion in exports -- somewhat less than 2 percent of the U.S. total. This financing supported 164,000 American jobs that year, according to the bank, and about 90 percent of the bank’s deals helped small businesses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has pushed for the bank’s lending powers to be fully restored, saying that without it, jobs might be lost to competitors in China or Russia.

Re: "Huge bomb debuts -- U.S. targets militants' tunnel complex with 'mother of all bombs,'" Friday news story. So President Donald Trump dropped a Massive Ordnance Air Blast -- just short of a nuke -- in Afghanistan and nobody is calling it crazy? I mean, I sort of understand. ISIS is evil. Why not blow them up? White House press sold it as a necessary measure to deny ISIS operational space and to clear out their underground tunnels. Sounds pretty good. Except. They also said no civilians were injured or killed. A superbomb that only kills the bad guys? Collateral damage is such a downer. And if they know they didn't take out any civilians, it follows they must know how many combatants they took out. Apparently those figures are to be determined. If it's OK for Trump to detonate a MOAB, will it be easier for him to take it up a notch next time and drop a nuke? Not all enemy nations are able to be remapped via explosion as Afghanistan without consequence. Jason Nancarrow, Dallas _ Bombing is insane PR stunt Trump visits Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Trump drops Boeing-made bomb from Lockheed-made airplane. Job creation -- mission accomplished! (About 36 ISIS killed. Cost-benefit analysis? How many million of dollars per person killed?) I believe this is an insane PR stunt. Yvette Sedlewicz, Garland _ New pot policy makes sense Re: "Dallas will ease up on marijuana arrests -- Those in possession of less than 4 ounces can be ticketed instead," Thursday news story. Thanks to the Dallas City Council and especially to Philip Kingston and Tiffinni Young for passing the cite and release program for marijuana, limited though it is. Police officers lose several hours of availability while transporting and booking suspects for nonviolent crimes. Suspects spend an average of 10 days in jail at a cost of about $60 per day. It is absurd to use scarce police resources and taxpayers' money arresting people for owning a plant. If Mike Rawlings wants to jail more law violators, he should go after speeders. Speeding is much more dangerous to the citizens of Dallas than possessing marijuana. Suzanne Wills, Dallas _ Pot policy is misguided and ... To understand the significance of this front-page piece, we have to be reminded that our radical left newspaper is an advocate for cite and release. With that thought in mind, we have to ask the question, does The News really believe relaxing marijuana laws is good for our minority kids or is that a pretext to advance its radical agenda on illegal drugs use? If the leaders of our community believe that arresting illegal pot users is more harmful to our minority kids than actually using illegal drugs, they are not serving our community well. Don Skaggs, Garland ... Reflects messed-up priorities Wednesday was a newsworthy day. The Middle East was going to hell in a handbasket and American-Russian relations were plummeting to Cold War levels with Russia threatening to wage "real war" if we conduct more missile strikes against Syria. Although the news real channels were covering these world events very closely, what was the lead-in story on the 5 p.m. news at Channel 4 and Channel 8? Yep, you guessed it -- relaxation of marijuana laws and enforcement. You can't tell me that we don't have our priorities right. Harold Whittington, Garland Just don't break the law Re: "Red-light cameras will keep clicking after contract OK'd -- Despite concerns about subcontractor diversity, firm gets 7-year deal," Thursday Metro story. I read the two stories regarding marijuana and traffic cameras. Both had the same argument: The laws currently prosecute the poor minority residents who can't afford the cash to pay the fines or jail time because they would lose their jobs. I have an easy solution to the argument: Just don't break the law. Use the money you are buying marijuana with to buy food or pay the rent, and just don't run red lights. But, with the way our elected officials seem to be thinking, maybe the ones who rob banks and steal cars shouldn't be arrested either? Martha DeLuca, Grand Prairie Don't strip our rights ... Re: "Must we count our chickens? 'You should have as many breeds as make you happy,'" Thursday Arts & Life story. Our comrades from the Communist Party want to congratulate Plano Sen. Van Taylor for his bill that strips yet another freedom away from the people of Texas. Passage of this bill will strip the rights of all Texas neighborhoods to decide their own level of tolerance for livestock in residential areas, and pass that power into the hands of the All Knowing and All Powerful State. It's for their own good, of course, as the peasants of Texas are obviously incapable of deciding anything on their own. Having passed the House, the passage of Senate Bill 1620 will force all residential neighborhoods to accept livestock into their backyards, regardless of the wishes of the people living in the neighborhood, regardless of any city ordinances, regardless of the stink, disease or noise, or of the decline of property values. We know that Taylor calls himself a Republican, but by his actions to enlarge the power of the state and strip the rights of the people to live as they wish, we welcome him as a true and faithful Communist comrade. Olan Knight, Murphy ... To be free of rats and chickens Be sure to check your city's ordinances before starting a backyard chicken coop. Most cities have an ordinance in place in reference to keeping animals in city backyards in order to protect neighbors from unwanted nuisances such as barking dogs, etc. Your neighbor may not appreciate the clucking of chickens when they try to enjoy a quiet moment on their own patio nor the feathers that have blown into their yard. Not to speak of rats running along the fence wanting to get some of the chicken feed. Ina Klune, Bedford Love the Yantis post office Re: "Customer service is missing," by Harry Bomberger, Friday Letters. The other side of this story should be shared. We moved into the community serviced by the Yantis post office over 10 years ago. Our experience with the Yantis post office has been entirely pleasant, and as retired seniors we love the employees and their services. We travel often and our mail is carefully held at our request and delivered upon our return. When the delivery is more than our rural mailbox can hold, the carrier delivers it to our door. This excellent customer service.

Scott Garrett questions SEC chairwoman Mary Jo White during a hearing in Washington November 15, 2016. — Reuters picWASHINGTON, April 15 — US President Donald Trump nominated former Republican lawmaker Scott Garrett as president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States yesterday, completing an about-face over an institution he had denounced as “featherbedding” for big business. A White House statement also named Spencer Bachus, another Republican former congressman, to be a member of the board of directors of the bank. Both were named for four-year terms. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill the two vacancies on the bank's five-member board that have prevented it from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over US$10 million (RM44.1 million). His picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing Co and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who worked in Congress to kill the institution, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump's backing of the bank represents a victory for manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric Co, which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump told the Journal the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank as being "featherbedding" for wealthy corporations. Trump's about-face followed a meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing chief executive Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation's aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank's charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump pick for Export-Import Bank is critical of its mission Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Bursa Malaysia to consolidate next week Mercosur to sign trade deal with EU this year, Argentina says Ringgit expected to climb against US dollar Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Village Grocer buys up Ben’s Independent Grocer Petronas pitches RM4.4b offshore gas project stake to oil firms, sources say Demand for Malaysian palm oil set to rebound, says Council United Airlines CEO won’t resign Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Greek Orthodox Patriarch leads Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem Reuters Video: Beating climate-change odds, a wolverine is born in Belgium Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Trump pick for Export-Import Bank is critical of its mission Obama to US business-owners: Press congress to renew Ex-Im Bank Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Buy Now Mamta Popat / Arizona Daily Star Ruben Rocha, 16, left, and Antonio Acosta, 17, of Sunnyside High School, look at a sample of granular activated carbon pellets during a tour of the Advanced Oxidation Process Water Treatment Facility located at 1102 W. Irvington Road. The AOP is helping clean up a superfund site on the south side of Tucson. Thursday March 09, 2017 Buy Now Mamta Popat / Arizona Daily Star A Tucson Water official talks to Sunnyside High School students about the treatment facility. “We need a younger generation to have the knowledge,” says local activist Yolanda Herrera. Advancements in the treatment of contaminated south-side water have left Tucson Water officials looking to shut down a 22-year-old plant they say is no longer necessary, but still required by law. A newer treatment plant completed in 2014 removes all the same contaminants as its older counterpart in addition to the carcinogen 1,4-dioxane, which was recently found to be more dangerous than previously thought, said Jeff Biggs, Tucson Water’s administrator of strategic initiatives. The progress has rendered the old plant obsolete, he said. “It’s redundant now and it’s costing money unnecessarily,” he said. Contaminated water has plagued the lower-income, largely Hispanic south-side community since the 1950s when defense-related industries used the carcinogen trichloroethylene, known as TCE, as an industrial degreaser and dumped it into the soil and unlined wells. For almost 30 years, south-side residents unknowingly drank and bathed in contaminated water. Studies link long-term exposure to TCE to diseases like kidney cancer, liver cancer and blood cancer. Tucson Water began operating a treatment plant, funded by the industries that originally polluted the groundwater, at the Tucson International Airport Area Superfund Site Area A in 1994. The area contains the contaminated groundwater plume that extends north from Los Reales Road to just past Irvington Road. The plume is bounded on the west by Interstate 19 and the Santa Cruz River, and on the east by South Sixth Avenue and Nogales Highway. Over the past 22 years, 5,303 pounds of TCE have been removed from the water. The first engineers of the original TIAA Superfund site plant believed enough TCE would have been removed by now to close the plant. But it could be another 30 years before enough TCE is removed to halt the treatment system, estimates Chad LaPora, the environmental and regulatory compliance supervisor for Tucson Water. The original treatment plant stripped water of contaminants of concern including TCE but did not remove the carcinogen 1,4-dioxane from the water. That wasn’t a problem until the EPA discovered 1,4-dioxane was more dangerous than previously thought. Tucson Water built the new Advanced Oxidation Plant to target both TCE and 1,4-dioxane using ultraviolet light combined with hydrogen peroxide to rid the groundwater of toxic chemicals. The groundwater plume near Tucson International Airport was declared a federal Superfund site in 1983. The parties responsible for polluting the water at the TIAA Superfund Site Area A and now legally bound to clean it up are the U.S. Air Force; city of Tucson; Tucson Airport Authority; Hughes Aircraft Co., acquired by Raytheon in 1997; and McDonnell-Douglas Corp., acquired by Boeing in 1997. Last month the EPA held a public forum at El Pueblo Activity Center to propose amendments to the 1988 record of decision, which laid out cleanup plans for the Superfund site. The EPA’s proposed amendments would allow for the closure of the older treatment plant and add 1,4-dioxane to the list of contaminants of concern. The EPA will accept public comment on proposed changes to the Superfund site by letter or email until April 21. RESIDENTS DON’T TRUST WATER The legacy of toxic dumping in the south side has left some residents suspicious of treated water coming from the Superfund site. At last month’s forum, residents voiced fears about continuing family health issues including cancers and the chronic autoimmune disease known as lupus. Some demanded the EPA conduct a study to determine whether these diseases are linked to the contaminants. EPA toxicologist Gerry Hiatt responded at the forum that although the EPA uses health-risk assessments to make decisions at Superfund sites, the EPA is not a health agency. “We don’t have physicians working for us that can go into a community and evaluate the health status of a community or talk to people who’ve had health issues and may have been affected by the contamination,” Hiatt said. Together with Tucson toxicologist Dr. Farshad Shirazi, south-side resident Linda Robles is in the process of creating a house survey to take to her neighbors to find how many illnesses have resulted from the water contamination. She’s also started a community group called the Environmental Task Force. “They just keep finding more chemicals,” Robles said. “Where are these coming from?” CHROMIUM-6 Tucson Water is also braced for the possibility that another chemical may require treatment at the Superfund site. Chromium-6, the carcinogen featured in the 2000 movie “Erin Brockovich,” has been under scrutiny by the EPA since 2010. The agency told PBS in 2013 that it would release findings from its review of chromium-6’s health effects this year, but it has not yet done so. EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones did not respond to the Star’s questions about when the study will be released. In November, Tucson Water found chromium-6 concentrations of up to 8.8 parts per billion in TIAA Superfund Site Area A wells, which water officials say is safe. Concentrations are even lower — 1.6 parts per billion — after the groundwater is mixed with Colorado River water before distribution for drinking, LaPora said. The EPA hasn’t yet established a threshold for safe consumption of the carcinogen, but California established a legal level of 10 parts per billion and a public health goal of .02 parts per billion. In the event that chromium-6 levels rise at the Superfund site or the EPA’s review finds the contaminant more dangerous than previously thought, Tucson Water will need to construct a new plant to treat the water for that chemical, Biggs said. Tucsonan Yolanda Herrera, 64, has watched the south-side water cleanup from the beginning. She applauded Tucson Water for its cleanup efforts. “I was glad they were more proactive than reactive,” Herrera said. While Herrera said she would support a health-survey effort, she said her neighbors’ distrust of the cleanliness of Tucson Water is misguided. She co-chairs the Unified Community Advisory Board that meets quarterly with Tucson Water officials and representatives from the industries responsible for contaminating south-side water to talk about the cleanup progress. A second-generation board member, she has seen first-hand the damaging effects of TCE. Her mother developed a cancerous tumor after drinking the contaminated water and had to have part of her jaw removed. She suffers immense pain every day, Herrera said. Herrera said some of her siblings have also gotten cancer and her family has experienced stillborn babies and had others born with heart and kidney problems. EDUCATING YOUTH University of Arizona College of Education associate professor Kristin Gunckel developed a high school curriculum, with funding from the National Science Foundation, that uses computer modeling to teach students about the TIAA Superfund site groundwater contamination. Over the past school year, she’s worked with science teachers from Desert View and Sunnyside high schools to teach students about their groundwater. “They didn’t really know about it,” Gunckel said of the water contamination, “but as they started learning about it they became much more interested and engaged.” On March 9, five Sunnyside high schoolers took a tour of the two plants at TIAA Superfund Site Area A. Quiet and reserved, the students let the information of the history of south side’s water contamination seep in. Sunnyside senior Francisco Martinez said he felt it was important to learn about the water contamination. His grandmother lived off Drexel Road when the tap water was contaminated, so he was familiar with the issue. Local activist Herrera tagged along on the tour and spoke to the kids about her advisory board, whose members are aging, she said. “I think it’s imperative that we do have kids at the table,” Herrera said. “We need the younger generation to have the knowledge to hold the government agencies’ feet to the fire.” Michelle Jaquette is a University of Arizona journalism student and an apprentice at the Star.

Email comments to Aycock.Mary@epa.gov, or send comments to: Mary Aycock, EPA Region 9, Mail Code SFD 8-1, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA 94105 Timeline 1940s-1980s — Defense-related industries near the Tucson International Airport Area use products containing the carcinogen trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,4-dioxane as industrial solvents. Companies including Hughes Aircraft Co. dispose improperly of the solvents, dumping them into unlined wells. 1981 — The city of Tucson and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency run tests and discover hazardous levels of TCE in the drinking water near the Tucson airport. Numerous municipal wells are shut down and private well owners are warned of the risks. 1983 — The EPA declares land near the Tucson airport a federal Superfund site. 1988 — The EPA, along with city officials and the parties responsible for polluting the water, decide on a long-term plan for cleanup of the site, called the "record of decision." 1994 — The Tucson Airport Remediation Project plant begins treating water from the contaminated groundwater plume. Treated water is served as drinking water to south-side residents. 1995 — Unified Community Advisory Board formed with community members and government agencies to keep watch over groundwater cleanup. 2011 — A federal study finds 1,4-dioxane is more dangerous than previously thought. The EPA lowers its its threshold for what's considered safe consumption of the contaminant. 2012 — Tucson Water begins building its Advanced Oxidation Plant to treat the water for TCE and 1,4-dioxane. 2014 — The new plant is finished. Water is now stripped of both TCE and 1,4-dioxane by the new plant before running through original 1994 plant. 2017 — EPA proposes amendment to 1988 record of decision, which would allow for the 1994 plant to be shut down. If the amendment goes through, Tucson Water will still need to negotiate with the parties responsible for the pollution to create a new legal consent decree stating how much money the polluters must pay for the operating and management costs of the new plant.

In a well-timed statement, just as tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program and potential US airstrikes run wild, the NNSA said that in conjunction with the US Air Force, it had completed the first qualification flight test of B61-12 gravity nuclear bomb on March 14 at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada.   #NNSA & @usairforce complete first B61-12 #LEP qualification flight test. @NellisAFB @NNSANevada https://t.co/cmhlhJsPnC pic.twitter.com/JbTpHn2cCB — Frank Klotz (@FrankKlotzNNSA) April 14, 2017 In the press release, the NNSA said that the “non-nuclear assembly test” was dropped from an F-16 based at Nellis Air Force Base and was intended to evaluate “both the weapon’s non-nuclear functions as well as the aircraft’s capability to deliver the weapon.” This test was the first of a series that will be conducted over the next three years to qualify the B61-12 for service. Three successful development flight tests were conducted in 2015. “This demonstration of effective end-to-end system performance in a realistic ballistic flight environment marks another on-time achievement for the B61-12 Life Extension Program,” said Brig. Gen. Michael Lutton, NNSA’s principal assistant deputy administrator for military application. “The successful test provides critical qualification data to validate that the baseline design meets military requirements. It reflects the nation’s continued commitment to our national security and that of our allies and partners.” The flight test included hardware designed by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, manufactured by the Nuclear Security Enterprise plants, and mated to the tail-kit assembly section, designed by the Boeing Company under contract with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. Phil Hoover, an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, shows off a flight test body for a B61-12 nuclear weapon The B61-12 consolidates and replaces four B61 bomb variants in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. The first production unit is scheduled to be completed by March 2020. The original B61 gravity bomb is the mainstay of the Air Force’s nuclear arsenal and one of the legs of the so-called nuclear triad, along with the intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed from either ground-based silos or oceangoing submarines. The B61 nuclear gravity bomb, deployed from U.S. Air Force and NATO bases, has almost 50 years of service, “making it the oldest and most versatile weapon in the enduring U.S. stockpile.” Numerous modifications have been made to improve the B61’s safety, security, and reliability since the first B61 entered service in 1968, and four B61 variants remain in the stockpile: the 3, 4, 7, and 11. However, the aging weapon system requires a life extension to continue deterring potential adversaries and reassuring our allies and partners of our security commitments to them. The B61-12 LEP will refurbish, reuse, or replace all of the bomb’s nuclear and non?nuclear components to extend the service life of the B61 by at least 20 years, “and to improve the bomb’s safety,  effectiveness, and security” according to the NNSA. The B61-12 first production unit will occur in FY 2020. The bomb will be approximately 12 feet long and weigh approximately 825 pounds. The bomb will be air-delivered in either ballistic gravity or guided drop modes, and is being certified for delivery on current strategic (B-2A) and dual capable aircraft (F-15E, F-16C/D & MLU, PA-200) as well as future aircraft platforms (F-35, B-21). President Trump has endorsed the ambitious and expensive plan to modernize the US nuclear triad, begun under his predecessor. The March test of the B61-12 was the first in a series to take place over the next three years, with the final design review due in September 2018 and the first production unit scheduled for completion by March 2020. Once the bomb is authorized for use in 2020, the US plans to deploy some 180 of the B61-12 precision-guided thermonuclear bombs to five European countries as follows: Belgium – 20; Germany -20; Italy – 70; Netherlands – 20; Turkey -50; … although in light of recent developments, and this weekend’s Turkish referendum which may grant Erdogan what are effectively dictatorial powers, it may consider reassessing the Turkish deployment. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-14/us-conducts-successful-field-test-new-nuclear-gravity-bomb Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) dropped $2.29 last week (about 1.6%), closing at $141.05 on Thursday. Markets were closed Friday. Even so, it remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities the comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 21.78% year to date, still well above second-place Boeing’s 12.81% improvement. Apple stock dropped sharply early Tuesday, likely due to a countersuit filed by Qualcomm in response to Apple’s January lawsuit against the chipmaker. Apple has charged Qualcomm with throttling its LTE processors and with abusing its market power. All told, Apple listed 389 specific allegations in its filing. In its response, Qualcomm denied all 389 allegations, citing 35 specific defenses to the charges, as well as claiming that the charges are unfounded. There is a lot of money at stake, and these opposing lawsuits will take months or years to sort out. Apple also got some bad news from Laptop magazine early last week. In the publication’s list of best notebook brands, the MacBook finished fifth behind Lenovo, Asus, Dell, HP and Acer (tied with Apple). The company was taken to task for offering too narrow a range of models, and MacBooks were also judged to be too expensive. Apple shares closed at $141.05 on Thursday, down about 0.5% for the day, in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $145.46. The consensus 12-month price target is $147.61 in a price target range of $104 to $185 per share.

Trump, who as a candidate said he didn’t think the bank needed to exist, named former New Jersey Representative Scott Garrett, one of the biggest recipients of Wall Street donations among House members, to be the bank’s chairman and president. He tapped former Alabama Representative Spencer Bachus for a seat on the bank’s board of directors. Both positions require Senate confirmation. Trump hinted at his reversal in media interviews last week, signalling a shift from his position on the campaign trail. In 2015, he told Bloomberg that the bank’s role amounted to “featherbedding” for some politicians and companies. Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg is said to have been particularly influential in changing the president’s view of the agency. Boeing is by far the largest exporter beneficiary of the bank, to the tune of several billion dollars annually, followed by General Electric Co. Small-government conservatives shut down the bank in 2015 by blocking its reauthorization. While the bank was revived, its five-member board has lacked a quorum, which restricted it from granting loans of more than $10 million. Former President Barack Obama’s late-term nominees were blocked by Senate Republicans, including Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. In Garrett, Trump has once again chosen a critic of a government agency to run it. “The Export-Import Bank’s long legacy of crony capitalism has hurt the livelihoods and businesses of many Americans who don’t get special treatment from this misguided government program,” Garrett said in a 2015 statement. Conservative groups including Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity oppose the bank for similar reasons. Garrett lost re-election last year after seven terms in Congress when he lost the backing of major Wall Street donors after a report that he’d told fellow Republican lawmakers he wouldn’t give money to the party’s congressional campaign arm because it supported openly gay candidates. Bachus, a former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has previously backed the Ex-Im Bank, sponsoring a 2012 law that reauthorised the bank. Backers of bank say that most of its lending supports small and medium-sized businesses. In fiscal 2014, the bank’s last fully operation year, it backed $27.5 billion in exports “- somewhat less than 2 per cent of the US total. This financing supported 164,000 American jobs that year, according to the bank, and about 90 per cent of the bank’s deals helped small businesses. The US Chamber of Commerce has pushed for the bank’s lending powers to be fully restored, saying that without it jobs might be lost to competitors in China or Russia.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 15, 2017 at 10:13AM In March, President Donald Trump proposed increasing the U.S. defense budget by $54 billion. Trump wants America to build more aircraft carriers, more nuclear submarines, more nuclear missiles, and... more of Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) famed F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter, a weapon that he now calls "the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter." But here's a bit of shocking news for America's populist president: In a poll conducted last year by Voice of the People (VOP), a majority of Americans opted to send the fantastic new F-35 fighter jet to the junkyard. Lockheed Martin's F-35 could be preparing to bomb -- and not in the way it's supposed to. Image source: Lockheed Martin. The poll VOP conducted its poll online between Dec. 20, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2016. Surveying 7,126 registered voters who belong to its "Citizen Cabinet" advisory panel, in eight states scattered across the nation, VOP posed a series of questions concerning the U.S. defense budget. Among other revelations, VOP's poll showed that Americans generally favor cutting defense spending on the Air Force (by $2 billion annually), the Army ($4 billion), Navy ($2 billion), nuclear weapons ($3 billion), and missile defense ($1 billion). Perhaps the most surprising revelation from the poll, though, was the sentiment among voters for what is now President Trump's new favorite military jet. Of those polled, 54% wanted to end production of the F-35. The details That's right. By a vote of 54% in favor to 43% opposed, a majority of those polled "endorsed cancelling the F‐35 Joint Strike Fighter Program and instead upgrading current fighters" such as Boeing's F-15 and (luckily for Lockheed) Lockheed Martin's own F-16. When told that upgrading old planes versus buying newer F-35s would save as much as $97 billion in defense dollars over the next 20 years, voters overwhelmingly voted with their wallets -- to kill the F-35. Anti-F-35 sentiment was widespread, too. Voters in eight states were surveyed, and in all eight states, majorities favored killing the F-35. Even in Texas, where the F-35 is built in Fort Worth, a 51% majority agreed that the F-35 should go away. Why the death sentence? Actually, maybe that's not so surprising, given the negative press Lockheed's F-35 program has endured. In querying voters regarding their feelings on the F-35, VOP pointed out, "Some say the F-35... has many design problems, and is way over budget already, with more overruns likely." That's stating it kindly. As initially envisioned, Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet was supposed to achieve "initial operational capability" (IOC) and be ready for at least limited use in combat by 2010. In fact, by 2015, only one variant of the F-35 (the F-35B, destined for the Marine Corps) had reached IOC. The Air Force anointed its own F-35A variant with IOC status in 2016. And the Navy's F-35C variant... still isn't there yet. Viewed most charitably, the F-35 program is at least five years behind schedule -- and arguably as much as seven years late. Price-wise, the F-35 produced was originally predicted to cost about $35 million per plane in 1994 dollars ($57.5 million today). But even after Lockheed's latest round of price reductions, the average F-35 still costs taxpayers more than $113 million -- 197% of its budgeted cost. And as for the "design problems," well, VOP's poll was conducted more than a full year ago. Since then, the Pentagon's Directorate of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) has released an updated report on the airplane's progress. It details a list of 276 "critical" deficiencies with the F-35, concluding that by and large, the F-35 is "overall ineffective." Were the same VOP survey conducted today, it's possible that even more Americans would vote to kill the F-35. What it means for investors So what is the upshot of all the above? President Trump wants to spend a lot more money on defense this year (and in future years) than President Obama spent last year. Lockheed Martin shareholders were understandably enthused to learn of the new president's desire to spend more on defense in general, and of his kind words for the F-35 in particular. But don't count your warbirds before the eggs are hatched. Much of the extra money Trump wants to dump into defense is earmarked for an airplane that enjoys little support among voters -- and taxpayers. This could make the increase in defense spending a hard sell. And increased purchases of F-35 fighter jets are still not a foregone conclusion. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Jet2 service had been due to leave for Prague in the Czech Republic at about 15:15 BST on Good Friday. But its departure was delayed when the cabin crew called for police assistance The airline apologised to affected customers and said it would "not let the behaviour of a disruptive few spoil the flight for everyone else". Stuck with stag dos: Your stories A spokesman for the carrier said the Boeing had to return to the airport's parking stand shortly before its scheduled take-off. Several passengers went on social media to describe the scene. One, Lauren Sian, said the group had been "damaging property, swearing and being disruptive" before they were escorted from the flight. Ailsa Illingworth tweeted: "Stuck on the Tarmac at Manchester Airport as some idiot stags and their luggage are removed. Don't envy the jet2 staff at times like this." Image copyright Ailsa Illingworth Image caption Some passenger were led off the Jet2 flight Ms Illingworth, who is visiting a friend in Prague with her husband, told the BBC: "The stags were under the influence and being loud. It was only some members of each stag being disruptive. The majority of one group left, but I think a lot of the other stayed on. "Staff were very good with the rest of the passengers, they were patient, friendly and handed out water. "I think it is usually fun, but there is a line and these guys obviously crossed it. It was impacting on a lot of other travellers, and that's not fair. Staff shouldn't have to deal with the abuse either." Image copyright Dave Illingworth Image caption Police were called to Manchester Airport to help the plane's crew remove the passengers The pilot announced he had a zero tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour towards the cabin crew and police spoke to the remaining stags about their behaviour before take off, Ms Illingworth added. Jet 2 said police arrested one passenger while two others were "issued with public order offences". "We apologise to all other customers for the inconvenience that this has caused at the start of their bank holiday weekend. "However, as a family-friendly airline we will not let the behaviour of a disruptive few spoil the flight for everyone else." The flight eventually departed at 17:57 - a delay of more than two hours.

The first is that the  ‘The Mother of All Bombs’ (MOAB), which weighs 20,000 pounds,  is not the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the USA armoury. The United States has  GPS guided 30,000-pound bombs, at least 20 of them, made by Aerospace giant Boeing Co. They are called Massive Ordnance Penetrators. The first batch of the bombs was delivered in 2011 at a  total cost of about $314 million. According to  a report by Los Angeles Times,  the bombs are nearly five tons heavier than anything else in the military’s arsenal and they are meant  to pulverise underground enemy hide-outs. The bombs were designed to be dropped on targets by the Boeing-made B-52 Stratofortress long-range bomber or Northrop Grumman Corp.’s B-2 stealth bomber. Packed with more than 5,300 pounds of explosives and more than 20 feet long, the giant bunker-busting bombs were tested at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the site of the first atomic bomb test during World War II. The man who has pointed this out is the fugitive  NSA contractor Edward Snowden, now living in Russia. The second shocking revelation by Snowden is that the   tunnels and caves targeted by the MOAB were possibly built by the United States. “Those mujahedeen tunnel networks we’re bombing in Afghanistan? We paid for them,” Snowden wrote on Twitter, attaching an excerpt from a 2005 New York Times article, which suggested that the construction of the Tora Bora cave complex in the province of Nangarhar was financed by the CIA in 1980. At that period, Washington supported Mujahedeen, who fought against the Soviet military in the country. One of the members of the Mujahedeen was Osama Bin Laden, who  later fell out with America. According to earlier media reports, a 9.5-tonne GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb, nicknamed MOAB, was dropped at 7 p.m. local time Thursday. The bomb was dropped by an MC-130 aircraft, operated by Air Force Special Operations Command. CNN reported citing its military sources that “the target was ISIS tunnels and personnel in the Achin district of the Nangarhar province.” Snowden said the bomb was dropped in the middle of ‘nowhere’   I found this interesting I didin't find this interesting Join the Conversation Most Read headlines Gunmen shell Melaye’s country home Education New names emerge for HIV/AIDS, prostitutes News Accept tribunal verdict, Benin Oba tells Ize-Iyamu News Former VP joins Sierra Leone’s presidential race News Witnesses tell of brainwash by Jehovah’s Witnesses Latest Business Tax Day: U.S. protesters want Trump tax returns released 3 mins ago Politics Turkey votes for new constitution 1 hour ago News North Korea’s missile launch fails 3 hours ago Football Zesco bundle Rangers out of CAF league 10 hours ago Football Man City humiliate Southampton to go third 11 hours ago Politics Irate youths disrupt APC rally in Funtua 11 hours ago Entertainment Jos carnival: Mother of 4 wins mountain climbing competition 12 hours ago OffBeat Morano, world’s oldest person dies in Italy at 117 13 hours ago News Car bomb kills dozens of Syria war evacuees 13 hours ago Football BBC-less Madrid find Isco to edge Gijon 14 hours ago Load More Former President Jonathan's CSO, Obua is dead Previous Witnesses tell of brainwash by Jehovah's Witnesses Next No one knows Nigeria like NAN With substantial reach and mobility across the 36 states of Nigeria, we are always where the news is.

In a well-timed statement, just as tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program and potential US airstrikes run wild, the NNSA said that in conjunction with the US Air Force, it had completed the first qualification flight test of B61-12 gravity nuclear bomb on March 14 at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada.   #NNSA & @usairforce complete first B61-12 #LEP qualification flight test. @NellisAFB @NNSANevada https://t.co/cmhlhJsPnC pic.twitter.com/JbTpHn2cCB — Frank Klotz (@FrankKlotzNNSA) April 14, 2017 In the press release, the NNSA said that the “non-nuclear assembly test” was dropped from an F-16 based at Nellis Air Force Base and was intended to evaluate “both the weapon’s non-nuclear functions as well as the aircraft’s capability to deliver the weapon.” This test was the first of a series that will be conducted over the next three years to qualify the B61-12 for service. Three successful development flight tests were conducted in 2015. “This demonstration of effective end-to-end system performance in a realistic ballistic flight environment marks another on-time achievement for the B61-12 Life Extension Program,” said Brig. Gen. Michael Lutton, NNSA’s principal assistant deputy administrator for military application. “The successful test provides critical qualification data to validate that the baseline design meets military requirements. It reflects the nation’s continued commitment to our national security and that of our allies and partners.” The flight test included hardware designed by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, manufactured by the Nuclear Security Enterprise plants, and mated to the tail-kit assembly section, designed by the Boeing Company under contract with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. Phil Hoover, an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, shows off a flight test body for a B61-12 nuclear weapon The B61-12 consolidates and replaces four B61 bomb variants in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. The first production unit is scheduled to be completed by March 2020. The original B61 gravity bomb is the mainstay of the Air Force’s nuclear arsenal and one of the legs of the so-called nuclear triad, along with the intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed from either ground-based silos or oceangoing submarines. The B61 nuclear gravity bomb, deployed from U.S. Air Force and NATO bases, has almost 50 years of service, “making it the oldest and most versatile weapon in the enduring U.S. stockpile.” Numerous modifications have been made to improve the B61’s safety, security, and reliability since the first B61 entered service in 1968, and four B61 variants remain in the stockpile: the 3, 4, 7, and 11. However, the aging weapon system requires a life extension to continue deterring potential adversaries and reassuring our allies and partners of our security commitments to them. The B61-12 LEP will refurbish, reuse, or replace all of the bomb’s nuclear and non?nuclear components to extend the service life of the B61 by at least 20 years, “and to improve the bomb’s safety,  effectiveness, and security” according to the NNSA. The B61-12 first production unit will occur in FY 2020. The bomb will be approximately 12 feet long and weigh approximately 825 pounds. The bomb will be air-delivered in either ballistic gravity or guided drop modes, and is being certified for delivery on current strategic (B-2A) and dual capable aircraft (F-15E, F-16C/D & MLU, PA-200) as well as future aircraft platforms (F-35, B-21). President Trump has endorsed the ambitious and expensive plan to modernize the US nuclear triad, begun under his predecessor. The March test of the B61-12 was the first in a series to take place over the next three years, with the final design review due in September 2018 and the first production unit scheduled for completion by March 2020. Once the bomb is authorized for use in 2020, the US plans to deploy some 180 of the B61-12 precision-guided thermonuclear bombs to five European countries as follows: Belgium – 20; Germany -20; Italy – 70; Netherlands – 20; Turkey -50; … although in light of recent developments, and this weekend’s Turkish referendum which may grant Erdogan what are effectively dictatorial powers, it may consider reassessing the Turkish deployment. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-14/us-conducts-successful-field-test-new-nuclear-gravity-bomb Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

(iStock Photo) Export-Import Bank funds went to a company accused by federal prosecutors of bribing foreign officials, records obtained by the Washington Examiner show. The U.S. government's Export-Import Bank is the subject of a congressional funding battle, with small-government types saying its "corporate welfare" for massive corporations like Boeing and should be eliminated. The federal agency has figured prominently in the rhetoric of early presidential contenders. Its employees, in an effort to preserve their jobs, say that most of its transactions help small American businesses. They also grease multimillion dollar foreign deals for companies like Diebold Inc., which the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged in 2013 with foreign corruption in China and Russia. The Ohio-based company paid nearly $50 million in penalties and agreed to accept a "compliance monitor" in exchange for deferred prosecution. "Diebold paid bribes and falsified documents in connection with the sale of ATMs to bank customers in China, Indonesia, and Russia," federal prosecutors said in a statement two years ago. "Diebold attempted to disguise the payments and benefits through various means, including by making payments through third parties designated by the banks and by inaccurately recording leisure trips for bank employees as 'training.' The court documents also allege that from 2005 to 2009, Diebold created and entered into false contracts with a distributor in Russia for services that the distributor was not performing." An inspector general's report shows that Ex-Im complied with lending its support to the company because the specific Ex-Im money involved transactions with Kazakhstan, not Russia or China. In the inspector general's review, Ex-Im officials said that funding recipients sign a certificate saying that they "have not engaged, or will engage, in any activity ... that is a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act," but noted that it also contains the caveat "in connection with this transaction." Kazakhstan, in central Asia, is a notoriously corrupt country, but the specific Department of Justice case did not involve that nation. Ex-Im provided about $83 million in "insured shipments, guaranteed credit or disbursed loan[s]," according to federal data. Spokesmen for the Ex-Im Bank did not immediately return a voicemail left this weekend seeking comment. A spokesman for Diebold did not return a similar email message.

(Graeme Jennings/Examiner File) Source: Congressional Budget Office, OpenSecrets.org. Lobbying has grown in direct proportion to government spending, with special interest groups consistently spending almost exactly $1 million for every billion dollars in federal expenditures. The correlation suggests that while liberal politicians portray K Street lobbyists as villains ruining Washington, it may be Big Government policies that attract them, according to a Washington Examiner analysis. The money spent on lobbying rose from $1.5 billion in 1998 to a high of $3.6 billion in 2010, during President Obama's stimulus package. During that same time period, spending grew from $1.7 trillion to $3.5 trillion. Experts said that as lawmakers have created new government programs and pumped up spending on existing programs, companies and activist groups have mobilized lobbyists to figure out how to cash in on the newfound money. "To paraphrase James Carville, drag a billion dollars through a trailer park, and there's no telling who will turn out," said Bill Allison, a lobbying expert at the Sunlight Foundation. "Lobbying is an overhead expense of Big Government — a constant." Sunlight is a nonprofit that seeks more government transparency. In some ways, it's a chicken-and-egg relationship, and a competing theory is that lobbyists are causing the government to grow. To be sure, some companies lobby to increase the federal budget in areas on which they can profit. That includes defense contractors like General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing; government consultants like Accenture; quasi-public entities like public television stations; and healthcare firms like Emergent BioSolutions and AdvaMed. But many companies would prefer lower taxes over new government spending. If their lobbyists were successful, the result should be less government spending — in order to balance out the lower taxes — rather than the increase in government outlays, as measured by the Congressional Budget Office. Lobbying on taxes are mammoth companies like Microsoft, Wal-Mart, ExxonMobil and FedEx. Those companies may boost their lobbying presence as a reaction to government growth, which they see signaling higher taxes on the horizon. Three thousand entities hired lobbyists on federal appropriations last year, while 2,000 hired lobbyists on tax issues, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Lobbyists generally don't create demand, they sense an opportunity and respond to it, Allison said. "If I didn't think government had an interest in funding me, I wouldn't be putting the effort into lobbying it." Often that interest comes in the form of well-intentioned programs crafted by liberals from which companies almost always seem to find a way to profit. Politicians created government-backed student loans, for example, out of concern for young people. But for-profit colleges now lobby heavily for them, and depend upon the revenue that results. Soda and junk food manufacturers lobby to boost the food stamp program, and green-energy companies' business models depend on legal carve-outs. Big Government spending on defense and national security has the same effect. Creation of a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Homeland Security, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, set off a gold rush of lobbying, as did the heightened defense spending of the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Tim LaPira, a political science professor at James Madison University. Government taking on an expanded role — as it has done recently with healthcare — brings out lobbyists for both sides of an issue, as well as a crop of entities who were formerly not politically active, but now see a chance to profit. "A governmental decision to become involved in an issue area sets the agenda for existing and potential organized interests," LaPira and colleagues wrote in an academic paper titled "Drawing lobbyists to Washington." "If government had no authority over or involvement in an issue-area, then there would be little point in forming an interest group to lobby," LaPira and colleagues wrote. Demian Brady of the National Taxpayers Union noted that, while lobbying parallels federal spending, it doesn't match up so smoothly with federal revenues. "New federal programs create new constituencies who then lobby not only for additional benefits but to protect what they've already been granted," he said. "The benefits to the constituents of a given program are concentrated, while the costs of those programs are diffused, so that those people with the benefits have a much greater incentive to lobby on behalf of themselves than" taxpayers do to keep costs down.

Sunday, April 16, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets The Export-Import Bank socializes risk for private benefit by Veronique de Rugy | Jul 31, 2014, 5:00 PM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn (iStock) One reason that governments grow fast without many obstacles is because the benefits of expansion are concentrated on a few while the costs are spread among millions. Program beneficiaries have strong incentives to coordinate and protect their privileges. Average Americans, on the other hand, simply do not have the time or information to organize enough opposition to defeat these programs. They might bear the costs of government expansion, but individual programs only cost each American a few tax dollars here and there. Fighting for reform is simply not worth it. Bad programs proliferate, then, because cronyism pays more than stewardship. The Export-Import Bank is a prime example of this dynamic. There is no policy justification for this corporatist program. Economists have long known that these kinds of export credit subsidies will never raise the overall level of trade; rather, they redistribute wealth away from unsubsidized American firms, employees, and consumers and direct it toward a tiny number of subsidy beneficiaries. The bank is allowed to prosper and grow because its costs are spread over millions while its benefits are jealously protected by its few clients. A recent chart series that I produced for the Mercatus Center clearly illustrates this effect. The map above uses data from the Export-Import Bank to display Ex-Im disbursements in each state as a percentage of total disbursements. Washington is the clear winner in terms of total Ex-Im disbursements, receiving a massive 43.6 percent of all Ex-Im Bank disbursements from 2007 to 2014. Why? The state houses Boeing, one of Ex-Im Bank’s biggest beneficiaries, but the sheer size is nonetheless startling. Larger states like Texas and California only respectively pulled in 10.5 percent and 8.8 percent of total Ex-Im Bank disbursements during the same time. While businesses in most states barely benefit from the Ex-Im Bank at all, their taxpayers are just as exposed to Ex-Im Bank liabilities as taxpayers in handful of states that receive the most Ex-Im Bank backing. The same is true when look at the portion of total state exports backed by the Ex-Im Bank, as a second chart in the Mercatus series demonstrates. Washington is again the big winner, with an incredible 22.67 percent of state exports backed by the Ex-Im Bank since 2007. The state percentages drop off quickly from there. While almost four percent of Wisconsin’s exports and about 3.5 percent of Massachusetts’s exports were backed by the Ex-Im Bank, the Ex-Im Bank supported less than two percent of the exports of 41 states for the same time period. The truth of the matter is that the Ex-Im Bank yields negligible benefits for the vast majority of state exports, aside from one big outlier. These charts make it clear that the Ex-Im Bank primarily exists to benefit Boeing at the expense of everyone else in the country. You might wonder why lawmakers would refuse to acknowledge this reality. For one, politicians are pressured by an army of lobbyists representing powerful companies who are committed to protect their perks even if it hurts everyone else. But politicians are not exactly shrinking violets, here. They like being able to point to the small businesses and American jobs that they “support” through the Ex-Im Bank. What is much harder is to point to the millions of victims of the Ex-Im Bank. Taxpayers, for instance, bear a massive $140 billion exposure so that giant corporations like Boeing and General Electric can make a little more profit each year. Should the bank’s portfolio go south, normal people like you and I will be on the hook. Then there’s the economic distortions. Consumers face higher prices for airline travel, for instance, because the bank heavily subsidizes the foreign purchase of aircraft. Unsubsidized companies are subjected to an unleveled playing field. Because Ex-Im artificially lowers subsidized competitors’ financing costs, unsubsidized firms get crowded out of capital markets and find it hard to expand and maintain employment. If they fail, they won’t have the convenient assurance of a de facto taxpayer bailout like Boeing does. Since more than 98 percent of all U.S. exports receive no assistance from Ex-Im, this means the vast majority of Americans are victims who bear the costs of political privileges for a tiny number of politically-connected firms. Lawmakers should stand up for these unseen victims of the Ex-Im Bank. But they should also ask themselves why they are protecting a program that mostly benefits Washington.

Its corporate beneficiaries are fighting tooth and nail to protect their subsidies. Do not be fooled by their rhetoric. Insider lobbying groups like the Chamber of Commerce claim the Ex-Im Bank is about small business and jobs. Without the bank, they threaten, catastrophe will strike average Americans. This is just fear-mongering. The bank only subsidizes less than 2 percent of exports and jobs and less than 1 percent of small businesses in the U.S. each year. Most of this support directly benefits a handful of well-connected domestic and foreign firms, like Boeing and General Electric. Unfortunately, Ex-Im supporters know that “promoting small business” is a good way to conceal toxic Ex-Im corporatism. Take this piece in The Hill by Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La. He argues that the bank primarily helps small businesses to gain customers, create thousands of jobs, and grow exports. These claims are misleading. First, the Ex-Im Bank's definition of a “small business” isn't exactly “small.” Most government bodies set the threshold at firms with fewer than 500 employees. Ex-Im “small businesses” can be three times that large and earn up to $21 million in annual revenues. This isn't “small” for most Americans. Even with this expansive definition, it is misleading to imply, as Boustany does, that Ex-Im supports most small business firms and jobs in America. In fact, Ex-Im's effect on U.S. small businesses and jobs is so tiny that you can hardly see it on the chart above. Data from Census Bureau's Statistics of U.S. Businesses dataset and this Export-Import Bank dataset show that only 0.3 percent of all small business jobs in 2007 (the most recent year for the Census dataset) were supported by the Ex-Im Bank. Assuming that each Ex-Im small business transaction went to a unique small business, only 0.04 percent of all small businesses were supported by Ex-Im that year. The pattern is similar on the state level. Consider Boustany's home state of Louisiana. Census data show that Louisiana exported $355 billion in goods and services from 2007 to 2014. Ex-Im reports that it supported $1.6 million of Louisiana's exports in that same time, $786 million of which went to small businesses. This means that only 0.44 percent of Louisiana’s exports were actually supported by the bank — which is lower than the national average of 1.6 percent. Additionally, Ex-Im only supported 0.22 percent in exports for small businesses in Louisiana. Boustany either doesn’t know the facts or he doesn’t care. Either way: Ex-Im is hardly critical for more than 99 percent of small businesses in the U.S. and his own state. That doesn’t stop Boustany from trying to scare Americans from ending the Export-Import Bank with visions of exports collapsing and economic catastrophe. The sad part is that the Export-Import Bank actually harms many U.S. small businesses and workers by subsidizing their competitors. Boustany doesn’t explain that when Ex-Im subsidizes one Louisiana firm, it penalizes all other unsubsidized firms and workers. Subsidized firms undoubtedly enjoy that these taxpayer-backed subsidies lower their costs and raise their profits, but they come at the cost of slower wage growth, less hiring, and more layoffs among the other 98 percent of unsubsidized exports. These unsubsidized Americans shouldn’t matter less than the few privileged firms who receive government subsidies. Boustany is right when he says that “American people are tired of Washington politicians playing political games when American jobs are at stake.” He should look in the mirror. More than 98 percent of jobs and exports in the U.S. bear the unjust costs of Ex-Im privileges for politically connected few. Members of Congress should represent all of us, not just those of us fortunate to have friends down at the Export-Import Bank.

The Jet2 service had been due to leave for Prague in the Czech Republic at about 15:15 BST on Good Friday. But its departure was delayed when the cabin crew called for police assistance The airline apologised to affected customers and said it would "not let the behaviour of a disruptive few spoil the flight for everyone else". Stuck with stag dos: Your stories A spokesman for the carrier said the Boeing had to return to the airport's parking stand shortly before its scheduled take-off. Several passengers went on social media to describe the scene. One, Lauren Sian, said the group had been "damaging property, swearing and being disruptive" before they were escorted from the flight. Ailsa Illingworth tweeted: "Stuck on the Tarmac at Manchester Airport as some idiot stags and their luggage are removed. Don't envy the jet2 staff at times like this." Image copyright Ailsa Illingworth Image caption Some passenger were led off the Jet2 flight Ms Illingworth, who is visiting a friend in Prague with her husband, told the BBC: "The stags were under the influence and being loud. It was only some members of each stag being disruptive. The majority of one group left, but I think a lot of the other stayed on. "Staff were very good with the rest of the passengers, they were patient, friendly and handed out water. "I think it is usually fun, but there is a line and these guys obviously crossed it. It was impacting on a lot of other travellers, and that's not fair. Staff shouldn't have to deal with the abuse either." Image copyright Dave Illingworth Image caption Police were called to Manchester Airport to help the plane's crew remove the passengers The pilot announced he had a zero tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour towards the cabin crew and police spoke to the remaining stags about their behaviour before take off, Ms Illingworth added. Jet 2 said police arrested one passenger while two others were "issued with public order offences". "We apologise to all other customers for the inconvenience that this has caused at the start of their bank holiday weekend. "However, as a family-friendly airline we will not let the behaviour of a disruptive few spoil the flight for everyone else." The flight eventually departed at 17:57 - a delay of more than two hours.

The ‘mother of all bombs’ has a Boeing-built big brother Sat Apr 15th, 2017 2:45pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Scott Canon, The Kansas City Star KNOB NOSTER, Mo. — The giant “mother of all bombs” dropped on an Islamic State target in eastern Afghanistan this week was the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat. It’s the second-heaviest non-nuclear bomb in the American arsenal. A bigger version can be packed into the B-2 stealth bomber based at Whiteman Air Force Base near Knob Noster, Missouri. That 30,000-pound satellite-guided bomb — the Pentagon calls it the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator — might be considered the father of all bombs. The 22,000-pound bomb used in Afghanistan is the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or MOAB. It’s typically fused to detonate above its target and uses shock waves to destroy things on and below the ground. In contrast, the MOP was built to burrow into the ground and then explode. A B-2, which can carry up to 160 smaller bombs, can carry just two on a flight. Special cranes are needed to load the behemoths. In a recent interview with The Kansas City Star at Whiteman, B-2 pilot Lt. Col. Justin “Vapor” Grieve compared releasing 500-pound weapons like those used in a January attack over Libya to letting go of the 30,000-pound bombs in testing and training exercises. “The 500-pound weapon is pretty anti-climactic. What is exciting is when we release our 30,000-pound MOP, the Massive Ordnance Penetrator,” he said. “When you release that, you can feel it. The plane will actually raise up about 100 feet, and then it’ll settle back down. It’s pretty cool. It’s fun.” Some published reports suggest the MOP could dig 200 feet into the earth before its 5,300 pounds of explosives detonate. Analysts differ on whether that’s realistic. The bomb’s metal needed to be strong enough to withstand being dropped on a bunker, a target that might be made of steel-reinforced concrete, and its shape had to be slender enough to pierce the ground like a needle into your skin. The relatively skinny shape — they stretch 20.5 feet long with a 31.5-inch diameter — is why the heavier bomb made for the B-2 can carry less than a third as much H6 explosive as the MOAB. A 2005 paper published by the Union of Concerned Scientists discussed the potential damage of bunker-busting and its limits. “By exploding just a few meters underground instead of at or above the surface, a much larger fraction of the energy of the explosion is transmitted to the ground,” the document said. “The explosion creates a strong seismic shock wave that propagates and can crush or damage an underground bunker. … “Nevertheless, even nuclear weapons have limited effectiveness at destroying the deepest or widely separated underground bunkers,” the report continued. “For example, an earth penetrating weapon using the 1.2 megaton B83 warhead — the highest yield weapon in the U.S. nuclear stockpile — could crush underground bunkers to a depth of about 1,000 feet. Deeper bunkers can be constructed with modern tunneling equipment, and are essentially invulnerable to nuclear attack.” Boeing made 20 of the B-2’s bunker busters, delivered and tested in 2011, for $30 million. The Air Force has not said how many remain in the arsenal after testing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Analysts have long seen the MOP as a potential weapon to be used on deeply buried nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea. That’s one reason why they’ve been fitted to the B-2 bomber. The stealth jet is used rarely, typically on targets where air defenses pose a significant threat and a plane virtually invisible to radar can sneak through on a first-strike bombing run. In the recent Afghanistan bombing, the MOAB was dropped from an MC-130 cargo plane. Islamic State fighters on the ground had no way to shoot down a plane. That meant there would be little need to risk one of Whiteman’s 20 B-2s, jets that cost $2 billion-and-counting and are essentially irreplaceable. In Iran or North Korea, a jet without radar-dodging powers might easily get shot down. That makes the B-2 a more likely candidate — along with standoff weapons like the Tomahawk cruise missiles used earlier in April on a Syrian airfield. The MOAB was largely designed for what the military strategists consider “softer” targets — infantry troops and non-armored vehicles. It also could prove devastating for the sort of compound hit in Afghanistan, a relatively primitive tunnel complex that lacked the steel- or concrete-hardened bunkers found at critical locations in Iran or North Korea. “So if you’re trying to block cave entrances or collapse rudimentary tunnel complexes, you might use the MOAB,” said Mark Gunzinger, a former B-52 pilot and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “If you’re trying to penetrate a very hardened, very deep structure, you might want something to penetrate into the target or to a deep enough depth that you cause damage inside. “You have to select the kind of weapon you want to use,” he said. “It’s not always a bigger blast.”   Most Read Another Chick-Fil-A will land in Snohomish County BOTHELL — Consider the Chick-fil-A experiment in the Northwest a success.

(AP) - President Donald Trump plans to nominate a vocal critic of the U.S. Export-Import Bank to serve as its president. The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank's board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank's charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as "corporate welfare." "I opposed the House's vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism," he tweeted in 2015. It's a view he used to share with Trump - at least until this week. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. "I don't like it because I don't think it's necessary," he told Bloomberg, describing it as "sort of a featherbedding for politicians" and "a few companies." "And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don't like it. I think it's a lot of excess baggage," he added. But this week Trump announced he'd changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he now supports it. "It turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it," he said. "And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business." "So instinctively," he added, "you would say it's a ridiculous thing but actually it's a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money." The bank has been hobbled in recent years without enough board members to produce a quorum, blocking it from approving transactions exceeding $10 million. Much of the bank's financing benefits large corporation such as The Boeing Company, General Electric and Caterpillar Inc. Many moderate, business-minded Republican groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank. But vocal opponents, including many tea party Republicans and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation, have said it practices crony capitalism, awarding most of its financing to well-connected corporations. Trump's reversal on the subject is just one of several he's made in recent days as he approaches his 100th day in office. __ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank's board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank's charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as "corporate welfare." "I opposed the House's vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism," he tweeted in 2015. It's a view he used to share with Trump - at least until this week. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. "I don't like it because I don't think it's necessary," he told Bloomberg, describing it as "sort of a featherbedding for politicians" and "a few companies." "And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don't like it. I think it's a lot of excess baggage," he added. But this week Trump announced he'd changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he now supports it. "It turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it," he said. "And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business." "So instinctively," he added, "you would say it's a ridiculous thing but actually it's a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money." The bank has been hobbled in recent years without enough board members to produce a quorum, blocking it from approving transactions exceeding $10 million. Much of the bank's financing benefits large corporation such as The Boeing Company, General Electric and Caterpillar Inc. Many moderate, business-minded Republican groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank. But vocal opponents, including many tea party Republicans and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation, have said it practices crony capitalism, awarding most of its financing to well-connected corporations. Trump's reversal on the subject is just one of several he's made in recent days as he approaches his 100th day in office. __ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Former Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., who voted twice against reauthorizing the bank while in Congress, will be nominated as president of the bank. Separately, former Rep. Spencer Bachus III, R-Ala., is slated to be nominated to join the bank’s board. Both nominees require Congressional confirmation. Garrett, a deeply conservative Congressman who helped found the House Freedom Congress, has in the past heavily criticized the agency he may now be tasked with leading, calling it a “fund for corporate welfare” and “a bank that embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system” in a speech on the floor of the House in 2015. The bank, which offers financial support to U.S. exporters, is despised by conservative Republicans, who have forced it to remain effectively dormant for nearly two years. Yet the appointments themselves may allow the bank to resume lending in earnest, after being legally barred from acting by a lack of leadership. Advertisement Continue reading Trump opposed the bank during the campaign, but indicated he planned to reopen the bank for business in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday — one of several recent decisions by the president that suggest a shift in his views on economic policy. In the Wall Street Journal interview, Trump said that he had been “much opposed” to the Ex-Im Bank, until he realized that the bank helps small companies and that other countries offer similar assistance. “So instinctively you would say it’s a ridiculous thing but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money,” Trump said. Trump — who won the Republican nomination and the presidency on an agenda that eschewed conservative economic thinking — has adopted more orthodox GOP positions since taking office in January. Also Friday, his treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, declined to declare that China is manipulating its currency in an official report, pleasing economists and experts on trade but violating a promise that the president repeated frequently on the stump. Conservative lawmakers have lambasted the Export-Import Bank for years. The bank helps U.S. firms sell their products abroad by offering cheap, federally guaranteed loans and other forms of financial support. Opponents point out that the bulk of the assistance provided by the bank goes to major multinational firms, such as Boeing. In 2015, Trump called the bank’s support “feather bedding,” and said the benefits mainly went to “a few companies – and these are companies that can do very well without it.” How Garrett might alter the bank’s operations to win support from conservative Republicans remains to be seen. A conservative faction in Congress succeeded in shutting down the bank in 2015. The bank reopened later that year, but conservative lawmakers prevented then-President Obama from filling two vacancies on the board. As a result, the board lacked the quorum legally required for any consequential deals. Trump’s nominees — if confirmed by the Senate — would allow the bank to begin doing business again. Despite his history with the House Freedom Congress, Garrett also has ties to Wall Street, having chaired the powerful Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, which watches over financial institutions and the SEC. Garrett served as a representative in New Jersey, then represented the state in the House from 2003 to 2015. He was defeated in 2016 by former Clinton aide Josh Gottheimer. Bachus served in the House of Representatives from 1993 until he retired in 2015 and formerly chaired the House Financial Services Committee from 2011 to 2013. Bachus voted in favor of the bank while in Congress. Confirmation by the Senate is not assured. Last year, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the then-chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, prevented Obama’s nominees from reaching a vote on the floor. The current chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, could not immediately be reached for comment.

People know this and they're sick of it. They've even taken to the streets. It's a non-partisan outrage, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street. People are sick of the cronyism, and the Export-Import Bank is the epitome of that cronyism. Come September, lawmakers have a chance to put an end to this boondoggle. It should be a no-brainer for anyone who believes in markets and who see the immorality of giving subsidies to companies, whether they are big or small and domestic-based or foreign-based. It should also be easy since most of the bank's activities support large and successful companies which didn't wait for the handout to make some cash. In fact, some great research by Heritage Foundation's Diane Katz proves that the bank's stories about being the secret ingredient in the success and profits sauce of specific small businesses--including the bank's poster child Mrs. Jenny's Pickles--are quite misleading. But what about the claim that export subsidies are necessary to counteract the competitive disadvantages posed by the export credit agencies of foreign nations? Since foreign firms enjoy the benefits of their own national export subsidy organizations, the thinking goes, U.S. firms would struggle to compete internationally if our federal government did not provide similar aid. Obviously, U.S. exporters prefer that their companies only had to compete on price and quality against unsubsidized foreign companies. Bad economic policy is hardly limited to the U.S., and many countries have indeed established their own export-financing agencies just like the Export-Import Bank. This does not justify the bank’s existence, however. Congress recently obliged the bank to provide more explanations for certain portfolio transactions as a condition of its most recent reauthorization in 2012. While the bank does not provide justifications for all transactions in its portfolio, the bank’s current charter now compels Ex-Im to at least provide categorical explanations for all loans and long-term loan guarantees in its annual report. According to the Export-Import Bank's fiscal year 2013 annual report, roughly $7.9 billion in estimated export-valued loans and $10.7 billion in estimated export-valued long-term loan guarantees, or a combined estimated export value of $18.7 billion, must be categorized as Congress legislated. Here is how Ex-Im justifies its activities: $4.1 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “political risks,” another $2.1 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “private sector limitations,” and finally $12.2 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “foreign competition.” That leaves $18.8 billion in estimated export value, or 50.2 percent, of the rest of the bank’s portfolio unjustified. Since the estimated export value of the bank’s entire portfolio for fiscal year 2013 was roughly $37.4 billion, this means that less than one third of the estimated export value of the bank’s portfolio is intended to actually counteract competitive disadvantages wrought by foreign export credit agencies. What's more, much of this financing goes to large corporations that are unlikely to be incontrovertibly harmed by foreign export credit agencies. For instance, roughly 66 percent of the value designated to “meet competition from a foreign, officially-sponsored export-credit agency” went to the Boeing Corporation, whose own financial director publicly admitted could “find alternative funding sources” without the Export-Import Bank. The bottom line is that defending the Export-Import Bank on the grounds that it effectively counters foreign competition simply does not hold water. The Export-Import Bank backs less than 2 percent of the value of total U.S. exports. It means that more than 98 percent of U.S. exports take place without any support from the Ex-Im Bank. In addition, the Bank’s data show that it justifies less than 33 percent of this tiny portion on the grounds of countering foreign competition. In other words, the Bank claims to counteract 0.0066 percent of the value of U.S. exports that are exposed to foreign-subsidized competition. The Bank's effect in countering foreign subsidies is negligible, but its activities come at the great costs of corporate cronyism, economic distortions and irresponsible taxpayer exposure. It's time to retire the Export-Import Bank. CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the percentage of the value of U.S. exports that are exposed to foreign-subsidized competition the Export-Import Bank claims to counteract.

Garrett would fill the role of Ex-Im president for a four-year term. In the past, Garrett was openly critical of the Ex-Im Bank, tweeting in 2015: “I opposed the House’s vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism.” Garrett served as a New Jersey Republican congressman from 2003 to 2015 and was a state representative for 12 years prior. He was one of the nine founding members of the House Freedom Caucus. Bachus would be a member of the Ex-Im Bank’s Board of Directors. Bachus served in Congress from 1993 to 2015, representing Alabama, and at one point was chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. He supported the bank’s re-authorization, once saying the Ex-Im Bank “is available to help those small businesses compete and win in the global marketplace.” The Ex-Im Bank, the federal government’s export credit agency, has been targeted by groups like the Heritage Foundation and some free-market conservatives in the past — who argue it’s a form of corporate welfare that unduly benefits major companies, such as Boeing and Caterpillar. Re-authorizing the bank became a campaign issue during the 2014 midterm election and remained an issue of debate in Congress afterward. Opponents, such as then-Senate banking chairman Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, have tried to hobble it by not confirming nominees to its board. The bank has lacked full power in recent years because of those vacant seats, which means it can’t approve transactions over $10 million. On the campaign trail, Trump called the bank “featherbedding” for politicians and companies. “I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage. I think it’s unnecessary,” he told Bloomberg in August 2015. “And when you think about free enterprise, it’s really not free enterprise. I’d be against it.” But Trump appeared to reverse a number of his campaign trail positions in an interview published by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, including signaling support for the Ex-Im Bank. In the interview, Trump said the Ex-Im Bank helped small companies. “Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing?” Trump said. “But actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.” The White House did not return a request for comment.

Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said in a statement Friday evening that the nominations moved the bank's board "closer to becoming fully functional." "While I have reservations about his nominations and believe they need to be thoroughly vetted, this is a positive step toward helping the Bank do its job of delivering funds back to the taxpayers while supporting American businesses and workers," Heitkamp said. Despite his history with the House Freedom Caucus, Garrett also has ties to Wall Street, having chaired the powerful Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, which watches over financial institutions and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Garrett served as a representative in New Jersey, then represented the state in the House from 2003 to 2015. He was defeated in 2016 in a tough race against former Clinton aide Josh Gottheimer. Bachus served in the House of Representatives from 1993 until he retired in 2015 and formerly chaired the House Financial Services Committee from 2011 to 2013. Bachus voted in favor of the bank in 2012. Confirmation by the Senate is not assured. Last year, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), the then-chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, prevented Obama's nominees from reaching a vote on the floor. The current chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), could not immediately be reached for comment. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

(AP) — President Donald Trump plans to nominate a vocal critic of the U.S. Export-Import Bank to serve as its president. The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank's board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank's charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as "corporate welfare." "I opposed the House's vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism," he tweeted in 2015. It's a view he used to share with Trump — at least until this week. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. "I don't like it because I don't think it's necessary," he told Bloomberg, describing it as "sort of a featherbedding for politicians" and "a few companies." "And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don't like it. I think it's a lot of excess baggage," he added. But this week Trump announced he'd changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he now supports it. "It turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it," he said. "And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business." "So instinctively," he added, "you would say it's a ridiculous thing but actually it's a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money."

Many moderate, business-minded Republican groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank. But vocal opponents, including many tea party Republicans and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation, have said it practices crony capitalism, awarding most of its financing to well-connected corporations. Trump's reversal on the subject is just one of several he's made in recent days as he approaches his 100th day in office. __ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The dollar hit a session low after President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal he thought the currency was "getting too strong." As the safe-haven trade continued Wednesday, the 2-year yield fell to session lows around 1.22 percent, while the 10-year yield traded below the psychologically key 2.30 percent level. "Nothing seems to be happening or not happening as fast as people would like it to happen," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. Other traditional safe-haven assets rose, building on gains from Tuesday' session. Gold futures for June delivery rose $3.90 to settle at $1,275.50 per barrel, while the dollar hit its lowest level since November against the Japanese yen. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 15.6. "There's a lot of uncertainty that's really hard to model. That's why you're seeing this give-and-take [in stocks] and the uptick in volatility," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Moscow on Wednesday and received a barrage of criticism from several Russian officials. Tillerson said in a news conference Wednesday that U.S.-Russia relations are at a "low point" and need to improve. "The world's two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship," Tillerson said. All that said, stocks have held their ground this week. The three major indexes are just marginally lower for the week. "We are concerned about Syria and Russia, ... but at the same time we have a very resilient market," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "That could change if one of these geopolitical hotspots heats up, and there's no way to fully price that in." Geopolitical tensions have been brewing ahead of a highly anticipated earnings seasons. Earnings are expected to have grown around 10 percent in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales, meanwhile, are expected to have grown the most since 2011. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to report Thursday morning. Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, posted better-than-expected results, sending its stock higher in the premarket. Investors were also trying to get a sense of the Trump administration's priorities. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday he wants to tackle health care reform before implementing new tax policy. "I have to do healthcare first, I want to do it first to really do it right," Trump said. Stocks rallied after Trump was elected in part because of the prospects of lower taxes, deregulation and fiscal policy. "The market has known this for a while. He didn't say anything new," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "The question is how far along health care is, because depending on what they get done there, they'll know what kind of tax reform they can get." Financials were among the worst decliners as U.S. Treasury yields fell. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was last trading about 1 percent lower. The financials led the post-election market rally on promises of pro-growth policies but were trading lower for the year so far on Wednesday. Boeing and Goldman Sachs had the greatest negative impact on the Dow, which fell more than 50 points below its 50-day moving average, a level it has not closed under since Nov. 7. The S&P 500 also fell below its 50-day moving average with materials and industrials the worst performers. The index was also on track to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 8. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.4 percent. Crude oil prices struggled for gains and last traded 0.41 percent lower near $53.20 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a slightly larger-than-expected drawdown of 2.17 million barrels.

Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed – Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Search 16 C Harare Sunday, April 16, 2017 About Us Contact Us Advertising Listen to Radio Privacy Policy Who is Who News Alerts Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home Opinion Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed Opinion Popular Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed Apr 13, 2017 3 7914 By Ken Mufuka My research interest was in finding the Methodist connection with early African nationalism. From South Africa came Enoch Sontonga, a Shangani who bequeathed to us the anthem: Nkosi Sikelela iAfrica. Another giant who walked on this earth was Chief Albert Lithuli, president of the African National Congress (ANC), 1952-1967. Born in Zimbabwe at Hope Fountain Mission, Lithuli and his widowed mother settled at Endendale Methodist Mission in Natal. Both served as teachers and lay pastors in the Methodist faith. Lithuli biographer says that he was intolerant of hatred and adamant that the struggle for human dignity in South Africa should follow a non-violent path. His book, Let My People Go (1960) was regarded as offering a bridge between his native African culture and the Eurocentric culture, which dominated the world at the time. His acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize (1960) further alienated the Dutch racists in South Africa, who plotted his murder. It was Lithuli’s insistence against hatred of the Dutch racists that led to a breach in the ANC and the formation of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). The PAC’s appeal to the African youth was the belief that the only thing that a Dutchman understood was a bullet in the head. Here is the connection between the old and the new, personified in the person of South African President Jacob Zuma whose appeal and ideology, solidified in the Umkonto weSizwe, is expressed in his anthem: Bring me my machine gun. None of my hosts were familiar with Sontongo and Chief Lithuli who seemed to them like shadowy figures in the distant past. My taxi driver was enthusiastic about Zuma and was acquainted with the Economic Freedom Fighters. Events in South Africa inexorably diverted my attention to the bitter narrative that hangs on Zuma like an albatross. The narrative is that blacks (called Bantus in whispers) are indifferent to economic husbandry and that anybody other than an African will do well to handle the treasury. Therefore, the presence of Pravin Gordhan, of Asian origin, at the South African treasury, was a must, otherwise one day South Africa will wake up to find the treasury has been emptied. Gordhan made his entry into South African politics through the Natal Indian Congress, an offshoot of Mahatma Gandhi’s Indian Congress. If there is truth in this supposedly self-evident truth, and South Africa goes the way of Zimbabwe, then Africa is doomed. One of my hosts was a youngish white business couple that had migrated to Australia, in their wisdom, to escape the coming doom. They confirmed that there was a huge “capital migration” from South Africa — he was, but one example. Zuma has been implicated in the defence procurement scandals of 1999. When his financial advisor, Shabir Shaik, was thrown in jail for corruption in 2005, then president Thabo Mbeki removed Zuma from the vice presidency of the Republic. Zuma’s trial in 2006 for sexual abuse lasted several months further blackening his name. The Zulus have a different interpretation. There was bad blood between Mbeki and Zuma partly because Mbeki took liberties (assumed to be of a sexual nature) with Nkosazana Zuma (Zuma’s wife) who was foreign minister then. Mbeki, who saw himself as a philosopher king, despised Zuma, whose formal education is, but a bare thread. Zuma, married to four wives and with 20 children, claims to have a philosophy. This is the heart of the contention, that Afrocentric leaders are incapable of appreciating a constitutional form of government, which places limits on the ruler. That these nepotistic politicians serve their families and friends comes with the territory. State of Capture is a report by the Public Protector on the relationship between Zuma, son Duduzane and three Indian migrants, the Guptas. Within a short time, the Gupta brothers acquired a bank, a television station and an investment instrument. It is their non-transparent financial transactions that have provoked a crisis of confidence in the country itself. The Public Protector concluded that their influence on the Zuma family amounts to a stranglehold and that affairs of State are filtered through this nefarious family first, by-passing State institutions and the ANC. One example will suffice. Vytjie Mentor claimed that she was offered a job by the Guptas on condition she cancelled the South African Airways (SAA) flights to India. This story explains why Nick Bezuidenhout (35) a whiz kid at SAA was forced to leave and also why the parastatal engaged in unprofitable ventures. SAA’s collaboration with Lufthansa is profitable to the Germans, but drains passengers away from SAA. A Charlotte-Johannesburg ticket bought through SAA costs US$1 000 more than one bought through Lufthansa. As a result, a SAA 350-seat 747 Boeing from Munich to Johannesburg had less than 100 passengers. The Public Protector cites examples of similar style management at the electricity commission (Eskom) where Gupta Teget officials are in an incestuous relationship with Eskom managers. The narrative surrounding the management of South African parastatals reads like an old story to Zimbabweans. Eskom is like ZESA Holdings. SAA is like Air Zimbabwe. South African Railways is like the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ). Let us start by sending a girlfriend or a relative to such and such parastatal. Just for the heck of it, we can send another relative of a chef to ZESA. At NRZ, the board chairperson, Alvord Mabhena is informed by the national radio that he has been replaced by someone else. I woke up in Munich. It was all a dream.

The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank’s board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank’s charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as “corporate welfare.” “I opposed the House’s vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism,” he tweeted in 2015. It’s a view he used to share with Trump — at least until this week. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. “I don’t like it because I don’t think it’s necessary,” he told Bloomberg, describing it as “sort of a featherbedding for politicians” and “a few companies.” “And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage,” he added. But this week Trump announced he’d changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he now supports it. “It turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it,” he said. “And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business.” The bank has been hobbled in recent years without enough board members to produce a quorum, blocking it from approving transactions exceeding $10 million. Much of the bank’s financing benefits large corporation such as The Boeing Company, General Electric and Caterpillar Inc. Republican groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank. But vocal opponents, including many Republicans and outside groups such as the Heritage Foundation, have said it practices crony capitalism, awarding most of its financing to well-connected corporations.

Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed – Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Search 16 C Harare Sunday, April 16, 2017 About Us Contact Us Advertising Listen to Radio Privacy Policy Who is Who News Alerts Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home Opinion Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed Opinion Popular Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed Apr 13, 2017 3 7915 By Ken Mufuka My research interest was in finding the Methodist connection with early African nationalism. From South Africa came Enoch Sontonga, a Shangani who bequeathed to us the anthem: Nkosi Sikelela iAfrica. Another giant who walked on this earth was Chief Albert Lithuli, president of the African National Congress (ANC), 1952-1967. Born in Zimbabwe at Hope Fountain Mission, Lithuli and his widowed mother settled at Endendale Methodist Mission in Natal. Both served as teachers and lay pastors in the Methodist faith. Lithuli biographer says that he was intolerant of hatred and adamant that the struggle for human dignity in South Africa should follow a non-violent path. His book, Let My People Go (1960) was regarded as offering a bridge between his native African culture and the Eurocentric culture, which dominated the world at the time. His acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize (1960) further alienated the Dutch racists in South Africa, who plotted his murder. It was Lithuli’s insistence against hatred of the Dutch racists that led to a breach in the ANC and the formation of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). The PAC’s appeal to the African youth was the belief that the only thing that a Dutchman understood was a bullet in the head. Here is the connection between the old and the new, personified in the person of South African President Jacob Zuma whose appeal and ideology, solidified in the Umkonto weSizwe, is expressed in his anthem: Bring me my machine gun. None of my hosts were familiar with Sontongo and Chief Lithuli who seemed to them like shadowy figures in the distant past. My taxi driver was enthusiastic about Zuma and was acquainted with the Economic Freedom Fighters. Events in South Africa inexorably diverted my attention to the bitter narrative that hangs on Zuma like an albatross. The narrative is that blacks (called Bantus in whispers) are indifferent to economic husbandry and that anybody other than an African will do well to handle the treasury. Therefore, the presence of Pravin Gordhan, of Asian origin, at the South African treasury, was a must, otherwise one day South Africa will wake up to find the treasury has been emptied. Gordhan made his entry into South African politics through the Natal Indian Congress, an offshoot of Mahatma Gandhi’s Indian Congress. If there is truth in this supposedly self-evident truth, and South Africa goes the way of Zimbabwe, then Africa is doomed. One of my hosts was a youngish white business couple that had migrated to Australia, in their wisdom, to escape the coming doom. They confirmed that there was a huge “capital migration” from South Africa — he was, but one example. Zuma has been implicated in the defence procurement scandals of 1999.

Mbeki, who saw himself as a philosopher king, despised Zuma, whose formal education is, but a bare thread. Zuma, married to four wives and with 20 children, claims to have a philosophy.

The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration said on Thursday that the U.S Air Force completed the first qualification flight test of the B61-12 gravity bomb on March 14 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. According to the National Nuclear Security Administration, the non-nuclear test assembly was dropped from an F-16 based at Nellis Air Force Base. The test evaluated both the weapon’s non-nuclear functions as well as the aircraft’s capability to deliver the weapon. This event is the first of a series that will be conducted over the next three years to qualify the B61-12 for service. Three successful development flight tests were conducted in 2015. “This demonstration of effective end-to-end system performance in a realistic ballistic flight environment marks another on-time achievement for the B61-12 Life Extension Program,” said Brig. Gen. Michael Lutton, NNSA’s principal assistant deputy administrator for military application. “The successful test provides critical qualification data to validate that the baseline design meets military requirements. It reflects the nation’s continued commitment to our national security and that of our allies and partners.” The flight test included hardware designed by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, manufactured by the Nuclear Security Enterprise plants, and mated to the tail-kit assembly section, designed by the Boeing Company under contract with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. The B61-12 consolidates and replaces four B61 bomb variants in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. The first production unit is scheduled to be completed by March 2020, the National Nuclear Security Administration said. ← Justice Deferred: 15 Year Anniversary Of Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission Verdict – OpEd USS Stethem Operates In South China Sea → You May Also Like Defense Secretary Mattis Issues Message to Nation’s ‘Sentinels And Guardians’ – Statement January 21, 2017 Eurasia Review 0 Bangladesh Joins Saudi-Led Anti-Terror Coalition To Fight Radicalization – Analysis January 5, 2016 South Asia Monitor 0 Ron Paul: What Markets Are Telling Us – OpEd February 15, 2016 Ron Paul 0 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
