With the help of the international non-profit organization Vital Voices, whose mission is to invest in and empower women leaders, the airline’s 22nd Next-Generation 737-800 will transport and deliver nearly 30 boxes full of relief items including clothes and school supplies. The items are headed to The Children’s Advocacy Center Thailand (ACT), a non-profit organization dedicated to better the lives of abused children and youth in Thailand. Representatives from ACT will deliver the aid to impacted children and youth throughout Thailand. “We are honored to play an important role for the well-being of our children and youth,” said Nok Air CEO Patee Sarasin. “Providing timely supplies to those in need will affect the lives of many in the region. Nok Air is proud to continue playing a vital role in cultivating the well-being of our community.” As part of the Global Corporate Citizenship program, Boeing is committed to building better communities worldwide. “We are honored that Nok Air partnered with The Boeing Company to deliver humanitarian aid to the many children in Thailand who are in need,” said Sam Whiting, Director, Global Corporate Citizenship, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We look forward to working closely with Nok Air and non-profit organizations like ACT in Thailand to identify future opportunities.” Based in Bangkok, Thailand, Nok Air is a low-cost carrier that operates an all-Boeing fleet.

As per the original plan, Jet was expected to receive the first of the ten Boeing 787 on order from last quarter of 2017 but now the airline management has pushed back the induction. "At Jet Airways we continuously review our fleet and network strategy. We are currently upgrading capacity on key international routes by deploying the six Boeing 777 aircraft which are returning from lease. A decision on the induction of additional wide body aircraft will be based on the outcome of the review," a Jet Airways spokesperson said in an emailed response. The spokesperson did not state when the airline will start receiving the 787s but a source indicated it is likely to receive them from 2019. A Boeing spokesperson did not immediately respond to the query on the topic. Jet Airways ordered ten Boeing 787 aircraft in 2006. Its original order was for the 787-8 varaint (flown by Air India) but later the airline converted it to the bigger variant (787-9) which has a longer range and higher seat capacity (290 in a standard two class configuration). The 787-9 has a list price of $ 264.6 million. Jet Airways has 116 aircraft including a mix of narrow body 737s, wide bodies Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s and turboprop ATR-42 aircraft. Recently it announced deployment of the Boeing 777 aircraft on Amsterdam, Dubai and Singapore routes following return of leased planes from Etihad. Three A330s are on lease with Turkish Airlines and will return to Jet in 2020. Jet Airways has 75 Boeing 737s Max on order due for delivery in 2018 and currently most of its capacity enhancement has been through improved better utilisation. While rival IndiGo plans to add 24 Airbus A320 aircraft in the current fiscal, Jet Airways has no additional 737 planes entering its service this year. As such its passenger growth is slower than IndiGo and its market share too fell 2.1 percentage points to 19.1 in June on a year on year basis. The airline posted its fifth consecutive profit in Q1 FY 17 but profit fell 44 per cent to Rs 126 crore on a year on year basis as it was impacted by decline in yields. Analysts say Jet Airways' fleet requirements have always been constrained due to its limited long distance international network and the airline has been leasing bulk of its Boeing 777 planes to foreign airlines since 2009. "It would behoove Jet to replace their ageing Boeing 777 fleet with the fuel efficient long range 787-9s before the aircraft lose their market value like the Airbus 330-200s," said Devesh Agarwal, editor of aviation blog Bangalore Aviation.   Aneesh Phadnis Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 7 Indian companies among top 200 carbon clean firms Business Standard Jet Airways defers Boeing 787 induction According to a source, the airline will start receiving the 787s from 2019 Aneesh Phadnis  |  Mumbai  August 18, 2016 Last Updated at 00:40 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

The 787-9 has a list price of $ 264.6 million. Jet Airways has 116 aircraft including a mix of narrow body 737s, wide bodies Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s and turboprop ATR-42 aircraft. Recently it announced deployment of the Boeing 777 aircraft on Amsterdam, Dubai and Singapore routes following return of leased planes from Etihad. Three A330s are on lease with Turkish Airlines and will return to Jet in 2020. Jet Airways has 75 Boeing 737s Max on order due for delivery in 2018 and currently most of its capacity enhancement has been through improved better utilisation. While rival IndiGo plans to add 24 Airbus A320 aircraft in the current fiscal, Jet Airways has no additional 737 planes entering its service this year. As such its passenger growth is slower than IndiGo and its market share too fell 2.1 percentage points to 19.1 in June on a year on year basis. The airline posted its fifth consecutive profit in Q1 FY 17 but profit fell 44 per cent to Rs 126 crore on a year on year basis as it was impacted by decline in yields. Analysts say Jet Airways' fleet requirements have always been constrained due to its limited long distance international network and the airline has been leasing bulk of its Boeing 777 planes to foreign airlines since 2009. "It would behoove Jet to replace their ageing Boeing 777 fleet with the fuel efficient long range 787-9s before the aircraft lose their market value like the Airbus 330-200s," said Devesh Agarwal, editor of aviation blog Bangalore Aviation.   Aneesh Phadnis Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Widgets Magazine MORE ON MARKETS: Quick Links Stock Market Live Portfolio Commodity Market Upcoming IPO Personal Finance Stock Market News Derivatives Mutual Funds Gold Price Sensex Browse STOCK Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Browse Mutual Funds A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Index Stocks ACC Adani Ports Ambuja Cem.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com CAPE CANAVERAL AIR FORCE STATION, FL — A new ‘Stairway to Heaven’ which American astronauts will soon stride along as “the last place on Earth” departure point aboard our next generation of human spaceships, was at long last hoisted into place at the ULA Atlas rocket launch pad on Florida’s Space Coast on Monday Aug 15, at an “awesome” media event witnessed by space journalists including Universe Today. “This is awesome,” Chris Ferguson, a former shuttle commander who is now Boeing’s deputy program manager for the company’s Commercial Crew Program told Universe Today in an exclusive interview at the launch pad – after workers finished installing the spanking new Crew Access Arm walkway for astronauts leading to the hatch of Boeing’s Starliner ‘Space Taxi.’ Starliner will ferry crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS) as soon as 2018. “It’s great to see the arm up there,” Ferguson elaborated to Universe Today. “I know it’s probably a small part of the overall access tower. But it’s the most significant part!” “We used to joke about the 195 foot level on the shuttle pad as being ‘the last place on Earth.” “This will now be the new ‘last place on Earth’! So we are pretty charged up about it!” Ferguson gushed.

Credit: Dawn Leek Taylor Under hot sunny skies portending the upcoming restoration of America’s ability to once again launch American astronauts from American soil when American rockets ignite, the newly constructed 50-foot-long, 90,000-pound ‘Crew Access Arm and White Room’ was lifted and mated to the newly built ‘Crew Access Tower’ at Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) on Monday morning, Aug. 15. “We talked about how the skyline is changing here and this is one of the more visible changes.” The Boeing CST-100 Starliner crew capsule stacked atop the venerable United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket at pad 41 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida will launch crews to the massive orbiting science outpost continuously soaring some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Space workers, enthusiasts and dreamers alike have been waiting years for this momentous day to happen. And I was thrilled to observe all the action firsthand along with the people who made it happen from NASA, United Launch Alliance, Boeing, the contractors – as well as to experience it with my space media colleagues. “All the elements that we talked about the last few years are now reality,” Ferguson told me. The Crew Access Arm and White Room for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft approaches the notch for mating to the Crew Access Tower at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 41 at level 13 on Aug. 15, 2016, as workers observe from upper tower level. Astronauts will walk through the arm to board the Starliner spacecraft stacked atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com Attaching the access arm is vital and visual proof that at long last America means business and that a renaissance in human spaceflight will commence in some 18 months or less when commercially built American crew capsules from Boeing and SpaceX take flight to the heavens above – and a new space era of regular, robust and lower cost space flights begins. It took about an hour for workers to delicately hoist the gleaming grey steel and aluminum white ‘Stairway to Heaven’ by crane into place at the top of the tower – at one of the busiest launch pads in the world! It’s about 130 feet above the pad surface since it’s located at the 13th level of the tower. The install work began at about 7:30 a.m. EDT as we watched a work crew lower a giant grappling hook and attach cables. Then they carefully raised the arm off the launch pad surface by crane. The arm had been trucked to the launch pad on Aug. 11. The tower itself is comprised of segmented tiers that were built in segments just south of the pad. They were stacked on the pad over the past few months – in between launches. Altogether they form a nearly 200-foot-tall steel structure. Another crew stationed in the tower about 160 feet above ground waited as the arm was delicately craned into the designated notch. The workers then spent several more hours methodically bolting and welding the arm to the tower to finish the assembly process. Indeed Monday’s installation of the Crew Access Arm and White Room at pad 41 basically completes the construction of the first new Crew Access Tower at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station since the Apollo moon landing era of the 1960s. “It is the first new crew access structure at the Florida spaceport since the space shuttle’s Fixed Service Structures were put in place before Columbia’s first flight in 1981,” say NASA officials. Overall the steel frame of the massive tower weighs over a million pounds. For perspective, destination ISS now weighs in at about a million pounds in low Earth orbit. Construction of the tower began about 18 months ago. “You think about when we started building this 18 months ago and now it’s one of the most visible changes to the Cape’s horizon since the 1960s,” said Ferguson at Monday’s momentous media event. “It’s a fantastic day.” The White Room is an enclosed area at the end of the Crew Access Arm. It big enough for astronauts to make final adjustments to their suits and is spacious enough for technicians to assist the astronauts climbing aboard the spacecraft and get tucked into their seats in the final hours before liftoff. “You have to stop and celebrate these moments in the craziness of all the things we do,” said Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, at the event. “It’s going to be so cool when our astronauts are walking out across this access arm to get on the spacecraft and go to the space station.” The Crew Access Arm was built by Saur at NASA’s nearby off site facility at Oak Hill. And when Starliner takes flight it will hearken back to the dawn of the Space Age. “John Glenn was the first to fly on an Atlas, now our next leap into the future will be to have astronauts launch from here on Atlas V,” said Barb Egan, program manager for Commercial Crew for ULA.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The Boeing CST 100 Starliner is one of two private astronaut capsules – along with the SpaceX Crew Dragon – being developed under a CCP commercial partnership contract with NASA to end our sole reliance on Russia for crew launches back and forth to the International Space Station (ISS). The goal of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program since its inception in 2010 is to restore America’s capability to launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil to the ISS, as soon as possible. Furthermore when the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon become operational the permanent resident ISS crew will grow to 7 – enabling a doubling of science output aboard the science laboratory. This significant growth in research capabilities will invaluably assist NASA in testing technologies and human endurance in its agency wide goal of sending humans on a ‘Journey to Mars’ by the 2030s with the mammoth Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion deep space capsule concurrently under full scale development by the agency. The next key SLS milestone is a trest firing of the RS-25 main engines at NASA Stennis this Thursday, Aug. 18 – watch for my onsite reports! Boeing was awarded a $4.2 Billion contract in September 2014 by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden to complete development and manufacture of the CST-100 Starliner space taxi under the agency’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program and NASA’s Launch America initiative. Since the retirement of NASA’s space shuttle program in 2011, the US was been 100% dependent on the Russian Soyuz capsule for astronauts rides to the ISS at a cost exceeding $70 million per seat. When will Ferguson actually set foot inside the walkway? “I am hoping to get up there and walk through there in a couple of weeks or so when it’s all strapped in and done. I want to see how they are doing and walk around.” How does the White Room fit around Starliner and keep it climate controlled? “The end of the white room has a part that slides up and down and moves over and slides on top of the spacecraft when it’s in place.” “There is an inflatable seal that forms the final seal to the spacecraft so that you have all the appropriate humidity control and the purge without the Florida atmosphere inside the crew module,” Ferguson replied. Up close, mid-air view of Crew Access Arm and front of White Room during installation.

The Atlas will be augmented with two solid rocket motors on the first stage and a dual engine Centaur upper stage. How confident is Ferguson about meeting the 2018 launch target? “The first crew flight is scheduled for February 2018. I am confident.” Ferguson responded. “And we have a lot of qualification to get through between now and then. But barring any large unforeseen issues we can make it.” The Crew Access Tower after installation of the Crew Access Arm and White Room for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft on Aug. 15, 2016 at Space Launch Complex 41 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fl.

YouTube NASA Johnson By Avery Thompson Aug 17, 2016 Starting in 2017, Boeing and SpaceX will become the first private companies to send NASA astronauts into orbit. When that happens, the International Space Station is going to need a new space parking space. So, on Friday, astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will venture outside the ISS to finish installing a new docking adapter. Installing these adapters is a necessary step in NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which seeks to spur development of commercial crew spacecraft. Since the space shuttle was discontinued in 2011, NASA has had to pay Russia million to take its astronauts to the ISS. The Commercial Crew Program will give NASA cheaper options in crewed spaceflight.

There's more to buying a Dow dividend stock than just focusing on yield. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Aug 17, 2016 at 12:44PM Image source: Getty Images. Dividend investors look to maximize their income, and the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) are a natural starting point for those seeking high-quality companies with solid histories of dividend payments. Below, you'll see the 10 current top-yielding Dow dividend stocks; but the bigger question you need to answer is whether they have the right mix of future growth to go along with their proven track record of dividend success. The 10 highest dividend yields in the Dow Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow as of Aug. 17: Stock Dividend Yield Verizon (NYSE:VZ) 4.4% Chevron (NYSE:CVX) 4.2% Caterpillar 3.7% Pfizer 3.6% IBM 3.6% Cisco Systems 3.6% Boeing (NYSE:BA) 3.6% ExxonMobil 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.3% McDonald's 3.2% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. There are a couple of things you can see at first glance looking at this list. First, the telecom industry has sustained its reputation for paying healthy dividends, with Verizon topping the chart. Even after the replacement of AT&T as a former Dow component, the healthy cash flow that Verizon and its telecom peers produce make the sector a popular one for dividend investors. Some smaller telecoms pay even higher yields, but Verizon has done a good job of balancing its dedication to shareholders against the need to reinvest in building out its wireless network infrastructure to stay ahead of its competition. Verizon has generated impressive double-digit average annual returns for shareholders over the long haul, and its dividend has played a key element in adding to the stock's overall total return. Also, the Dow dividend list is full of stocks that have struggled recently. The most obvious area in turmoil is the energy sector, where crude oil prices have plunged from triple-digit levels a couple of years ago to below $50 per barrel currently. That has created challenges for energy companies like Dow components Chevron and ExxonMobil, and Chevron, in particular, has had to work hard in order to pick up the slack from weak oil and natural gas prices. Still, the company has managed to find lucrative sources for future production, and the healthy dividend has helped give investors greater confidence about Chevron's long-term ability to stay profitable, even if oil prices don't recover fully in the near term. Similarly, Caterpillar has suffered from a poor environment in commodities, and IBM and Cisco are both having to reorient themselves to a mobile-driven world in which PCs play a less-vital role. One industry where growth is flying higher Perhaps the most-surprising entrant on this list is Boeing, which is going through one of the best periods in its history. The commercial aerospace industry has been on fire for several years now, and consolidation among major airlines has helped them find profits that they've used to upgrade their fleets, and make massive orders for new aircraft from Boeing and rival Airbus. Skeptics will point to Boeing's most-recent earnings report, in which the aircraft manufacturer took massive one-time charges that caused it to report a loss for the quarter. Out of a total of $3 billion in pre-tax charges, $1 billion was related to decisions not to try to sell two early production 787 Dreamliner aircraft, while others came from cutting its 747 production projections, and from cost overruns related to its KC-46 Pegasus military tanker aircraft. However, even though earnings guidance for the full year fell because of the charges, Boeing actually expects better operational results than it previously did once you adjust for those charges. Strong margins have helped bolster profitability, and orders for the always-popular 737 model line are offsetting weakness in the wider-body 777 and 787 models. As long as airlines remain profitable -- and they show few signs of losing their profitability in the near future -- then Boeing should be able to capitalize on strong demand from its customers. It's always tempting simply to pick top-yielding stocks without further examination. But looking beyond the yield to examine growth prospects can save you from costly mistakes. Although dividend investors are hoping for further share-price bounces from Chevron, Caterpillar, and other Dow stocks that have seen their businesses affected by recent macroeconomic woes, Boeing has the history of success that has it at the top of its game right now.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 17, 2016 at 10:47AM The Pentagon wants to put a new GPS satellite in space -- and must pick between SpaceX and United Launch Alliance to Get it there. IMAGE SOURCE: Getty Images. Whom would you bet on: David, or Goliath? SpaceX, or Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)? At long last, the U.S. Air Force hopes to put these two contenders -- SpaceX in the role of David, and Boeing and Lockheed's United Launch Alliance wearing Goliath's sandals -- in a head-to-head competition next month. As announced earlier this month, the USAF has just issued a request for proposals to launch its next GPS III communications satellite into orbit. And unlike the last time one of these contracts went up for bid, both SpaceX and ULA are expected to compete. A bit of history Historically, the launching of "national security" payloads -- large, expensive, complex and sensitive satellites crucial to the military's ability to operate globally -- has been the domain of ULA, and for good reason. As the Air Force remarked in its announcement, "under the previous phase 1 strategy, United Launch Alliance (ULA) was the only certified launch provider." (Emphasis added.) That changed in May 2015, however, when the Air Force certified SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle as capable to launch these payloads. This decision opened up contracts for the next nine  GPS III launches to competitive bidding by both ULA and SpaceX. Or at least it should have. In fact, because of a legislative quirk that temporarily restricted ULA's ability to use Russian-made rocket engines on national security launches, ULA declared itself unable to bid on the first GPS III delivery in the series. SpaceX then handily beat out the only other bidder (to this date, still unidentified) on the contract. What's more, it wasn't even a close decision. The Air Force reportedly marveled  at SpaceX's bid of $82.7 million to launch the satellite, a bid that was apparently "40% less" than the Air Force had expected to pay. Once more, with feeling In contrast to the last round, both SpaceX and ULA are expected to bid on GPS III this time. And this sets up a real cage match of a contract showdown. In one corner stands SpaceX, the Wal-Mart of space launch, offering "always low prices" to its customers -- with the added excitement of not knowing if the launch will turn into a spectacular fireball. In the other corner is ULA, which has conducted at least 109 straight space launches without mishap -- and may have hit 110 by the time you read this. (ULA has another launch scheduled for Friday, August 19 ). If SpaceX's challenge is establishing a long record of success in a short period of time, then ULA's Achilles' heel is price. By its own admission, ULA is incapable of launching a satellite into orbit for anything less than $164 million -- twice SpaceX's price. According to the Air Force, it's going to pick a winner while seeking "a balance between mission success/operational needs, and lowering launch costs." But in the end, the choice must still come down to picking ULA for its reliability, or SpaceX for its low price. Inflection point If ULA wins this contest, it will mean price is not dispositive in the Air Force's decision-making -- or at the very least, that the Air Force wants to wait and see SpaceX execute its first GPS contract (launch window: May 2018), before risking a switch from proven provider ULA. On the other hand, if the Air Force goes ahead and picks SpaceX this time, then the situation for ULA starts looking really grim, really fast. This would mean that price is the deciding factor. And if SpaceX starts developing a record of success with Air Force launches, that will remove any valid reason to award future contracts to ULA, unless it can find a way to drastically reduce launch costs. That could force United Launch Alliance out of the military space launch business, and deal a serious blow to the profitability of both Boeing's and Lockheed Martin's space divisions. One way or the other, we should know the answer soon. Both companies' bids are due by Sept. 19, with the Air Force's decision to follow shortly thereafter.

Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Aug 17, 2016 at 8:20AM Image source: Getty Images With literally thousands of options from which to choose, it can be an intimidating task for new investors to sift through all the intriguing businesses our stock market has to offer. But finding the best stocks doesn't have to be daunting. To help get the ball rolling, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to each pick a cheap stock they believe could serve as a starting point for rookie investors to build their portfolios. A bargain biotech for the long haul Todd Campbell: It may be tempting to invest in that speculative biotech with the early-stage game changer, but a better way for new investors to dip their toes into this complex industry is to focus on bellwethers with a been-there-done-that pedigree. Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) record of developing and launching billion-dollar blockbuster medicine is envy-inspiring, and given that sales are roughly $30 billion and the coffers are stuffed with $24.6 billion in cash, there's plenty of financial firepower handy to advance new drugs to market. The company makes its money selling market-share-leading therapies for HIV and hepatitis C, and new medicines in those indications are likely to keep them atop the podium. In the pipeline, the company's got intriguing drugs targeting multibillion-dollar indications, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, an increasingly common cause of liver failure, and rheumatoid arthritis, a multibillion market. What makes Gilead Sciences even more attractive, however, is its price. A slowing in top-line sales growth stemming from a maturing market for hepatitis C has led to investors shunning the stock for faster-growing peers. However, that short-term thinking could be creating a great long-term opportunity for investors. Despite the fact that the company works on a packed pipeline of potential new drugs, investors can buy this stock for only 6.8 times forward earnings. That's incredibly cheap for the industry, and it marks a multiyear low valuation for the company. GILD PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts. A company poised to fly higher Daniel Miller: Being a rookie investor, and there's no shame in that, means you have a lot to learn about the market. That takes time. In my opinion, that means one of your first investments should be in a larger company with competitive advantages, that isn't being displaced by competition any time soon. One company that fits the bill is definitely The Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA). Boeing's competitive advantages are rooted with the commercial aircraft industry itself. It takes a long history of technical knowledge to design, assemble, and certify commercial aircraft. Boeing operates the majority of its business in a highly regulated industry that few newcomers dare to try and break into -- when it comes to commercial aircraft, it's basically Boeing, Airbus, or bust. Another perk for Boeing investors is the company's huge backlog of orders. It takes years to build these aircraft, and when demand is strong, so is the company's revenue visibility. Consider that Boeing has a backlog of over 5,700 commercial aircraft, which is basically five years of revenue. One of Boeing's goals during the near term is to continue ramping up production of its commercial aircraft. Boeing's 737 is a prime example: Its production per month will increase from about 41 planes currently to 52 per month in 2018. On top of it all, Boeing has another catalyst with its defense business. It's been a tough area over the past few years as U.S. defense spending has been slashed, but the bottom of that cycle appears to have arrived, and if government spending returns, Boeing stands to benefit. All in all, Boeing has a well-protected business, a robust backlog, a potential catalyst with its defense business, and it's trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 13, according to Morningstar estimates. With these characteristics, it's a pretty strong candidate to own in a rookie investor portfolio. Focusing on the long term will pay off Steve Symington: I think now is a great time to pick up PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Shares of the digital-payments platform leader plunged last month despite not only turning in stronger-than-expected second-quarter 2016 results, but also raising its full-year outlook. Adjusted revenue jumped 16% year over year (19% at constant currency) during the quarter, to $2.65 billion, and PayPal highlighted the fact it gained market share during the quarter, with total payment volume jumping 29% year over year, to $86 billion -- significantly faster than the overall growth rate of the e-commerce industry. But investors were more concerned with PayPal's simultaneously expanded strategic partnership with Visa, under which PayPal agreed to stop directing its customers to link bank accounts instead of credit cards to its platform. Because Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers are cheaper for PayPal to facilitate than credit card transactions, this could mean PayPal will be facing margin pressures in the near term. But the agreement also gives PayPal access to Visa's tokenization services for in-store PayPal transactions, which will accelerate adoption of PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are accepted. Over the long term, I think the benefits of this deal more than outweigh the near-term drawbacks. And with shares trading at 22 times next year's expected earnings -- a reasonable premium given the company's market-beating growth -- I think any patient, long-term investor would do well to have PayPal as a core position in his or her portfolio. Daniel Miller has no position in any stocks mentioned. Steve Symington has no position in any stocks mentioned. Todd Campbell owns shares of Gilead Sciences and PayPal Holdings.

(File/News 13) By Jerry Hume, Reporter Last Updated: Wednesday, August 17, 2016, 1:18 PM EDT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER --  NASA is preparing the International Space Station for the return of American spaceships this week. International Docking Adapter to be installed at ISS Will ensure SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft can connect to ISS Astronauts will perform spacewalk Friday to install the adapter An International Docking Adapter will be installed at the ISS. That docking adapter will ensure both SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft can connect with the ISS when they launch astronauts from Florida in the next year or so. Ground controllers on Wednesday will use the space station’s robotic Canada-Arm to pull the docking adapter out of the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule. That capsule launched last month from the Space Coast. The robotic arm will position the docking adapter to just three feet away from the space station. Then on Friday, two NASA astronauts will conduct a spacewalk to install the docking adapter to the ISS. “We’re excited to see this tangible change in the space station,” said Steve Stich with NASA Commercial Crew Program. “The space station has been changing the last year for our flights. And now once we have this new door on the front of the space station I think for us it really marks it’s time for us to get our hardware ready to go fly.” NASA has contracted both Boeing and SpaceX to build spacecraft that will carry astronauts to and from the ISS, starting in late 2017 or early 2018. Those astronauts will launch from Florida’s Space Coast. Also on Wednesday, NASA will provide a brief on their next big unmanned mission. They plan to launch a spacecraft that will travel to an asteroid, collect a sample of its minerals, and then return to Earth. That mission will launch September 8, also from the Space Coast.

The Boeing landed safely after possibly blowing a tyre. It was carrying 31 people at the time. Mr Mark has an issue with Air Force planes being used for prime ministerial travel. "Given we can charter commercial aircraft when required, we'd rather see military aircraft in RNZAF service, and not being mainly used to fly the prime minister around as the 757s do," he said. "We have a perfectly decent state airline that can do that job." Mr Mark says the 757s - the Air Force has two of them - are maintenance-heavy and fly far fewer hours than they would in commercial service. "The Boeing 757s flew only 571 average annual flight hours between January 2013 and September 2015," he said citing information gained under the Official Information Act. "That's only about one-fifth of what a 757 flies in commercial service." Emergency services were called to the landing of the aircraft at Whenuapai Airbase on Monday morning. It landed safely shortly after 10am, following several passes over the landing strip. Air force crews were checking the aircraft for overheating with thermal imaging cameras, the Fire Service said. The 757 experienced vibrations on take off from Whenuapai and was forced to return, a Defence Force spokesperson says. "An investigation into the incident will be held and no further comment will be made until that is complete," she said.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor NASA previews spacewalk to install IDA-2 Derek Richardson August 16th, 2016 The Boeing-built International Docking Adapter 2 (IDA-2) prior to its installation in the CRS-9 Dragon trunk. Two NASA astronauts will install the adapter on Friday, Aug. 19. Photo Credit: NASA Two members of the International Space Station’s (ISS) Expedition 48 crew will be performing a spacewalk this Friday to install an International Docking Adapter (IDA) on the forward end of the station. The docking ring was brought up on SpaceX’s CRS-9 Dragon mission and has been sitting inside the spacecraft’s trunk since arriving at the orbiting outpost one month ago. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 36 will be performed by Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins. This is a spacewalk that has been in the planning stages for a number of years. It was supposed to occur last summer with members of Expedition 44. However, due to a launch mishap in June 2015 that resulted in the loss of both the Falcon 9 and CRS-7 Dragon, IDA-1 was lost. This adapter, IDA-2, is the second to be built. A third is currently being manufactured by Boeing as a replacement for IDA-1 utilizing spare parts. Both will be used to support SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner in the coming years. The CRS-9 Dragon is berthed to the Earth-facing port of Harmony. The International Docking Adapter is located inside the trunk. Photo Credit: NASA “This EVA that we’re going to be doing on Friday represents a very significant milestone on the path to establishing a commercial crew capability on board the ISS, so we’re very excited,” said Kenny Todd, ISS Operations Integration manager. “We’ve had this in the queue for quite a while. We were going to try to do this last summer, but things didn’t go our way, so here we are back again in August of 2016. We’re staring at the IDA daily in the SpaceX trunk and we’re ready to go put it on board.” An adapter for the adapter The reason these adapters are being sent to orbit is that a new docking standard has been developed for use by spacecraft. The International Docking System Standard (IDSS) was created by the ISS Multilateral Coordination Board, which includes NASA, Roscosmos, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The design uses low-impact technology and allows for both docking and berthing. It can also support autonomous or piloted dockings. Additionally, the design allows for the transfer of power, data, commands, and communication. Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corporation (with their Dream Chaser Cargo System) plan to utilize the IDSS for their crew and cargo vehicles. Currently, on the U.S. side of the station, the Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA) utilize the APAS-95 docking system, which was Russian-designed. It was selected for the Space Shuttle to allow for dockings with the Mir space station in the mid-1990s. The design remained unchanged for the ISS program. PMAs themselves convert the Common Berthing Mechanism (the main ports between U.S. Orbital Segment space station modules) to the APAS-95 The IDSS is not compatible with the APAS-95 system. The IDA converts the Russian design to the NASA docking standard, which is the agency’s implementation of the IDSS. IDA-2 pre-positioning On Wednesday, the ground robotics team will command the robotic Canadarm2 with the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (Dextre) robotic “hand” attached to the end of the arm. The arm will use Dextre to grab the IDA-2 inside the trunk and move it to the forward end of the Harmony node, where PMA-2 is located. PMA-2 was used by almost all Space Shuttle missions to the ISS. Its last use was during the final shuttle flight, STS-135. Canadarm2, with Dextre, will position IDA-2 to within a few feet (about a meter) in front of PMA-2 and hold until Friday morning. Then, before the EVA is set to begin, ground teams will move it in closer to make contact with the older adapter. Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins inspect the two suits that will be used in EVA-36. Photo Credit: NASA EVA-36 The spacewalk will start at 7:10 a.m. CDT (12:10 GMT) August 19. Williams and Rubins will leave the airlock and traverse to the work area. Williams will be the lead spacewalker, EV-1, and sport red stripes on his suit. Rubins will be EV-2 and have white stripes. This will be Williams fourth EVA, his first being during the STS-101 mission in May 2000. That mission to the ISS was to help prepare the outpost for its first crew, which would arrive some five months later in November 2000. Rubins will be conducting her first spacewalk. A rendering of the primary workspace for EVA-36. Photo Credit: NASA TV Williams and Rubins will translate over to PMA-2 and connect adjustable equipment tethers with IDA-2. After that, Dextre will then be commanded to unlatch to allow extra movement for the crew to cinch the tethers down. At this point, the two spacewalkers will begin to attach power and data cables that have been run across the station over the last year or so during four spacewalks and multiple station expeditions. After that task is complete, inside the ISS, Flight Engineer and JAXA astronaut Takuya Onishi will support the spacewalkers. He will reside in the Harmony module where a special IDA control panel will command the hooks of the adapter to engage into PMA-2. After a firm connection is established, the crew will mate a few more remaining cables. Additionally, the will start covering up old reflectors and installing new reflectors that will guide incoming commercial crew vehicles. Finally, the cover on the front of IDA-2 will be removed and stowed in a bag for storage. Ready to receive commercial vehicles After all of that is complete, the docking adapter will officially be ready to receive commercial crew vehicles. The first one is currently expected late next year. Afterward, the crew will begin routing more cables for the next adapter, IDA-3. Sometime next year, PMA-3 will be moved to the space-facing side of Harmony. It is currently in a storage location on the port side of the Tranquility module. Then, likely in 2018, another SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, CRS-16, will bring IDA-3 to the outpost. The process that took place for IDA-2 will be done again, only in front of PMA-3. A second IDA is not required for commercial crew vehicles to begin visiting the ISS. It will be used primarily for redundancy as well as for direct handovers between commercial crew vehicles. “The last time a vehicle undocked from this area of the space station where we’ll do the EVA was the Space Shuttle Atlantis five years ago, closing the door on that chapter of the incredible Space Shuttle program,” said Steve Stich, deputy manager for the Commercial Crew Program. “We very much look forward to getting this docking adapter installed [as well as] the second docking adapter. It will really be that gateway, or [a] new door, to open up the space station to these new commercial vehicles and enhancing the science with an additional crew member.

He is currently the managing editor of the student run newspaper, the Washburn Review. He also writes a blog, called Orbital Velocity, about the space station. His passion for space ignited when he watched space shuttle Discovery leap to space on Oct. 29, 1998. He saw his first in-person launch on July 8, 2011 when the space shuttle launched for the final time. Today, this fervor has accelerated toward orbit and shows no signs of slowing down. After dabbling in math and engineering courses in college, he soon realized that his true calling was communicating to others about space exploration and spreading that passion.

Airbus, Boeing brace for crucial phase in subsidies dispute Reuters 8/16/2016 By Tom Miles and Tim Hepher The world's two largest jetmakers are bracing for the next round in a transatlantic spat over billions of dollars of aircraft subsidies, amid accusations of widening U.S. support for Boeing and persistent European aid to Airbus. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 149.62 +0.10 +0.07% After a yearlong lull, the world's biggest trade dispute will enter a crucial phase in coming months, potentially casting a shadow over faltering efforts by the European Union and United States to negotiate a wider free-trade deal. At stake are mutual claims of unfair subsidies to the two planemakers that raise the prospect of $22 billion a year in threatened trade sanctions, though many say a resolution remains years away and could ultimately involve a negotiated settlement. The dispute, said to be the biggest in terms of value and time, dates back to 2004 when the U.S. urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to act against European government loans to help Airbus develop jets such as the A380, followed by a counter-claim from the EU over federal and local aid for Boeing. In separate rulings, the WTO found that both planemakers had benefited from billions of dollars of unfair subsidies. The case is now bogged down in arguments over whether each side complied with orders to withdraw illegal subsidies and undo the effects of the majority of aid which, although not banned, can be challenged if it can be proved to be damaging. After a three-year delay due to the strain placed on its resources by the marathon dispute, the WTO is expected to rule within weeks on whether the EU obeyed its rulings, followed by a similar report on U.S. compliance early next year. Both sides claim the other ignored the thousands of pages of judgments and appeal findings in each case and have sought WTO permission to draw up sanctions, with the U.S. calling for up to $10 billion in counter-measures and the EU $12 billion. U.S. sources have said they are confident the WTO will find the EU flouted its decisions, while the European side has called U.S. accusations "empty". TAX BREAK CHALLENGE Together, the cases affecting tens of thousands of aerospace jobs are seen as the biggest test of a multilateral system for resolving trade disputes since the WTO was founded in 1995. Any sanctions could further complicate relations as the U.S. and EU remain bogged down in differences over a proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), amid growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic. As the two existing Airbus-Boeing cases that have dominated the WTO's disputes forum for more than a decade creep towards a conclusion, a third WTO dispute affecting the world's two largest planemakers is simultaneously gathering pace. Last year, the EU complained that Boeing was set to receive unfair support for its latest plane, the 777X, from Washington state thanks to an $8.7 billion package of expanded tax breaks. In a confidential draft report, a WTO panel found Boeing would get some fresh subsidy from the tax decision, although it rejected several EU arguments, three people familiar with the case said. One European source called it an important win for the EU. A U.S. source denied this, saying claims that the EU is poised to win the case are "false", and a distraction from its inaction over earlier WTO rulings, but declined further comment. The WTO and all the parties declined to comment. No publication date has been set for the interim findings, but they are typically released a few months after parties see a copy. Previous WTO rulings on aircraft subsidies have been bitterly disputed, with both sides finding support for their arguments in the trade body's decisions and there are no signs that this report will be any different when it is published. In parallel previous rulings, the WTO found both sides had doled out subsidies worth billions of dollars to their leading planemakers, sparking feuds between Airbus and Boeing over which side had won a greater percentage of the arguments in each case. The latest dispute over Washington tax measures adds a third pillar to the sprawling trade dispute and, just like earlier cases, is expected to take years of legal arguments and appeals. The EU argues that the 2013 package of preferential business tax rates, tax credits and tax exemptions represented subsidies to Boeing in return for securing the coveted 777X jetliner work. It also claims the support falls into the WTO's most severe category, that of "prohibited" subsidies, because it depends on the use of domestic over imported goods. U.S. industry sources argue the measures are available to any aerospace company in the state, including even a few suppliers to Airbus, and don't fall into the WTO's subsidy net. Washington state's 2013 tax package for aerospace companies is largely the same as an earlier 2003 package, which the WTO found caused "serious prejudice."    The 2013 law extended all of the 2003 benefits from 2024 to 2040, and added exemptions for sales and use taxes on new plants used to manufacture airplanes, wings or fuselages. In 2011, the WTO ruled earlier versions of the incentives from Washington state were subsidies that caused "serious prejudice" to Airbus, but rejected Europe's claim that they crossed the line of support that is prohibited automatically.

After a year-long lull, the world's biggest trade dispute will enter a crucial phase in coming months, potentially casting a shadow over faltering efforts by the European Union and United States to negotiate a wider free-trade deal.

The new Terminal 3 Ultimate (T3U) currently only serves domestic flights of Garuda Indonesia but will expand to cover international flights of other airlines as well. Once T3U is fully operational, it will be able to handle 25 million passengers annually, helping to alleviate air traffic at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, as well as providing better security and customer service. The launch of T3U will not only contribute to the development of the Indonesian economy and increase the number of inbound tourists, but also cement the airport’s status as an international airport in the ASEAN region. Cathay’s final 747 flight Cathay Pacific will fly its last Boeing 747-400 passenger jet from Haneda to Hong Kong on Oct. 1. To commemorate the end of “jumbo jet” flight operations, the airline is holding a contest via its Facebook account. Customers are invited to submit texts, images or videos of their memories on board Boeing 747s on Facebook. Cathay Pacific will then select 10 people to join an aircraft tour before the plane departs for its last flight. Further details will be posted on the company’s Facebook account soon. The Boeing 747 series was first introduced in the 1970s and over the years Cathay Pacific has used them to serve around 160 million passengers. Cathay Pacific was still operating three Boeing 747-400s as of Aug. 5, on routes serving Haneda, Narita and Taipei from Hong Kong. Freshen up with Jetstar Jetstar Japan has partnered with Tokyo-based 9h nine hours to provide discounts for the latter’s nap and shower services this summer for passengers using Narita International Airport. In August and September, passengers on Jetstar Japan flights can receive up to 60 percent off when they use 9h nine hour’s services three days before their departure or after their arrival. For example, the nap service costs ¥1,000, while the shower service costs ¥500 in August. Customers are also entitled to a 20 percent discount for nap and shower services with 9h nine hours Kyoto. Since 2012, the low-cost carrier has slowly expanded its services, offering domestic and international flights on various schedules. Jetstar Japan now operates 50 percent of domestic flights departing and arriving from Narita. This new collaboration targets passengers arriving on red-eye flights who would like to take a short nap before beginning their day; those who are departing on late flights and would like to take a shower before boarding the aircraft; and those transiting through who would like to freshen up before continuing their journey.

Commercial Crew Astronauts Discuss Progress, Training with Employees by Steven Siceloff, for KSC News Kennedy Space Center FL (SPX) Aug 15, 2016 File image. There are few days that are the same for NASA's Commercial Crew Program astronauts as they train for flight tests aboard the next generation of human-rated spacecraft, astronauts Eric Boe and Suni Williams told an audience at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Thursday. "One of the things I like about being an astronaut is that you're always doing different things," Boe said. "I don't think I have a day or week that's been the same since we started this." Williams said the constant changes involved in training are similar to what happens during a space mission, so the daily differences are valuable for the crews. "This is not work, this is fun," Williams said. "It's pretty spectacular the stuff we get to do, but it's not all the same. It's not routine and I think that's good training for space. Up there, day-to-day, every day your timeline changes." Astronauts Boe, Williams, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley have not been assigned to specific missions or spacecraft, so all four are cross-training and advising on the development of both Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon. All four flew on space shuttle missions and have visited or lived aboard the International Space Station during their careers. They each also served as test pilots during their military careers. Boeing and SpaceX are working toward conducting orbital flight tests of their spacecraft without a crew next year, then progressing toward a flight test for each including astronauts before they begin operational missions to take astronauts to the space station. The new launch capability will enhance research opportunities on the orbiting laboratory by doubling the amount of time astronauts working in space have to devote to scientific investigations. Both companies will launch their spacecraft from Florida's Space Coast using spacecraft, rockets and support networks they own and operate. That approach is novel for NASA's human spaceflight programs which have always been designed, owned and operated by the agency itself in the past. Taking questions from around the agency during the Kennedy event, Boe and Williams were joined by Bob Cabana, director of Kennedy and a former space shuttle commander, and Kathy Lueders, manager of the Commercial Crew Program. What is the progress of the Commercial Crew Program? Lueders: I think people forget about the time frame and how short the time has been that our partners have been working on the final development of their spacecraft. We awarded the contracts in September 2014. Right now, the companies are in the midst of this grueling periods of getting their vehicles together and getting their structural test articles together. We're getting ready for flight tests. Most importantly, we're getting there as fast as we can safely fly. What opportunities do you have working on a developmental program? Boe: We haven't worked on a new manned space program in the United States in more than 30 years, so it's a great honor for all of us. We're also working on Orion that will take us to Mars one day. These all work together for what we're doing. We're going to have people on Mars at some point and a big reason we have the station is to do the research that's needed to make that possible. So as you can tell, we're getting closer to flights and we'll probably start picking up the pace of our training efforts as we get into the fall. Williams: Now is a good time to try new things. We're really taking advantage of 22 years of technological advances. That might take us out of our comfort zone, but we shouldn't be afraid of that. What's the biggest challenge you've seen so far in CCP? Williams: We think we have an idea of what's going to happen, and we start to talk about it, then other ideas come in and change starts to happen and that's where you see the advances. It's challenging because you have to change your mindset. Boe: When you make a new thing, it's hard work and it's an honor to be able to see these spacecraft and systems and to see the people who are making these things and making these changes. When you make something new, you have to be able to balance the work to get the right allocation and use. How much faith do you put in engineers or do you go through all the engineering yourself? How much do you trust companies? Williams: There is just too much information to go through every single part of a spacecraft or an aircraft for that matter. We got to be involved almost a year ago so we were able to provide a perspective of what was being designed for. We have to trust them. The safety stuff is going to happen, everyone knows that and everyone works toward that. It's our obligation to make the spacecraft as good as it can be for the future crews as well. Boe: Spaceflight is about people. When you fly airplanes you have to count on those people. The hardware is cool, but it's really the people that make everything work. What do you think of the changes you are seeing at Kennedy? Boe: It's amazing to see Pad 39A getting modified by SpaceX. It's hardware and to me it shows that we are moving right along and 2017 and early 2018 are coming up fast. It's really amazing to see an old building like the Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility completely remade on the inside like Boeing did to make it into a Starliner factory. Williams: To me this is not a museum, it's an active spaceport. This is big hardware that's getting modified and getting built and I just can't help but tell a lot of people to come out here and see what is going on. It's not just where shuttles used to fly, it's where new vehicles are getting ready to fly. It's happening and it's happening quickly. What would you say to the children who first walk on Mars? Williams: Don't forget to turn around and look at your home planet. Boe: Have fun! We see Mars from Earth and it's a little thing and when they are going to look back on Earth from Mars and see the same thing, that's going to be pretty amazing.

GENEVA/PARIS: The world's two largest jetmakers are bracing for the next round in a transatlantic spat over billions of dollars of aircraft subsidies, amid accusations of widening U.S. support for Boeing and persistent European aid to Airbus. After a year-long lull, the world's biggest trade dispute will enter a crucial phase in coming months, potentially casting a shadow over faltering efforts by the European Union and United States to negotiate a wider free-trade deal. At stake are mutual claims of unfair subsidies to the two planemakers that raise the prospect of $22 billion a year in threatened trade sanctions, though many say a resolution remains years away and could ultimately involve a negotiated settlement. The dispute, said to be the biggest in terms of value and time, dates back to 2004 when the U.S. urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to act against European government loans to help Airbus develop jets such as the A380, followed by a counter-claim from the EU over federal and local aid for Boeing. In separate rulings, the WTO found that both planemakers had benefited from billions of dollars of unfair subsidies. The case is now bogged down in arguments over whether each side complied with orders to withdraw illegal subsidies and undo the effects of the majority of aid which, although not banned, can be challenged if it can be proved to be damaging. After a three-year delay due to the strain placed on its resources by the marathon dispute, the WTO is expected to rule within weeks on whether the EU obeyed its rulings, followed by a similar report on U.S. compliance early next year. Both sides claim the other ignored the thousands of pages of judgements and appeal findings in each case and have sought WTO permission to draw up sanctions, with the U.S. calling for up to $10 billion in counter-measures and the EU $12 billion. U.S. sources have said they are confident the WTO will find the EU flouted its decisions, while the European side has called U.S. accusations "empty". TAX-BREAK CHALLENGE Together, the cases affecting tens of thousands of aerospace jobs are seen as the biggest test of a multilateral system for resolving trade disputes since the WTO was founded in 1995. Any sanctions could further complicate relations as the U.S. and EU remain bogged down in differences over a proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), amid growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic. As the two existing Airbus-Boeing cases that have dominated the WTO's disputes forum for more than a decade creep towards a conclusion, a third WTO dispute affecting the world's two largest planemakers is simultaneously gathering pace. Last year, the EU complained that Boeing was set to receive unfair support for its latest plane, the 777X, from Washington state thanks to an $8.7 billion package of expanded tax breaks. In a confidential draft report, a WTO panel found Boeing would get some fresh subsidy from the tax decision, although it rejected several EU arguments, three people familiar with the case said. One European source called it an important win for the EU. A U.S. source denied this, saying claims that the EU is poised to win the case are "false", and a distraction from its inaction over earlier WTO rulings, but declined further comment. The WTO and all the parties declined comment. No publication date has been set for the interim findings, but they are typically released a few months after parties see a copy. Previous WTO rulings on aircraft subsidies have been bitterly disputed, with both sides finding support for their arguments in the trade body's decisions and there are no signs that this report will be any different when it is published. In parallel previous rulings, the WTO found both sides had doled out subsidies worth billions of dollars to their leading planemakers, sparking feuds between Airbus and Boeing over which side had won a greater percentage of the arguments in each case. The latest dispute over Washington tax measures adds a third pillar to the sprawling trade dispute and, just like earlier cases, is expected to take years of legal arguments and appeals. The EU argues that the 2013 package of preferential business tax rates, tax credits and tax exemptions represented subsidies to Boeing in return for securing the coveted 777X jetliner work. It also claims the support falls into the WTO's most severe category. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

I was sweating buckets, ridiculously excited, and also trying not to think about how terrible it would be to vomit in my oxygen mask during a flight being filmed for a TV news story. My assignment was simple: check out one of the two top contenders for a multi-billion dollar contract to replace the aging CF-18 fleet currently serving the Canadian Armed Forces.  Two of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighters were on display at the Abbotsford Air Show, but the pilots were neither performing in the three-day event nor taking any civilians up for demonstrations. Instead, Lt. Col. George Watkins and Lt. Col. Curtis Pitts were there on behalf of the United States Air Force to talk about the benefits of the sleek-looking, stealth aircraft. “It’s not about how fast and how high you can go anymore,” said Pitts. “It’s about being able to strike first and not have the enemy see you.” While Lockheed Martin talked up the benefits of their aircraft, Boeing took the chance to show off its answer to the F-35 with several demonstrations of the F-18 Super Hornet -- plus opportunities for journalists to ride along. The aircraft are on lease to Boeing from the U.S. Navy, with naval officials vetting potential ride-alongs months in advance. Unbeknownst to me, I was on the list from CTV Vancouver but didn’t get confirmation until just a couple days before my flight. When I agreed, I thought I was signing up for a trip in an older aircraft, like the venerable Snowbirds. I didn’t realize I’d be in for hours of orientation and safety training and an insanely intense physical experience in one of the most advanced aircraft in the world. When photojournalist Pete Cline and I arrived at the Abbotsford Air Show a Boeing rep greeted us and ushered us into a massive trailer where throngs of people were crowded around a flight simulator, complete with the kind of touch panel controls and elaborate visual displays that are actually inside the aircraft. It was great to get a preview and footage of that simulator because the U.S. Navy wouldn’t let us take video inside the Super Hornet for two reasons: they didn’t want classified or proprietary info of the setup or other details in the cockpit published, and because the G-force the aircraft undertakes make it risky for GoPros or other cameras that could break off and then rattle inside the cabin during the many manouevres they perform during the flight. My pilot, John “Toonces” Tougas, gave me the rundown on what he’d be seeing in the driver’s seat and how I could follow along in the back, able to view many of the displays he has access to. Toonces (I’m going to refer to him that way, because he won’t answer to anything else) has been flying military aircraft for 25 years and is now a test pilot for Boeing’s newest and fanciest aircraft, so I felt pretty confident in him – until he told me I’d be piloting the Super Hornet myself. “Boeing spent a lot of time and effort to get it to this condition where with three minutes of flight time I can have anyone flying it," he said. With great skepticism, I followed his instructions on the simulator, which actually made me feel like I was spinning sideways because of the three massive monitors wrapped around the controls. It felt like I was immersed in the ultimate video game: multiple screens, a hyper-realistic display and controls that felt like the real deal. It turns out, that was a big part of Boeing letting me on board: to show the intelligent design of the piloting system that makes flying intuitive so that the pilot can focus on other things, like watching the display from a high definition camera or monitoring for hostile aircraft. "It's a strike fighter and the main focus is being able to use your weapons and sensors and be able to deploy them in combat,” said Tougas, “so you have to make the task of piloting simple and almost unconscious." The next step was getting geared up. Boeing travels with a huge amount of gear not only for the pilots, but the VIPs they take for demonstrations in the aircraft. It turns out very few of them are women, because the boots were all too big and the flight suits are clearly designed for male physiques and proportions. The one-piece jumpsuits are fire retardant and full of pockets and easy to zip in and out of – except if you’re a female reporter in need of a bathroom break and wearing tiny yoga shorts in anticipation of sweating up a storm in the gear. Let’s just say preserving my modesty while using the toilet was almost as challenging as the flight. Toonces clearly does this all the time, because he has an hour-long PowerPoint presentation explaining exactly what the demo flight will entail, safety protocols, details of the displays I’ll be able to use, all titled with our names -- including my newly-appointed call sign, Henny. I hate it, which means it’s going to stick. That’s just how it works. Thoroughly intimidated by what was to come, Boeing gear boss Nate Hanson outfitted me with the g-suit that would keep me conscious during manouevres that would put incredible pressure on my body and blood supply. It basically zips up over the flight suite like a set of chaps, with sturdy Velcro panels to hold it it snug from ankle to thigh and another section around the lower torso. I then shimmied into a five-point harness that fit snugly over my shoulders, complete with an inflatable life jacket and all the hookups for my oxygen mask. He perfectly estimated the helmet size I would need and then we took some time to adjust the oxygen mask. I felt I couldn’t get enough air but they said it’d be fine once the diluted oxygen supply began. Hanson also showed me how to discreetly tuck a couple of air sickness bags in the pockets in case I needed them and then before I knew it we were in a golf cart and out to the aircraft. The Super Hornet is big, with an intimidating ramp staircase to get to the top, past a full weapons array. Butterflies racing through my stomach, Cline busy filming as Boeing’s official photographer snapped away, Hanson helped me get into the back seat and started clipping me in at the ankles, thighs and shoulders. It is a bizarre feeling having two dozen people watching from the ground while getting one’s bearings two stories up in a multi-million dollar piece of machinery. Toonces had made it very clear that if I wanted to call off the whole thing or needed some “comfort time” I just had to say the word and it’d be ok. But my curiosity and sense of adventure overruled my nervousness and fear of puking all over myself and we were off. Checklist in progress, the dome came down and we started taxying toward the runway, ejection seat engaged and oxygen mask cranked. In my stressful state I wasn’t getting enough air so I had to loosen the seal around my makeup-free face so I wouldn’t feel like I was suffocating. True to the agenda, Toonces punched the afterburner for takeoff and we were up before I knew it. It felt like an aggressive takeoff in an airliner, or about the g-force I’m used to when we zip off in Chopper 9. So far, so good. Toonces is a smart guy and instantly started chit-chatting through our headsets about the surrounding farmland, asking me to name a local mountain and otherwise keeping my eyes moving along the horizon and thinking about something other than my fear of puking in my oxygen mask. I don’t know whether I’ve got a good constitution for flying or if his tactic worked, but I was feeling great! Every airport in the Lower Mainland wanted a look at the Super Hornet, so we headed straight to the Langley Airport, which only took about two minutes. We flew down low over their runway, calling a “missed approach” to their tower, and then promptly hit the throttle and we zoomed right up to the clear blue sky. I couldn’t help but laugh like a little kid, because it was just so thrilling and fun. Next stop was Vancouver International Airport, where one of our CTV News photojournalists was waiting with a couple friends and his to film our flyby from the Chopper 9 hangar near the South Terminal. When I said I saw them, Toonces tilted us sideways so they could see I was in the jet and then gave a fancy side-to-side manouevre before blasting past the tower toward UBC, with a loop around downtown Vancouver and the Harbour Tower. Needless to say, we confused the living daylights out of a lot of people wondering what a US fighter jet was doing over the city. Then it was time to get down to business. We flew eastward, pushing to 11,500 feet with me now at the controls. I couldn’t believe how similar it was to the simulator. When I turned left and pulled on the stick, the navigation system adjusted and corrected itself so it kept us in a safe and steady trajectory. I punched the throttle, taking us to 500 knots, then back to minimum speed and it slowed us right down, but didn’t stall the aircraft. Toonces had his hands in the air at this point to prove to me me I was in control, which was pretty wild. I insisted he take over for the manoueverability demo, which had us flowing from a slow flight in an Angle of attack position ranging from 15 to 35 degrees (imagine a bear rearing up on its hind legs), followed by a full aft stick stall (straight up, like a rocket), followed by a turbo nose-down (face pointed at the earth with that gut-wrenching feeling you get at the top of a roller coaster), a pirouette (a tight turn) and a square loop (imagine a backwards summersault) that I will never forget, with Mount Baker upside down in my field of view. I should mention that several of these moves caused my g-suit to inflate, powerfully squeezing my legs and torso to push the blood to my head. At the same time I was clenching the necessary muscle groups, “calves, thighs, butt and gut” as Toonces said, to keep the blood in my brain so I wouldn’t pass out. It’s intense but you feel like a superhero when you’re able to keep your eyes open and absorbing everything that’s going on around you – namely, twirling around a snow-capped mountain like some crazed dragonfly. I’m told being short and a woman makes it easier to withstand g-force, and even going up to 5 Gs was tough, but doable. Then came the moment of truth. Toonces had told me in the briefing that at the end I could “land, or have a story to tell.” That’s because I had the option to experience a 7-G turn before we came in for a landing. I’d originally said “hell no” to the idea, but I was feeling so good throughout everything else I said “let’s do it!” I heard “That’s my girl – here we go!” and we were suddenly in a turn so violent and forceful I could barely keep my eyes open. Leg muscles and core fully engaged, g-suit squeezing the hell out of my lower half, I still had the edges of my vision going black and tunneling from the pressure, but it was suddenly over and I was still conscious. Woah. Seven Gs is rough – we’re talking seven times your body weight. Formula One drivers regularly handle 3 to 5 Gs, with most roller coasters in that range. It’s just shy of what Apollo 16 astronauts experienced on re-entry into the atmosphere, when they hit 7.19 Gs. I didn’t find out till later I’m only the second person to say yes to Toonces’ offer of the 7 G turn. While I’m glad I got to experience it, I probably wouldn’t want to do it again. But I would take another flight in a Super Hornet – in a heartbeat. The federal government now has a choice to make: the F-18 Super Hornet, or the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Both have communications systems compatible with NATO requirements and sophisticated avionics equipment that makes them virtually incomparable to older model fighter jets. The F-35 is a stealth aircraft, with more physical capabilities then the F-18 and the previous Conservative government had settled on the F-35, but cost overruns and delays scuttled the deal and the Liberals are now running a new procurement process. The biggest advantage Boeing may have over Lockheed Martin is the existing fleet. The aging CF-18 Hornets currently flown by the Royal Canadian Air Force are the previous generation model of the Super Hornet. Toonces compared it to a personal computer situation: going from the CF-18 to the F-18 is like upgrading from Windows 97 to Windows 10, he said. It’s newer and better but still familiar. He says for our CF-18 pilots, training for the F-35 would be akin to learning a Mac operating system. The idea is, the smoother the learning curve to fly the aircraft, the more the pilots can focus on learning the sophisticated avionics under the hood, as it were. While the Liberals campaigned with the promise they wouldn’t sign off on the F-35, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan was cagey at a July 16 press conference in Ottawa, saying "no decision has been made on procurement" and that he wants to “make sure we have all the necessary information, all the right data" before signing off on the multi-billion dollar contract.  Photos Pilot John “Toonces” Tougas and CTV reporter Penny Daflos pose in front of an F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet at the Abbotsford Air Show.

WILL LESTER — STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER By Neil Nisperos, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin Posted: 08/15/16, 5:52 PM PDT | Updated: on 08/15/2016 # Comments ONTARIO >> A local manufacturer of fiberglass shipping crates for military weapons is hoping to double in size and output over the next decade. The owners also want to leverage its status as a minority-owned business. PRC Composites, which has been in Ontario since 2008 and began in Santa Fe Springs in 1973, has grown to about 120 employees, many of them first- and second-generation Mexican-Americans. “Our whole intention with this is to grow,” said Gene Gregory, president of PRC Composite. “We’ve grown about 10 percent in the last year and our game plan is over the next five to seven years, we’d like to double in size.” The recent acquisition of a majority stake by a partnership of the Rincon and Colusa Indian tribes provides PRC with a “minority-owned” business designation that could lead to more contracts, Gregory said, through government incentives for clients such as rebates and help client companies like Boeing fulfill mandates to work with minority-owned companies. “With Boeing, we should be able to go to Boeing and say we’re Native American-owned and that should give us an advantage of quoting new work,” said Mike Marvin, marketing director for PRC Composites. “So far we haven’t connected with the right people with Boeing to pass that word down to their purchasing people. They can get a 5 percent rebate on every invoice that we invoice to Boeing for these products. That’s cash back to Boeing and not a penny back to us.” Gregory was keen on Monday to talk to Rep. Norma Torres, D-Ontario, who represents Ontario, Pomona, Chino and Fontana. Torres visited the plant Monday to find out more about the facility. Torres is a member of the House Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs. “She’s on the Indian affairs subcommittee and I think for her, to recognize that in her district she’s got a government contractor and a (minority-owned) business, we want to see if maybe there are any opportunities we’re missing,” Gregory said. “The government has incentive to do business with (minority-owned) businesses and to help grow minority businesses.” Torres, who was taken on a tour of the plant, said she came to hear more about the company’s expansion plans and the ability to get more contracts for the region. “That means more jobs here, which is the next conversation I want to have with them about training opportunities for their workforce,” Torres said. She said in California most Native American tribes have been very successful with the casino industry. “You’re not thinking of (Native American tribes) when you think of government contracts for our national security,” Torres said. “You’re not thinking about the types of materials that they’re manufacturing here, and I think it’s a good opportunity to take this model to other Native American tribes in the state.” Advertisement PRC, which originally stood for Plastics Research Corp., was established in 1973 to fill the need for a company that could utilize advances in plastics technology to produce large, special-purpose, lightweight and cost-effective shipping and storage containers for military and commercial customers. “We just want to introduce our business to our local congresswoman,” Gregory said. “We’re here in her backyard and we want to show her what we’re doing.” The company says it has developed more than 100 types of containers and has produced more than 250,000. The containers are used by the Marines to hold weapons, ammunition and tents. General Atomics, which makes the Predator drone, uses PRC fiberglass containers to ship its product to the Air Force. PRC containers are also used to ship Joint Direct Attack Munition smart-bomb tail fins to the battlefields of Afghanistan. Other PRC contracts include containers that ship airline engine parts from California to Paris for use in the manufacturing of the Airbus A350 aircraft.

By Jon Austin Jon Austin PUBLISHED: 12:31, Wed, Aug 17, 2016 | UPDATED: 13:06, Wed, Aug 17, 2016 The fleet of mostly Boeing 737s are based at a private terminal called Gold Coast in Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, but it is reportedly impossible for anyone else to buy tickets for the planes which have just one destination. The white jets with a red band along the side where the windows are have no logos, and military personnel who board them must not discuss the route, it is alleged. For years conspiracy theorists have insisted Area 51 is where evidence of alien visitations of Earth are secretly held away from public view. The top-secret Area 51 military base in the Nevada desert, USA, has intrigued and mystified UFO and alien chasers for years, particularly as the US Government only and reluctantly confirmed its existence in 2013.  The long-held myth is that the US Government is well aware aliens visit Earth in flying saucers, and that sometimes they crash, or the crew are captured.  YouTubeA Janet Airlines flight departs for Area 51 with around 190 staff on board. Related articles GOVERNMENT CHIEF: 'I was shown inside alien UFO at Area 51' Second UFO man dies fuelling claims of 'Men in Black' murder spree Alien conspiracy theorists claim when this happens the spacecraft, damaged or otherwise, are taken there for tests and storage to prevent the public ever finding out.  Ever since the US Air Force revealed in July 1947 that a flying saucer crashed in the desert outside Roswell, New Mexico, before retracting it with a statement that it was a weather balloon, the next day, conspiracy theorists have claimed the authorities are desperate to withhold the truth about aliens from us. The theory is that if we knew for certain there were other races across the universe, it would destroy the concept of religion and make controlling the masses increasingly difficult.  The Roswell myth has expanded over the years to include claims that alien corpses were pulled from the wreckage. Since the discovery of the existence of Area 51, it has been incorporated into the myth. UNICORNAEROSPACE*GETTYLast month Andre Milne, founder of Unicorn Aerospace, confirmed black projects happen at Area 51. Related articles How 'deadly force' used to keep prying eyes from mysterious Area 51 'UFOs' on trucks on A34 spark claims there is a BRITISH AREA 51 Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. UFO expert Nick Pope The story now being that the wreckage and dead aliens were taken there for tests, storage and experimentation. Alien conspiracy theorists believe the US military regularly intercept flying saucers, which are also taken into Area 51. Claims include that engineering experts are trying to reverse engineer the spacecraft to allow the US Air Force the same capabilities, and that secret tests of such crafts take place over the Nevada desert. According to sources the fleet is dubbed Janet Airlines as this stands for just another non existent terminal, and is operated by AECOM, a private defence contractor for the USAF. The planes are believed to have been taken from the former Western Airlines after it merged with DELTA in 1987. Conspiracy theorists claim Area 51 is "restricted airspace inside restricted airspace" and once the aircraft approach the base their call sign changes from Janet to "bones 58". Nick Pope, a British UFO expert, who investigated UFO phenomena for the MoD, but is now based in the US, said Area 51 is where the USAF designs, builds and tests hi-tech and top-secret military aircraft in so-called black projects. But, he is not convinced by theories that recovered alien technology is stored or experimented on there. He said: "Area 51 exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown. CLASSIFIED: Area 51 Mon, July 25, 2016 The United States Air Force facility, known as Area 51 is a remote area in Nevada. Current purpose of the base is unknown, however conspiracy theorists and media have speculated purposes from UFO spacecraft research to analysing the brain activity of an alien.

"Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. "Having been name checked in movies like Independence Day, Area 51 has become part of pop culture and the secret is out, so if there ever was alien technology at Area 51, I suspect it's been moved to a location we've never heard of." Earlier this year, it emerged AECOM was hiring for pilots for the secretive planes. The defence contractor listed the post of First Officer based out of Las Vegas on its official careers website. The job required "full background checks" and the "ability to hold a top secret clearance from the US government".   Related articles White House dodges 'alien question' amid demands for answers Were 'Roswell files' destroyed?

However, this isn’t going to be just a walk in the park. The astronauts will be working on installing a new international docking adapter (IDA) to the outside of the ISS. This is a crucial component of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. Image via NASA A major issue with the ISS is it’s relative inaccessibility. It takes a lot of planning, work and resources to send people or equipment up there. For this reason, SpaceX and Boeing have been working on commercial alternatives. These alternatives — so-called space taxis — would be faster and cheaper than existing possibilities. SpaceX is building a crewed version of its Dragon cargo capsule, called Crew Dragon, and Boeing is building a brand-new crew capsule called the CST-100 Starliner, the two being slated to work in 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, in order for these to dock at the station, a new docking module needs to be installed to fit the shuttles and astronauts need to get to work. There is a reason to worry about the spacewalk. This will be the first one since January, and that spacewalk didn’t exactly go swimmingly. Then, NASA astronaut Tim Kopra noticed a small water bubble forming inside his helmet, probably due to an issue with his spacesuit’s sublimator, inducing too much condensation. NASA has already taken steps to fix this issue and hopefully, it  won’t be a problem in the future. Regarding the space operation itself, NASA writes: Advertisement “The two astronauts will venture outside the space station’s Quest airlock to install the first IDA onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2, located on the forward end of the Harmony module. On Wednesday, Aug. 17, ground controllers will use the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached “Dextre” Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon, and position it just inches away from PMA-2. There will be no live coverage of the trunk removal and IDA positioning.” In other ISS news, Russia is reportedly planning on reducing its space crew from 3 to 2. The Russian newspaper Izvestia quoted cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who serves as the head of piloted space programs for Russia’s state-run space corporation, Roscosmos. “They’re exploring the option of going down to two crew on the Russian segment,”said ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd, responding to a question from collectSPACE.com editor Robert Pearlman. “We’ll look at it as we do with all these kind of things—we’ll trade it against whatever risk that might put into the program, first and foremost the risk to our crew onboard, and the station itself.” The whole building operation will be streamed by NASA.

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Facebook swung to higher-than-anticipated quarterly profits and sales. It appears Facebook is getting mobile strategy right. Mobile made up more of total ad revenues than it did the prior quarter. One other metric of note - the monthly average number of users logging on to the social network on their phones jumped 51 percent from the same time last year. The response was bullish - the stock immediately surged above $31 in after-hours trade - a level not breached since February. Turning to manufacturing: Boeing raised its outlook after demand for 787 Dreamliner jets and foreign orders for military aircraft pushed results ahead of the consensus. Ford also boosted full-year guidance. Higher U.S. truck sales, strong demand in China, and a surprise smaller-than-expected loss in Europe drove the automaker to a forecast topping quarter. But Caterpillar slashed its outlook for the year. The problem: a slowdown in the mining industry caused profits to crater by more than 43 percent. That prediction gave investors little reason to buy stocks. The S&P 500 had its first two-day drop in a month. The Nasdaq was basically unchanged. Google is updating its nexus 7 tablet. The latest version is thinner than its predecessor and comes with higher screen resolution. The cut-throat priced tablet hits the market at a time when Apple revealed a 20 percent drop in iPad sales last quarter, and Microsoft recently slashed prices on the Surface because of soft demand. New home sales hit a 5-year high. Meanwhile, President Obama is trying to re-energize his economic agenda - starting with a pledge: U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1276 days of my term to make this country work for working Americans again." Though short on details, The White House is calling on Republicans to work with the President, who wants to spend on education and infrastructure in order to strengthen the economy and bring down unemployment. And speaking of a better economy, a survey of euro zone private businesses showed growth for the first time in two years - that was enough to send European stocks to an eight-week closing high.

In 2014 Boeing and SpaceX were awarded contracts worth some $6.8 billion to develop commercial crew transportation systems for the ISS. SpaceX is building a crewed version of its Dragon cargo capsule, called Crew Dragon, and Boeing is constructing a crew capsule called the CST-100 Starliner. The IDA-2 adapter, the second to be built, will allow new spacecraft to dock with the station, beginning in 2017. Spacecraft using the International Docking Standard, including NASA's Orion capsule, will be able to attach to the ISS. The docking adapter was launched from Cape Canaveral atop a Falcon 9 rocket on July 18 and has remained, until now, inside the Dragon's external trunk section. © Photo: pixabay Lockheed Martin, NASA Ink Deal for SkyFire Infrared Lunar Discovery SatelliteOn Wednesday, the ISS robotic arm will remove the IDA from the Falcon 9 and place it close to the ISS port. On Friday, Williams and Rubins will don their spacesuits and leave the station for a six-and-a-half hour shift, carefully connecting the IDA to its ISS port. In four previous spacewalks, astronauts completed preparatory steps for the upcoming installation, including positioning dozens of meters of power and connectivity cabling for the docking adapter. The two astronauts will be assisted in their spacewalk by Takuya Onishi of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, who will monitor the progress from inside the ISS during the installation. "There's a very coordinated interplay between the external crew outside, Tak on the inside, and the ground doing the commanding," said Zeb Scoville, the spacewalk flight director, during a NASA briefing. The installation process will be aired by NASA TV beginning 6:30 a.m. EST (10:30 GMT). ...

This certification from under secretary Frank Kendall will enable the USAF to proceed with the production of the Boeing-built multirole tanker. The approval to begin low-rate initial production follows a series of aerial refuelling demonstrations such as refuelling an F-16 Fighting Falcon, C-17 Globemaster III and A-10 Thunderbolt II off the boom, and an AV-8 Harrier II and F/A-18 Hornet off both hose and drogue systems. "The KC-46 programme has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernisation needed in our strategic tanker fleet." The KC-46 also demonstrated its receiver capability by taking fuel from a KC-10 Extender. USAF Secretary Deborah Lee James said: "I commend the team for diligently working through some difficult technical challenges. "The KC-46 programme has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernisation needed in our strategic tanker fleet." The first two lots of low-rate initial production contracts will be awarded to Boeing within the next 30 days. Boeing will supply a total of 19 aircraft and associated spare parts for a pre-negotiated $2.8bn combined value. The first aircraft deliveries will be to McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, and Altus AFB, Oklahoma, US. A total of 18 tankers are expected to be delivered by early 2018. The KC-46 still needs to complete schedule of Federal Aviation Administration and military certification flight testing that includes refuelling test flights, in order to achieve certification for aircraft in the Air Force and Department of Defense inventory.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Locality World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# demonetization War on Black Money Donald Trump Narendra Modi Bigg Boss 10 Home Money Air India to fly solo for airframe MRO The airline feels it can do a better job than private players Shares7 Shahkar Abidi | Tue, 16 Aug 2016-07:30am , Mumbai , DNA National carrier scraps plan to rope in private player running its airframe branch at its maintenance, repair and overhaul unit in Nagpur About six months after inviting expression of interest (EoI) from private players for operating and managing the airframe branch of its maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility at Mihan in Nagpur, national carrier Air India has now decided to operate it on its own. The company now thinks that it can do the job better than the private players. "We will be running it on our own and can do it better than any private player as we have decades of experience," said a senior executive at Air India Engineering Services Ltd, a subsidiary of national carrier Air India during an interaction with dna. The company had in February issued a public advertisement stating, "Expression of interest from interested parties having technical/ financial capabilities for operating and managing Air India's Air Frame MRO which is already set up in Nagpur and functional on a revenue-sharing basis or any other viable business proposal." The MRO was set up by aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing at a cost of over Rs 600 crore as part of its memorandum of understanding with Air India in bargain for purchasing of over 100 aircraft in 2006. However, the MRO project at the special economic zone of Mihan in Nagpur got delayed for several reasons including land acquisition. Boeing has already handed over to the MRO project to AIESL but refused to be a partner in its operations, even though there was a specific request made in this regard by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Currently, due to lack of adequate world-class MRO facilities in India, many airlines, especially the low-cost ones take their planes to nearby hubs including Singapore, Dubai or Colombo, leading to India losing millions of foreign exchange to other countries that provide better tax laws and cheaper costs. Maintenance accounts for approximately 10% of airlines' cost. According to aviation advisory firm CAPA, the global MRO business is estimated to be over $50 billion. The largest providers typically offer the three main MRO capabilities -- airframe, engine and component services. Engine maintenance makes up the largest proportion of the global market (35%), followed by component (22%) and airframe heavy maintenance (13%). According to CAPA, in the past most maintenance work was conducted in-house, with a movement in the 1990s towards outsourcing the work to independent and airline third-party providers, led by the emerging LCCs. Most airlines which outsource work to a third party do so to allow them to focus on their core business -- commercial flying. AIESL has already signed MoUs with a handful of airlines for repair and maintenance of aircraft of airlines including SpiceJet, Jet Airways, apart from all works for the fleet of parent company Air India. The aviation industry experts said the MRO industry will get further impetus with the government liberalising the sector with better tax and other benefits. The growth of regional connectivity scheme will also help in giving further thrust to it, the officials said. "Around the world airlines' primary job is to make passengers and cargo travel from point to point and they are more than happy to outsource their planes' maintenance and overhauling work. We intend to tap that market in India by approaching the airlines. The regional connectivity, as new aviation policy has also opened a huge scope for us," H R Jagannathan, CEO, AIESL, had earlier said.

Manufacturer AeroVironment stated that the recovery system enables the Puma to operate from a variety of vessels for rapid response reconnaissance. The multi-environment UAV is hand launched, and is programmed to autonomously glide back to the flight deck, but can also float; allowing for sea recovery. Keep reading for the whole story with recent events put in context Puma AE team (click to view full) The mini-UAV market may lack the high individual price tags of vehicles like the RQ-4 Global Hawk, or the battlefield strike impact of an MQ-9 Reaper, but it does have 2 advantages. One is less concern about “deconfliction” with manned aircraft, as described in “Field Report on Raven, Shadow UAVs From the 101st.” Mini-UAVs usually fly below 1,000 feet, and a styrofoam-like body with a 5 foot wingspan is much less of a collision threat than larger and more solidly-built platforms like the man-sized RQ-7 Shadow, or the Cessna-sized MQ-1 Predator. The other advantage is mini-UAVs’ suitability for special operations troops, who are being employed in numbers on the front lines around the world. “Raven UAVs Winning Gold in Afghanistan’s ‘Commando Olympics’” details the global scale of this interest – and in July 2008, a $200 million US SOCOM contract for a breakthrough mini-UAV underscored it again. Now AeroVironment’s S2AS/ RQ-20A Puma AE is moving beyond Special Operations, and into the regular force. Mini-UAVs: Evolution & Advantages CL-227, pre-launch (click to view full) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that can perform battlefield missions seem like a recent phenomenon, but countries like Israel and Canada have been building and using them for 3 decades now. Israel translated its early lead into a globally competitive UAV industry; Canada has not, as the early lead generated by projects like the CL-227 Sentinel/”flying peanut” withered on the vine. As American forces began to adopt UAVs more widely, however, opportunities were created for domestic manufacturers to establish volume production, and become global leaders. The American penchant for technology, and the pressure of battlefield requirements, began to create another opportunity: greater UAV diversity. At the high-end, UAVs moved from brigade, fleet group, and division surveillance roles, and began to replace high-end national reconnaissance assets (vid. RQ-4 Global Hawk). At the brigade and division levels, armed UAVs began to give these devices important strike roles in counterinsurgency scenarios (vid. MQ-1/9 Predator family). The next level down are tactical UAVs like Textron AAI’s RQ-7 Shadow, IAI’s Searcher II, Elbit’s Skylark II, or the Boeing/Insitu ScanEagle. They require additional support equipment for launch/recovery, and have the ability to cover “this sector” or even “this city”. RQ-14 Dragon Eye, Smithsonian NASM (click to view full) At the same time, the march of technology had made another new development possible: large numbers of “mini-UAVs” small enough for soldiers to carry, with electronic sensors that could capture good quality imagery, and then relay it to troops over expanding electronic networks. The mini-UAV market focuses on flying devices that can be carried, launched, and recovered by soldiers. They generally have ranges up to 20 km, and an endurance of 1-3 hours in the air. These UAVs aren’t designed to do depth reconnaissance, but to look over the next hill, watch a neighborhood in a city before troops enter it, patrol a base’s outer perimeter, etc. Even smaller micro-UAVs are in development, and focus more tightly on “this building” or “this engagement”. Aerovironment’s Mini-Mes Pointer UAV (click to view larger) The late Dr. McReady’s Aerovironment, Inc. has a history of aerial innovation, from human and solar-powered flight to early entries that helped define the mini-UAV market. Their main competition is Israel’s Elbit Systems (esp. the popular Skylark I), while their most advanced competitor may be Prioria’s Maveric, selected by the Canadian armed forces. As Aerovironment’s history shows, however, their own firm’s new designs are their most frequent competitors: 1990: Aerovironment delivers the first privately-developed FQM-151 Pointer hand-launched UAVs, for “extended evaluation” by the US military and Special Operations communities. Some are used in Iraq and Kuwait during Desert Storm in 1991. The subsequent Puma UAV design, begun in 2001, can be fairly characterized as a Pointer UAV that incorporates most of the industry’s advances since 1990. It’s part of a long progression for AeroVironment, which has played a big role in the mini-UAV space’s evolution: 2003: Aerovironment’s Dragon Eye/Swift (RQ-14) wins the US Marines’ competition for a mini-UAV. 2004: A new Aerovironment mini-UAV, the RQ-11A Raven, is fielded under limited expedited orders with the US Army’s 10th Mountain Division, and some special forces. This is not a formal competition, however, but an outgrowth of a 2002 ACTD (advanced concept technology demonstration) project. RQ-11, Iraq (click to view full) Fall 2005: The US Army’s RPUAV competition arises from the RQ-11’s success. SOCOM joins this competition, and the upgraded RQ-11B Raven wins. The US Marines switched from Dragon Eye to the Raven B in 2007, and the US Air Force now fields them too. Raven has also proved popular with foreign militaries, and is in service with Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Spain, among others. August 2006: The USAF picks another Aerovironment mini-UAV for its BATMAV UAV competition, and deliveries begin under the 5-year $45 million contract. The Wasp UAV began as a DARPA project, and the larger Wasp-III is a 1-pound vehicle with a wingspan just under 3 feet. It is called a ‘micro-UAV,’ but in truth it sits on the borderline between mini-UAV systems and true micro-UAVs. Late 2007: The US Marines began buying and issuing Wasp-IIIs at the platoon level, complementing the RQ-11 Raven B, which is issued at the company and battalion levels. In January 2008, the USAF approved full-rate BATMAV production. June 2008: SOCOM’s AECV program aims to select a mini-UAV that can be used by all branches, including Navy SEAL teams and USMC MARSOC. It picks the Puma AE, a new UAV from Aerovironment that adds a stabilized micro-camera, waterproofing, and the ability to land and recover the UAV on water. The “RQ-20” Puma subsequently finds a niche with route clearance minehunters, thanks to the advanced state of its optics, and ends up serving with the regular US Army, Marines & Air Force. The Puma AE RQ-20A Puma assembly (click to view full) Puma is slightly larger than Raven as is Aerovironment’s largest mini-UAV offering, but it’s still man-portable and hand-launched. The original Puma was almost 6 feet long, with a wingspan of 8.5 feet. Aerovironment pursued the typical young industry profile of build-field test-build as it developed the AE variant, issuing modified UAVs to units in the field for evaluation and feedback. The US SOCOM contract has been the Puma program’s focus for a some time now, as SOCOM’s specifications led Aerovironment to conclude that its larger Puma platform was a better fit than the existing RQ-11B Raven. Along the way, Puma has been used for hybrid fuel cell experiments, and an “Aqua-Puma” driven by requests from the field served as an interim step along the road to the final Puma AE. In March 2012, it received the formal USAF designation “RQ-20A.” AV on Puma AE click for video The hand-launched Puma AE’s most significant innovation is that it can land on both land and water, surviving near-vertical “deep stall” final approaches. In addition to the obvious special forces scenarios like river infiltrations, the ability to land on water and in very tight areas on land means that Puma can also be used from boats and ships, without vessel modifications for landing systems or vehicle storage. The other big innovation is its sensor system. Previous mini-UAV systems tended to have micro-cameras that could be moved by the operator to pan, tilt, or zoom. What they usually have not had was a camera that was fully stabilized to fix on a designated point and provide a steady, constant image that compensates for aircraft movement etc. Recently, firms like Israel’s Bental Systems have begun to offer stabilized micro-payloads. Puma AE incorporates this innovation in an EO/IR day- and night-capable, waterproof sensor package that provides this kind of image tracking and stabilization. Other payload designs can be clipped in as they are developed for military or civilian applications. Control is exercised from Aerovironment’s Ground Control Station (GCS) with a line of sight communications range of 15 km, and the system has its own internal GPS for positioning. The Ground Control Station is shared by the firm’s Raven and Wasp/BATMAV systems. Flight endurance is about 2 hours in the production version, and typical flight altitude is 100-500 feet. Like other mini-UAVs, Puma relies on its small size, small radar profile, and quiet engine to avoid detection. Contracts and Key Events FY 2013 -2016 Raven & Puma click for video August 16/16: A US Navy guided-missile destroyer has received an RQ-20B Puma UAV with a precision recovery system. Manufacturer AeroVironment stated that the recovery system enables the Puma to operate from a variety of vessels for rapid response reconnaissance. The multi-environment UAV is hand launched, and is programmed to autonomously glide back to the flight deck, but can also float; allowing for sea recovery. July 26/13: FAA. The US Federal Aviation Administration issues its 1st UAV Restricted Category Type Certificates, which include the Puma UAV. The UAV will support emergency response crews for oil spill monitoring and wildlife surveillance over Alaska’s Beaufort Sea, within the Arctic Circle. Experimental Airworthiness Certificates have been used for non-government UAV operations in the past, but they don’t allow commercial use. The FAA says that US military acceptance of the ScanEagle and Puma designs was an important factor in granting the new Restricted Category certificates, which do allow commercial operations. That’s going to be a hotter area for UAV manufacturers over the next few years, and for the FAA as well. The Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandated that the FAA integrate UAVs into domestic airspace by 2015, but a key deadline establishing 6 pilot sites by August 2012 wasn’t met. These type certificates are a small step forward, within a larger framework. Sources: US FAA | AeroVironment | NDIA’s National Defense magazine | Seattle Times. (Restricted) Commercial USA in USA Jan 3/13: SUAS 2013-2017. U.S. Army Contracting Command in Natick, MA awards a 5-year, $248 million multiple-vendor fixed-price Small UAS contract. From FBO.gov: “The Army currently has fielded 1,798 RQ-11B systems and 325 RQ-20A systems and has a requirement to sustain and maintain this existing fleet. The Army has met 92% of the RQ-11B Army Acquisition Objective (AAO), and has met 83% of the anticipated need for RQ-20A (required by USFOR-A-issued JUONS). Additionally, the current [DID: RQ-11B & RQ-20A] fleet has pre-planned spiral upgrades such as the Gimbal payload, which will be competed and retrofitted under this effort. The need exists to complete the AAO; maintain, sustain and upgrade the fleet; and procure future SUAS Systems as required by DoD, Other Government Agencies (OGA) and foreign countries.” Vendors will compete for each order, and work can include full Unmanned Aerial Systems, upgrades, testing, packaging, marking, and storage and shipping. Work location will be determined with each order, and the contract runs until Dec 20/17. The bid was solicited through the Internet, with 5 bids received. All 5 qualified to compete: RQ-11B Raven & RQ-20A Puma: AeroVironment Inc. in Monrovia, CA (W911QY-13-D-0073). Obviously, they’re in a strong position for fleet upgrades at least, as well as for additional UAVs. NOVA Block III: Altavian in Gainesville, FL (W911QY-13-D-0074). They’re not a household name, but their air/land UAV is working with the USACE (Army Corps of Engineers). They partner with ISR Group Inc. in Savannah, TN for support and service. Skylark-I LE Block 2: Elbit Systems of America LLC in Fort Worth, TX (W911QY-13-D-0075). Skystinger, and others: Innovative Automation Technologies LLC in Gainesville, FL (W911QY-13-D-0076). Skystinger is more like the RQ-11 Raven, while their AXO is closer to the RQ-20 Puma. Note that The Skystinger is the only UAS that IAT could confirm, but they did say there was more than 1 UAS offered. Desert Hawk III: Lockheed Martin Corporation, Owego, NY (W911QY-13-D-0077). The Desert Hawk has been successfully used on the front lines by British forces. The AECV contract expires in 2013, so this appears to be the follow-on. See also: AeroVironment | Elbit Systems | Gainesville Sun. SUAS multi-vendor Oct 20/12: Support. The US government announces a woman-owned small business only solicitation for up to $25.5 million in SUAS support work, after soliciting interest and finding 3 such businesses who qualify. The FBO.gov solicitation adds that: “…SUAS PdO must maintain the capability to support current and future Warfighter needs for SUAS systems in CONUS and OCONUS…. The objective of the SUAS Support Program is to support the Warfighter’s as well as other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) and Non-Governmental Agencies users’ SUAS-related sustainment needs. These needs primarily include SUAS training, maintenance, repairs, and engineering services. Additionally, the SUAS PdO will require various logistics, technical management, and program management services to support its SUAS customers.” FY 2012 USAF, USMC, Denmark & Sweden become customers; Puma becomes RQ-20; #1,000 delivered. Moving launch, Afghanistan (click to view full) June 12/12: Danish win. Aerovironment announces a $9.6 million win in Denmark. This competed win follows a $2.4 million Danish Army order for RQ-11B Raven systems in 2007. Denmark June 11/12: Swedish win. AeroVironment announces that they’ve won an unspecified Swedish firm fixed-price contract for 12 hybrid small unmanned aircraft systems. The Swedish Army’s order will be a mix of Puma AE and Wasp air vehicles, plus a set of common ground stations, training, and logistics support. Contract options could increase the buy to a total of 30 systems. The firm adds a roundup of foreign RQ-11 Raven, RQ-20 Puma, and Wasp customers: “In addition to Sweden, other international governments that have purchased AeroVironment small UAS include Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Italy, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Uganda, and the United Kingdom.” Sweden April 20/12: Puma = RQ-20. AeroVironment announces a $20.4 million firm-fixed-price follow-on order from the US Army for RQ-20A Puma AEs. They will provide overwatch for security, route clearance operations, etc. in Afghanistan. Delivery is scheduled within 30 days. Separately, AeroVironment announced the production and delivery of its 1,000th Puma AE air vehicle, and the USAF’s approval of the “RQ-20A” designation for the Puma AE system. Milestones: #1,000, RQ-20A April 20/12: USMC order. AeroVironment announces the 1st RQ-20A Puma AE order from the US Marine Corps. The $5.6 million firm-fixed-price order was placed via the all-services contract now managed by the US Army. Delivery is scheduled within 2 weeks. The USMC were pioneers in adopting mini-UAVs, picking AeroVironment’s RQ-14 Dragon Eye in 2003 for the Small Unit Remote Scouting System (SURSS) program. Other buys from the firm have included Wasp mini-UAVs beginning in 2007, and the replacement of their Dragon Eyes with RQ-11B Ravens beginning in 2009. The Puma buy will give the Marines the full 3 tiers of mini-UAV performance: Wasp, Raven, and Puma, ahead of the US Army’s own plans (vid. Feb 4/11 entry). USMC’s 1st April 18/12: USAF order. AeroVironment announces its 1st Puma AE order from the USAF, which already uses its RQ-11 Raven and Wasp mini-UAVs. The $2.4 million firm-fixed-price order is below the threshold for public notification, and was placed on April 5/12 through the existing U.S. Army contract. Delivery is scheduled within 2 weeks. USAF 1st April 4/12: Plans. The US Army discusses its plans for a family of small UAVs again. They may actually be headed toward 2 Family of Small UAS contracts (1 products, 1 services), in an effort to “refine requirements.” After all this time, the Army is still working on a capabilities document outlining the parameters of the Family of Small UAS. The Army is also hoping to develop a universal control station for the F-SUAS. Feb 13/12: Sentient MTI. AeroVironment, Inc. announces an exclusive global distribution license with Sentient in Melbourne, Australia for its Kestrel Land MTI Tier I automatic target detection software, designed for full motion video for use with small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Kestrel software automatically detects moving objects, then places tracking boxes around them for easy monitoring. That’s especially helpful with mini-UAVs, because of the payload optics’ limitations, and better tracking of multiple moving objects fills an obvious need of front-line troops. Over the past 18 months Sentient and AeroVironment have optimized and integrated the software with AeroVironment’s mini-UAS common Ground Control System for Puma, Raven, and Wasp UAVs. Sentient makes a number of Kestrel solutions used around the world. It’s worth noting that the AeroVironment deal doesn’t impair its Kestrel Land MTI Tier II/III used by larger UAVs like the ScanEagle, RQ-7 Shadow, and MQ-9 Reaper; and by patrol aircraft like the P-3 Orion; or its Kestrel Maritime products. What it does, is fence in the market for mini-UAS solutions with a desirable and hard-to copy capability. AeroVironment | Sentient. Jan 31/12: Pentagon DVIDS discusses preparations by the “Lancers” of Second Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, who are “going into Operation Enduring Freedom with the most Raven [a small unit UAS] and Puma operators in the history of OEF combat,” according to AMCOM UAS specialist Tarah Hollingsworth. Sgt. Christopher Harris, a 2nd SBCT UAS operations non-commissioned officer, adds that: “I was on the initial fielding of the Puma when it was first brought in about three years ago when I was in Afghanistan… We were able to use it on all kinds of patrols, whether it be presence patrols, recon or anything of that sort. I utilized it two times for a call for fire; it’s very accurate for that.” FY 2011 US Army joins AECV buy, assumes management of the contract; US Army’s 3-tier mini-UAV plans; RQ-16’s Tango Uniform opportunity?; Communication relay demo; Training issues.

AECV = Army Aug 16/11: Comm relay. Boeing announces successful May and August demonstrations of its new narrowband communications relay, using an Insitu ScanEagle and AeroVironment’s Puma AE mini-UAV. During the multiservice demonstrations, held in California, the UAVs flew at a variety of altitudes while linking handheld military radios dispersed over mountainous regions, extending the radios’ range tenfold. Larger RQ-7B Shadow UAVs have also been used in this role, but those are generally controlled at the battalion level or above. Narrowband relays small enough to work on hand-launched mini-UAVs like the Puma AE would represent an important step forward, especially for Special Operations forces. August 16/11: AeroVironment, Inc. announces a $65.5 million firm-fixed-price contract delivery order for new digital Puma AEs, and initial spares packages. It’s another buy under the existing $200 million US SOCOM All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) contract (vid. July 1/08), and will be delivered in the coming months. June 9/11: AeroVironment, Inc. in Monrovia, CA receives a $13.1 million cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification for “Puma unmanned aircraft systems training and contractor logistics support.” Aerovironment has since confirmed that this is for the Puma AE. They now simply call it “Puma,” because the very different UAV they had formerly called Puma is not in production. Work will be performed in Simi Valley, CA, and Kandahar, Afghanistan, with an estimated completion date of Oct 14/11. One bid was solicited, with one bid received by the U.S. Army Contracting Command in Redstone Arsenal, AL (W58RGZ-11-C-0004). April 20/11: Training issues. The US Army currently equips each brigade with 15 RQ-11B Raven systems, but the 9 Afghan BCTs want to raise that to 35 each (105 UAVs). They’re also shipping larger Puma-AE UAV systems into theater, with 64 in and another 20 requested. So what’s the problem? Training. Right now, the US FAA requires Federal Aviation Administration must issue a certificate of authorization, in order to fly UAVs in US air space. There are limits to that requirement, but it takes months to get that certification, and it’s hurting operator training. Commanders are complaining that some operators lack adequate pre-combat preparation, and must learn on the job. In response, the US Army has instituted a buddy program, a tracking program for operators, and a ground-based technical solution. Under the buddy program, skilled mini-UAV operators will teach other soldiers. The web tracker will make sure that qualified operators don’t get lost in the shuffle when they move from one brigade to another. The technical solution involves a ground-based sense-and-avoid system that may help expedite FAA certification. NDIA’s National Defense Magazine. April 21/11: AeroVironment, Inc. announces an $11.5 million firm-fixed-price delivery order for new digital Puma AE systems, initial spares packages, and training services. The new UAVs were bought under the existing United States Special Operations Command All Environment Capable Variant (USSOCOM AECV) indefinite-delivery/ indefinite-quantity contract, and deliveries are scheduled to be completed over the next several months. Feb 4/11: Platoon mini-trio. Aviation Week reports that the US Army wants to beef up UAV availability down to the platoon level, in an environment where, as Army Operations Office aviation UAS director Lt. Col. James Cutting puts it, “there will never be enough multi-million-dollar systems to cover them.” Where now there are 17 RQ-11 Ravens in a brigade combat team (BCT), the Army plans to increase this to 49 “Small UAS family of systems”, initially made up of AeroVironment’s Puma at the high end, RQ-11B Raven mini-UAV as the core, and smaller Wasp III as the true “flying binoculars” micro-UAV. Down the road, this set is expected to be a competition, and the numbers involved make it an attractive target. According to Cutting, the Army will push the new UAVs directly down to engineer, armor and infantry units, rather than forming more aviation units and adding their overhead. Since the UAVs in question are so small, and fly at under 1,000 feet, they can be used without worrying about “deconfliction,” and don’t really require the same planning & support overhead as, for instance, a unit of RQ-7B Shadows, or MQ-1C Gray Eagles. Aviation Week | Aviation Week Ares. Jan 6/11: The US Army issues a stop-work order on the Class I Unmanned Aerial System (RQ-16 T-Hawk), as part of the E-IBCT next-generation brigades. Formal termination takes place on Feb 3/11. In light of the Oct 22/10 order, this could become a major opportunity for the Puma AE. Defense News. Oct 26/10: Aerovironment announces a $7.2 million for an unspecified number of new digital Puma AE systems and training services, under the existing US SOCOM indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. Oct 25/10: More Army minis. The NDIA’s National Defense magazine reports that Puma AE is forcing its way into regular Army operations, due to a combination of unforgiving high-altitude terrain and roadside mission demands: “The Army currently supplies 15 sets of Ravens (with three aircraft per set) to each brigade in Afghanistan. The current plan is to buy 3,000 Ravens, and the Army so far has acquired more than 2,000… [but units] have asked for a “larger small” unmanned aircraft that can carry more sensors and fly longer… So the Army is now tapping into the SOCOM contract and buying 72 Pumas to meet urgent demands, Gonzalez said. The Puma request came directly from the top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David Petraeus… The Army already is testing the concept of a “family” of three aircraft (Raven, Puma and Wasp) in combat. It fielded 15 sets six months ago to the 101st Airborne Division and will allow the unit to keep them for a year for further evaluation, said Gonzalez. One of the concerns is designing a controller that can operate all three aircraft.” Oct 22/10: AeroVironment, Inc. in Simi Valley, CA receives a $17.2 million cost-plus-fixed-fee letter contract, which establishes not-to-exceed amounts for Puma-AE capable contractor logistics support, training, and accounting for contract services in support of Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement CC-0289, entitled, “Unmanned Aircraft Systems for Route Clearance.” AeroVironment confirms that this order is for the regular army, not SOCOM. The RQ-16 T-Hawk ducted fan UAV is supposed to be handling that special niche, but the Puma would appear to have carved out a place, thanks to its stabilized EO/IR payload, and added conventional reconnaissance capabilities. Work is to be performed in Simi Valley, CA, with an estimated completion date of Oct 14/11. One bid was solicited with one bid received by U.S. Army Contracting Command, CCAM-AR-A at Redstone Arsenal, AL (W58RGZ-11-C-0004). Army in. FY 2008 – 2010 $200M AECV win for US special Operations.

Work is scheduled to be performed “within a period of several months.” July 1/08: US SOCOM AECV. AeroVironment, Inc., wins a 5-year (base year plus 4 one-year option periods), maximum $200 million indefinite-delivery/ indefinite-quantity contract for an “all environment capable variant small unmanned aircraft systems” from the US SOCOM’s Program Executive Office – Fixed Wing. It covers aircraft, ground control systems, spares, repairs and training under a combination firm fixed-price, cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost reimbursable arrangement. The initial delivery order is valued at $6 million, and is fully funded. Work will be performed in Simi Valley, CA and the base year period lasts for exactly 1 year from date of contract award. This contract was awarded through full and open competition (H92222-08-D-0048). See also Aerovironment release. SOCOM AECV Puma fuel cell (click to view full) March 6/08: AeroVironment announces a 9 hour flight for a modified Puma powered by an onboard fuel cell/ battery hybrid energy storage system. During the flight, a 2-camera payload system provided a live, streaming video feed from the Puma. Aerovironment developed the battery pack, power electronics and controls portion of the hybrid energy storage system, which used London-listed Protonex Technology Corporation’s Pulse UAV fuel cell system. This successful demonstration is not part of the SOCOM bid, but is conducted under Aerovironment’s separate small business innovation research (SBIR) Phase II contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). AFRL’s goal is to develop advanced energy storage and propulsion technologies for unmanned aircraft. The overall program advanced swiftly from kickoff in January 2007, to a 5-hour flight in May 2007, a 7-hour flight in July 2007, and then this 9-hour flight. Aerovironment release.

ULA's Delta IV rocket lifts off with the AFSPC-6 mission for the United States Air Force. Marco SantanaContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Two rockets head into space to better map space junk Privacy Policy Two satellites expected to paint a clearer picture of debris and space junk headed into space from Florida early Friday. United Launch Alliance's Delta IV rocket took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 12:52 a.m. lighting up the night sky on the Space Coast. The rocket carried two Orbital ATK satellites to support space surveillance operations by U.S. Strategic Command. This will be the second launch of the month from Florida's Space Coast, following SpaceX's launch of a Japanese satellite last week. The missions contribute to what has become a busy time for the U.S. space program. On top of private commercial launches, NASA has also been gearing up for a high-profile job that will take its OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft to collect and retrieve a sample from the Bennu asteroid.

Ernest Rutherford first broke the nuclei of atoms at Manchester University in 1917. Our Queen opened the world's first nuclear power plant in 1956 at Calder Hall. Such were the halcyon days of British atomic confidence, before defeatism took hold and free market ideology was pushed to pedantic extremes. Most of Britain's ageing reactors will be phased out over the next decade, leaving a gaping hole in electricity supply. By historic irony the country has drifted into a position where it now depends on an ailing state-owned French company to build its two reactors at Hinkley Point, with help from the Chinese Communist Party. Watch | Aerials show the proposed site for Hinkley Point nuclear plant 00:28 The horrors Hinkley are by now well-known. The European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) is not yet working anywhere. The Olkiluoto plant in Finland is nine years late and three times over budget. EDF's Flamanville project is not faring much better. What is clear is that the costs of 'old nuclear' have spun out of control everywhere in the developed world. It is too expensive to keep trying to refine an inherently dangerous technology dating back 60 years in a Sisyphean attempt to make it less threatening after Chernobyl and Fukushima. Watch | Explained: Fukushima nuclear plant clean-up 03:02 The capital cost of new nuclear plants in Europe and the US has risen from $1,000 per kilowatt in the 1970s to around $5,500 today in real terms. Hinkley will be nearer $8,000. Hence the lapidary term 'negative learning' coined by Yale scientist Arnulf Grubler. The standard light water reactors were solid workhorses in their day - and averted huge releases of CO2 from fossil fuels - but they operate at 100 times atmospheric pressure. They need costly containment structures  to prevent an explosive release of deadly radioactive gases across hundreds of miles.  Ernest Rutherford first 'split the atom' at Manchester University in 1917 This nuclear cost spiral has been happening just as solar and wind costs plummet, and the verdict is in. The nuclear share of global power has dropped to 10.7pc from 17.6pc in 1996. Ten new reactors were built last year, but eight were in China. In Europe they are shutting down. There is an alternative. Research into a radical new wave of safer, cleaner, and cheaper reactors is suddenly reaching critical mass, some are entirely compatible with the intermittency of wind and solar. This is what Theresa May should be looking at as she launches her industrialisation drive and fashions an energy policy fit for the 21st Century. The Washington think tank Third Way has identified fifty advanced reactor projects in North America, including eight based on molten salt fuel, ten on liquid-metal, and some based on fusion designs. Energy capacity increase The US Energy Department has thrown its huge research power behind this push for a "meltdown-free" reactor cheap enough for mass production. It even explored micro modular variants for large jet aircraft at a forum in March, and Boeing has filed a patent to do exactly that with a laser-powered fusion-fission engine. One of the US-backed projects is a "waste annihilating molten salt reactor", which uses up spent nuclear fuel and lethal plutonium residue. As it happens, Britain's start-up company Moltex Energy is working on similar lines, and this country needs the technology even more urgently than the US. "We have the largest plutonium stockpile in the world and we don't know what to do with it," said Stephen Tindale from the Alvin Weinberg Foundation. Moltex founder Ian Scott estimates that his molten salt design can cut costs to almost a quarter of the Hinkley tariff. "We think we can come in at a levelized £29 per megawatt hour," he said. Nuclear reactor construction "That is radically cheaper than gas or coal in Europe. It could have a massive impact on the UK economy and it would be a terrible shame if we lose it," he said. Molten salt reactors were built by the US physicist Alvin Weinberg at the Oak Ridge Laboratories in the 1960s, but were never pursued because the Pentagon wanted the plutonium residue from light water reactors to build nuclear warheads. They dissolve the nuclear fuel in molten salts rather than using dry pellets of uranium. Advocates say a melt-down is impossible, and there can be no chain-reaction along the lines of Fukushima. If the reactor gets too hot, a freeze plug melts and the salts drain off. They cool down and turn solid. The fission process stops automatically. "It is inherently stable. You could break every containment barrier and still not get a leak of cesium or iodine outside the reactor," said Dr Scott. The plants operate at atmospheric pressure so they are much smaller and safer. Bags of radioactive contaminated soil piled up along the coast near the Fukushima nuclear plant The Moltex reactor can run off existing spent nuclear fuel, cleaning up the legacy headaches of old nuclear plants. "We can process nuclear waste very cheaply instead of burying it at enormous cost in steel tanks for 200,000 years underground," he said. The plan is switch to thorium as a "greener" source of fuel once Britain's stockpile of nuclear waste has been consumed. The Moltex design slashes costs by using a convection process that avoids pumping molten salt around the system. This reduces corrosion, the metallurgy barrier has bedevilled molten salt projects. Dr Scott is the former chief scientist of Unilever and his technical advisory board includes Derek Fray at Cambridge, Paul Madden at Oxford, and Tim Abram at Manchester. The design is one of several projects being examined by the UK government in its competition for the best small modular reactor.  "We have done everything entirely without government so far, and frankly we have had much more interest in Canada where we were welcomed with open arms by the regulators," said Dr Scott. Watch | Tour of Chernobyl 30 years after the disaster 03:28 Canada is now the crucible for molten salt reactors. Terrestrial Energy in Toronto is the most advanced such project in the world with an integral molten salt reactor, and is already pre-licensed. "We can bring our reactor to the commercial market in the 2020s," said the chief executive Simon Irish. "Once we put a shovel to the ground we can build it in three to four years. The parts can be manufactured on a mass scale.  We believe we can produce power for 40-50 US dollars per megawatt hour," he said. That is £31 to £38, a third of Hinkley. The reactor core - relatively cheap to make - is simply removed and replaced after seven years. Molten reactors have a double advantage. They operate at 700 degrees centrigade, much hotter than light water reactors. This dry 'high quality heat' is itself valuable. It can drive steam electrolysis, make ammonia fertilizers or polymers,  and can even be turned into methanol for synthetic transport fuels. Mr Irish said his 190 MW design is ideal for a new energy order dominated by renewables. "We can deploy extra power at peak times and pull it back into the troughs, and we can do it within minutes like a natural gas turbine. We tick all the boxes," he said. Old workhorse reactors cannot be switched on and off at will. Nuclear reactors cancelled I do not wish to neglect a flurry of other designs that may have equal promise, nor can I vouch for the technical and cost claims. Specialist readers will delve further, and make their own judgment. What is clear is that nuclear technology is in ferment. In a sense we have rare chance to go back to the drawing board. Britain still has a superb stable of nuclear scientists and talent but no longer faces a fortress of vested interests with horrendous sunk costs. It could leap frog the field. The British state can borrow for 20 years at 1.2 per cent and it should do so with zest to break out of the austerity cage, launching a blast of fiscal stimulus to carry the country through the post-Brexit adjustment while at the same time giving our engineering industries a shot of adrenaline. A gamble on the untested technology of advanced reactors might prove a costly flop but it is hard to see how it could be worse than a blank cheque for an obsolete nuclear model that will bleed us into the 2060s. At least we can take back our energy destiny.

Most Sikhs affected by this ban are residents in US, UK & Canada. NEW DELHI:Thousands of Sikhs in election-bound Punjab will likely cheer a Prime Minister's Office driven move to scrap a 32-year government blacklist that banned India visits by Sikh NRIs from 212 families. The blacklist was put in place by a Congress government after Operation Bluestar in 1984 and the Kanishka bombings in 1985. Most nonresident Sikhs affected by this ban are residents in the United States, UK and Canada. Operation Bluestar was an Indian Army offensive against Khalistani militants holed up in the iconic Golden Temple of Amritsar. It was ordered by the then prime minister Indira Gandhi. Explosives on board Air India's Kanishka, a Boeing-747 aircraft flying the Montreal-New Delhi route, destroyed the plane while it was over Irish air space killing 329 passengers, most of them Canadian-Indians. Sikh militant groups were investigated for the bombing and there were several arrests in Canada. Officials familiar with the government's decision on removing the blacklist said a committee headed by additional secretary of the home ministry had examined the blacklist, and 212 cases of a total of 324 were removed. The remaining cases are being examined and may be removed from the blacklist as well. These officials did not want to be identified. A home ministry spokesperson said he had no comments. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visits to the UK and Canada had seen several representations from Sikh NRI groups asking for reconsideration of the India travel ban. Officials said the proposal to remove the ban was opposed by the Intelligence Bureau. But the PMO intervened, and a committee was set up after which IB was asked to reexamine each case. One official explained that many of the blacklisted names were arbitrary. Entire families had been blacklisted on grounds that did not bear up to close scrutiny. The blacklist was never publicly acknowledged. But following several visa denials over the years, Sikh NRI groups started voicing opposition to what they described as systematic discrimination.

Amateur astronauts could head to the International Space Station in space taxis as early as next year, and NASA is making sure that the structure is able to receive visitors. On Friday, spacewalkers Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will start work on the installation of a new International Docking Adapter on the ISS. This component will allow crew vehicles dispatched by Boeing and SpaceX to safely dock at the station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The SpaceX Dragon space freighter transported the dock to the ISS, which orbits the Earth at an altitude between 205 and 270 miles. The Canadarm2 robot will soon move the component to within inches of its final resting place, at which point Williams and Rubins will be able to complete its installation manually — the process will apparently require a spacewalk lasting six and a half hours. Related: China is developing a hypersonic space plane that makes the Space Shuttle look primitive This is the final stage in a long, arduous process. Previous crew members aboard the ISS have already laid hundreds of feet of power and data cabling to integrate the dock into the station, according to a report from Engadget. Once the Dragon freighter has been relieved of the dock, it will be used to transport gear from the ISS back to Earth. On August 26, it’s set to be grappled by the Canadarm2 robot and then released back toward the planet for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA’s blog post detailing the operation. NASA will live-stream the dock installation Friday via its NASA TV service. The broadcast will begin at 6.30 a.m. ET, but the spacewalk won’t get underway until 8.05 a.m. Also watch: Raimond de Hullu’s vision for Oas1s green buildings Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Sgt. Bob Wickley / Reuters The Pentagon has reportedly expressed concern over the price of a yet-to-be developed new silo-based strategic nuclear missile Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Minuteman III missiles currently operated by the US Air Force are about 40 years old. The GBSD program supervised by the US Air Force aims at the development, production and deployment of 400 new ICBMs called to replace the outdated LGM-30G Minuteman III ground based ballistic missiles. America’s largest defense industry giants Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. are all competing to be awarded the new lucrative ICBM contract. However, the meeting of the Pentagon’s Defense Acquisition Board on August 3 exposed a substantial multibillion dollar gap between the estimates presented to the board by Air Force service and Pentagon’s office of independent cost assessment, a defense official familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, citing an unidentified US defense official familiar with the internal debate. ‘Anti-nuclear’ Obama plans to spend $1 trillion on nukes http://t.co/shcE0TrpVPpic.twitter.com/qkodWtE2Vs— RT America (@RT_America) September 22, 2014 According to the Air Force’s moderate 2015 estimates, the development of the new ICBM program would reportedly cost $62.3 billion for all stages combined, including the development and production of related infrastructure, command and control systems and operational commissioning. The Pentagon is well aware that the US has not developed or built new nuclear-capable ICBMs for decades, which implies that unexpected technical issues might emerge. So the military department has reportedly voiced concerns that cost considerations of the GBSD program are incomplete and should be reconsidered. “If there was something that we learned” from the Defense Acquisition Board meeting it is “the magnitude of this type of ICBM work,” Air Force Secretary Deborah James said during a “State of the Air Force” news conference last week. “There is a level of complexity that has to be worked through.” New deterrence: US plans to upgrade its nuclear bombhttps://t.co/6pCQsYXauvpic.twitter.com/T19jSUcQ1T— RT America (@RT_America) August 2, 2016 The US Department of Defense is seemingly reluctant to initiate a program with insufficient funds that would inevitably pose a problem in terms of the need to seek additional funding through Congress of by shifting funds from other Pentagon programs. The debate largely surrounds the methods of calculating the program’s cost, either making it on the basis of old missile development programs of the 1960s, or evaluating the costs according to the latest estimates readied by Pentagon’s cost analysts, Bloomberg’s source said. The Pentagon may reportedly give the green light for the GBSD program, if the Air Force reconciles the differences between their cost estimate and that of independent experts, and expresses readiness to be able to take the program past 2021, taking into consideration various estimates of inflation etc. The Air Force is now considering whether it will be able to back up the ICBM program financially in case extra money is needed, the source told Bloomberg. This means it would have to agree to the higher forecast or put the GBSD program on hold, because the Pentagon is unlikely to allow the Air Force to underfund it. “We’re working that through,” Air Force Secretary said. The Obama administration’s plan to modernize all of the US nuclear weapons arsenal, is expected to cost around $355 billion by 2023. However, critics say this figure could rise to over $1 trillion. The replacement of America’s only remaining silo-based LGM-30G Minuteman III ground based ballistic missiles is long overdue. READ MORE: Slush funds, secrets and splurges: How Pentagon budgets keep getting bigger Developed in late 1960s, Minuteman III was first deployed in 1970. Production of Minuteman III missiles was discontinued in 1978. At the time, each missile cost $7,000,000. The existing missiles have been repeatedly upgraded technically and electronically, yet in two years’ time the newest of the remaining 450 Minuteman III missiles will turn 40 years old. Still, the USAF reportedly expects the Minuteman III remain operable until 2030, when all of the existing LGM-30G missiles will be over half-century old.

Manchester Evening News 17/08/2016 By Lucy Roue © Provided by Manchester Evening News As around 40 per cent of adults who download the Pokemon app are older than 25 , it has the potential to cross over into valuable work time. So what can employers do to ensure their staff remain focused at work and are not distracted by this latest craze? Emma O’Leary, consultant at ELAS , specialising in employment law said: “The latest Pokemon Go obsession is a sign of the times and has gripped everyone from school children to grandparents, so employers can’t ignore it. "Believe it or not, we have been advising on disciplinary procedures for staff that have been leaving their work stations to hunt one of these characters. In one case, a carer actually left a resident alone because she’d sighted one outside.” As with any potential distraction during work hours - whether that’s personal phone calls, social media, texting or Pokemon - there is a need for employees to show self-control, but it also requires effective management. © Provided by Manchester Evening News Manchester's first Pokemon pub crawl launches this weekend As a manager it’s important to establish ground rules for behaviours and set a good example for your team. As an employee, if clients or co-workers are relying on you then you have to make sure that distractions such as Pokemon don’t impact on your ability to perform. Emma said: “If there are employees in your business who appear to have been bitten by the Pokemon bug , you need to set clear guidelines to complement your social media policy. "In this ever evolving world it’s crucial for businesses to have social media policies in place however, even without one, if your employee is abandoning their work to be glued to their phone and, as in the case we have been advising on, actually leaves the building to catch a Pokemon then this is a disciplinary matter. "The absence is not authorised, there is no reasonable explanation for it (even for a ‘rare’ Pokemon) and it’s a neglect of duties. It does warrant a written warning.” This Bury school teacher is making the most of out of the Pokemon Go craze...in a very unusual way The nature of Pokemon Go means that there are also health and safety concerns for businesses. The news is full of reports of people being run over, falling off cliffs, getting stuck in mines and crashing cars while pursuing Pokemon characters, and players are often deeply absorbed in their mobile phones to the exclusion of all else. In July, Boeing banned Pokemon Go from all company-owned devices and sent an email to staff after one employee came close to hurting themselves while playing, according to website 9to5mac.com. © Provided by Manchester Evening News © Provided by Manchester Evening News Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said “We used the Pokemon Go phenomenon as an opportunity to talk with our employees and remind them of Boeing’s strong focus on workplace safety.

The move follows Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s decision Wednesday to scrap a planned increase in municipal taxes on airline tickets and a relaxation of restrictions on the use of regional airports, in line with EU rules. Ryanair initially planned to base the planes in the U.K. The new Boeing Co. 737s will add 3 million travelers a year on 44 routes serving Rome, Milan and smaller Italian cities. The extra capacity will lift Ryanair’s annual Italian passenger tally to about 35 million next year, the carrier said. Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary credited Italy’s government with taking steps to improve the country’s competitiveness. “All of this growth would have been lost to other EU countries if the municipal tax increase had not been reversed and the airport guidelines had not been redrafted to comply with EU rules,” he said in a statement. Ryanair has said it will move about 50 jets due for delivery this year to markets other than the U.K. to offset the impact of an expected travel slump after the Brexit vote and the drop in the value of the pound. The airline cut prices 10 percent in the latest quarter to try to fill seats, a task that was made more difficult by a string of terror attacks in Europe.

The unmarked white and red Boeing 737s appear like any other at first sight. Lined up at Las Vegas‘ McCarran International Airport, several of the giant jets use their own private terminal. But they are not used by the public and only serve one destination – Area 51. Alamy 4 The mysterious jets are lined up beside a private terminal at the McCarran International Airport near Las Vegas Wikipedia 4 The unmarked 737 jets only fly between the airport and the notoriously secretive Area 51 – where many believe there is evidence of aliens Mysterious smoke billows from Area 51 UFO hotspot Extra terrestrial theorists believe the top-secret military base - hidden away in the Nevada desert - contains the remains of an alien aircraft that crashed in the 1950s. The area was bought up by the US military in 1955 and its existence was only acknowledged for the first time in 2005. It is believed to be the testing site for top-secret cutting-edge military technology. Related stories WHAT THE UFO IS THAT?

Nobody who flies on the planes is allowed to reveal where they are going or what their job is. Operating from a private terminal at the Vegas airport, they only fly to and from Area 51. But an extra-terrestrial expert who used to investigate UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence believes there is little to the rumours. Nick Pope told the Mail: "Area 51 exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown. Alamy 4 The top secret military base was bought up by the US government in 1955 and was only acknowledged for the first time in 2005 Alamy 4 Some conspiracy theorists believe it is the site of an alien crash landing in the 50s 'Flying saucer' transported near secret US base "The UFO and conspiracy theory community think it's the place where crashed UFOs are kept and where the US military are trying to back-engineer this alien technology. "And even Hillary Clinton has said that if she's elected President she'll look into the claims. "Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. "Having been name-checked in movies like Independence Day, Area 51 has become part of pop culture and the secret is out, so if there ever was alien technology at Area 51, I suspect it's been moved to a location we've never heard of."

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     ISS Crew Will Install A New Commercial Dock For Space Taxis Posted: Aug 17 2016, 7:29am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   This computer rendering depicts a spacewalker performing installation activities for the International Docking Adapter. Credit: NASA Johnson YouTube NASA to Set Up a Brand New Dock on the ISS Soon   NASA's able astronauts are to set up a brand new dock on the ISS soon. In fact, the coming Friday has been chosen as the due date for this mission. After being stuck aboard the ISS for eons, NASA astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams will get a chance to do some radical stretching soon. It will be a six and a half hour long spacewalk that will occur on the upcoming Friday. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock However this will not be for leisure purposes alone. These two astronauts will instead be installing an international docking adaptor (IDA) on the external surface of the ISS.  NASA will present this interesting scenario in the form of a live stream video at 6:30 AM ET. What is called the IDA is a fundamental part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. According to Engadget, many private companies form “space taxis” for NASA which take astronauts to and fro between the earth and the ISS. SpaceX is busy manufacturing the Crew Dragon. As for Boeing, it is tinkering with a CST-100 Starliner. These spacecrafts will relay astronauts between the earth and the ISS in 2017 and 2018.  The IDA reached the ISS on July 20th. It had gotten launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. However, the Dragon capsule was not employed for this purpose at all. It was the Dragon’s trunk which served quite well for this worthy task. The IDA remained within the trunk. It will be taken out on the upcoming Friday and attached with the ISS’s exterior. The astronauts will play a crucial role in the procedure. Also the robotic arm of the ISS will go into action to attach the IDA with the surface. The two astronauts will get a little help from a Japanese astronaut named Takuya Onishi who hails from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. He will assist them from within the ISS.   While this is the fourth spacewalk for Williams, it will be the first for Rubins. During the course of the installation, the two astronauts will be able to rehydrate via a large bag of water, but they won’t eat a thing. NASA is concerned lest this spacewalk go wrong. So all precautionary measures have been taken beforehand. Basically, the IDA was supposed to be sent to the ISS last summer. Yet that didn’t pan out. So today this unfinished business is being brought to reach its denouement.

Employment law expert ELAS on the potential pitfalls of the latest digital craze  Share ByLucy Roue 16:10, 17 AUG 2016 Updated16:13, 17 AUG 2016 Business  Share Get business updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email As around 40 per cent of adults who download the Pokemon app are older than 25 , it has the potential to cross over into valuable work time. So what can employers do to ensure their staff remain focused at work and are not distracted by this latest craze? Emma O’Leary, consultant at ELAS , specialising in employment law said: “The latest Pokemon Go obsession is a sign of the times and has gripped everyone from school children to grandparents, so employers can’t ignore it. "Believe it or not, we have been advising on disciplinary procedures for staff that have been leaving their work stations to hunt one of these characters. In one case, a carer actually left a resident alone because she’d sighted one outside.” As with any potential distraction during work hours - whether that’s personal phone calls, social media, texting or Pokemon - there is a need for employees to show self-control, but it also requires effective management. Read More Manchester's first Pokemon pub crawl launches this weekend As a manager it’s important to establish ground rules for behaviours and set a good example for your team. As an employee, if clients or co-workers are relying on you then you have to make sure that distractions such as Pokemon don’t impact on your ability to perform. Emma said: “If there are employees in your business who appear to have been bitten by the Pokemon bug , you need to set clear guidelines to complement your social media policy. "In this ever evolving world it’s crucial for businesses to have social media policies in place however, even without one, if your employee is abandoning their work to be glued to their phone and, as in the case we have been advising on, actually leaves the building to catch a Pokemon then this is a disciplinary matter. "The absence is not authorised, there is no reasonable explanation for it (even for a ‘rare’ Pokemon) and it’s a neglect of duties. It does warrant a written warning.” Read More This Bury school teacher is making the most of out of the Pokemon Go craze...in a very unusual way The nature of Pokemon Go means that there are also health and safety concerns for businesses. The news is full of reports of people being run over, falling off cliffs, getting stuck in mines and crashing cars while pursuing Pokemon characters, and players are often deeply absorbed in their mobile phones to the exclusion of all else. In July, Boeing banned Pokemon Go from all company-owned devices and sent an email to staff after one employee came close to hurting themselves while playing, according to website 9to5mac.com. Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said “We used the Pokemon Go phenomenon as an opportunity to talk with our employees and remind them of Boeing’s strong focus on workplace safety. "As we strive for zero injuries, we prohibit employees from walking and using mobile devices at the same time on Boeing property. This has been a safety standard since 2014. Doing so has contributed to improvements in eliminating distractions and reducing the risk for slips, trips and falls.” O’Leary says businesses should not ignore the health and safety risks that Pokemon Go brings, particularly in certain industries.

Even if your company is office based there is the danger of employees walking into others or falling down stairs.

(Liz Martin/The Gazette) B.A. Morelli The Gazette More stories from B.A. Aug 17, 2016 at 5:00 am | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — The story of Major Robert M. Horsky can be told through his planes. The United States Air Force veteran and Cedar Rapids native, who died in the skies over Vietnam in 1965, built model airplanes starting in high school and throughout his 20-year military career. The models capture the history of flight with a definite military focus, particularly the World War II, Korean War and Vietnam eras. “It’s a wide range of flight from the Wright Brothers to the modern day of his era aircraft,” said Jim Douglas, a member of the Alexander Lippish Modeling Club and a volunteer at the Veterans Memorial Building where a new Horsky exhibit is on display. Douglas inventoried the collection and performed repairs before In Flight: The Horsky Collection of Model Airplanes went live in July at the Veterans Memorial Building, 50 Second Avenue Bridge. The collection has 185 models, including about a dozen flown by Horsky, on display on the fourth floor outside the old city council chambers. The free exhibit is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Many may remember the same models being on display at The Eastern Iowa Airport for nearly 50 years until a remodel in 2012. The aviation collection had a short stint at The History Center before the latest move. The exhibit is about more than just the models, though. It chronicles Horsky’s life with additional effects including a service uniform, a timeline, old articles and letters, pictures, plane blueprints, dog tags and his flight log book, which helps tie his life to the models. “It was very emotional the first time I saw it because it was like sitting in a room of his stuff,” said his daughter Jan Wieneke, 51, of Phoenix, who was 11 months old when he died. “It’s an interesting display the way they put everything together with the timeline, and his log. It gives a much better picture then just the planes on display.” Horsky’s modeling hobby started as a student at the old Wilson High School and member of the Civil Air Patrol program, a citizen volunteer initiative to support the military. “Soldiers would study the models the high schoolers were making so they could identify aircrafts,” said Teri Van Dorston, Veterans Memorial assistant director who helped curate the exhibit. The first plane in the collection is a wooden model of a Nakajima E8NI Dave, built likely in the early 1940s, she said. Horsky continued modeling as he moved from base to base around the globe over his 20 years of service, beginning in 1945 until his death. Douglas said he found the models of planes Horsky flew most interesting and some had extra details, such as weather streaks and aluminum panels. A Rockwell International Aero Commander U-4 model included the tailnumber from Horsky’s craft. A Navy version of the Douglas AD6 Sky Raider, which specialized in close ground support missions in Vietnam, a B-29, in which Horsky was lead pilot with a crew of 11, a B-47 Boeing Stratojet with a crew of three and a B-52 are other models in the collection flown by Horsky, Douglas said. The collection features crafts from Japan, Great Britain, Germany and Canada, as well as different styles such as triplanes and biplanes. “These are the planes that made aviation into what it is today,” Douglas said of the collection.

USD 537 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 5.3% compared to the second quarter of the previous year, with a growth of approx. 7.9% in passenger flights. Said increase in revenue from passengers resulted from a significant growth in the number of the Company's passengers and the passenger revenue per kilometer (RPK) that was affected, inter alia, by the timing of Passover, which this year occurred in the second quarter, whereas last year Passover occurred at the beginning of April, thus departures for Passover holiday had already started in the last week of March. On the other hand, revenues were adversely affected by the continued trend of decrease in fight ticket prices as a result of the impact of the drop in oil prices and the intensified competition. In the Cargo Segment, the Company's revenues decreased by approx. 14.6%, mainly as a result of a drop in the yield of Ton-Kilometer and a decline in the amount of Ton-Kilometer flown. Operating Expenses –amounted to approx. USD 414 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 1.4% compared to the second quarter of the previous year, mainly due to an increase in operations, disruptions in staffing flights (which began in October 2015 and continue until the publication of this report) and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses, mostly arising from an increase in the number of the company's aircrafts and a change in the estimated residual value of the 777 aircrafts, as explained in Note 3.B. to the Condensed Financial Statements. The USD 32 million increase in operating expenses) excluding Jet Fuel expenses)  has been offset by the USD 26 million decrease in the Company's jet fuel expenses, as explained below. Jet Fuel Expenses – the Company's jet fuel expenses, including hedging impact, declined by approx. USD 26.3 million (about 21%) compared to the corresponding expenditure of the previous year, as a result of a significant drop in the effective price of jet fuel, offset in part by an increase in the amount of jet fuel consumed due to the growth in the scope of the Company's operations (about 9% growth in flight hours). Selling Expenses – selling expenses increased by approx. 5.8%, mainly as a result of the increase in the revenue turnover compared to the second quarter of the previous year. Other Income, Net – in the reported quarter, the Company recorded other income of approx. USD 1.0 million in respect of capital gain from the sale of a 737-700 aircraft. In the second quarter of the previous year, the Company recorded other expense, net, of approx. USD 4.8 million, in respect of an early retirement plan for the Company's employees. Financing Expenses –financing expenses amounted to approx. USD 4.5 million, compared to approx. USD 3.8 million in the second quarter last year. Said increase mainly resulted from exchange rate differences. Taxes on Income – taxes on income in the reported quarter amounted to approx. USD 12.0 million compared to approx. USD 6.3 million in the second quarter of the previous year. This growth resulted from the increase in profit before taxes on income. Profit for the Period – profit before tax in the reported quarter amounted to approx. USD 47.0 million (profit after tax amounted to approx. 35.0 million, constituting about 6.5% of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 23.6 million in the second quarter of last year (profit after tax stood at approx. USD 17.3 million, about 3.4% of the turnover). Cash flows from operating activities – the Company generated positive cash flows from operating activities of approx. USD 107.2 million, compared to positive cash flows from operating activities of approx. USD 78.9 million in the second quarter of last year. This growth mainly resulted from the increase in profit before taxes in the reported quarter compared to the second quarter of last year, and from the fact that the cash flows from operating activities for the reported period were adversely affected (about USD 15 million) due to a payment for hedging transactions, which was not recognized in profit and loss. Profit and Loss Results for the Six-Month Period Ended on June 30, 2016: Operating Revenues – amounted to approx. USD 934 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 0.4% compared to the first half of the previous year, as passenger flights increased by approx. 2.4% in and cargo revenues decreased by approx. 12.0%. The main trends affecting operating revenues in the first half of 2016, compared to the first half of 2015, are substantially similar to the trends explained in the analysis of the results for the second quarter provided above (except for the timing of Passover Holiday). In addition, the Company's revenues for the six-month period were adversely affected by the erosion of exchange rates of currencies, in which the sales transactions of the Company are made, in relation to the dollar. Operating Expenses –amounted to approx. USD 776 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 0.1% compared to the first half of the previous year, mainly due to an increase in operations, disruptions in staffing flights (which began in October 2015 and continue until the publication of this report) and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses, mainly arising from an increase in the number of the company's aircrafts and a change in the estimated residual value of the Boeing 777 aircrafts. The USD 62.5 million increase in operating expenses (excluding Jet fuel expenses) has been offset by the USD 62 million decrease in the Company's jet fuel expenses. Financing Expenses –financing expenses, net, totaled approx. USD 9.1 million, compared to approx. USD 11.6 million in the first half of the previous year. Said decrease mainly resulted from early redemption of a loan during the first quarter of 2016, as explained in Note 5.B.2 to the Condensed Financial Statements. Tax Benefit – tax benefit in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 0.2 million, notwithstanding the profit recognized in this period, due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in the recognition of tax income on the date of the change, in the amount of approx. USD 3.8 million (see also Note 10 to the Condensed Financial Statements). In the corresponding period last year, income tax expenses of approx. USD 0.6 million were recorded. Profit for the Period – profit before taxes on income in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 13.4 million (profit after tax amounted to approx. 13.6 million, constituting about 1.5% of the turnover), compared to profit before taxes on income of approx. USD 1.9 million in the same period last year (profit after tax stood at approx. USD 1.3 million, about 0.1% of the turnover). Balance Sheet Data as of June 30, 2016: Current Assets amounted to approx. USD 525.9 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 131.6 million compared to December 31, 2015. This growth mostly resulted from an increase in cash balances (see cash flow analysis below) and a seasonal increase in the Trade receivables item. Current Liabilities amounted to approx. USD 915.1 million. The growth of about USD 72 million compared to December 31, 2015, mainly resulted from a seasonal increase in Unearned revenues from sale of airline tickets and an increase in Other payables mostly due to an increase in advances from customers, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings and current maturities, and a decrease in the Derivative financial instruments item (see Note 4 to the Condensed Financial Statements). Working Capital – as of June 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of approx. USD 389.2 million compared to a deficit of approx. USD 448.8 million as of December 31, 2015. It shall be noted, that a substantial part of the working capital deficit does not reflect short-term cash flows, as hereinafter explained. The Company's current ratio as of June 30, 2016 rose to approx. 57.5% compared to 46.8% as of December 31, 2015. The working capital of the Company consists of two substantial components, which are included in the Company's Current Liabilities items and are characterized by current business cycle; however, the Company is not required to use cash-flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components: Unearned revenues from the sale of airline tickets and from the Frequent Flyer Club, to be settled by providing future flight services, and liabilities to employees for vacation, which are expected to be paid over several years but classified as a short-term liability in accordance with accounting principles. Furthermore, as specified in Note 5.B.3 to the Condensed Financial Statements, a loan of about USD 30 million, the original maturity date of which is in April 2017, is expected to be settled over a period of 4 years, therefore it will be classified, starting from the financial statements for the third quarter of 2016, as a long-term liabilities. It shall be noted that the working capital is affected, inter alia, by the seasonality of operations and among others, by the timing of the holidays. Non-Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 1,288.6 million, showing a growth of approx. USD 18.8 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2015, mainly as a result of receiving three 737-900 aircrafts, as provided in Note 3.A to the Condensed Financial Statements, less current depreciation. Non-Current Liabilities - totaled approx. USD 675.2 million, reflecting an increase of approx. USD 48.9 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2015. Said increase resulted mostly from loans obtained to finance the acquisition of three 737-900 aircrafts (see Note 5.B.1 to the Condensed Financial Statements) and an increase in deferred tax liabilities, mainly due to the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives, which in accounting terms were designated as hedging instruments, as well as due to profit before taxes on income for the period, offset by the decrease in the corporate tax rate. Equity – amounted to approx. USD 224.3 million. The growth of approx. USD 29.5 million compared to equity as of December 31, 2015, mainly resulted from the profit for the period and the impact of the Company's hedging instruments on the equity funds, in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 35.2 million, offset by the impact of liabilities for employee benefits on the equity funds, in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 4.7 million. Additionally, the increase in equity was partially offset by a dividend of approx. USD 15 million, which was paid in April this year. About EL AL EL AL Israel Airlines Ltd.

Photo by Reuters/Kham Prolonged layovers between Vietnam and the United States might soon be a thing of the past. National carrier Vietnam Airlines is readying itself to open direct flights to the United States in 2018, its Chief Executive Officer Duong Tri Thanh has said. Vietnam Airlines started making preparations for the route 10 years ago, Thanh was quoted by Vietnam News Agency as saying on Wednesday. He added that the carrier has focused on enhancing the long-haul flying experience for passengers by expanding its fleet with larger airplanes, including Airbus 350 – 900s and Boeing B787 Dreamliners. Vietnamese airlines must meet CAT1 requirements set by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which are specifically for non-stop flights to the U.S. Under the requirements, the air carriers from the assessed state may initiate or continue service to the United States in a normal manner and take part in reciprocal code-share arrangements with U.S. carriers. according to the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam. Vietnamese aviation authorities and Boeing last year signed an agreement in which the U.S. airplane manufacturer pledged, through technical and training assistance, to help Vietnamese aviation officials reach CAT1 standards. Based on CAT1 requirements, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will decide which foreign airlines are allowed to operate direct flights to the U.S. Visitors from the U.S. to Vietnam during the first six months of the year increased 14.5 percent from a year earlier to roughly 300,000, accounting for 6 percent of total international arrivals to the Southeast Asian country in that period.

Area 51 The fleet, nicknamed Janet Airlines, operates from McCarran Airport  None of the planes carry logos and you can't buy a ticket for their service Conspiracy theorists claim Area 51 in Nevada houses UFO technology  By Ted Thornhill for MailOnline Published: 02:42 EST, 17 August 2016 | Updated: 12:48 EST, 17 August 2016 e-mail 2.6k shares 495 View comments A fleet of passenger aircraft is stabled at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport that it's impossible to buy tickets for. They don't carry any company logos – they're plain white with a red band down the side - and anyone who boards one is sworn to secrecy about where they're going and what they do for a living. The reason that the aircraft, mostly Boeing 737s, are so shadowy in nature, is because they serve America's most secret military base, Area 51 in Nevada, which conspiracy theorists claim houses UFO technology. Scroll down for video  At Las Vegas McCarran International Airport is a fleet of passenger aircraft (pictured) it's impossible to buy tickets for - because they fly to the US's secret Area 51 military base They are run by the United States Air Force and operate from a private terminal at McCarran nicknamed Gold Coast, according to Flight Club. The fleet does have a name of sorts – Janet Airlines, because that's the call sign the planes in it use while in civilian airspace.

Share this article Share From Las Vegas they fly north-west to a place that has what's widely regarded as the most restricted airspace in the world, the Area 51 base in the Nevada Test and Training Range. In fact, Flight Club calls it 'restricted airspace inside restricted airspace'. It claims that once the Janet aircraft approach this secretive area their call signs change from the likes of 'Janet 210' to 'bones 58'. Once they touch down, the passengers disembark into a facility that's inspired countless books, TV shows and movies, but about which very little is known. The Area 51-bound planes are run by the United States Air Force and operate from a private terminal at McCarran nicknamed Gold Coast (pictured) UFO expert Nick Pope said: 'Area 51 [pictured] exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown' Nick Pope, author of Encounter in Rendlesham Forest and the man who used to investigate UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence, explained to MailOnline Travel that Area 51 is the place where some of America's most hi-tech military hardware is built and tested – but he doubts any of it is extra-terrestrial in origin. He said: 'Area 51 exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown. 'The UFO and conspiracy theory community think it's the place where crashed UFOs are kept and where the US military are trying to back-engineer this alien technology, and even Hillary Clinton has said that if she's elected President she'll look into the claims. 'Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. 'Having been namechecked in movies like Independence Day, Area 51 has become part of pop culture and the secret is out, so if there ever was alien technology at Area 51, I suspect it's been moved to a location we've never heard of.'

Life Buy/Sell Political Fix Close Eric Schmitt, Republican Schmitt continues push for Iran investment ban in bid for Missouri treasurer By Celeste Bott St. Louis Post-Dispatch Celeste Bott Aug 16, 2016 (…) Eric Schmitt, Republican JEFFERSON CITY • An effort to ban state investment in companies that do business in Iran may not have made it through the Missouri legislature in its most recent session, but sponsoring Sen. Eric Schmitt has made it part of his platform in his bid for state treasurer. The Glendale Republican is running against former Democratic state Rep. Judy Baker to be Missouri’s next chief financial officer, a job that would put the Nov. 8 general election winner in charge of overseeing the state’s spending and investments. “When I’ve talked about this going around the state for several months, people are outraged that their money would make its way to Iran,” Schmitt said. The treasurer’s office already has a policy in place prohibiting investment in countries designated as terrorist outposts, but Schmitt has pushed for that to become a law. Earlier this month, he announced a plan to ramp up efforts should he be elected treasurer, including updating the existing policy and using the office to work with local governments on their investment policies. It’s a state-level response to an ongoing federal battle, as Republicans continue to voice opposition to a landmark nuclear deal reached in 2015 between Iran, the United States and several other world powers. In exchange for lifting economic sanctions for Iran, the deal puts limits on Iran’s nuclear program and increases oversight. While the Obama administration lauds improved relations with Iran as a result of the agreement, many Republicans say lifting the sanctions provides financial relief and means to a state sponsor of terrorism. The fight has trickled down to state politics through Defund Iran, a group that aims to put constitutional amendments before voters that would keep state dollars away from corporations that do businesses with countries like Iran. It’s chaired by former Missouri Treasurer Sarah Steelman and co-chaired by Schmitt. Opponents have argued these efforts amount to fear-mongering. Schmitt says escalating attacks from ISIS make it clear terrorism is a growing threat. He also points to bipartisan support for his proposed investment ban, saying the bill didn’t make it through because of time constraints, not opposition. The bill passed both chambers with overwhelming majorities, but the session ended before amendments could be approved. In the Senate, only former Minority Leader Joe Keaveny voted against it on the grounds that it could negatively impact Boeing Co., an aerospace company that sells commercial airplanes to Iran and employs more than 14,000 people in St. Louis. “Do we really want to be in the position where we prohibit all of the state pension systems from investing in Boeing, a local manufacturer, and international manufacturer?” said Keaveny, a St. Louis Democrat, at the time. Schmitt actually sponsored legislation in 2013 that helped the state lure a Boeing plant to St. Louis County, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle heralded its potential for job creation. Now though, he says banning investment in companies like Boeing is the “natural consequence” of opposing the Iran Deal, and it’s one he said Democrats have already gotten behind. “A lot of Democrats voted for that ban investing in those companies,” Schmitt said. “I think, look, terrorism is undeniably a very serious issue for our country. We have a moral imperative to be in the lead here to say that we are not going to be part of it.” Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Be informed.

This research report titled 'Global Cloud CFD Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes an up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. "CFD is a tool that analyzes the flow, turbulence, pressure distribution, and interaction of liquids and gases with various structures. It is the science of predicting fluid flow, mass transfer, chemical reactions, and related phenomena. The CFD technology uses computers, computational methods, data of fluid viscosity, and fluid flow rates to simulate the flow of fluids," says Amrita Choudhury, a lead analyst at Technavio for enterprise application research. The global cloud CFD market will have a positive growth in the forecast period because of the increasing demand for CFD from the automotive and aerospace and defense industries and the advances in cloud computing. Request sample report: http://goo.gl/9jmBxy The report categorizes the global cloud CFD market into three major end-user segments. They are: Automotive industry Aerospace and defense industry Electrical and electronics industry CFD in automotive industry The demand for more sophisticated technologies from customers has increased, resulting in a growing demand for CFD. It plays a major role in the design and development of interior and exterior features such as enhanced night vision with pedestrian detection and automatic high beam control. Moreover, the increasing vehicle standards across several countries are a major factor driving the minimum requirement in vehicles. For instance, the US CAFE standards, which came into effect in 2016, emphasized increased fuel efficiency. This led to the need for enhanced fuel injection technology and fuel-efficient engine design, which require the use of CFD. Advances in computing and complex code-solving programs have helped the CFD market in the automotive industry to obtain more accurate prediction and analysis. CFD is used for all components that interact with fluids such as lubricants, fuel, water, coolants, and exhaust gases. CFD is used for optimizing interior climate control systems, which include windshield defogging and defrosting. CFD is also used while spray painting automobiles. The effect of spray guns and paint particles on the automobile body can be calculated using CFD. Even vehicle headlights require CFD for thermal management while configuring the position of headlights and to estimate the heat emitted through conduction from the light source. CFD in aerospace and defense industry In 2015, the high adoption of CFD by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, General Dynamics, Bombardier Aerospace, GE Aviation, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Honeywell Aerospace L-3 Communications, and Textron for R&D activities contributed to the growth of the market. Before the evolution of CFD,aircraft manufacturing companies used wind tunnel testing and flight testing to check the performance of designed products. With the development of fast and highly efficient computers in recent years, the old tools and methods of testing were replaced by numerical simulation methods based on the Navier-Stokes equation. The Navier-Stokes equation is used to describe the motion of fluid substances using Newton's second law of motion. Thus, this equation and the numerical simulations collectively help in building CFD solutions. CFD is widely used in various design stages of aircraft manufacturing and R&D. In the aerospace and defense industry, CFD is also used to design external aerodynamics, fuel systems, cockpit and cabin ventilation, engine core compartments, missiles, and submarines. CFD in electrical and electronics industry The electrical and electronics industry is growing at a fast rate in APAC because of the increasing demand for semiconductor components, consumer durables, electronics goods, and high-technology products, especially in China, South Korea, India, and Japan. The major countries in APAC that played a significant role in the cloud CFD market in the electrical and electronics industry include China, Japan, and Taiwan. Smartphones were the major areas of R&D in the electrical and electronics industry. CFD is mainly used for conducting mechanical stress analysis; heat transfer and losses; and structural analysis in electrical machines such as generators and electrical engines. "Since the inception of CFD in the 1980s, it has been used mainly for conducting thermal design of electronics systems," says Amrita.

Wednesday November 23, 2016 Analysis Argentina Community Economy World Culture Media Sports English on the Side   Tuesday, August 16, 2016 CEO’s line up for gov’t investment forum More than 1,500 foreign business leaders set to arrive next month in Buenos Aires More than 1,500 foreign business leaders and representatives from governments and global organizations will arrive next month to Buenos Aires for the “Forum on Investment and Business in Argentina,” a three-day government-led summit to lure foreign investment. Described as President Mauricio Macri’s “Mini-Davos,” such an event was initially discussed at the World Economic Forum, the international gathering between governments and private companies held in Davos, Switzerland earlier this year. Macri’s presence there marked the first time since 2003 that Argentina was represented at the annual forum. The summit will be held between September 12 and 15 and will focus on investment projects in Argentina, mainly regarding renewable energy, oil and natural gas, agriculture, industrial services, mining, transport and logistics, public works and infrastructure, telecommunications and technology, tourism and real-estate. Many foreign business leaders have already said yes to the invite such as the heads of BP (Bob Dudley), Export-Import Bank (Fred Hochberg), Siemens (Joe Kaeser), Coca-Cola (Muhtar Kent), Boeing (Donna Hrinak) and Dow (Andrew Liveris). They will be welcomed at a reception at Teatro Colón on September 12, with the forum officially kicking off the next day. Macri will open and close the forum, which will have working sessions — most of them taking place behind closed-doors — over Argentina’s investment potential. There will also be an “innovation day” on September 15 that will feature “success stories” of countries which are moving forward on innovation, the main example being Silicon Valley in San José and San Francisco bay areas of the United States. The Agency of Investment and International Commerce, led by Juan Procaccini, an economist with expertise in investment, will be organizing the event. For Procaccini, the meeting will serve “to show the changes and reforms Argentina is making, including the most ambitious infrastructure plan in its history.” “We have identified four major sectors in need of investment: energy, mining, infrastructure and agriculture,” Procaccini said last week. Attracting foreign investment has been a pillar of Macri’s administration, which has often blamed the previous Cristina Fernández de Kirchner government for “cutting Argentina off from the world.” With that in mind, Macri has paid off the so-called “vulture funds,” attended the World Economic Forum and removed the foreign currency restrictions — all in order to gain more international credibility and attract investment. Nevertheless, results haven’t paid off yet. Stubbornly high inflation and fiscal deficit and a larger-than- expected economic drop for this year have delayed the arrival of capital flows, experts agree, while claiming more time will be needed for projects to be carried out. In the first half of the year, foreign direct investment (FDI) reached US$1.3 billion, according to Central Bank data. While the amount almost equals the annual investment for 2015, it only represents less than five percent of the US$30.1 billion in investment announcements as calculated by the Finance Ministry. When looking at each sector, the US$1.3 billion invested in the first six months of the year was focused on oil (US$336 million), communications (US$247 million), food, drinks and tobacco (US$179 million) and the vehicle industry (US$111 million). Another US$900 million arrived in the country but only for bonds and financial asset investment. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said Argentina will shrink by 1.5 percent this year, a greater contraction than initially expected — a forecast shared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Things get underway around 8:05AM ET, and you can watch NASA's coverage of the event in the livestream above. The IDA is a key element of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program The IDA is a key element of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. That’s the initiative in which private companies create "space taxis" for NASA, to ferry the agency’s astronauts to and from the space station. For the program, SpaceX is building a crewed version of its Dragon cargo capsule, called Crew Dragon, and Boeing is building a brand-new crew capsule called the CST-100 Starliner. Those spacecraft are slated to carry astronauts to the ISS for the first time in late 2017 and early 2018, respectively. And when they arrive at the station, they’ll dock with the IDA. The docking adapter just got to the space station on July 20th, after launching on one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets. It didn’t travel inside SpaceX’s pressurized Dragon capsule, though, which usually houses all the cargo bound for the station. Instead, the adapter was transported inside the Dragon’s trunk — the unpressurized structure attached to the end of the capsule that provides support and houses the vehicle’s solar panels. The IDA has mostly remained in the trunk since its arrival, until it was freed on Wednesday, August 17th. The station’s robotic arm removed the IDA from the trunk and placed the adapter about three feet away from the port it will be connected to. Now that the IDA is in position, Rubins and Williams will exit the ISS and go through the complex process of hooking up the adapter to its port. Fortunately, lots of preparations have already been made to help the installation run smoothly. In four previous spacewalks, astronauts positioned all the necessary cables that Rubins and Williams will attach to the docking adapter to give it power and connectivity. Additionally, the two astronauts will have help from Takuya Onishi of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, who will remain inside the ISS during the spacewalk. After helping them to suit up, Onishi will manage a control panel inside the station that will help to physically connect the IDA to its port. "There’s a very coordinated interplay between the external crew outside, Tak on the outside, and the ground doing the commanding," said Zeb Scoville, the spacewalk flight director, during a NASA briefing. This will be the fourth spacewalk for Williams and the first for Rubins This will be the fourth spacewalk for Williams, who has been traveling to space since 2000. For Rubins, the spacewalk will be her first, though she has been training for this particular mission for years on the ground, according to Scoville. During the installation, the astronauts will be able to drink water from a 36-ounce drink bag, but neither will have any food to eat. This is also the first spacewalk NASA has done since January. During that outing, NASA astronaut Tim Kopra and Tim Peake of the European Space Agency replaced a failed voltage regulator that had cut off one of the station’s power channels. However, that spacewalk didn’t go exactly according to plan. The walk ended two hours early after Kopra noticed a small water bubble had formed inside his helmet. NASA was worried about the same issue happening for this spacewalk, but the agency thinks they know what went wrong. The problem may have had to do with blockage in the spacesuit’s sublimator, along with some operational procedures that may have produced too much condensation. NASA has taken steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again during Friday’s installation, according to Kenneth Todd, an ISS program representative. Originally, the first IDA installation was supposed to have taken place last summer. An adapter was set to arrive at the station in June of 2015, but it was destroyed when the Falcon 9 rocket that was carrying it disintegrated during launch. If that launch had been successful, the IDA that is now at the ISS would have been the second adapter and the station would have two functioning docking ports ready before the first Commercial Crew flights got underway. Now, NASA may only have one ready before those flights happen, which the space agency is prepared for. Another IDA is currently being built by Boeing and will likely go up on another SpaceX launch in early 2018, according to NASA.

Photo: NASA. WASHINGTON (BNS): NASA has selected six US companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions, according to a NASA news release. The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas; Boeing of Pasadena, Texas; Lockheed Martin of Denver; Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia; Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado; and NanoRacks of Webster, Texas. "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we're utilising the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors," Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems was quoted as saying in the release. "We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth," he added. The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that's still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. Habitation systems will provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars. In addition to US industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate.

Russia’s flagship air carrier Aeroflot is mulling over conceding its rights to purchase twenty-two Boeing 787 Dreamliners to another carrier, according to a company statement.

Previously, it was reported that Aeroflot had intended to postpone its order for the Dreamliner until 2017 at the earliest. Aeroflot CEO Vitaly Savelyev said that the postponement was due to the fact that civil aviation had been facing a stagnating market. In 2015, he stated that the company wanted to scrap buying the Dreamliner aircraft because Boeing failed to fulfill it on time, as the crisis had rendered the new aircraft unnecessary. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News November 23, 20:19 Diplomat says Moscow never discriminates Western media on its territory November 23, 20:19 November 23, 20:23 Rally in support to Russian military operation in Syria held outside embassy in London November 23, 20:23 November 23, 21:05 Foreign Ministry says Russia still keen to restore cooperation with EU November 23, 21:05 November 23, 19:32 German defense minister says no plans for creating EU army November 23, 19:32 In other media Реклама Photo 18 Russian Arctic, the history of exploration 6 Sales of iPhone 7 officially start in Russia 5 First international flight arrives from Minsk at Moscow's newest airport Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 MP: EU Parliament resolution on combating propaganda shows liberal Europe’s weakness 2 Rally in support to Russian military operation in Syria held outside embassy in London 3 Damascus against proposals to create autonomous areas in Syria — envoy 4 Defense minister says Russia-China military cooperation consolidates peace in Eurasia 5 Iran, Russia sign agreement on simpler rules of visa issuance for tour groups 6 New Su-30, Il-38 planes and other top picks of the Russian Navy this year 7 Diplomat says Moscow never discriminates Western media on its territory 1 Tsunami reaches Fukushima I NPP in Japan 2 Lavrov tells Johnson only dialog based on mutual respect can improve Moscow-London ties 3 Shanghai Cooperation Organization official says Russia can cope with any sanctions 4 Putin says European Parliament’s resolution on Russian media points to degrading democracy 5 Army commander assures Russia’s advanced Armata tank has no rivals worldwide 6 France’s ex-PM castigates West for turning Russia into ‘virtual enemy’ 7 NATO source says deploying missiles to Russian Kaliningrad not to reduce regional tensions 1 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 2 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 3 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 4 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 5 Russia declines to ratify International Criminal Court Statute 6 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio 7 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

(AVP) (the "Company", "Avcorp" or the "Avcorp Group") today announced its second quarter financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016 Avcorp Group revenues totaled $44,246,000 as compared to $20,369,000 revenue for the same quarter in the previous year.  The December 18, 2015 acquisition of the US based composite Aerostructures division of Hitco, a subsidiary of Frankfurt-listed SGL has added $22,595,000 to current quarter revenues. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Avcorp Group recorded a loss from operations of $12,781,000, which includes costs incurred and yet to be recovered under the Hitco acquisition agreement, on $44,246,000 revenue; as compared to a $1,125,000 operating loss on $20,369,000 revenue for the same quarter in the previous year; and net loss for the current quarter of $12,951,000 which include costs incurred yet to be recovered under the Hitco acquisition agreement as compared to net loss of $1,135,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  Pre-Hitco acquisition operational events although indemnified and on which Avcorp was required to assist, adversely impacted operations and caused excessive personnel costs, administrative and legal expenditures at ACF Avcorp's Gardena facility. These costs have yet to be recovered are included in all the costs for 2016. In addition to indemnified losses, a portion of the losses and one-time costs were anticipated.  These costs are part of the 2016 business improvement plan for ACF Gardena. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of changes in non-cash working capital, utilized $12,762,000 of cash as compared to utilizing $523,000 of cash during the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  Cash flows from operating activities were most significantly impacted as a result of operating losses incurred from the integration and productionization costs expended for the newly acquired Hitco operations, losses arising from unfavourable customer contracts assumed, and operational, administrative, and legal expenditures, incurred at Avcorp's Gardena facility as a direct result of pre-Hitco acquisition operational events. Avcorp's Burlington operations increased revenue in the second quarter 2016 relative to the second quarter 2015 by $1,521,000 (35.2%). Avcorp's Delta location continues to actively pursue production contracts on aerospace programs throughout North America, Asia, and Europe both in the commercial and defence aerospace sectors.  These efforts are driving increased value as evidenced by recent contract awards; in addition to 2015 awards for the expanded scope of production on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Carrier Variant Outboard Wing, as well as production and supply of 767-2C Panoramic Camera Fairings, as part of The Boeing Company's KC-46 Tanker program.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: August 17th, 2016 >> Story Satnews Daily August 17th, 2016 Arianespace's Sixth In 2016...An Epic Launch As VA232 Sends Off Doubles Ready, set, go... almost. The Ariane 5 has been integrated for the upcoming VA232 launch of the Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 satellites on Wednesday, August 24th from French Guiana. Designated Flight VA232, the mission will be Arianespace’s sixth launch in 2016, and the fourth using a heavy-lift Ariane 5 this year. Its two payloads will be the 57th and 58th satellites launched by Arianespace for Intelsat which continues a relationship that began in 1983 as the US-based operator developed a network to deliver high-quality, cost-effective video and broadband services worldwide. During preparation activity for Flight VA232 in the Spaceport’s Final Assembly Building, Intelsat 36 was installed atop the Ariane 5’s core stages on Friday, positioning the 3,250-kg.-class spacecraft as the mission’s lower passenger. Followed this weekend by the lowering of the launcher’s “composite” consisting of Intelsat 33e, together with Ariane 5’s SYLDA dual-payload deployment system and the protective payload fairing into position over Intelsat 36. Deployed first during the mission to geostationary transfer orbit, Intelsat 33e, which has an estimated liftoff mass of 6,600 kg. is the second satellite in Intelsat’s next-generation high-throughput Intelsat Epic NG series. It joins Intelsat 29e, launched by Arianespace aboard another Ariane 5 in January.   This artist's rendering shows Boeing's Intelsat 33e, the first of the four satellites in the new contract. Built by Boeing using a 702MP spacecraft platform and operating from an orbital slot of 60 deg. East, Intelsat 33e’s Ku- and C-band coverage will meet broadband demand for carrier-grade telecom services, enterprise networks, aeronautical connectivity and certain media services. The satellite’s Ku-band spot beams are to provide broadband services for Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, while a Ku-band wide beam provides broadcast coverage of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Its C-band spot beams will cover high traffic telecommunications centers in Europe, Central Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia; while a C-band wide beam is to deliver coverage over sub-Saharan Africa for data and media services. The Intelsat 36 satellite, built for Intelsat S.A., is designed to provide media and content distribution services in Africa and South Asia. Completing Arianespace’s Flight VA232 at 41 minutes after liftoff will be the separation of Intelsat 36, which is designed to enhance Intelsat’s media neighborhoods serving the South African and Indian Ocean region. Manufactured by SSL (Space Systems/Loral) on a 1300 platform, its Ku-band payload was built to support the MultiChoice direct-to-home service in South Africa. Intelsat 36’s C-band relay capacity provides in-orbit resilience for the company’s video content distribution neighborhood at the orbital slot of 68.5 degrees East – where the satellite will be co-located with Intelsat 20, which was launched by Arianespace in August 2012.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other By sea, land and space – Busy week for SpaceX hardware August 17, 2016 by Chris Bergin As the landed booster from the JCSAT-16 mission sailed into Port Canaveral on Wednesday, the next first stage – set to launch September’s Amos-6 mission – is expected to complete a road trip to Cape Canaveral over the coming days. Meanwhile, robotic assets on the ISS have removed the IDA-2 payload from the trunk of the CRS-9 Dragon on Thursday morning. By Sea: It has only been just over four months since the first booster to be recovered at sea sailed into Port Canaveral on the deck of the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS). That milestone came via the landing of the first stage involved with helping push the CRS-8 Dragon on a path towards the International Space Station. It was only the second time SpaceX had successfully landed a booster, following up on the LZ-1 landing of the OG-2 first stage. Since then, SpaceX has enjoyed more successes, both on land and at sea, with the JCSAT-16 mission showing further refinement to the company’s approach. With JCSAT-16 launched on the more challenging Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) mission – when compared to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) destinations – SpaceX has previously added a three engine landing burn, designed to counter the high velocity of the return. See Also LIVE: F9 JCSAT-16 Launch Updates SpaceX Missions Section L2 SpaceX Section Click here to Join L2 However, for this landing, SpaceX returned to a single engine landing burn, firing the center Merlin 1D engine for a longer duration, citing more control on the approach to the ASDS, but also – and importantly – reducing the stress on the stage during its landing. Utilizing lessons learned from the JCSAT-14 mission, where the landed stage suffered “max damage” from its landing, the single engine landing burn for the JCSAT-16 stage will provide vital data points into how that stage has fared after its return, not least when compared to the JCSAT-14 booster. Heading into Port Canaveral on Wednesday, the booster was offloaded within four hours of arrival, will be safed on the dockside and then transported to the 39A Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) for inspections. The aim will be to eventually prepare it for a future re-flight, which is the next major goal for SpaceX in its ongoing reusability aspirations. Notably, several static fire tests on the “max damage” JCSAT-14 stage at SpaceX’s test center in McGregor are playing a major part in pushing towards that historic milestone, with the potential for a re-flight mission of a returned booster to occur this year. By Land: Meanwhile, SpaceX’s primary missions continue to be lined up for their upcoming launch dates, with the next mission set for September 3 (Window 0300-0500 Eastern). That mission will involve the launch of the Amos-6 satellite, launching from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral. The Amos-6 satellite, built by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), will provide communication services including direct satellite home internet for Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. The booster for this mission was static fired at McGregor, as per the usual process of firing up all nine Merlin 1D engines to validate the health of the stage’s propulsive systems, prior to being removed from the test stand for transportation. Although SpaceX doesn’t publicize its transport schedules, it was expected to be sent on a road trip to the Cape this week. However, there has been a large amount of flooding along the route usually taken by stages in transit, which may delay its arrival at the Cape, although it will still be at the launch site in plenty of time ahead of the latest launch date target, with its static fire now showing on L2 schedules as September 1. By Space: In space, the CRS-9 Dragon is in the latter segment of her berthed mission at the ISS and is looking forward to handing over her trunk payload. See Also LIVE: CRS-9 Berthed Updates EVA-36 UPDATES L2 SpaceX Section Click here to Join L2 After her arrival at the orbital outpost, Expedition 48 crewmembers began to offload the 1,790 kg (3,946 lb) of cargo in the pressurized module. They have since started to reload the vehicle with downmass that will be returned to Earth when Dragon splashes down in the Pacific later this month. However, first up is the removal of the 467-kilogram (1,030 lb) International Docking Adapter 2 (IDA-2), located in the unpressurized trunk section of the spacecraft. The International Docking Adapters are devices designed to convert APAS-95 docking mechanisms – which were used by the Space Shuttle – to the new NASA Docking System (NDS) or Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) standard which is to be used by future US manned vehicles including the Dragon v2, Boeing CST-100 Starliner and Orion. IDA-2 will be affixed to the docking port of Pressurised Mating Adaptor 2 (PMA-2), at the aft end of the Harmony module. Preparations for Wednesday night’s task began with the Mobile Transporter (MT) relocating to Worksite 6. This transition allowed for the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to be in position to translate the Dextre robot towards Dragon’s trunk. Grappling operations began around 11pm UTC – with the adaptor clear of the trunk via ground robotic ops overnight. With the new adapter extracted, it is now being maneuvered to a point about three feet away from its installation point at PMA-2. On Friday, the final task of installation will take place, requiring the assistance of human hands. This will involve a 6.5 hour spacewalk (EVA-36) scheduled to begin Friday at 8:05 am EDT with astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins.

You clog it up, you can give Walmart a heart attack.” Photo: People's World (CC BY-NC 2.0) Where’s our economy headed? This is part two of our interview with Kim Moody, co-founder of this magazine and the author of many books on U.S. labor. Despite the hype about the “gig economy,” Moody argued in Part 1 that the bigger change most workers are experiencing is the rise of the crappy-job economy. On the bright side, he pointed out how just-in-time production has created huge concentrations of workers—and vast potential for organizing. In Part 2, we ask Moody about corporate mergers, the changing demographics of the U.S. workforce, and what it will take to organize the South: Labor Notes: Increased competition between corporations has led to massive mergers. What has been the impact on workers? Kim Moody: It’s in the mid-’90s that this new mergers and acquisitions wave took hold. It was fundamentally different from the big mergers and acquisitions waves of the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s. Those mostly were about conglomeration—companies buying up all different kinds of production, finance, and everything you can get your hands on. Diversification would be another word for it. The mergers of the mid-’90s forward have gone in the opposite direction. More companies are shedding unrelated divisions. For example, General Electric and General Motors used to have huge financial divisions and they dumped those, even though they were moneymakers. All these major industries have seen mergers that are creating bigger employers. In some industries the concentrations are huge. If you look at trucking, UPS is this massive employer that it wasn’t 20 years ago. UPS is in every field of logistics—not just in delivery or even in trucking, but also in air freight. So companies are buying up things that are in their basic core competencies. The structure of ownership has been realigned in a way similar to the first half of the 20th century, when unions, including the CIO, organized these big corporations. This concentration of ownership along industrial lines means that there are more economically rational structures now in which unions can organize. So you would no longer see a situation where the union strikes one division but the company has plenty of unrelated divisions that are still making profits. Right. And when you put that together with the logistics revolution, you begin to get a picture of what I’m calling “the new terrain of class conflict.” We are dealing with production systems, of both goods and services, that are far more tightly integrated than they used to be, and companies that are bigger, more capital-intensive, and more economically rational. So unions should be able to take advantage of the vulnerable points in just-in-time logistics and production to bring some of these new giants to heel. The old idea of industrial unionism might have a new lease on life if—and it is a big if—the unions can take advantage of this situation. My view is that this is going to have to come from the grassroots of the labor movement. Or those who today are not organized, like the people in warehouses. There is a potential that really hasn’t existed in well over half a century. The consolidation of industry and the whole logistics revolution: these things have only come together in the last 10 or 15 years. When workers and unions in these industries—and many of these industries have unions in pieces of them—look at this situation, it’s something they’re not used to yet. It usually takes a generation for the workforce to realize the power that it has, and the points of vulnerability. This was the case when mass production developed in the early 20th century. It took pretty close to a generation before the upheaval of the ‘30s. New Book Secrets of a successful organizer A step-by-step guide to building power on the job. Buy Now. » Another important change has been in the demographics of the working class. Can you talk about what those changes mean? This bears not only on unions but on American politics. An obvious change that has taken place in pretty much the same period—the ’80s up until now—and will continue on is the change in the racial and ethnic composition of the entire population, but particularly concentrated in the working class. For example, if you look at what the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls the “transportation and material moving” occupations in the ’80s, maybe 15 percent of those workers were either African American, Latino, or perhaps Asian. Today it is 40 percent. Workers of color now compose a much bigger proportion of the workforce, much of it due to immigration. The biggest growth, of course, is among Latino workers. Workers of color are now between 30 and 40 percent of union membership. It seems the right is making its own hay out of the changing demographics of the country. This is happening everywhere in the West. It is much easier to blame immigrants for the lack of jobs or housing or crowded schools than it is to figure out how to deal with the powers that be. So a lot of people turn towards these self-defeating ideas that they can solve their problems by closing off borders and sending people back, or by keeping Muslims out. We have the potential to have a phenomenally different kind of labor movement. It is going to be different from anything we have ever seen in the United States, or pretty much anywhere else, for that matter. That is, if we have a multicultural, multiracial labor movement that is larger and is growing and is taking advantage of the new terrain that we just talked about. A common tactic used by business is whipsawing workers against one another, using non-union areas of the country against union-dense areas. I am thinking of Boeing and South Carolina. Boeing got from Washington State the largest subsidy ever given to a company in the United States. And yet they still sent all those jobs to South Carolina, which also provided them with massive subsidies. How much of a hindrance has the inability to organize the South been for labor? The answer is massive. This goes all the way back to the end of the Second World War, and the amount of manufacturing value-added that was produced in the South just grew until the ’80s. The amount produced in the South continues to grow a little, but it has more or less leveled off. I have some ideas why. If you look at the auto parts industry, for example, in the last 10 or 15 years it has dramatically reorganized, one of the most dramatic reorganizations of any industry that I have seen. You have many fewer companies, and those that remain have gotten bigger. The bulk of them are in the Midwest and not in the South. A huge percentage of them are actually in Michigan. Of course, they are nonunion. So I am not saying that the South is not important. You won’t crack manufacturing until the South is unionized. These big corporations do whipsaw. But given the new structure of these industries and the logistics revolution, there is a possibility of counter-whipsawing. Say you have a union drive at a South Carolina plant and you want to cut off production there, to force management to recognize the union. My guess is that you can find suppliers, if they are unionized or can be unionized, whether they are in the South or Midwest, that can strike and close down that plant. Given the rise of these tight new logistics systems, unions can counter-whipsaw by closing down suppliers or even the transport links, and thereby starve management at these Southern plants into submission. That would require the cooperation of many different unions—but they have to begin thinking about that if they are ever going to organize the South.

NASA will live stream the event starting at 6.30am ET. The IDA forms to be an important element of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative in which private companies will come up with space taxis for NASA. The space taxis will be used to take agency’s astronauts to and from the ISS. The docking adapter has reached at the ISS on July 20. The adapter was transported in SpaceX’s Dragon trunk rather than in Dragon capsule. In fact, the IDA is present in the trunk since it has reached at the ISS. On August 17, the ISS’s robotic arm will removed the IDA from the trunk and place it around three feet away from the port and will there until the spacewalk. On Friday, the astronauts will start early to install the IDA. At around 8.05 am ET, Rubins and Williams will leave the ISS and carry out the process of attaching the IDA to its port. Already, preperations have been done to help the installation run smoothly. In earlier spacewalks, astronauts will position all the necessary cables that Rubins and Williams will attach to the docking adapter to give it power and connectivity. Takuya Onishi of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency will be helping both the astronauts. Onishi will be present in the ISS at the time of the spacewalk. He would be managing control panel inside the station that will help connect the IDA to its port. “There’s a very coordinated interplay between the external crew outside, Tak on the outside, and the ground doing the commanding”, affirmed Zeb Scoville, the spacewalk flight director.

The ministry says its jets took off earlier in the day on Wednesday from a base southwest of the Iranian capital, Tehran, to strike targets in the east of Syria. It says they destroyed two command posts and two training camps. Iran on Tuesday allowed Russian warplanes to take off from its territory to bomb targets in Syria, for the first time since Russia launched its operation in the war-torn Arab nation last year.” Story Continued Below — THE FLIGHTS FROM IRAN SIGNAL GROWING RUSSIAN INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST: Russia’s bombing runs from an Iranian air base are a first for Moscow — and signal growing cooperation between Iran and Russia. Tuesday was the first time a foreign military operated from Iranian soil since at least World War II, according to The New York Times, which has more on the arrangement here: “The arrangement, permanent or not, enables Russia to bring more firepower to the Syrian conflict, and far greater military flexibility. Analysts said the new arrangement could also expand Moscow’s political influence in the Middle East and speed the growing convergence of interests between Moscow and Tehran. From the air base, in Hamadan, northwest Iran, the Russian bombers destroyed ammunition dumps and a variety of targets linked to the Islamic State and other groups that had been used to support militants battling in Aleppo, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. “Historians and American officials said on Tuesday that the Iranian decision to let Russia base its planes and support operations in Iran — even temporarily — was a historic one. ‘This didn’t even happen under the shah,’ said John Limbert, a former American foreign service officer stationed in Iran, referring to the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from 1941 to 1979.” — MOVE SENDS A MESSAGE TO U.S., writes the AP: “Russia's use of an Iranian air base to bomb targets in Syria sends a message to Washington as it weighs a military partnership with Moscow: Join us or we'll look to your enemies. Tuesday's missions were unprecedented. Iran allowed Russian warplanes to take off from its territory to strike opposition targets in Syria. The move came with little notice to the United States, which has watched helplessly the escalating bloodshed near Aleppo, the country's biggest city, and even offered an alliance with Russia against Islamic State and other extremist fighters as a way to get Syria's government out of the fight.” — WHAT’S PUTIN UP TO IN UKRAINE? Reuters examines Moscow’s latest moves on that front: “Ukraine says it thinks Vladimir Putin is planning a new invasion, and it's not hard to see why: the Russian leader has built up troops on its border and resumed the hostile rhetoric that preceded his annexation of Crimea two years ago. But despite appearances, some experts say Putin is more likely seeking advantage through diplomacy than on the battlefield, at least this time around. “‘It's about sanctions,’ Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Moscow-based foreign policy think tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Reuters. ‘It looks like a way of increasing pressure on Western participants of the Minsk peace process,’ he said of a peace deal set up for eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have battled against government forces.” HAPPY WEDNESDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

HAPPENING TODAY — TRUMP TO BEGIN RECEIVING INTEL BRIEFINGS, via ABC News: “Certain staffers in the FBI's New York Field Office have been told to expect a special guest tomorrow: Donald Trump. He is scheduled to receive his first classified briefing as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, according to sources notified of the upcoming visit. Trump is planning to take with him New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who has become an outspoken supporter of Trump, a senior campaign official said. “Career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the nation's top intelligence office, will be leading the briefing, which is expected to cover major threats and emerging concerns around the world.” — Trump gets praise from a Republican critic: South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has been one of Trump’s harshest Republican critics, but he offered praise for his terrorism speech on Monday. "The one thing I thought Donald Trump did very well was give a damning indictment, like a prosecutor of Obama’s failed foreign policy," Graham said in a "Kilmeade & Friends" radio interview. "And it is true, whether people want to believe it or not — I believe it — that without Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq and failure to intervene in Syria in a timely way, that there would be no ISIL." — A campaign shakeup: Trump has tapped pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and Breitbart News Chairman Stephen Bannon as campaign chief executive, our colleagues Matthew Nussbaum and Ken Vogel report. INDUSTRY INTEL — TOP DEFENSE LOBBYISTS PLAN MEETING WITH CLINTON CAMPAIGN, reports our colleague Ellen Mitchell: “The Aerospace Industries Association plans to confer with advisers to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to discuss key defense industry issues, its chief executive said Tuesday. AIA CEO and President David Melcher told POLITICO the association would meet with ‘advisers to the Clinton campaign … sometime soon,’ but offered few other details. Melcher did say the session would be similar to that the leading defense trade association had in June in New York with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. “‘We talked about sequestration and the impact it’s having on the industry. We talked about trade and the need to do a better job for foreign military sales. And we talked about over-regulation that could be and should be reduced, which was a topic that was repeated by many industries,’ Melcher said of the two-hour meeting that reportedly included representatives of Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, among other defense contractors.” WAR REPORT — CONVOY OF ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS ALLOWED TO LEAVE MANBIJ, via the AP: “A couple hundred vehicles of Islamic State fighters were allowed to leave the northern Syrian city of Manbij as U.S.-backed forces seized the town in recent days because the militants had civilians with them, according to a U.S. military official. The official said Tuesday that some of the IS fighters may have already made their way into Turkey, but many are still in Syria. “Col. Chris Garver, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting IS, told Pentagon reporters that the decision to let the convoy leave the city was made by commanders of the Syrian Democratic Forces. He said there were civilians in each of the vehicles, and the military wanted to avoid casualties. He added that he doesn't know how many of the civilians may have been in the cars voluntarily, but some were likely hostages.” — WHY MANBIJ COULD BE A MODEL FOR BATTLING ISIL: The Washington Post reports the Pentagon wants the recent U.S.-backed campaign to be a model for future operations in Syria: “U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the campaign publicly, said the Manbij offensive illustrated the value of the small force of U.S. Special Operations troops now on the ground in Syria, as they directed U.S. air strikes and advised Syrian forces during an intense urban fight. “‘Our operating concept has been validated,’ said a senior defense official. ‘Utilizing local forces and our own Special Operations forces, partnered with overwhelming coalition air power, and enough time — the Islamic State really doesn’t have an answer to it.’” TOP DOC — U.S. TROOP AND CONTRACTOR NUMBERS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN: A new report from the Congressional Research Service tracks the levels of U.S. military forces and contractor personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade. The non-partisan research agency breaks down the levels of military personnel as well as Defense Department contractors on a quarterly basis beginning with the final quarter of 2007. The CRS also tracks the number of private security contractors in both countries. The report counts up to 4,087 U.S. troops in Iraq as of July — reflecting a cap that was increased to 4,647 that month — as well as 2,485 Pentagon contractors in Iraq. There were also 8,730 U.S. troops and 28,626 Pentagon contractors in Afghanistan as of March, according to the report. NSA WEBSITE GOES DOWN AMID POSSIBLE CYBER THEFT, reports our colleague Eric Geller: “The National Security Agency’s website was offline for almost a full day until Tuesday evening, in an unexplained outage that began shortly after hackers claimed to have stolen a collection of the agency's prized cyber weapons. It's unknown if the two events are connected. “POLITICO first noticed that the agency’s website wasn’t working at 10:54 p.m. Monday. It came back online around 5 p.m. Tuesday. The outage began a few hours after a mysterious group called the Shadow Brokers claimed to have stolen cyber weapons from the Equation Group, a sophisticated hacking group suspected of being linked to the NSA.” MAKING MOVES — SALAZAR TO LEAD CLINTON TRANSITION TEAM: Former Interior Secretary and Colorado Sen.

News provided by STASH INVEST Aug 17, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Aug. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Stash, one of the fastest-growing new financial services for Millennials, announced today that it has secured $9.25 million in Series A funding to further accelerate user growth and to build out its technology platform. The round was led by Goodwater Capital, which specializes in early-stage consumer technology companies, and Valar Ventures. Entrée Capital also participated in the round. Most Millennials find investing confusing, unrelatable, and intimidating. They simply don't trust Wall Street.  Stash is the solution for the millions of Americans traditionally ignored or taken advantage of by big investing firms. Stash is a community for people who want to start investing and who don't want to rely on a black box service to do it for them. It's a platform to help people take ownership and become confident investors. Brandon Krieg, CEO says, "My co-founder Ed and I left our jobs because we believe everyone should have access to financial opportunity. After a combined 30+ years in the business, we know that Wall Street can be fundamentally unfair to smaller investors and makes it hard for the individual investor to accomplish their goals. We want to create real change - the kind that transforms the financial literacy gap and narrows the vast division of wealth that plagues our country." Stash investors are the real heroes in this story. Soldiers, nurses, Uber drivers, construction workers, and IT professionals alike are taking positive steps for their financial futures. Stash empowers people to declare "I'm an investor", transforming what has typically been stressful and intimidating into something that feels intuitive and simple. Stash investors want to do well and do good. They invest in a way that reflects who they are, building a portfolio of investments that aligns with their interests, beliefs and goals. Stash investors choose from a curated selection of ETFs. They purchase fractional shares, set up Auto-Stash to make recurring investments, and can start doing it all with as little as $5. Investment choices are simple, descriptive, and relatable. For example, users can invest in "Internet Titans" (online technology giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook), "Young Money" (companies that stand to benefit from the increasing purchasing power of the Millennial generation such as LinkedIn, Amazon and Ebay), "Defending America" (aerospace and defense companies such as United Technologies, Boeing, Lockheed Martin), etc. There are no hidden fees, and Stash doesn't charge commissions for buying or selling investments or for transferring money in and out of accounts. There is a transparent subscription fee of $1 per month for accounts under $5000 and 0.25% a year for balances over $5,000. The first three months are free for everyone. Stash entered the investment advisory market late last year to equip people with the knowledge they need to start investing. Since launching on October 14, 2015, Stash has amassed over 150,000 investor accounts and almost 500,000 content subscribers. Stash is igniting a movement of next-generation investors. With the additional funding, they will reach millions of new investors, empowering them to start investing and take control of their financial future. About Stash Stash is on a mission to empower a new generation of investors, giving everyone access to financial opportunity. People can choose where to invest their money, starting with as little as $5, and receive ongoing guidance from the Stash Advisor.

Budget Aviation Holdings also aims to raise the proportion of connected flights between its short-haul Tiger Airways and medium-to-long-haul Scoot brands from a single-digit percentage, its chief executive, Lee Lik Hsin, told Reuters today. “We do expect this (connectivity) to grow, and when I say grow I actually mean multiple fold,” Lee said. “The ingredients for being able to operate to Europe, we think we now have them — aircraft and connectivity.” Budget Aviation was created this year after parent Singapore Airlines took Tiger private and paired it with Scoot. Scoot announced its first Europe-bound flight yesterday. Regular flights between Singapore and Athens begin next year, bringing Scoot into competition with full-service Gulf carriers which have been increasing market share on Asia-Europe routes. Lee said he aimed to add more European routes, but did not elaborate on destinations or time frame. Airlines have been benefiting from a drop in oil prices as well as a travel boom in South-east Asia which has spurred many regional carriers to order several hundred aircraft from Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. “There is room for growth,” Lee said. “The overall travel market will continue to grow and the overall budget travel market will continue to grow.” Budget Aviation has nine Boeing 787 planes on order for Scoot, and 39 new-generation Airbus A320s for Tiger. Lee said his firm would for now continue to use only those two types of aircraft. Scoot and Tiger operate under separate licences but share an organisational structure for some functions and cost-saving via economies of scale. Bringing the two under the same brand or licence would involve regulatory, commercial and other considerations, of which an internal review would be necessary before making any commitment to change, Lee said. “Of course, we will not exclude any possibilities,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Mavcom: 69pc of air travellers in Malaysia unaware of rights Now, faster border checks for regular Malaysian visitors to the UK Actress Gwyneth Paltrow launches new travel app Obama writes travel essay for 'Lonely Planet' Embark on a 'Gilmore Girls' getaway in the real-life Stars Hollow Malindo Air drops new air fare promo starting from RM69 Check out National Geographic Traveler’s must-go destinations in 2017 Pokemon installations, activities launched at Changi Airport Langkawi International Airport to get expanded capacity Now, faster border checks for regular Malaysian visitors to the UK Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Despite AirAsia, Lion Air, top investor sees gap for ‘truly low-cost’ airlines in Asia Budget airlines set to soar in South-east Asia’s open skies World’s ‘biggest’ budget airline alliance takes off in Asia-Pacific Singapore Airlines turns to new jet to lure premium-paying flyers Norwegian to fly New York to Paris nonstop with fares from US$175 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(Credit: NASA) ARM will see NASA use a robotic spacecraft to capture a multi-ton boulder from the surface of a large near-Earth asteroid, then place it into orbit around the Moon. Before beginning its trip to lunar orbit, the ARM spacecraft will attempt an asteroid deflection technique called a gravity tractor, where the spacecraft plus the mass of the captured boulder will create a small gravitational attraction to alter the orbit of the large asteroid. Once the smaller boulder has the been placed into lunar orbit, crewed spacecraft will be deployed to study it, with the first such mission scheduled for 2026. The robotic mission is currently due to launch in December 2021, having recently passed the important landmark known as Key Decision Point-B, or KDP-B. “This is an exciting milestone for the Asteroid Redirect Mission,” said NASA associate administrator Robert Lightfoot. “Not only is ARM leveraging agency-wide capabilities, it will test a number of new technologies already in development.” Gravity Tractor (Credit: NASA) Phase B of the robotic mission will develop a baseline design that aligns with NASA’s parameters on risk, cost and schedule. The agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) will issue a request for proposals for the robotic spacecraft, with Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK among the companies already involved in preliminary studies. “Since its early formulation, NASA has invited mission concept feedback and development ideas from the planetary science community, general public, US and global industry, and international partners,” said Michele Gates, NASA’s programme director for ARM. “With KDP-B under our belt, ARM can now move forward to define partnerships and opportunities for long-term engagement.” In April, NASA awarded a $67m contract to Aerojet Rocketdyne for the development of a new electric propulsion system, which is expected to form a key part of the robotic mission. The Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) could potentially increase spaceflight fuel efficiency by a factor of 10 compared to current rocket technology, as well as providing double the thrust capability of current electrical systems. If the technology proves successful, it could also play a crucial role in NASA’s journey to Mars, which aims to put humans on the Red Planet by the 2030s.

Smith Posted: 16-Aug-2016 Updated: 16-Aug-2016 07:24 PM Michele Gates, NASA’s Program Director for the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), said today that the cost for the robotic portion of the mission has grown from $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to a one-year delay announced earlier this year.  The cost growth was announced yesterday, a month after the program passed a milestone called Key Decision Point-B (KDP-B). ARM was initiated by the Obama Administration as the next step in NASA’s human spaceflight program, a steppingstone to eventually sending humans to Mars.  ARM is composed of two elements:  the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) to send a robotic spacecraft to an asteroid to pluck a boulder from its surface and move it to lunar orbit; and the Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) to send astronauts to visit the boulder, collect samples and return them to Earth. The KDP-B review was of the ARRM portion and was completed on July 15.  NASA announced the top-level results yesterday.  Gates spoke with SpacePolicyOnline.com about the program today. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden has insisted that ARRM would cost no more than $1.25 billion, an issue of concern to NASA Advisory Council (NAC) members worried that money spent on ARM might reduce funds available for other aspects of NASA’s “Journey to Mars” or other NASA priorities. Bill Gerstenmaier, head of NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), told NAC in July that the KDP-B review had revealed cost growth and the agency was deciding whether to descope the mission to stay within the cap or accept the cost growth. Gates said today that no descope options were exercised.  Instead, the decision was to proceed with ARRM and “move” the cost cap to $1.4 billion.  She said one cost estimate by the JPL-led project and two independent probabilistic assessments by its Standing Review Board (chaired by Janet Petro, Deputy Director of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center) and a separate team factored into the decision.  She also explained that at this stage of a program, there is less emphasis on precision than will be expected at the next milestone, KDP-C, while adding that the $1.4 billion has a 70 percent confidence level. The decision to delay the mission by one year was made in February.  Gerstenmaier said in July it was because of difficulty in finding money within NASA to fund the project. Launch of ARRM was originally expected in 2020, with ARCM in 2025 to meet President Obama’s directive that NASA send astronauts to an asteroid by that date.  ARRM now will be launched in December 2021 in order to meet up with asteroid 2008 EV5, with ARCM taking place in 2026.  A final decision on what asteroid will be the target for ARRM will not be made until a year before launch, but EV5 is being used as a reference point and remains accessible if the mission is launched in December 2021 instead of 2020, Gates said. NASA’s cost estimate for ARRM excludes launch and operations.   In a March 2016 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of NASA’s major programs showed a cost of $1.72 billion.  Gates explained that the $1.72 billion includes the launch vehicle cost, set at approximately $500 million as a placeholder since NASA has not determined which of three launch vehicles will be used (Delta IV Heavy, Falcon Heavy, or the Space Launch System). ARRM is managed by JPL, which awarded study contracts to four companies for concepts for the spacecraft earlier this year.  Those contracts are completed and a Request for Proposals (RFP) has not yet been issued for the spacecraft itself.   Gates therefore demurred on questions about how much of the $1.4 billion is for the spacecraft, whether it will be a fixed price or cost-plus contract, and when the RFP will be released. The four companies that won the concept contracts and are eligible to respond to the RFP when it is issued are Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Orbital ATK, and SSL (formerly Space Systems Loral, now a subsidiary of Canada’s MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates -- MDA). ARRM requires a spacecraft that uses high power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) and accommodates a capture mechanism to grab the boulder.  NASA is developing both of those technologies. Meanwhile, NASA will release a Broad Agency Announcement in September for partner-provided payloads that could be carried on ARRM and for membership in a multidisciplinary industry-academia-government-international investigation team to provide technical expertise to ARRM and ARCM. It can be difficult to follow this acronym-rich project.  ARRM and ARCM are the two components of ARM, which in turn is part of NASA’s “Asteroid Initiative.”  The $1.4 billion estimate is only for ARRM and, as noted, excludes launch and operations.   None of those should be confused with the robotic OSIRIS-REx mission scheduled for launch on September 8, 2016.  That is a science mission that will use only a robotic spacecraft to return a sample of the asteroid Bennu to Earth.  It is unrelated to ARRM/ARCM/ARM/Asteroid Initiative (all of which are associated with NASA's human spaceflight program). Gerstenmaier characterized ARM as an “excellent” way to demonstrate the skills needed for NASA’s Journey to Mars at a recent Senate hearing.  In today’s interview, Gates called it “important and enabling.” The next administration will have to decide if the costs are worth the benefits.  Although NASA has decided they are, the House Appropriations Committee disagrees.  It denied funding for the program in its report on the FY2017 Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) appropriations bill, which funds NASA.   The bill has not passed the House yet, however, and there is no similar language in the Senate version, so NASA is not currently prohibited from spending money on the project. For NASA, the next milestone decision is KDP-C where the agency formally commits to a cost and schedule for a program.  Gates said that is currently scheduled for March 2018.

Robert "Bud" Duthie says he has the solution. Duthie has created a system using UVA and UVB rays that can purify water by removing organics and inorganics. Duthie said his technology can cleanse up to 50 gallons of water per minute. By Mike Ferguson The Ledger LAKE WALES — The state of Florida has a problem with toxic algae. Robert "Bud" Duthie says he has the solution. Duthie has created a system using UVA and UVB rays that can purify water by removing organics and inorganics. Duthie said his technology can cleanse up to 50 gallons of water per minute. “The researchers have found nothing in comparison,” Duthie, 70, said. “Florida has one of the biggest opportunities for it. In microseconds, we could kill blue-green algae. I've done (polychlorinated biphenyl) and phenol. Blue-green algae are nothing compared to those.” Toxic forms of blue-green algae found in the state's waterways have closed beaches on the Treasure Coast and infected large bodies of water in the Everglades as well as Lake Okeechobee, the nation's second largest lake. There have been reports of fish dying and people getting sick as a result of the toxic algae. “With the population growing the way it is, we have a real issue with water quality,” said Jim Vaughan, president of Lake Wales-based Texas Aquatic Harvesting, which works to clean up lakes. “Our lakes are filling up with mud and muck because they don't flush like they used to.” Duthie's patented product called the HellCat, which he produces through his company Synergena International in Orlando, can be scaled larger to run continuously through major lakes using a tractor trailer as the docking station. At least, so he thinks. Right now, Duthie has a travel device called the H-cat that could be used by missionaries, campers or local government emergency service organizations. The Micro HellCat is a middle-sized system. “It's as simple as this,” Duthie said. “I can make bigger tubes and we can run it through the lakes.” Duthie gave a demonstration recently at American Legion Post 71 All Veterans Center in Lake Wales, which Vaughan saw. He applauds Duthie's efforts. “We've got to come up with something to clean this water,” he said. “I would love for this to work. There's a possibility it could work if they develop more volume. Right now, it appears to be too small of a scale.” Duthie, a Buffalo native who now lives in Ocala and an engineer by trade, has master's degrees in education, mathematics and computer science. Duthie first started experimenting with light waves as a purification tool in 1984 while working with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. There he developed technology that could sterilize surgical steel in 10 seconds, rather than the previous 20 minutes, and could be used in the operating room. In the latter part of the 1990s, Duthie used nano-photonic technology to remove pulp from fruit juice. In 2001, his technology was used to combat Anthrax. Duthie was hired by Boeing in 2004 to construct water purification systems. “We blew the doors off anyone doing anything with water,” Duthie said. “The microbiologists at the University of Buffalo were literally blown away.” “He's had several demonstrations that really seem to clean up the water,” said Scott Wallen, a research chemist and technician at Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland. “We need to start taking specific species of algae, so we can quantify it. This definitely kills the organisms.” Duthie said he was set to receive a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Navy for the H-Cat, but once the military branch saw the technology, it was shrugged off as conventional ultraviolet technology. “He's using a variety of wave lengths, not just the standard UVC,” Wallen said. “That's the most important thing about this.” According to a test run at the State University of New York at Buffalo, Duthie's technology was able to kill every bit of E. Coli from a half inch sample of water in seven seconds. In that same time frame, conventional ultraviolet rays killed less than 5 percent. Duthie said he had been working with Florida Poly to obtain a $50,000 grant from the Hinkley Center in Tallahassee, but was turned down because the university is not yet accredited. The end game for Duthie is producing large scale units to be used for purifying waterways internationally. Duthie said he sees Polk County as a perfect area to do the manufacturing because it has, and is in close proximity to, so many lakes. He said his company could employ between 250 and 500 people locally and as many as 5,000 internationally. “I don't need highly skilled labor because we'd have a lot of assembly jobs,” Duthie said. “We have the capabilities of going into other industries and we could grow this.” For this to happen, Duthie said, he needs a contract. He sees the federal government as the perfect partner since his technology could service the water bodies internationally. Duthie said he's been in contact with the state, but thinks finger-pointing and party politics are circumventing any real progress. “I think it's a great way to make an immediate impact on small ponds and things of that nature,” Wallen said. “If anyone says they have the solution, I'm always very cautious, but I'm very optimistic about this. It could be a useful tool and I'm hoping there are people out there interested in pursuing it.” — Mike Ferguson can be reached at Mike.Ferguson@theledger.com or863-401-6981.

Related News/Archive Mold closes beds at Young VA center, may be a problem at Haley, too 2 Months Ago Group that helped sell Iran nuclear deal also gave to NPR (w/video) 6 Months Ago With development looming, little left of Pinellas' citrus industry 7 Months Ago If the County Commission approves the estimated $10 million deal next month, the Industrial Realty Group will take over the Young-Rainey Science, Technology and Research, or STAR, Center, a 96-acre manufacturing and technology campus the county owns on Bryan Dairy Road. The Los Angeles firm manages more than 120 properties in 28 states, with more than 100 million square feet of rentable space. Led by president and chairman Stuart Lichter, the firm specializes in turning shuttered military bases and industrial complexes into centers that attract jobs from national corporations. Three of IRG's projects under way in Ohio are estimated to be worth $1 billion. "We think it will expose this area to many more companies," said Pinellas County economic development director Mike Meidel, "It's a phenomenal company." IRG already owns a 460,000-square-foot industrial complex in Tampa, east of Ybor City. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the firm's plans in the Tampa Bay area until the Pinellas deal closes. The complex currently features eight buildings totaling nearly 662,000 square feet and about 7 acres of developable land. IRG would have to honor the current leases of the 30 tenants, including Raytheon, which develops and produces communication devices. Raytheon accounts for more than half of the jobs on the site and has leasing options for up to 18 years. As the county finalizes the agreement, Meidel declined to say whether the price tag of the $10.1 million deal could increase. Last year an appraisal said the property was worth nearly $19.1 million. The campus brings in $8 million to $9 million in annual revenue from leases. But it also costs the county about $8 million to operate and maintain. Pinellas' general revenue funds are not used to maintain the property. The county declared the property surplus in October 2014 and started a nationwide search for buyers in June 2015. There were two proposals, Meidel said, and IRG's stood out. The company sees the complex as a hub for research and development with a corporate headquarters. The property could support a $30 million capital investment for new buildings over five years, according to IRG's proposal, along with office space, labs and production and warehouse space. The proposal doesn't specify how many jobs any redevelopment would add. The "excellent location makes it a prime candidate attracting cutting-edge industry innovators," the proposal said. "We also envision a business incubator on-site to cater to small or startup entrepreneurial companies in their endeavor to jump-start their technology." While the proposal didn't provide specifics, it said Pinellas County should gain additional tax revenues from construction activity and personal property and business taxes. IRG is certainly familiar with Pinellas County. In 2008, county leaders picked IRG and an Ohio company to turn 240 acres at the Toytown landfill site into an expanse of shops, homes and recreation space. The Great Recession killed the $870 million venture. In the following years, Meidel said, the county continued to alert IRG about other Pinellas opportunities. One of the firm's biggest projects includes the former McClellan Air Force Base in California, now called McClellan Park. After buying the property from Sacramento County in 2000, the firm turned the base into a multiuse business park with about 8.5 million square feet of buildings. The firm has now leased more than 5 million square feet of commercial, industrial, and aviation space there. Tenants include Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and the Department of Agriculture. IRG said the project has created more than 8,000 jobs. In Ohio, the firm developed Goodyear's world headquarters in Akron. A few miles south in Canton, IRG redeveloped the 88-acre site of the old headquarters of the Hoover Vacuum Co. In addition, the company is in the middle of a $500 million project at the Pro Football Hall of Fame campus, called Hall of Fame Village. IRG listed the Sacramento and Akron projects as references in its proposal for redeveloping the Young-Rainey STAR Center. The sale of the Young-Rainey STAR Center would open a new chapter in the long history of the property. In 1956, General Electric built the original 161,000-square-foot building on what was once known as Bryan's Dairy Farm. GE sold the facility to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission the following year but continued to operate what became known as the Pinellas Plant, engineering, developing and manufacturing components for the nation's nuclear weapons program. In 2001, officials rededicated the campus to honor two Pinellas residents who had a hand in the center's creation: U.S. Rep C.W. Bill Young and former County Commission Chairman Charles "Chuck" Rainey. Contact Mark Puente at mpuente@tampabay.com or (727) 892-2996.

"Toray is one of a number of suppliers we work with to meet our carbon fiber needs for Falcon rocket and Dragon spacecraft production, and we haven’t announced any new agreements at this time," a company spokesman told Ars. "As our business continues to grow, the amount of carbon fiber we use may continue to grow." Original story: SpaceX appears to be betting big on carbon fiber composites, which could increase the capacity of its future rockets to get people and supplies into space—and eventually to the surface of Mars. According to a report in Nikkei Asian Review, SpaceX has signed an agreement with Toray Carbon Fibers estimated to be worth $2 billion to $3 billion. The total price and delivery dates have yet to be finalized. It is not immediately clear exactly when, and in which launch vehicles, these lightweight composites will be employed by SpaceX. But the company is not alone in its interest—NASA and other aerospace companies have been experimenting with the materials because of their potential to increase the amount of payload that can be carried by a rocket. They could also lower overall manufacturing cost. The scale of the deal seems telling, however. If the value of the deal as reported is correct, in the billions of dollars, it seems probable that the carbon fiber composites would be used in SpaceX's proposed Mars Colonial Transporter rocket. This is the very large (but still under development) rocket the company plans to use to transport humans to Mars. SpaceX is already far along in the production of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which is based on the Falcon 9 core stage. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, which SpaceX has successfully been landing this year, has tank walls and domes built from an aluminum lithium alloy. Carbon fibers, which are generally woven into a fabric, possess desirable qualities such as high tensile strength, low mass, high temperature tolerance, and low thermal expansion. This has made them very popular with aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus. Toray, headquartered in Japan, is a leading provider of carbon fibers to airplane manufacturers. In a bit of irony, Toray is likely to produce carbon fibers for SpaceX at its Decatur, Alabama-based factory, which is located in the same city where SpaceX competitor United Launch Alliance manufactures its rockets. The carbon fiber deal may represent another sign, along with the company's recent movement of the Raptor engine to a Texas test facility, that SpaceX is making substantial progress toward developing and launching rockets to Mars, including potential human missions sometime in the 2020s. Investing $2 billion or more on carbon fibers suggests the scale of SpaceX's Mars ambitions are grand indeed. Expand full story Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.

Typically, three Russian cosmonauts live on board the ISS at any given time, but Roscosmos, the country’s state-run space corporation, is thinking about reducing its ISS crew complement to just two cosmonauts. "They’re exploring the option of going down to two crew on the Russian segment." The news was first reported in the Russian newspaper Izvestia, which said the move was a way for Roscosmos to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Sergei Krikalev, director of human spaceflight at Roscosmos, said that a letter about the possible change had been sent to the participants of the ISS program. And yesterday during a press briefing, NASA confirmed that it had been informed of Russia’s potential plans. "They’re exploring the option of going down to two crew on the Russian segment," said Kenneth Todd, an ISS program representative. "They’ve made that known to the partnership." The standard crew size for the ISS has stayed at six for the past few years. NASA maintains a three-person crew, which often includes an astronaut from one of the agency’s international partners. And Russia has managed its own crew of three cosmonauts on the ISS since 2010, according to the Planetary Society. Russia has also provided the main source of transportation to the ISS since the Shuttle program ended in 2011, which has turned out to be a good source of income for Roscosmos. A few times a year, crews launch to the station in groups of three aboard the Russian Soyuz rocket. And NASA pays about $70 to $80 million for just one of its astronauts to ride aboard the Russian vehicle. However, that’s all about to change soon: starting in late 2017 and early 2018, NASA will begin launching its astronauts from the US again, on private spacecraft currently being developed by SpaceX and Boeing. That means that eventually Roscosmos will no longer receive money from NASA for rides to space, cutting off what has become a lucrative deal for the corporation. Meanwhile, Roscosmos has run into major financial troubles. Due to the Russia’s economic concerns, the country has slashed the corporation’s 10-year budget to just over $20 billion. That’s barely more than NASA gets in a year. Reducing the number of cosmonauts could both cut costs and serve as a money-making endeavor With very little funding coming in, Roscosmos is looking for other ways to make money. And reducing the number of cosmonauts could both cut costs and serve as a money-making endeavor. Sending up less crew would free up room on the Soyuz, and that space could then be sold to paying customers who want to sent cargo up to the ISS or tourists looking to visit lower Earth orbit. No decision has been made just yet, and NASA assured press yesterday that this doesn’t mean Roscosmos will be backing out of the ISS program prematurely. "One thing that we certainly always keep in the back of our mind [is] that our Russian partners are committed to the program at least through 2024," said Todd. "There’s no doubt they’re keeping that in mind as they work through whatever challenges they have within their system."

Preparations for Arianespace's upcoming Ariane 5 flight move into their final phase at the Spaceport by Staff Writers Kourou, French Guiana (ESA) Aug 15, 2016 File image. The upper portion of Ariane 5's dual-passenger configuration is now complete, with the Intelsat 33e satellite and SYLDA dispenser system encapsulated inside their protective payload fairing in preparation for an August 24 liftoff from French Guiana. This activity took place in the Spaceport's Final Assembly Building for Ariane 5, adjacent to where the heavy-lift launcher is waiting to receive both Intelsat 33e and the mission's other passenger, Intelsat 36 - which was transferred into the same building from the S5 payload preparation facility yesterday. The integration process' next step will occur when Intelsat 36 is positioned on the launcher's core section, allowing the configuration to be completed with installation of the Intelsat 33e/SYLDA/fairing combination atop it. During the August 24 flight sequence, the payload fairing will be jettisoned first at approximately three minutes into the mission, followed by deployment of Intelsat 33e at the 28-minute mark. The SYLDA dispenser is then to be released, allowing Intelsat 36's subsequent separation to complete the mission 41 minutes after liftoff. Arianespace's upcoming Ariane 5 flight, designated VA232 in the company's launcher family numbering system, is scheduled during a launch window that opens at 6:55 p.m. and continues through 7:40 p.m., local time in French Guiana. Intelsat 33e, produced by Boeing Space Systems, is the second Intelsat EpicNG-series spacecraft - following the first, Intelsat 29e, successfully orbited on an Ariane 5 mission performed in January. The satellite has a liftoff mass estimated at 6,575 kg. and will operate from an orbital position of 60 deg. East after launch. The Intelsat 36 passenger, which was built by SSL (Space Systems Loral), has an estimated liftoff mass of 3,250 kg. After reaching its target orbit, the satellite will enhance Intelsat's premier direct-to-home neighborhood in Africa from a 68.5 deg. East orbital slot.

Governments need to enforce regulations more strictly against “rogue producers and exporters,” and impose stiffer penalties on companies that put shipments of improperly tested batteries on cargo aircraft, the International Air Transport Association, International Air Cargo Association and three manufacturers’ or shipping lobbies said Monday in a joint statement. “We’ve had regulations in place for a long time, and they’re regularly strengthened but the frustration is the failure of some states to step in and enforce the regulations,” said Dave Brennan, an assistant director at IATA for cargo safety and standards, said by phone from the group’s Geneva headquarters. In some countries, manufacturing is outpacing overseers’ ability to check standards, while some nations’ aviation authorities lack the legal means to impose fines without going to court, he said. Growth of worldwide shipments of lithium-ion batteries, which power devices such as smartphones, laptops and toys, is projected to average 20 percent annually for the next decade or so after reaching about $16 billion last year. Three freighter blazes have been linked to lithium battery shipments, including the crash of a Boeing Co. 747 freighter in Dubai in 2010 that killed two United Parcel Service pilots. ICAO Move The United Nations’ air-industry regulator, the International Civil Aviation Organization, banned any shipments of rechargeable lithium batteries as cargo on passenger planes earlier this year, following a warning in mid-2015 by aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE. The interim prohibition is in force while ICAO works on a new lithium-battery package-performance standard, expected by 2018. Non-rechargeable versions were already banned in 2004. While smaller incidents involving lithium ion batteries must be reported to civil aviation regulators, both in the country where the airline is registered, and in the country from which the shipment came, they’re not necessarily publicized, IATA’s Brennan said. “Airlines don’t necessarily tell us: they tend to be fairly reluctant at sharing the information,”‘ he said. “They don’t want anything out in the public arena suggesting they carry dangerous goods, even though the blame isn’t with the airline itself.” Copyright 2016 Associated Press.

Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of Air India's turnaround in his Independence Day speech, state-run Air India said, it expects to log over Rs 100 crore operating profit in the last fiscal and projecting to cross the Rs 700 crore mark in the current financial year. While the 2015-16 figures are still being audited and finalised, senior officials said, "We are sure to cross Rs 100 crore worth of operating profits in the last fiscal, largely due to low fuel prices as well as improved performance. In the current financial year, we are projecting that this figure will jump to Rs 700-800 crore." In his Independence Day address from the ramparts of Red Fort, the Prime Minister, while speaking on the turnaround of major PSUs, said, "Today I can say with complete satisfaction that Air India, which used to be notoriously known for incurring losses, has improved its operations leading it to log operational profits." The officials, however, said the biggest challenge before the airline was the massive debt burden of Rs 52,000 crore, whose servicing alone is costing the airline around Rs 5,800 crore per annum. After debt servicing, the cash gap between operating and net profit was estimated around Rs 4,000 crore. The carrier had incurred a loss of Rs 5,859.91 crore in 2014-15. Asked how they planned to bridge this gap, they said, "A proposal could be to convert the debt into equity. It is for the government to take a final call, but we have flagged it." Maintaining that the airline was consolidating and expanding, the officials exuded confidence that Air India would become "very good operationally in the coming months by trying to adopt a more aggressive strategy in the market". This would be achieved through rapid expansion in its international and domestic network, along with a fleet expansion plan over the next 3-4 years, they said. When contacted, Air India CMD Ashwani Lohani, said, "We are on the road to recovery. But there is still a long way to go due to the debt burden and other legacy issues." "We want to jump to Rs 700-800 crore worth of operating profits in the current fiscal. But this being a commercial enterprise and given the state of the aviation industry worldwide, this is what we desire. Everyone is putting in their best," Lohani told PTI here. To questions on Air India's network expansion plans, the officials said that the airline launched the Ahmedabad-London -Newark flight on Independence Day, months after the New Delhi-Vienna and New Delhi-San Francisco services. The airline is planning to double the San Francisco service from 3 to 6 days a week from November 1 this year. The plans are to launch a flight to Madrid in January and to Washington or Toronto by April-May next year. The other routes on the anvil are Copenhagen and some destinations in Africa, they said. On the domestic front, the plans are to connect several Tier-II and Tier-III cities, they said, pointing out that "there is a lot of space and we want to take the first mover advantage" to these destinations. Regarding its fleet expansion programme which would be a combination of lease or sale and lease-back, they said while three new ATR turboprop planes have already been inducted to serve the domestic route expansion, "orders for ten more are expected to be placed in the next week to 10 days." Besides, Air India has also placed orders for 30 Airbus A-320s, six Boeing 787 Dreamliners and three Boeing-777s. Over the next four years, "We will either buy or lease a total of 115 aircraft (of different types) and retire 15 old ones. So we will add 100 planes in this period," they said. However on the flip side, the officials also expressed concern over "falling yields" saying this has been a factor affecting all Indian carriers which have seen their yields falling by as high as 10%. They also spoke of several marketing tactics adopted in the recent past like matching AC-II tier train to last-minute fares, launching day-return flights and improved in-flight services to enhance its market share. Besides expanding its route network and fleet, Air India has been working on ways to revive its fortunes by reducing expenses in a variety of ways. "I have been repeatedly emphasising on economy, curbing of wasteful expenditure and maintaining immaculate conduct and behaviour," Lohani has said in a series of recent strong directives barring hiring of luxury cabs or high-end hotel rooms abroad or even welcoming himself with bouquets or carrying his briefcases. "All these steps have had a major impact not only on our finances but also on the culture and the value system of the airline," the CMD said.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Transport and battery-manufacturing interests today called on governments worldwide to tighten enforcement on the air movements of lithium batteries, which are embedded in a growing number of products but which are prone to exploding if they are overheated due to overcharging or faulty manufacturing. The protest took the form of a letter sent to unidentified battery-producing nations, according to the International Air Transportation Association (IATA), the leading global airline trade group and one of the signatory groups involved. The letter said governments must do a more consistent job of monitoring lithium-battery distribution at the origin point of the process, either with the manufacturer or with the distributor that is classified as the shipper, to determine whether product handling is in compliance. The letter also called for "cooperative enforcement initiatives between jurisdictions" to prevent the lithium batteries being made in one country from being trucked across a border to be flown from another country, thus putting them out of control of the origin country's jurisdiction. An industry source said the letter was aimed predominantly at China, which, along with Japan and South Korea, account for a large part of global lithium-ion battery production, according to an industry source. Though it is legal to ship the goods from China to Hong Kong, industry watchdogs have found that manufacturers that engage in the process have a higher incidence of flouting worldwide dangerous-goods transport regulations, such as failing to first test their batteries to meet United Nations testing requirements, improperly packaging, misdeclaring, or shipping counterfeit batteries. The manufacturers hope if they truck the goods to Hong Kong, the shipments can disappear within the massive volumes of cargo being air shipped daily from the island, thus avoiding the cost and obligations of compliance, the source said. The source said the Chinese government is keenly aware of the issue and is doing what it can to inspect and, if necessary, intercept problematic battery shipments before they are trucked out of the country. Commercialized in the early 1990s, lithium batteries are made of the world's lightest metal and hold a charge longer than metals of heavier density. They power most of the world's mobile devices and today power most electric cars. Lithium batteries remain expensive, though it is believed that as production capacity expands and processes improve, costs will drop dramatically, thus broadening the market for the product. According to data from French company Avicenne Energy, global demand for lithium batteries from 2012 to 2020 will increase by 16 percent a year, compounded annually. By contrast, demand for traditional lead-acid batteries, which comprise the bulk of batteries being made today, will increase by just 4 percent a year. However, lithium's properties can result in internal short-circuiting, which can cause overheating and a subsequent explosion. Some of the Boeing Co.'s 787 aircraft were grounded in 2013 because of fires caused by lithium-battery explosions. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an arm of the U.N., imposed a ban on lithium batteries being shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft. The ban did not extend to all-cargo planes. In the IATA statement, George A. Kerchner, executive director of the Portable Rechargeable Battery Association, which has been working with the airline group, said the inability of foreign governments to stop "rogue manufacturers" from disregarding international law is putting pressure on airlines and regulators to unilaterally ban all forms of lithium-battery shipments from aircraft. That, he said, would be a major mistake. "A ban on the shipment of lithium-ion batteries aboard aircraft would put lives at risk by slowing delivery of life-critical and life-enhancing medical equipment, and jeopardize the security of many countries because a large number of military applications are powered by lithium batteries," said Kerchner. #Regulation/Government/Infrastructure #Air #Transportation #Logistics Resources Mentioned In This Article Boeing Inc.

Last week the Russian newspaper Izvestia quoted Sergei Krikalev, director of manned programs at Roscosmos, saying that the agency had approached NASA about reducing its standard ISS crew count from three to two. Russia has had three astronauts on rotation in the ISS since 2010, but apparently that will be changing. Krikalev said that delays in building the Russian Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM), the nodal unit (a structural join), and the scientific and power module – let alone lofting them into orbit – meant there was no need for three local astronauts on station. Cutting one would save money and allow Russia to auction off the place to space tourists. In a press conference on Monday, Kenneth Todd, NASA's operations integration manager for the ISS, confirmed negotiations over the redundancy had begun, the Planetary Society reports. "They're exploring the option of going down to two crew on the Russian segment," he said. "We'll look at it as we do with all these kind of things – we'll trade it against whatever risk that might put into the program, first and foremost the risk to our crew onboard, and the station itself. From there, we start looking at the options and see what we can do as a partnership to either accommodate it or help them realize why that's a bad thing." Russia's MLM was due to have been sent into orbit back in 2007, but delays in building the hardware and launch delays mean that the earliest it will be sent up is now 2017. The other two modules have suffered similar problems and may be delayed to 2019 or later. At the heart of the Roscosmos decision is a funding double-whammy. Falling oil prices, as well as sanctions, have hurt the Russian economy and the space agency has had its budget slashed to a tenth of that of its Yankee counterpart. To make life more difficult, the Russians can no longer bank on getting cash from NASA for astronaut delivery past 2017. SpaceX should be ready to start sending crew to the ISS by then and Boeing is planning flights by 2018, so the $80m per launch Roscosmos was getting will no longer be coming in. "One thing that we certainly always keep in the back of our mind is that our Russian partners are committed to the program at least through 2024," said Todd. "There's no doubt they're keeping that in mind as they work through whatever challenges they have within their system." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 15 Comments More from The Register NASA opens ISS to private sector modules The plan is to to build wider experience useful for Izzy's successor 17 Comments SpaceX Dragon capsule lands in Pacific carrying 12 moustronauts NASA to watch Musketeer relatives carefully 44 Comments Taxi for NASA!

Some cities have boomed in the years since the national unemployment rate hit 10 percent in October 2009, while others have limped back to normalcy. A CNBC analysis of the latest per-capita real personal income data from 2009 to 2014, provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, reveals which major metros (with minimum populations of 1 million) have led the strongest rebounds above the nationwide average of 7.2 percent. 1. San Jose, Calif. (22%) With an impressive 22 percent growth in real personal income, San Jose tops our list. Income here rose three times more than the national average. The growth may be due in part to the fact that the metro area is home to nearly eight times as many developers as average, and they take in $147,220 per year on average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2. Houston (15.4%) Houston has seen significant income growth over the past several years, but it has also felt the impact of falling oil prices since 2014. Unemployment ticked higher in June to 5.5 percent. "We have had some significant layoffs in the oil and gas industry," said Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership. However, Jankowski noted that the uptick in unemployment could be seasonally skewed, and he pointed to management and real estate sectors that continue to grow. 3. Grand Rapids, Mich. (14.7%) The Grand Rapids-Wyoming metro area in Michigan has diversified greatly over the past 20 years, according to Birgit Klohs, CEO of The Right Place, a Western Michigan development corporation. "We have a health-care and life-sciences sector that 20 years ago did not exist," she said. Housing prices are booming, and the unemployment rate came in at only 3.4 percent in June. On top of that, local business confidence levels are running near a 16-year high. 4. San Francisco (14.6%) While the impressive 14.6 percent gain in personal income recorded in the San Francisco-Oakland metro area might have you thinking about a move, it is worth noting that the average resident dedicates nearly 40 percent of expenditures to housing, which is above the national average. 5. Oklahoma City (13.4%) Although Oklahoma City has felt the recent impact of falling oil prices, the energy sector only accounts for 3 percent of the city's employment base, according to Kurt Foreman, executive vice president of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. He cites General Electric and Boeing's research centers in Oklahoma City as examples of the city's shift to mechanical engineering. 6. Cincinnati (12%) Notable local employers Kroger and Procter & Gamble employ more than 30,000 Cincinnatians, contributing to the metro's low unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. 7. Dallas (11.7%) While the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area just makes the list, the local economy is showing strength beyond the time horizon analyzed here. Of the 12 largest U.S. metro areas monitored by the BEA, Dallas boasts the second-largest percentage gains in total nonfarm payrolls through 2016 — second only to Phoenix.

NASA celebrated a meeting with six private companies to design future space colonies, transborders and other new technologies, with the aim to conquer the Moon and the planet Mars. To carry out this plan, NASA started a second phase of the program called NexStep, of 65 million dollars to stimulate the development of private initatives. Among the proposals of six projects that were selected, there were the inflable space bases, which comes from the firm BIGELOW (Las Vegas, Nevada). BIGELOW will develop the XBase, a new version of inflable module BEAM, installed in the International Space Station. Differently from the one in the ISS, the new version will measure more than 330 cubic meters. For its part, Orbital Atk, will create a small 'cargo ship' that could take provisions to future orbital colonies in the Moon or Mars. The proposal is to promote and adapt the current transborders made by the firm Cygnus that provide regularly the astronauts of the ISS. Other financed companies are: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Sierra Nevada and NanoRacks. The first phase of the program 'NextStep' was inaugurated in 2014; with more than six million dollars in projects for the creation of new technologies of small satellites. hr/tac/may/cdg Temas Relacionados: NASA Plans to Use Inflable Space Bases and Space Taxis 16 de agosto de 2016, 00:10 Washington, Aug 16 (Prensa Latina) The US National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) plans to use a certain kind of inflable space bases, moon e-mails and space taxis moving among the stars and planets, according to its most recent report.

The number of crew members aboard the station has, more or less, remained steady since then, with Russia providing half the crew while NASA and its international partners provide another three astronauts. But, in a surprise announcement, Russia is considering scaling back its crew complement from three to two. According to Russian media reports, Sergei Krikalev, the director of human programs for Roscosmos, said the move was made to lower Russia's ongoing costs to service the station. By reducing the number of its crew members, Russia will need to fly fewer Progress cargo ships, which deliver food and supplies to the Russian side of the station. Roscosmos already spends considerably less on station operations than NASA does. Russian media report that Roscosmos plans to spend about $4.1 billion from 2016 through 2025 for station maintenance. That's just a little more than NASA's annual expenses for station operation and transportation, which were $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2016. In a statement on Monday, NASA confirmed that Russia is considering dropping back to two crew members. However, the agency did not provide any additional information. According to NASA: Any questions about the near-term Russian Space budget or Russian ISS expedition size should be directed to the Roscosmos press office. Roscosmos has joined NASA and other International Space Station partners in extending support for the orbiting laboratory to at least 2024, and the current level of research of both NASA and the international partners on ISS is at an all-time high. Future crew sizes The Russian decision raises questions about future space station crew sizes and the lifetime of the space station. In regard to crew size, NASA is discussing how to handle its own crew complement on the US side of the station—the US Orbital Segment—should Russia scale back. At present NASA has three slots, generally filled by two of the agency's astronauts and one crew member from the European Space Agency, Canada, or Japan. Several scenarios are being considered, but Ars has learned that the most likely option is keeping the NASA complement the same, which would reduce the overall crew size aboard the station to five. In some sense, that would represent a step backward to a time before May 29, 2009, when Roman Romanenko, Frank de Winne, and Bob Thirsk arrived on the station, expanding the crew size to six, which also marked the first time all of the ISS partners were represented on board. Before that, dating back to October 2000, three crew members were aboard the station. The only exception was a brief period after the Columbia accident when NASA had to fall back to a “caretaker” mode of two crew members, due to the grounding of the shuttle. The other big question is what this potential move might signal about Russia’s future commitment to the station. Although NASA and its partners have signed agreements to continue flying and supporting the station until 2024, the US space agency has talked openly about the possibility of flying it until 2028, or possibly even beyond then. Russia, however, has made noises about breaking with the international partnership no later than 2024, if not earlier, and building its own orbiting station. NASA’s pursuit of its commercial crew program—promoted as “Launch America”—further complicates matters. NASA currently relies on Russia for crew transport to the space station. When Boeing and SpaceX begin flying crew vehicles in a couple of years, Russia will lose the half a billion dollars the US agency currently pays Roscosmos annually for Soyuz seats. This fiscal pressure may also be adding to Russia’s desire to scale back its investment in the station. In any case, the multi-decade space station program that has bound US and Russian interests in space, coming after the Cold War and 1960s space race, has been one of the great diplomatic achievements of recent decades. Even as US-Russia tensions escalated following the Ukraine crisis, the two partners have worked well together in space. It would be disappointing to see that partnership unravel in less than a decade. Expand full story Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.
