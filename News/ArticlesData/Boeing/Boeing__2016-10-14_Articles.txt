Mounir succeeds John Wojick, who is retiring after 36 years of company service, effective early 2017. In his new role, Mounir is responsible for the sales and marketing of all commercial airplanes and related services to airlines and leasing customers in all markets worldwide. His team’s duties include sales strategy, operations and customer relationships. “Ihssane is a seasoned sales leader with in-depth knowledge of Boeing customers worldwide,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “His extensive knowledge of our products and services puts him in the best position to help our customers address their fleet and operational needs and be successful in today’s competitive environment.” Mounir has held several leadership positions within Boeing’s Sales organization, mostly recently as vice president of Sales for Northeast Asia. He previously served as vice president of Marketing, Sales Strategy and Operations, responsible for developing and implementing cross-regional strategies for Commercial Airplanes. Prior to that assignment, Mounir led Commercial Airplanes Sales efforts in many regions across the world. Previously, Mounir was the vice president of Sales for Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean. He also served in Sales leadership roles in Europe, Russia, Central Asia and Africa. Mounir joined Boeing as a senior aerodynamics engineer in 1997. He earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in aerospace engineering from Wichita State University. Conner thanked Wojick for his decades of service to Boeing and leadership of the team that sold thousands of airplanes to customers worldwide. “John’s retirement caps an outstanding 36-year Boeing career that has included assignments in engineering and all facets of commercial airplanes sales and marketing,” Conner said. “As the leader of our Sales team since 2012, he has consistently demonstrated the integrity, tenacity, courage and commitment it takes to compete aggressively and win in the marketplace. Under his leadership, our Sales and Marketing organization has sharpened its focus on our customers, continued to earn their trust and maintain their loyalty.” The new regional leader for Northeast Asia Sales will be named at a later time.

And other tales of science fiction, emerging as science fact. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 15, 2016 at 10:13AM NASA's path to Mars -- and Boeing's -- looks anything but straightforward compared to SpaceX's. Image source: NASA. SpaceX wants to go to Mars -- by now, that's common knowledge. But did you know that Boeing (NYSE:BA) wants to go to Mars, too? And that it plans to get there before SpaceX? It's true. And now, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has thrown down the gauntlet before SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, declaring: "I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket." High hopes Boeing's CEO made this declaration while speaking at The Atlantic's "What's Next?" tech conference in Chicago last week, and it came as a bit of a surprise -- mathematically speaking. You see, whereas SpaceX plans to send humans to Mars on its own, Boeing's intention is to provide the technology NASA needs to put U.S. astronauts on the Red Planet. Accordingly, Boeing's plan depends entirely on when NASA itself intends to go to Mars -- and last we heard, that wasn't likely to happen before 2033 (with arrival scheduled for 2034). Compare this to Elon Musk's plan for Mars: Earlier this year, at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Musk promised to put an unmanned Dragon 2 spaceship on Mars by 2018 -- then follow that up with a manned mission to Mars departing in 2024, and landing in 2025. 2034 minus 2025 equals SpaceX beating Boeing to Mars by nine years. And the first shall be last? Now, Boeing has been doing this "space thing" a whole lot longer than SpaceX has. It has an established reputation in the field, beginning with the Apollo missions and stretching to present day. At last report, Boeing and its United Launch Alliance partner Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) jointly hold the record for most consecutive rocket launches without mishap: 111 missions and counting. (In contrast, the last rocket SpaceX tried to send into orbit blew up before it was even ready to launch!) All of that said, SpaceX insists its rockets will be flying again soon, and perhaps as early as November. Unless Boeing and NASA move their timetable significantly forward, SpaceX could once again be on track to beat them. "He said, she said"... but they both say this Where does this leave us? SpaceX says it will get to Mars first; Boeing begs to differ. The truth remains to be seen. But here's one thing both companies agree on: Mars aside, there are some pretty exciting prospects for aerospace right here on Earth. You see, while Muilenburg's Mars proclamation got all of the headlines last week, what really caught my interest was his mention of other initiatives Boeing is working on. These range from efforts to promote space tourism to the development of "hypersonic aircraft" flying around Earth at speeds much faster than the norm today. Muilenburg touted the prospect of "supersonic, hypersonic travel, the ability to connect anywhere in the world in a couple hours," through vehicles similar to Boeing's WaveRider hypersonic vehicle (which has been clocked at Mach 5.1). Boeing's ULA partner, Lockheed Martin, meanwhile, is developing a "Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle" that it says could one day fly passengers from New York to Los Angeles in 12 minutes, at speeds up to Mach 20. This idea jibes with something Elon Musk mentioned as a potential new field of business for SpaceX: point-to-point transport of passengers and cargo via spacecraft. NYC to London -- in 10 minutes flat After listing the businesses SpaceX is already using in order to raise capital for its Mars mission, Musk observed that, in theory at least, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets could be used not only to loft satellites into space (and keep them there), but, now that SpaceX has mastered the process for launching and also landing rockets safely, to transport passengers from Earth... back to Earth. Mused Musk: "Maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world, provided we can land somewhere where noise is not a super big deal," such as on a drone ship stationed several miles off the coast. After all, a rocket that accelerates to Mach 23 to put a satellite in orbit can just as easily use that speed to traverse the globe in minutes -- and land somewhere other than where it started from. "We could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45 minutes at the longest," said Musk. "If we had a floating platform off the coast of, say, New York ... you could go from New York to Tokyo in 25 minutes, or cross the Atlantic in 10 minutes." Musk's discussion of point-to-point rocket travel in September sounded a lot like what Muilenburg mentioned in October. Different emphases and different vehicles, to be sure -- but the point is the same: Sure, we'll get to Mars eventually. Meantime, if SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed keep going the way they're heading, then the idea of booking an hours-long international airline flight could soon seem as silly as boarding an ocean liner to cross the Atlantic. Hypersonic travel is coming to Earth. And Boeing, Lockheed, and SpaceX are the companies bringing it. Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Yankee Analysts Home Earnings Finance Global Markets About Us Privacy Policy Actual Versus Consensus: Sell-side Take on Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) By William Abels - October 15, 2016 SHARE Facebook Twitter For the most recent quarter, 7 analysts weighing in on Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) had predicted that the company would report earnings per share of $-0.88 for the period ending on 2016-06-30.  On 2016-07-27, the firm reported actual earnings of $-0.44 for fiscal Q2 representing an EPS surprise amount in per share dollar terms of $0.44.  Just prior to the release, analyst’s estimates had a standard deviation of 0.1.  Looking ahead to the next fiscal quarter, Wall Street analysts are expecting earnings per share of 2.62 for the period closing on 2016-09-30. This is the Zacks Consensus estimate calculated as the arithmetic average of all the individual analyst EPS estimates according to their own proprietary methodology (BNRI Accounting).  Investors are expecting that Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) will issue their earnings release on or around 2016-10-26. In comparing the results to the same quarter a year ago, the firm posted earnings of $2.52 for the period which endend on 2015-09-30. Analyst Sentiment Leading up to the next earnings announcements investors should pay close attention to the analysts sentiment on the stock and which direction they are revising their estimates.  Over the past 6 months 2 sell-side analysts have lowered their long term earnings per share estimates on the stock.  During that same period 3 analysts have increased their earnings expectations for the firm.  So what does this mean?  Typically if a large percentage of analysts lower their revisions, the company is more likely to disappoint the Street.  If a large number of brokerage firms increase estimates prior to earnings, the company is more likely to impress with their numbers. Looking ahead to long term projections, Zacks has calculated a long term mean estimate of 12.2.  This is the best estimate for both revenue and earnings over the next three to five years.  Three months ago this number stood at 12.56. Analyst Price Targets Now turning to where analysts believe Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are headed.  According to the 11 analysts covering the shares, the consensus price target stands at $151.727.  The standard deviation of all estimates is $22.365.  The most aggressive analyst on the name has a price target of $183.  The analyst with the most bearish outlook on the stock has a target price of $103.  The latest analyst revision was recorded on 2016-10-11. Each of the 11 covering analysts have also provided a Buy, Sell or Hold recommendation on the stock.  As of 2016-10-14, 8 have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, 1 have a Buy rating, 5 have a Hold rating and 1 have a Sell or Strong Sell.  Taking a look back three months ago to compare sentiment, at that time 8 had a Strong Buy, 1 had a Buy, 6 had a Hold and 1 had a sell rating.  Zacks breaks all of the recommendations down into a integer based number in order to get an average recommendation rating on the stock.  The scale is on a 1 to 5 basis where 1 represents a Strong Buy and 5 a Strong Sell.  Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has a mean recommendation of 2.09.  In looking at the historical ratings numbers we can see that the stock had a mean rating of 2.11 one month ago, 2.11 two months ago and 2.15 three months ago.    William Abels LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Latest Netflix Up More Than 3% October 5, 2016 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Closes Fast-Casual Prototypes as Part of “Strategic...

(And Why It Matters) A wave of Dreamliner orders this quarter could provide a nice boost to Boeing's profit margin next year. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 15, 2016 at 9:35AM When Boeing (NYSE:BA) began delivering its 787 Dreamliner in late 2011, it set the program accounting quantity -- an estimate of foreseeable sales over the next decade -- at 1,100 units. Two years later, it raised this estimate to 1,300 units, providing a modest boost to its profitability. Boeing may be close to raising the Dreamliner program accounting quantity again. Let's take a look at what that means, when it could happen, and why it matters for investors. Program accounting 101 When a new aircraft type is introduced, the first few models produced tend to be extremely costly. Indeed, Boeing spent an average of about $400 million to build the first 40 or so Dreamliners, according to the Seattle Times. That's several times the average selling price. Boeing incurred huge losses on the first 40 or so Dreamliners it built. Image source: Boeing. However, costs decline significantly over time. It's fairly typical for costs to fall by about 15% every time the number of units produced doubles. In other words, the 200th plane off the line costs 15% less to build than the 100th plane, while the 400th plane built is 15% cheaper than the 200th. Program accounting allows Boeing to smooth out the profitability of new aircraft programs. It looks up to 10 years ahead and estimates the program's total profitability over that time period. The estimated profit is essentially spread evenly over each plane produced. Thus, Boeing can report steady earnings rather than rack up huge losses on early production models followed by profits later on. Program accounting has been stretched to its limit for the 787. Cash costs related to Dreamliner production over the past decade have exceeded revenue by more than $30 billion. However, Boeing hasn't reported losses on the Dreamliner program, because it expects to offset the cash losses it has incurred thus far with large profits over the next six years or so. Not surprisingly, this has stirred up quite a bit of controversy. Will Boeing raise the 787 program accounting quantity again? For the past three years, Boeing's program accounting quantity for the 787 has been 1,300 units. This covers about six more years of production. That's much less than the 10-year forecast horizon Boeing used when it originally set the accounting block at 1,100 units. Theoretically, this means that Boeing could extend the 787 accounting block. (As noted above, it did this once in late 2013, increasing the accounting quantity to 1,300 units.) To extend the accounting block, Boeing must be able to estimate the revenue and costs associated with those additional airplanes. This doesn't mean Boeing needs to have sold all of those planes. For example, Boeing had fewer than 1,000 Dreamliner orders when it extended the block from 1,100 to 1,300. However, Boeing has faced significant pricing pressure and a slowdown in orders for the 787 recently. That makes it harder to estimate the profitability of planes it will be delivering in the mid-2020s. A flurry of 787 orders to end 2016? Between the beginning of 2014 and the end of last month, Boeing booked just 131 net orders for the 787 family: 41 in 2014, 71 in 2015, and 19 through the first nine months of 2016. That gave it a total of 1,161 Dreamliner orders as of the end of last quarter. However, Boeing could add significantly to that total in the last few months of 2016. Last week, it announced that Qatar Airways had ordered 30 787-9s. This week, Boeing added another order for 12 787-9s from China Southern Airlines. Additionally, China's Donghai Airlines committed to buy five 787-9s earlier this year, but that order is still waiting to be finalized. Saudia also recently announced plans to buy 13 787s, although it isn't clear whether those are already included in Boeing's order book. Boeing has captured dozens of Dreamliner orders in the past month. Image source: Boeing. The big prize is a potential order from Emirates. By year-end, the Middle Eastern airline giant is expected to decide between the 787 and Airbus' A350 for an order of roughly 70 jets. Finally, Pakistan International Airlines appears to be on the verge of ordering eight Dreamliners. If the Emirates deal comes to fruition and these other orders are finalized, Boeing would end the year with nearly 1,300 total orders for the 787. Additionally, racking up more than 100 orders in a few months would give Boeing a lot more clarity about the Dreamliner's future profitability. As a result, it could cause Boeing to extend the 787 Dreamliner accounting block again. So what? Extending the program accounting block would have zero impact on Boeing's cash flow, which is arguably the most important metric for any business. Nevertheless, most investors pay close attention to accounting earnings as well as cash flow -- and a block extension would have a big impact on Boeing's earnings. For now, Boeing is reporting very slim profits on each Dreamliner it delivers, because the projected cash profits of future deliveries in the 1,300 unit accounting block are barely enough to offset the losses sustained thus far. By contrast, since aircraft production costs decline continuously, any units added to the accounting block would be highly profitable sales. Those profits would be spread across all the remaining deliveries in the 787 accounting block. As a result, extending the accounting block would immediately increase the amount of profit Boeing reports for each 787 delivery. 787 accounting block extensions are thus a crucial aspect of Boeing's plans to boost profitability at its commercial airplanes division. The sooner Boeing can meet the requirements needed to extend the 787 accounting block, the sooner it will be able to report the strong profit growth it has promised to shareholders.

The Boeing 747's landing gear on both wings failed and passengers were warned "not to rock the plane" when getting off as it could have overturned.  The 293 passengers on board were asked to leave the holiday jet destined for Chicago "very slowly" in case it toppled over on the runway following the mid-air emergency.  The frightening incident, caused when a landing gear lever got stuck in the "up" position, closed the Heathrow runway for one hour until the aircraft was secured and towed away.  The plane - which also had 17 crew members onboard - travelled the entire length of the runway before eventually coming to a full stop at the end because of the lack of braking power which was HALVED as a result of losing the main landing gear.

A formal report has blamed a mechanical error "that caused incorrect rigging of the landing gear lever system after the landing gear control module had been replaced."  The British Airways Boeing 747-400, registration G-CIVX, was performing flight BA-295 from London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare. Newflare The plane had 293 passengers onboard Newflare Passengers were told not to rock the plane as they left It was about 160nm south of Keflavik (Iceland) when the crew decided to return to London's Heathrow Airport due to a technical problem, reports the Aviation Herald.  Whilst approaching Heathrow, the pilots reported an unsafe gear indication for both main gear and only the nose and body wheels descended.  Twenty minutes later, the Boeing landed safely on only the nose and body wheels after the pilot circled to dump fuel.  "Passengers reported the crew advised they were returning to London due to a technical problem. About 20 minutes prior to landing the crew announced that the landing gear did not fully extend with only three of five sets of gear having lowered. After the aircraft was towed to the apron, passengers were told to disembark very slowly....otherwise the aircraft would tip over and settle on its tail," said the official report Getty The British Airways plane's landing gear on both wings failed .This is a file picture   The Air Accidents Investigation report said: "The jammed landing gear lever was attributed to a rig pin not being inserted in the landing gear system during maintenance, which led to additional and unnecessary shims being used to rig the landing gear lever."  It also indentified the contributing factors of "the distraction of the engineer when he saw the quadrant move and he took his break, deficiencies in the operator’s task card system, the omission of the need to fit the rig pin in the operator’s TR for this task and an inadequate handover between the night shift and the day shift."  The emergency happened on January 30th 2016 but details have only just been revealed. The Boeing was making its first flight since maintenance on January 24th. A British Airways spokesman said: "The aircraft landed safely with its nose and body landing gear functioning correctly. "Our highly trained pilots practise a range of landings during their regular training. "We have introduced additional engineering procedure checks and training to ensure this issue does not happen again.

(And Why It Matters) A wave of Dreamliner orders this quarter could provide a nice boost to Boeing's profit margin next year. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 15, 2016 at 9:35AM When Boeing (NYSE:BA) began delivering its 787 Dreamliner in late 2011, it set the program accounting quantity -- an estimate of foreseeable sales over the next decade -- at 1,100 units. Two years later, it raised this estimate to 1,300 units, providing a modest boost to its profitability. Boeing may be close to raising the Dreamliner program accounting quantity again. Let's take a look at what that means, when it could happen, and why it matters for investors. Program accounting 101 When a new aircraft type is introduced, the first few models produced tend to be extremely costly. Indeed, Boeing spent an average of about $400 million to build the first 40 or so Dreamliners, according to the Seattle Times. That's several times the average selling price. Boeing incurred huge losses on the first 40 or so Dreamliners it built. Image source: Boeing. However, costs decline significantly over time. It's fairly typical for costs to fall by about 15% every time the number of units produced doubles. In other words, the 200th plane off the line costs 15% less to build than the 100th plane, while the 400th plane built is 15% cheaper than the 200th. Program accounting allows Boeing to smooth out the profitability of new aircraft programs. It looks up to 10 years ahead and estimates the program's total profitability over that time period. The estimated profit is essentially spread evenly over each plane produced. Thus, Boeing can report steady earnings rather than rack up huge losses on early production models followed by profits later on. Program accounting has been stretched to its limit for the 787. Cash costs related to Dreamliner production over the past decade have exceeded revenue by more than $30 billion. However, Boeing hasn't reported losses on the Dreamliner program, because it expects to offset the cash losses it has incurred thus far with large profits over the next six years or so. Not surprisingly, this has stirred up quite a bit of controversy. Will Boeing raise the 787 program accounting quantity again? For the past three years, Boeing's program accounting quantity for the 787 has been 1,300 units. This covers about six more years of production. That's much less than the 10-year forecast horizon Boeing used when it originally set the accounting block at 1,100 units. Theoretically, this means that Boeing could extend the 787 accounting block. (As noted above, it did this once in late 2013, increasing the accounting quantity to 1,300 units.) To extend the accounting block, Boeing must be able to estimate the revenue and costs associated with those additional airplanes. This doesn't mean Boeing needs to have sold all of those planes. For example, Boeing had fewer than 1,000 Dreamliner orders when it extended the block from 1,100 to 1,300. However, Boeing has faced significant pricing pressure and a slowdown in orders for the 787 recently. That makes it harder to estimate the profitability of planes it will be delivering in the mid-2020s. A flurry of 787 orders to end 2016? Between the beginning of 2014 and the end of last month, Boeing booked just 131 net orders for the 787 family: 41 in 2014, 71 in 2015, and 19 through the first nine months of 2016. That gave it a total of 1,161 Dreamliner orders as of the end of last quarter. However, Boeing could add significantly to that total in the last few months of 2016. Last week, it announced that Qatar Airways had ordered 30 787-9s. This week, Boeing added another order for 12 787-9s from China Southern Airlines. Additionally, China's Donghai Airlines committed to buy five 787-9s earlier this year, but that order is still waiting to be finalized. Saudia also recently announced plans to buy 13 787s, although it isn't clear whether those are already included in Boeing's order book. Boeing has captured dozens of Dreamliner orders in the past month. Image source: Boeing. The big prize is a potential order from Emirates. By year-end, the Middle Eastern airline giant is expected to decide between the 787 and Airbus' A350 for an order of roughly 70 jets. Finally, Pakistan International Airlines appears to be on the verge of ordering eight Dreamliners. If the Emirates deal comes to fruition and these other orders are finalized, Boeing would end the year with nearly 1,300 total orders for the 787. Additionally, racking up more than 100 orders in a few months would give Boeing a lot more clarity about the Dreamliner's future profitability. As a result, it could cause Boeing to extend the 787 Dreamliner accounting block again. So what? Extending the program accounting block would have zero impact on Boeing's cash flow, which is arguably the most important metric for any business. Nevertheless, most investors pay close attention to accounting earnings as well as cash flow -- and a block extension would have a big impact on Boeing's earnings. For now, Boeing is reporting very slim profits on each Dreamliner it delivers, because the projected cash profits of future deliveries in the 1,300 unit accounting block are barely enough to offset the losses sustained thus far. By contrast, since aircraft production costs decline continuously, any units added to the accounting block would be highly profitable sales. Those profits would be spread across all the remaining deliveries in the 787 accounting block. As a result, extending the accounting block would immediately increase the amount of profit Boeing reports for each 787 delivery. 787 accounting block extensions are thus a crucial aspect of Boeing's plans to boost profitability at its commercial airplanes division. The sooner Boeing can meet the requirements needed to extend the 787 accounting block, the sooner it will be able to report the strong profit growth it has promised to shareholders.

Share this article Share A formal report has blamed a mechanical error 'that caused incorrect rigging of the landing gear lever system after the landing gear control module had been replaced.' The BA 295 flight had been making its way from London Heathrow to the Chicago O'Hare International Airport.  The plane turned around just south of Iceland after around two hours, due to a technical problem. This picture (file) shows what was missing when the BA flight returned to London Heathrow during the flight Whilst approaching Heathrow, the pilots reported an unsafe gear indication for both main gear and only the nose and body wheels descended. Twenty minutes later, the Boeing landed safely on only the nose and body wheels after the pilot circled to dump fuel. There were more than 300 people on board the flight - including 293 passengers and 14 crews members. Passengers described the experience as 'very scary' and praised the pilot who managed to smoothly land the Boeing 747. Only three of the five sets of landing gear descended because the crew couldn't move it to the up or down position  Muriel Gray tweeted: 'The hugest kisses and hugs to the British Airways pilot who just landed the plane my husband was on when the landing gear failed. 'Husband says BA pilot typically understated despite telling passengers how close a call that just was.' Passenger Kevin Lang told MailOnline: 'It was a dramatic and stressful episode. It all started about two or three hours into the flight when we were just south of Iceland. 'The pilot came on and said there was a technical fault and we had to go back to London. He then said they would have to jettison fuel and all the passengers would see this but was reassuring us not be alarmed.  This picture shows the landing gear that failed after the flight took off for Chicago, forcing it to return to Heathrow The Air Accidents Investigation report said: 'Passengers reported the crew advised they were returning to London due to a technical problem.  'About 20 minutes prior to landing the crew announced that the landing gear did not fully extend with only three of five sets of gear having lowered.  'After the aircraft was towed to the apron, passengers were told to disembark very slowly, aft cabin first, otherwise the aircraft would tip over and settle on its tail,' said the official report.

The Boeing 747's landing gear on both wings failed and passengers were warned "not to rock the plane" when getting off as it could have overturned.  The 293 passengers on board were asked to leave the holiday jet destined for Chicago "very slowly" in case it toppled over on the runway following the mid-air emergency.  The frightening incident, caused when a landing gear lever got stuck in the "up" position, closed the Heathrow runway for one hour until the aircraft was secured and towed away.  The plane - which also had 17 crew members onboard - travelled the entire length of the runway before eventually coming to a full stop at the end because of the lack of braking power which was HALVED as a result of losing the main landing gear.

A formal report has blamed a mechanical error "that caused incorrect rigging of the landing gear lever system after the landing gear control module had been replaced."  The British Airways Boeing 747-400, registration G-CIVX, was performing flight BA-295 from London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare. Newflare The plane had 293 passengers onboard Newflare Passengers were told not to rock the plane as they left It was about 160nm south of Keflavik (Iceland) when the crew decided to return to London's Heathrow Airport due to a technical problem, reports the Aviation Herald.  Whilst approaching Heathrow, the pilots reported an unsafe gear indication for both main gear and only the nose and body wheels descended.  Twenty minutes later, the Boeing landed safely on only the nose and body wheels after the pilot circled to dump fuel.  "Passengers reported the crew advised they were returning to London due to a technical problem. About 20 minutes prior to landing the crew announced that the landing gear did not fully extend with only three of five sets of gear having lowered. After the aircraft was towed to the apron, passengers were told to disembark very slowly....otherwise the aircraft would tip over and settle on its tail," said the official report Getty The British Airways plane's landing gear on both wings failed .This is a file picture   The Air Accidents Investigation report said: "The jammed landing gear lever was attributed to a rig pin not being inserted in the landing gear system during maintenance, which led to additional and unnecessary shims being used to rig the landing gear lever."  It also indentified the contributing factors of "the distraction of the engineer when he saw the quadrant move and he took his break, deficiencies in the operator’s task card system, the omission of the need to fit the rig pin in the operator’s TR for this task and an inadequate handover between the night shift and the day shift."  The emergency happened on January 30th 2016 but details have only just been revealed. The Boeing was making its first flight since maintenance on January 24th. A British Airways spokesman said: "The aircraft landed safely with its nose and body landing gear functioning correctly. "Our highly trained pilots practise a range of landings during their regular training. "We have introduced additional engineering procedure checks and training to ensure this issue does not happen again.

Warren/Associated Press files) By Jake Thomas, Columbian staff writer Published: October 14, 2016, 6:52 PM A   A Just a few months from the start of the 2017 legislative session, a Boeing official says the aerospace giant still has an important story to tell in Washington. Bill McSherry, vice president of government operations for Boeing Co., told The Columbian’s Editorial Board on Friday that Boeing remains the state’s largest taxpayer, largest private employer and the largest payer of tuition through a company program that paid $32 million in 2015 to send its workers to college. “You know, I think we have not always been the most vocal tellers of our story,” said McSherry. He was accompanied by Kelly Maloney, president and CEO of the trade association Aerospace Futures Alliance of Washington, on a trip through Clark County to meet with business groups and others. A big part of that story has involved tax incentives. In 2003, and again in 2013, the Legislature approved tax incentives that helped sway the company to keep jobs in Washington. McSherry said those tax incentives have worked, with the number of workers employed by Boeing in Washington rising from 53,000 to 75,000 since 2003. The latest aircraft produced by the company, the 777X, is produced in Washington as a condition of the $8.7 billion in tax breaks given to Boeing in 2013. “That sounds like a really good decision that has paid off really well,” McSherry said of the tax incentives. But the deal has drawn criticism. After getting the tax breaks, Boeing opened a new factory in South Carolina, where the company’s workforce isn’t unionized like Washington’s. The company’s workforce in Washington has also fallen from the roughly 83,000 employees it had in 2013. Earlier this year, the Legislature considered and nixed a proposal to tie Chicago-based Boeing’s tax breaks to its number of employees in Washington. The topic could resurface in the coming months as lawmakers grapple with a state Supreme Court decision requiring the Legislature to fully fund basic education. When McSherry was asked if he could understand why some people might be upset with the company’s decision to set up in South Carolina, he responded that the situation wasn’t handled “the best.” McSherry stressed that about half of Boeing’s workforce is located in Washington, including about 250 employees in Clark County who commute to nearby facilities, including a plant in Gresham, Ore. He said that Boeing faces significant challenges in coming years including intense competition from foreign competitors who have heavy government support. He also expects challenges in replacing retiring workers. While Washington offers a skilled and productive workforce, he said it’s still not a “low-cost state.” “If you look at how Washington stacks up against competitor states, even with the aerospace tax incentives, we are not a low-cost state,” he said. “The aerospace tax incentive puts Washington in the game from a cost perspective, but they do not make Washington a low-cost state.” During the interview, Maloney said there are 1,400 aerospace companies in the state. She said they often get phone calls or emails from state governments offering incentives to move. “The worst thing we can do is harm what we’ve already done,” McSherry said.   Jake Thomas Columbian  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

"Boeing has been a longtime and trusted partner as we've built our fleet and business," said President and Chief Executive Officer William J. Flynn, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings.

Ihssane Mounir was appointed vice president of sales and marketing for Boeing’s airliner division, which puts him in charge of worldwide jetliner sales and services to airlines and aircraft leasing companies. He was most recently vice president of sales for northeast Asia. Mounir takes over from John Wojick, who will retire from Boeing early next year after 36 years at the aerospace giant. A native of Morocco, Mounir joined Boeing in Seattle in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer but soon moved over to the sales and marketing side, first selling Boeing jetliners in Central Asia, Europe, Russia and Africa before being promoted to Boeing’s vice president of sales for Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean. Prior to his appointment to northeast Asia, he was the company’s vice president of marketing, sales strategy and operations. Mounir’s training, however, was in engineering. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aerospace engineering at Wichita State University in 1994 and 1996, respectively, and was a teaching assistant there from 1992 to 1997, according to university records. Scott Miller, professor and chairman of WSU’s aerospace engineering department, was Mounir’s adviser on his master’s degree and now considers him a good friend. Miller said that when Mounir was a graduate student, he had a strong work ethic. Perhaps too strong. “He was one of these guys that you actually had to worry about him doing too much,” Miller said. As a student, Mounir wrote a research paper that won an international competition held by a professional aerospace engineering society. Miller said Mounir’s affable nature is likely what prompted his move at Boeing from engineering to sales and marketing. “He’s … the nicest guy you could ever meet: hard working, incredibly personable,” Miller said Friday. “He’s just a sharp mind.” Mounir is a financial supporter of the university, having been named a life member to the WSU President’s Club, which comes with donating more than $100,000 to the university. He’s also an active member of the WSU Foundation’s National Advisory Board and serves on the College of Engineering’s advisory board, according to the WSU Foundation.

Business Boeing promotes China veteran to top sales job as Wojick retires Boeing AFP, Boeing handout Senior vice president Ihssane Mounir has been named Boeing's top airplane salesman as John Wojick retires. Senior vice president Ihssane Mounir has been named Boeing's top airplane salesman as John Wojick retires. (AFP, Boeing handout) Julie JohnssonBloomberg Boeing's chief airplane salesman, John Wojick, will retire from the post in early 2017 after four years of globetrotting and head-to-head competitions with Airbus Group for multibillion-dollar jetliner orders. He'll be replaced by senior vice president Ihssane Mounir, who leads the planemaker's sales team in northeastern Asia, Boeing commercial airplane chief Ray Conner said in an email to employees late Thursday. Mounir's current portfolio includes China, one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world. Mounir takes over as Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus contend with slowing commercial jet sales after more than a decade of rapid expansion that left the planemakers with record order backlogs. Wojick "has consistently demonstrated the integrity, tenacity, courage and commitment it takes to compete aggressively and win in the marketplace," Conner wrote. He said Mounir's "extensive knowledge of our products and services puts him in the best position to help our customers address their fleet and operational needs." Wojick helped make the 737 Max the best-selling new airplane model in Boeing's 100-year history, although it still trails Airbus's upgraded A320neo family, which benefited from an earlier market debut. Wojick also landed the largest sale in U.S. aviation history: Emirates Airline's $76 billion order for 150 of Boeing's 777X jetliners in 2013. He joined Boeing in 1980 as an aerospace engineer before earning an MBA from the University of Colorado in 1985. Wojick held a variety of positions within Boeing's sales organization, overseeing its marketing in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, India and elsewhere before succeeding Conner as senior vice president for global sales and marketing in August 2012. He holds a private pilot's license and is the son of a U.S. Air Force and United Airlines pilot. Mounir's promotion caps a rapid rise at Boeing, which he joined in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer. The Moroccan native didn't speak English when he arrived alone in the U.S. at age 17, according to a 2014 profile in the Seattle Times. After landing a conditional acceptance to Wichita State University to study aerospace engineering, Mounir, who is fluent in Arabic, French and Spanish, immediately enrolled in language school. Since 2011, Mounir has dueled with Airbus in China, which is spending heavily on aviation infrastructure and aircraft. His replacement will be announced later, Conner said. "My goal is to beat Airbus in China every year," Mounir told Bloomberg Television, adding that he wasn't content with a 50-50 split of the market. "My goal is to go all the way."

November 14, 2016 0353 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:170278 Publish Date: Fri, 14 Oct 2016 18:53:02 GMT Service: Iran US, Japanese banks to fund Boeing sales to Iran US plane manufacturer Boeing has reached an agreement with an American bank to provide financing for Iran’s purchase of airliners in cooperation with a Japanese bank, an informed source announced. The informed source at Iran’s government said according to an agreement between Boeing and a US bank, the purchase of the civil aircraft will be financed via a Japanese bank, Tasnim News Agency reported. The comments came after the US decided in September to remove a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers to sell planes to Iran under contracts signed after coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the group of six countries. Iran sealed a deal in June with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes. In January, Iran also signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. The contract was signed during the visit to Paris by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. On September 21, aviation giants Airbus and Boeing Co. received permission from the US government to sell aircraft to Iran, part of landmark deals potentially worth some $50 billion in total following last year's nuclear accord. Boeing deal with Iran would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control on September 22. Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day. Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the US Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the manufacturer's components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told the Associated Press. The license covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be A320s and A330s, he said. Dubon said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran soon. Under Boeing's deal, Iran’s flag carrier Iran Air will buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s in a deal that Iranian officials have suggested would be worth some $25 billion in total.       KeyWords US banks Boeing Iran   Related News : US, Japanese banks to fund Boeing sales to Iran Iran: US must encourage banks to do business with Tehran Iran urges US to tell EU banks trade Ok Iran's Rouhani calls for end to hostility with any country Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, Russia cooperating on Middle East issues: Larijani EU must play more active role on regional, global issues: Zarif Iran beats USA in world kabaddi meet to reach semifinals Iran seeks secure, stable Iraq: Parliament speaker Iran crowned at 1st world Pahlavani bouts Iran fit enough to win world physique title Top Iranian, Russian parliamentarians meet in Tehran President Rouhani inaugurates three oilfields in Khuzestan Official: Over 1m Iranians enter Iraq for Arba’een rituals Iran to join Paris climate change treaty Most Visited Protests erupt in Cincinnati after mistrial in police shooting of black male Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0457 sec

 Here's the simple reason why planes have winglets Benjamin Zhang and Dragan Radovanovic Oct. 14, 2016, 11:10 AM 177,873 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Boeing 737. Boeing Ever look out the window of a plane or watch as it pulls up to the gate? Have you ever wondered why some planes have pointy bits at the ends of the wings? What you see are "winglets," and they have essentially become standard equipment on all new airliners. Why are they there? "Winglets help reduce the drag associated with the creation of lift," Robert Gregg, Boeing's chief aerodynamicist, told Business Insider. That's the technical answer. Gregg said the practical reason behind winglets is easier to comprehend. Winglets allow the wings to be more efficient at creating lift, which means planes require less power from the engines. That results in greater fuel economy, lower CO2 emissions, and lower costs for airlines. Boeing claims that winglets installed on its 757 and 767 airliners can improve fuel burn by 5% and cut CO2 emissions by up to 5%. An airline that installs winglets on its fleet of 58 Boeing 767 jets is expected to save 500,000 gallons of fuel annually. Winglets help mitigate the effects of "induced drag." When an aircraft is in flight, the air pressure on top of the wing is lower than the air pressure under the wing. Near the wing tips, the high-pressure air under the wing rushes to the lower-pressure areas on top, which results in the creation of vortices. The vortices flow in a three-dimensional manner over the wings. They not only pull air up and over the wing, but they also pull air back. That third component is induced drag. With the advent of winglets, the aircraft is able to weaken the strength of wingtip vortices and, more important, cut down on induced drag along the whole wing. Dragan Radovanovic/Business Insider Induced drag can be overcome by making the wing longer. In fact, the general rule is, the longer the wingspan, the lower the induced drag, Gregg said. But in many instances, airplane makers simply don't have the option of making the wings longer. For example, narrow-body airliners such as the Boeing 737 and 757 often operate from gates at airports designed for short- to medium-range domestic flights. Since these flights usually require smaller aircraft, they have less room apportioned to them. As a result, wingspan is effectively limited by the size of the parking space the plane is allotted at the gate. So instead of the adding wingspan by making the wings longer, Boeing adds wingspan by going vertical with winglets. In some instances winglets aren't necessary, because there are no constraints on space. For example, Boeing's hot-selling 777 wide-body airliner does not have winglets. According to Gregg, that's because the 777 operates from international terminals designed for larger jumbo jets. As a result, Boeing found the performance it was seeking without the need for vertical extensions. A Boeing 777. No winglets here. Boeing Since they were first developed by Richard Whitcomb at NASA's Langley Research Center in 1976, airplane makers have steadily worked to improve the design and effectiveness of winglets. According to Gregg, the first-generation winglets fitted to aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400 and the McDonnell Douglas MD11 offered up to 2.5% to 3% improvement in fuel burn compared with aircraft not equipped with the option. Second-generation winglets, such as those found on Boeing's workhorse 737, 757, and 767 aircraft are much larger than the first-gen models, with greater curvature. Second-generation winglets offer a 4% to 6% improvement in fuel burn. Boeing's new 737 Max airliners are equipped with third-generation winglets that offer a 1% to 2% improvement over the second-gen models.

For example, the Boeing-built   F-15E is equipped with an Advanced Display Core Processor, which can process 87 billion instructions per second. The newly outfitted F-15E made its first flight July 8 with U.S. Air Force Major Justin “Astro” Elliott at the controls. “It will bring people home in bad situations—situations we couldn’t have gotten home from before,” said Elliott in a Boeing Co. press release. After a difficult few years, the outlook for  defense activity is improving, due in part to continuing innovation. Through July, data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that year-to-date shipments for defense aircraft and parts were down 11 percent from 2015 numbers; however, new orders rose 14 percent versus a year ago. For July alone, new defense capital goods orders increased 35.7 percent; shipments increased 1.1 percent. “We expect that the aerospace and defense industry will continue to grow, due to the rising tensions around the world, particularly in countries that have sovereign threats, such as the South China Seas, the India/China border, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the border between North and South Korea,” says Tom Captain, vice chairman of the Deloitte U.S. and Global Aerospace and Defense Sector. These threats prompted many countries to recapitalize their defense equipment. “The defense market hasn’t encountered the declines in spending that people were predicting five or six years ago,” says Randy Starr, a principal with Strategy&, a division of consultancy PwC. Starr, who leads the firm’s aerospace and defense practice, says defense spending “ebbs and flows every 12 to 14 years,” but prolonged conflicts resulting from the war on terror have kept spending from dipping as deeply as some analysts anticipated. However, despite supplemental funding that Congress allocates for defense programs, “the harsh reality is there isn’t enough [for] all the big programs the military has in its budget.” Growth areas for defense in the upcoming year will include restricted programs and the production ramp-up on the F-35 Triton and Global Hawk, Wesley Bush, chairman, president and CEO of Northrop Grumman, Falls Church, Virginia, told investors in late July. “These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in Aerospace Systems programs, such as NATO AGS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.” Affordability rules Because of the emphasis on budgets, the military will focus on finding “ways to increase the capability of platforms that already exist,” Starr says. “A classic example is the F-16 fighter, which has been around since the 1970s but it’s still in use, which is likely due to continually improving the capability of that airplane over time.” The effort to reduce costs also will have an effect on materials used. “Affordability is paramount, no matter what segment you are talking about,” Starr says. “There is a strong desire to try to find a way to wring costs out of both new development programs and programs that have been in production for decades. So defense contractors are under pressure, some of it self-imposed, to reduce material costs.” However, Captain says, lighter weight materials cannot compromise safety. “If it’s less safe and less reliable, it’s not going to be approved. Metals and alloy companies are working with certification authorities, as well their customers, to ensure that the lightweight materials that represent the next generation of material science are in fact as safe or safer but of course more lightweight and more fuel efficient.” There also will be a continued emphasis on communication, surveillance and reconnaissance technologies—“mission-related systems,” Starr says. “In the future, it’s been said that wars will not be fought with missiles and bullets but with ones and zeros—in other words, in cyberspace,” Captain says. He points out that in the next conflict, “we’ll certainly see more electronic defense weaponry, such as increased use of next-generation intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability as well as data analytics to support the third leg, which is precision strike. Precision strike will increasingly include electronic strike and that will include high-powered lasers as well as directed energy, in other words, microwaves. The first technologies are being proven out right now in the battle space but are not fully deployed in conflict quite yet.”  Editor's Choice Up to the task On the cusp Pure power Doubling down Durable beauty Most Viewed Alcoa Corp. launches as an independent industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products > Metals Service Center Institute and National Safety Council unveil partnership program > OMAX MicroMAX named finalist for prestigious R&D 100 Awards > Ampco-Pittsburgh announces acquisition of ASW Steel Inc. > Operational Excellence in Manufacturing 2016, December 6-7, 2016, Chicago > Copper Industry Sustainable Energy Director appointed to Federal Clean Energy Committee > Regional manufacturing centers boost high school completion rates > A veteran’s best friend > SSAB launches Docol (hot-rolled) steel, tailor made for chassis applications > Wismarq advances with strategic acquisition of Prior Coated Metals Inc. > LATEST ISSUE   November 2016 READY RESOURCE Service Center Metals produces billets to battle imports. > READ THIS MONTH'S ISSUE Instagram - @ModernMetalsMag Modern Metals on Twitter Tweets by @ModernMetalsMag Company Profiles COIL PROCESSING DEBURRING/FINISHING PLATE SERVICE CENTERS Butech Bliss Supermax Tools Peddinghaus Corp.

However, dividend stocks have recently been thrown out with the proverbial bath water as investors fear interest rate increases. A new Jefferies research note says that the 2016 Dogs of the Dow, which were the lowest priced, highest yielding stocks in the venerable index, are doing outstanding. What we found interesting is the companies that could very well be in that category next year. Four top Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks that all yield more than 3% are down so far in 2016 and may be outstanding buys at current levels. Boeing This top aerospace industrial is still down almost 8% since the beginning of the year, and it was removed from the Dividend Ruler portfolio. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services worldwide. Top analysts have noted that the commercial aerospace business is cyclical and there are some indications that airlines may have expanded their wide-body fleets too aggressively in recent years, suggesting a period of weaker demand going forward. In addition, the fall in oil prices reduces the incentive to upgrade to the most fuel-efficient planes. Boeing is launching refreshed versions of the 737 and the 777 in the next couple of years. New product introductions carry the risk of potential cost overruns. As a result, confidence in the dividend growth outlook has waned. Boeing shareholders receive a 3.27% dividend. The Wall Street consensus price target is $148.71. The stock closed most recently at $133.38. Coca-Cola This company remains a top Warren Buffet holding and offers not only safety, but an incredible strong worldwide brand. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is the world’s largest beverage company, refreshing consumers with more than 500 sparkling and still brands. Led by Coca-Cola, its portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade and Minute Maid. Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees and juices and juice drinks. Through the world’s largest beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy its beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. Despite reporting second-quarter earnings that came in above some estimates, slower growth and flat volumes brought out the sellers and they tagged Coke stock big time. It is important to remember though that the company owns 31.5% of Monster Beverage, which continues to deliver big numbers. Investors receive a 3.35% dividend. The consensus price target is $47.17, and the stock closed Thursday at $41.76. General Electric This iconic blue chip industrial was on a roll but has sold off 15% since July and is giving investors a nice entry point. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) is a highly diversified, global industrial corporation. Its businesses are organized broadly under six segments: GE Capital, Energy Infrastructure, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Home & Business Solutions. Its products and services include power generation equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives, medical equipment, appliances, commercial leasing and personal finance. Wall Street analysts feel that the American giant will be a large player in the efficient energy field. While the analysts recently lowered earnings expectations for the quarter slightly, they remain positive as expectations for orders and free cash flow already seem very low. They also note that the industrial giant has a massive $25 billion in cash, which could be put to use to drive earnings toward $2 a share by 2018. GE shareholders are paid a 3.3% dividend. The consensus price target is $33.13. The shares closed at $28.77. McDonald’s The fast-food giant has been hit hard since earnings were released, but it remains a solid pick for investors seeking dividends and a degree of safety. McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) is the world’s leading global foodservice retailer, with over 36,000 locations serving approximately 69 million customers in over 100 countries each day. More than 80% of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local business persons. The company reported solid second-quarter results, but the U.S. store comparable sales growth of just less than 2% disappointed investors. Merrill Lynch noted that charges and refranchising gains make the earnings numbers a bit dicey, so the firm lowered its GAAP numbers to $5.40 from $5.60. McDonald’s shareholders receive a 3.26% dividend. The consensus price objective is $128.33. The shares closed at $115.41.

Besides receiving a big check, Airbus gets to celebrate: This widebody jet is the 10,000th plane it has delivered. It’s an impressive milestone for a planemaker whose chief nemesis Boeing celebrated its 100th birthday this year. Airbus Industrie, a European consortium based in Toulouse, France, started bolting wings to engines in 1970, when Boeing was celebrating its 54th anniversary. It was formed because France, Germany, and initially, Britain wanted to beat those damn Yankees by developing their own “air bus” — a small, short-haul plane. Almost half a century on, Airbus rivals Boeing in marketshare, and deserves credit for some revolutionary innovations, including fly-by-wire and double-decker passenger jets. Here’s a look back at the trip so far. 01 It was a slow start. Airbus’ first plane, the A300, made its maiden flight in 1972. The first one entered service with Air France two years later, shuttling between Paris and London. It was the first twin-engine, wide body (with two aisles) aircraft in the world. Sales started slowly, particularly in the US, but picked up as the plane proved reliable and efficient. Its raised cabin floor allowed for extra cargo and helped make it the best selling freight aircraft, ever. Credit: Airbus Airbus' first plane, the A300, made its maiden flight in 1972.

Sales started slowly, particularly in the US, but picked up as the plane proved reliable and efficient. Its raised cabin floor allowed for extra cargo and helped make it the best selling freight aircraft, ever. 02 But Airbus dreamed big. Today, the Airbus range includes the A320, A330, A350 XWB, and A380. The A300-600 and A310 introduced electrical command of non-critical, secondary flight controls, like flaps, replacing the traditional cables and pulleys. The A320 took this a leap further with full fly-by-wire computer control, turning everything over to the electronics. That level of trust in computers was remarkable when the A320 launched in March 1984. Today, it’s standard—and even making its way into cars.   Credit: Airbus Today, the Airbus range includes the A320, A330, A350 XWB, and A380. The A300-600 and A310 introduced electrical command of non-critical, secondary flight controls, like flaps, replacing the traditional cables and pulleys.

By the late 1990s, Airbus had 16 manufacturing sites across Europe, collectively building over 200 planes per year and climbing. To move huge, semi-assembled airplane parts between them, Airbus needed an even huger plane, with a giant lift-up forehead to allow easy access. The A300-600 Super Transporter was quickly nicknamed the Beluga, and became everyone’s favorite, ridiculous, aircraft. Early next year an even bigger replacement will enter production. Five new transporter planes, based on the freighter version of Airbus’ A330-200,will be built. They’re officially named the BelugaXL.

Airbus’s boldest move has been the development of the gargantuan A380, a double-decker plane so big that airport infrastructure had to be redesigned to fit. When Airbus established a “large aircraft division” in 1996, the financial risks seemed worth it—taking lots of people lots of miles was the most lucrative part of the aircraft market. First flight was in 2005, followed by a series of exhaustive tests, like this cold soak in Canada, followed by polar Navigation studies. Slow sales have forced A380 production cutbacks, but Airbus still believes demand will grow, to service megacities with limited airport capacity.

Meanwhile, Airbus started production of an updated A330, in Toulouse, France, first joining wings to fuselage in September of this year. The A330neo (for new engine option) is designed to build on the success of the 20-year old A330, and rival Boeing’s 737MAX. New elements like “Sharklet” wingtips improve aerodynamics and reduce fuel consumption. Its medium range and medium size suit current demand from airlines.

The company’s 10,000th plane is an A350-900. The A350XWB (extra wide body) entered service in January 2015, with Qatar Airways. The extra width allows 10 seats per row in economy.

Airbus wants us to know it isn’t content to rest at 10,000.

Image: NASA Can We Get a Human to Mars by 2030? Written by Becky Ferreira and Ben Sullivan October 14, 2016 // 07:00 AM EST Copy This URL On Tuesday, President Obama wrote an op-ed for CNN outlining his vision to send humans to Mars within the next 14 years, in preparation for the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh on Thursday. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama said. “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way.” He’s not wrong; we are indeed on the brink of pioneering technologies that can deliver humans to Mars, and return them safely home again. Within the last few weeks, for instance, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled his company’s plans to develop a dazzling Interplanetary Transport System, powered by the largest rocket of all time, which could be ready to ferry astronauts to Mars as early as 2024, according to Musk. SpaceX’s ambitious plans have ignited a spirit of entrepreneurial rivalry with other private spaceflight companies. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg revealed his own company’s intentions of beating Musk to this milestone at the What’s Next? technology summit held last week in Chicago. “I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," Muilenburg said. But how realistic is the goal of reaching Mars on such a tight deadline? Motherboard's Ben Sullivan (who thinks it can be done) and Becky Ferreira (who thinks it can’t) discussed the invigorated race for Mars over Slack. BEN: Ok, so, what, you don’t think a human will set foot on Mars until the 2030s? BECKY: I think the 2030s is way too early to shoot for something as dangerous and complicated as a Mars mission for a few reasons. As Elon Musk laid out a couple weeks ago, carrying enough people to start a Mars colony while still having enough energy to arrive and land safely means building the largest rocket ever. Images: SpaceX BEN: Like what? I agree the Mars missions will be both dangerous and complicated, I just don’t see how Musk and others will be pushed back by a whole decade? Of course, I can totally believe NASA not getting there for ages... BECKY: Sure, well, there's the most self-explanatory reason of course—even though astronauts have been in the Mir/ISS for over a year, nobody knows what the medical risks of a multi-year trip to Mars would entail, even if there are no major accidents. But beyond medical/technical challenges, multiple lead-up missions would have to precede a human mission. Normally it takes five years to a decade to prep a Mars landing mission, let alone a sample return mission—which will have to be done at whatever Mars site is selected. I get that people are eager to take the next "giant leap" as Obama put it, but I think the Apollo comparison is harmful. Mars is not the Moon! Do you think Musk can make a human Mars mission happen within 14 years? What do you think NASA's role in that would be? BEN: Yep, you’re right about the medical risks. We wrote about the breakdown of cognitive abilities cosmic rays will have on astronauts just this week, but I don’t think it’s a problem that can’t be solved in just a few years. I mean, look at all this money private orgs like SpaceX are pumping into getting to the Red Planet. I honestly think SpaceX can make it happen within 14 years. That’s a lifetime with the pace of change happening in the private sector right now. SpaceX wasn’t even a company 14 years ago! And there’s going to be no shortage of human volunteers, either. I appreciate your argument is based on science and mine is very emotional… but just look plainly at the facts, we’re ready to go almost now. Musk’s plan isn’t even that extraordinary, there’s nothing crazy about it, right? BECKY: Great point about SpaceX not existing 14 years ago, which goes to show how much progress can be made in that period of time. However, as impressive as it is to build a spaceflight company from the ground-up, it's still a false equivalency to compare that to getting humans to Mars in the same timeframe. I suppose there's nothing inherently crazy about Musk's plan—except his deadline. He is proposing building the most powerful rocket of all time, the first long-duration interplanetary crewed spacecraft, and the infrastructure to mine in situ resources from the Martian surface within a decade and change. Even a company as innovative as SpaceX does not have the bandwidth to pull this off safely in time for the 2030s, and this isn't even getting into the legal issues of planetary protection. I do think those issues can be overcome, but it will take time and involvement from the entire global spaceflight community to do so. Summary of SpaceX’s Interplanetary Transport System concept. Video: SpaceX/YouTube As to your point about having an emotional angle on this, I feel ya. I want to see humans on Mars. But my preference would be a slow, safe, and incremental approach, a la Wernher von Braun's vision for spaceflight, rather than rushing into another space race that makes human life and safety secondary to symbolic victories BEN: Slow and steady wins the race, for sure. I guess it’s easy to think everything is sorted when all you have to worry about is rockets. Space is hard, but rocket science is easy, and building the ITS boosters won’t be too much of a problem, but yeah, Musk admittedly was rather scant on details when it came to health issues. And you’re right, it will take the full involvement of the global space community to overcome problems like radiation and the damaging effects of microgravity and weightlessness. I mean, NASA has made this area of research a priority, and I think SpaceX will rely on NASA a lot over the next decade or two in this department at least. And this deadline also relies on there being no problems with SpaceX’s Red Dragon mission in 2018, as part of its Space Act Agreement with NASA. The mission will analyse what will be needed to protect the Mars lander when it’s on the planet, and also make sure that the lander and humans won’t contaminate the planet in any harmful way. Funding is another hurdle. While I’m confident Musk can fund many aspects of the mission (he noted that it’s currently taking up less than five percent of SpaceX’s spending,) in his own words, “Ultimately, this is going to be a huge public-private partnership.” While SpaceX may be happy to send humans up in the 2020s and 2030s, the question is, will the ones who are paying for it be happy? READ MORE: Watch Elon Musk Explain How He Will Get Our Asses To Mars BECKY: Precisely, there will be so many hidden contingencies with a mission this ambitious and complicated, let alone the obstacles that we do know have to be overcome. The public-private partnership is one that I want to address: It's great that SpaceX and Boeing are shooting for Mars and I'm glad there are vocal proponents, like Musk, who are tackling these kinds of futurist goals. My worry is how much public money will be on the hook for this. A human Mars mission is estimated to cost upwards of $100 billion (though Musk has argued it can be much cheaper, of course). It would be a shame, in my opinion, if NASA's budget were steamrolled for several years by an endeavor this ambitious, edging out other robotic exploration missions that could be really useful (a Europa lander for instance). NASA's massive Space Launch System is currently under development by Boeing, and also would be the most powerful rocket ever built. Image: Boeing Also, I'd like to get your read on a broader note: I'm personally not sold on the idea of stoking another "space race," this time for Mars. During the Space Race 1.0., the US and USSR achieved great feats because of that rivalry, sure, but there were also a lot of tragedies as a result of the intense pace of the competition. Of course, there are thousands of volunteers who are willing to risk their lives for a chance to leave footprints on Mars, and they should be applauded. But every precaution should be made for their safety, and I'm not convinced that's possible by the 2030s, nor do I think "space races" provide a workable framework for sustainable colonization of the solar system over the long term. At some point, we have to be incentivized by something other that "oh no, my enemy is gonna get there first." BEN: Agreed, a Space Race 2.0 isn’t ideal but unless there’s some seismic shift in global relations I really don’t think that’s going to happen. The only race here is between private companies, and even then, they’re all going to have to help one another out. The technology needed to get humans to Mars will be the result of a multinational effort, as well as multicorporation (like my previous example of NASA’s role as more of a research incubator and advisor). The time is ripe for Mars. Everything’s fallen into place. We have the technology, we have the players, I think we have the consent of the public, and we also have persuasive reasons to go too, rather than political goals. Musk is a determined man, and I think the exponential growth of technology and ambition that he has ushered in will only continue until we have boots on the ground on Mars, and with the help of all the other agencies, this will no doubt happen during the 2030s at the latest. BECKY: Awesome, let's make this an official bet! If we've successfully sent humans to Mars by the 2030s, I'll owe you a really slick Saturn V model or something. I kind of love my position here because if we don't make it within 20ish years, I win, but if we do make it, the human species as a whole wins. I like those odds. Want to weigh in on the debate?

(Boeing) Related Stories Canada's CF-18s wearing out as rivals spar over replacement benefits Defence minister going back to drawing board on fighter jets, launching consultations In a study paid for by the company itself, Boeing found it contributes more than $3 billion US to the Canadian economy every year, the aircraft manufacturer announced Thursday. The analysis, done by Doyletech Corporation and commissioned by Boeing, concluded the massive manufacturer supports more than 17,000 jobs across Canada and contributes nearly $4 billion Cdn to the Canadian economy directly and indirectly. "This study helps to quantify Boeing's impact for Canadian industry," said Maria Lane, Defense Space & Security vice president of International Strategic Partnerships in a release. "Looking ahead, we are committed to growing our partnership with Canada, supporting local jobs and growth across the country." The analysis also says that Boeing's spending in Canada is growing at eight per cent — double the national growth rate of 4 per cent — and the company is contributing $10 million US to science, technology, economic evolution and growth. Harjit Sajjan going back to drawing board on fighter jets, launching consultations CF-18 airframes approaching their age limits as replacement debate rages The study is part of Boeing's larger "industrial engagement plan," the release states, related to its bid to sell several dozen fighter jets to the Canadian government. Boeing is vying with Lockheed Martin for the sale, offering up its own F/A-18 Super Hornet against the competitor's F-35 jets. Take numbers with a grain of salt, prof says Barry Prentice, a professor at the University of Manitoba's Asper School of Business, said the $3 billion USD figure could be "misleading." The number includes direct and indirect impact, and Prentice said that means the total factors in lots of money and jobs Boeing can't claim sole responsibility, including cash spent by employees and the price of raw materials the company didn't produce. "These sorts of numbers have to be taken with a real grain of salt," he said. Prentice said companies release economic impact studies from time to time to remind government and the public of their role in the economy. "It's always a threat the company can use to try and lever the sale of its goods to the government," he said. Boeing reportedly cutting up to 10% of workforce Boeing says it could end 747 production The report comes after media reports earlier this year that the company is facing hard times. In March, the Seattle Times reported the manufacturer was preparing to eliminate up to 10 per cent of its workforce, and in July, Boeing announced it might have to halt production of its 747 aircraft. Prentice said that's a symptom of a general decline in aviation markets, in part thanks to lagging demand from big buyers like the American military. Boeing's manufacturer in Winnipeg is one of the largest aerospace composite manufacturers in Canada, the company says, employing more than 1,400 people in the city.

Rama Rao commenced his week-long tour of the US to attract investment in Telangana, meeting industry leaders and Acting Ambassador of India in US Taranjit Singh Sandhu at Washington DC on Thursday. The newly appointed Consul-General of US in Hyderabad Katherine B. Hadda called on the Minister and apprised him of her priorities when she took charge. The President of Boeing International Bertrand-Marc Allen also called on Mr. Rao to discuss the current status of Boeing’s engagement in the Aerospace city in Hyderabad, a release said. Mr. Rao shared the Telangana government’s vision to curb industrial pollution when he met a team from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The agency representatives felt that plans for Hyderabad Pharma City exceeded the standards of the agency in many ways, the release added. The Minister related the efforts of the State government to relocate industries outside the Outer Ring Road in Hyderabad with the objective of making Hyderabad greener and less polluted. Mr. Rao addressed leaders from PhRMA - Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a group of leading innovative bio-pharmaceutical research companies of the US. He met a delegation of AES Corporation and discussed the possibility of investment in the State in the solar power sector. A team of Cleveland Motorcycle Works was requested to set up a manufacturing unit in Telangana. The Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2017 in India was discussed at a meeting with the Director of the Global Entrepreneurship Programme in the US government. Mr. Rao said the Telangana government was keen on hosting the summit if the Indian government selected Hyderabad as the venue. More In: Hyderabad Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

Plus, Qatar's Boeing spree. 15 Oct 2016 15:47 GMT Business & Economy, Science & Technology, South Korea With Samsung's formal recall of the Galaxy Note 7 amidst news of the mobile phone model spontaneously catching fire and injuring some users, flight bans due to the same and third quarter profits slashed, can the popular consumer brand recover from one of the worst spots in its history? We do expect at Brand Finance a significant hit to Samsung's brand strength and brand value in the short term. Robert Haigh, director of marketing, Brand Finance As rival Apple enjoys a 10-month stock high, Samsung also has billions of its share price being knocked off to contend with and a reputation crisis to manage.  In Seoul, Samsung's home, consumers are in two minds. Some believe it is the urge to produce at an unrelenting rate which has caused Samsung's current predicament. Others believe this is only a bump in the road for the conglomerate, and handled the right way, could soon be a thing of the past. With its revenues equivalent to a fifth of the South Korean economy, this could easily be the case.  But has the company done enough to minimise reputation damage and has there been enough transparency about the faulty phone model to encourage consumers to trust in Samsung once again? Some analysts question the lack of publicity in that regard. "In terms of a public engagement point of view, there are certainly lessons that Samsung can learn," says Robert Haigh, director of marketing at Brand Finance, a brand valuation consultancy based in London. "The idea that they've 'hidden' this is perhaps an overstatement, but certainly the idea that they haven't communicated enough is a fair criticism. They probably will suffer somewhat in terms of consumer trust as a result of that." There is also the question of new customers and whether Samsung will be able to grow its market share, considering consumer brand loyalties to other brands in combination with this recent blunder.  "There will be a very significant problem with market share in the short-term," continues Haigh, "but the truth is in western mature markets, there is already a very high saturation of smartphones, so there is limited scope for the attraction of new customers".

All this growth has, however, led to a different set of problems, including network congestion and quality of service. Fines and sanctions on operators have left the country in a flurry of network improvement tasks.

Qatar Airways Boeing shopping spree: Last week, Qatar Airways spent $18.6bn on up to 100 new planes. This comes as part of the airlines' continuous expansion which has seen the fleet increase from four to 188 planes in the last two decades alone. The airlines also flies to 150 destinations and has made an estimated $9.8bn in revenue last year in due course. It is also the world's third-largest air cargo operator.  Akbar Al Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways, spoke to us after the Boeing announcement about the Open Skies agreement, the Airbus delayed delivery debacle and the new cap on aviation emissions.  Sweet taxes: The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries this week to impose taxes on sugary drinks as a means to combat the increasingly alarming obesity crisis. However, with giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi making backhanded moves to protect themselves, such as millions of dollars of donations to health organisations, the route to a healthier diet is a lot more complicated than previously thought.  Source: Al Jazeera Tell us what you think Related Report: Samsung endangered workers health in S Korea Court documents show the electronics giant kept information on chemicals from workers for fear of exposing trade secrets Human Rights, Labour, South Korea, Asia Pacific On board the Boeing 787 Dreamliner CTC gives you an idea of what flying on the new carbon-composite, more environmentally-friendly plane will be like.

But innovation at Boeing will be “disciplined” and not endanger the future of the world’s biggest plane maker, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told reporters at an event marking the company’s founding on July 15, 1916. The enterprise established by William Boeing in a Seattle boathouse has faced numerous “bet the company” moments over its 10 decades to bring out new planes such as the 707 and 747. “We have won for 100 years because of innovation,” Muilenburg said. “The key is disciplined innovation. We’ll take risks. We’ll invest smartly.” Chicago-based Boeing has managed to stay ahead of European rival Airbus in plane production and is a major defense and space contractor, producing fighter jets, aerial refueling tankers, communications satellites and rockets. The company is exploring the possibilities of commercial supersonic and hypersonic planes, Muilenburg said. It also is at work on a manned mission to Mars. Though those are perhaps many decades away, “I’m anticipating that person will be riding on a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said. More immediately, Boeing is pressing for licenses to conclude sales of 109 aircraft to Iran, including leased jets, despite opposition from some in Congress. “This is a significant opportunity,” he said. “It does represent significant U.S. manufacturing jobs.” The company also is still working on plans for a so-called “middle of the market” aircraft that could fill a gap in its product line between the 737 and the 787. Muilenburg said it might use “existing products, derivatives of existing products or an all new airplane” to fill the gap. “If it’s an all new airplane, we think that would probably be in the 2024-2025 time frame in terms of when it would be introduced into service,” he said. Muilenburg spoke with reporters at the beginning of a celebratory weekend of events for an estimated 100,000 employees, families and retirees at Boeing Field in Seattle. Muilenburg said Boeing is arguably stronger now than at any point in its 100-year history. It has a backlog of 5,700 plane orders, enough to keep its factories humming for six or seven years. Beyond filling those orders, it aims to “sharpen and accelerate” its innovation, in plane design in the factory and services. This includes “second-century design in manufacturing, automation, 3-D printing, additive manufacturing,” he said. “Even though we’re arguably the best aerospace company in the world today, we have to continue to invest in innovation,” he said.— Reuters Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleHashoo Foundation committed to youth empowerment Next articleAttempted Turkey coup may imperil region’s crude transport Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Economy Watch Bahria Town, Hyatt Hotels sign agreement for 4 signature resort properties in Pakistan Economy Watch Dar urges SECP to create cell of experts to provide guidance on Companies Ordinance Economy Watch Dream of game-changer CPEC materialised Digital Newspaper Social Diary Oil & Gas Leap Forward Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: .....

He'll be replaced by senior vice president Ihssane Mounir, who leads the planemaker's sales team in northeastern Asia, Boeing commercial airplane chief Ray Conner said in an email to employees late Thursday. Mounir's current portfolio includes China, one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world. Mounir takes over as Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus contend with slowing commercial jet sales after more than a decade of rapid expansion that left the plane maker with record order backlogs. Wojick "has consistently demonstrated the integrity, tenacity, courage and commitment it takes to compete aggressively and win in the marketplace," Conner wrote. He said Mounir's "extensive knowledge of our products and services puts him in the best position to help our customers address their fleet and operational needs." Wojick helped make the 737 Max the best-selling new airplane model in Boeing's 100-year history, although it still trails Airbus's upgraded A320neo family, which benefited from an earlier market debut. Wojick also landed the largest sale in U.S. aviation history: Emirates Airline's $76 billion order for 150 of Boeing's 777X jetliners in 2013. He joined Boeing in 1980 as an aerospace engineer before earning an MBA from the University of Colorado in 1985. Wojick held a variety of positions within Boeing's sales organization, overseeing its marketing in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, India and elsewhere before succeeding Conner as senior vice president for global sales and marketing in August 2012. He holds a private pilot's license and is the son of a U.S. Air Force and United Airlines pilot. Mounir's promotion caps a rapid rise at Boeing, which he joined in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer. The Moroccan native didn't speak English when he arrived alone in the U.S. at age 17, according to a 2014 profile in the Seattle Times. After landing a conditional acceptance to Wichita State University to study aerospace engineering, Mounir, who is fluent in Arabic, French and Spanish, immediately enrolled in language school. Since 2011, Mounir has dueled with Airbus in China, which is spending heavily on aviation infrastructure and aircraft. His replacement will be announced later, Conner said. "My goal is to beat Airbus in China every year," Mounir told Bloomberg Television, adding that he wasn't content with a 50-50 split of the market. "My goal is to go all the way."

Then check out Verizon Communications, Terra Nitrogen Company LP, and Boeing Co. Tyler Crowe (TMFDirtyBird) Oct 14, 2016 at 9:34AM Image source: Getty Images. I won't say that investing in dividend stocks is the only way to build wealth in the stock market, but it is a pretty good way to do it. For investors out there who have a very, very long investment time horizon, buying, holding, and letting dividends reinvest themselves can create significant gains. If you are looking for some solid dividend investments that fit a buy-and-hold mentality, maybe you should check out Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Terra Nitrogen Company LP (NYSE:TNH), and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Here's a quick rundown of each of these stocks and why it could make for a compelling long-term dividend investment.  Delivering data and dividends Let's face it, data, and the need to access it at any given moment, has solidly entrenched itself into our lives. Between increased use of data on smartphones and other mobile devices, and cord-cutters relying more on their internet connections for entertainment than on traditional TV packages, there is still an immense opportunity for even the largest communications providers. When a company has the pricing power that Verizon Communications sports, it can make for an extremely compelling investment. Despite the fact that some of Verizon's smaller wireless competitors are starting to offer incentives such as unlimited data plans, Verizon continues to have the lowest churn rate among all the major wireless carriers. This kind of sticky business model, combined with its even stickier wired FiOS business, has been a major factor in making Verizon a cash cow. Last quarter alone, the company generated $5.4 billion in cash from operations. It's not exactly cheap to remain the top communications provider in the U.S., however: The company has spent more than $7 billion in the first half of 2016 on capital expenditures.  Having the ability to spend that much on its network, though, is what makes Verizon a compelling investment for the years to come. It's extremely unlikely that data usage would go down, and a robust network infrastructure coupled with strong pricing power should give Verizon a major growth platform for several years to come and further support its dividend that yields 4.6% today. If you only want a dividend If you are interested in just dividends and aren't concerned with rapid dividend growth, then perhaps it's worth taking a look at Terra Nitrogen Company. It consists entirely of one nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility, so there isn't much growth baked into the investment thesis for this company. What makes it compelling, though, is its ability to generate lots of cash that it pays out to its unitholders.  There are two things that work in Terra Nitrogen's favor in this regard. One is that the company is one of the lowest-cost producers of nitrogen fertilizers. Even though fertilizer prices are at their lowest level in a decade, Terra Nitrogen is still generating a 56% gross margin on its combined ammonia and urea sales. This advantage should work in its favor as many more-expensive fertilizer producers get squeezed out of the market.  The other big advantage is the way the business is structured. It's a variable-rate master limited partnership, so it pays out all available cash at the end of each quarter. With no long-term debt on the books, all of the cash generated each quarter goes toward some small maintenance capital needs or into investors' pockets. With such a high yield and little in terms of production growth in the future, all of the gains on an investment in Terra Nitrogen will come from those quarterly distributions. With a yield today of 9.1% and a good chance that prices of nitrogen-based fertilizers will rise over time, Terra Nitrogen looks to be a compelling dividend investment.  A payout that still has a chance to soar Two big knocks on Boeing today are that total commercial aircraft orders may not be as robust as they have been over the past couple of years and that some of the aircraft maker's most profitable plans over the years -- most notably the 777 -- are in a decline that its expensive 787 Dreamliner will have to make up for. Based on these two points, you can see why some investors might be concerned. If you look beyond these factors, though, there are reasons to believe that this company still has plenty of opportunities to grow its bottom line and payout to shareholders. Let's start with orders for new planes drying up. That is certainly true, especially in the case for older planes such as the 747. One look at the company's current backlog, though, and you can see that Boeing has plenty of work ahead of it over the years that it can handle a decline in orders for a while. Its backlog for the 737 alone is enough for the company to grow its production from 42 planes a month today to 57 planes a month in 2019 and still have plenty of work left over. It also helps that over this time frame, its 787 Dreamliner will increase production and start to recover the cash losses from its earlier deliveries. These two drivers should help to more than make up for the declines in its other planes and will even give the company a cushion until it starts delivering its 777 replacement, the 777X.  This gives the company a runway of more than half a decade. By then, it's not hard to imagine another wave of plane orders coming in. In the meantime, those fulfilled orders will generate loads of cash that will give Boeing the ability to grow its already impressive payout that yields 3.2% today.  Tyler Crowe owns shares of Terra Nitrogen.

Monday, 14 November 2016 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview US, Japanese Banks to Fund Boeing Sales to Iran News ID: 1211744 Service: Economy October, 14, 2016 - 17:44 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – US plane manufacturer Boeing has reached an agreement with an American bank to provide financing for Iran’s purchase of airliners in cooperation with a Japanese bank, an informed source announced. The informed source at Iran’s government said according to an agreement between Boeing and a US bank, the purchase of the civil aircraft will be financed via a Japanese bank. The comments came after the US decided in September to remove a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers to sell planes to Iran under contracts signed after coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the group of six countries. In January, Iran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. The contract was signed during the visit to Paris by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. Iran also sealed a deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes.

Hyderabad: Low frills carrier SpiceJet today said it is planning to add about three Bombardiers and 4 to 5 Boeings by the end of the current fiscal as it wants to increase its daily flights by 10 per cent and also introduce new international destinations. "We have 17 planes for regional connectivity. Spicejet is a major player in regional connectivity space. Few weeks back, we have added three Bombardiers. We will be adding three more in the current financial year," Ajay Singh CMD of SpiceJet told reporters on the sidelines of a Ficci Ladies Organisation programme here today. "We will be adding 4 or 5 aircraft this year. They will mostly be Boeings," he said. Currently, SpiceJet is having a fleet of 43 aircraft operating 320 flights a day. Replying to a query, Singh said within next few weeks they will be adding 2 to 3 international destinations. Currently, it operates to six countries. "We are flying to six countries as of now. We are looking at more options. In the next few weeks, we will announce some more routes. We will be announcing two to three destinations more. Our strategy is to operate in 4 hour-window journey," he said. On its proposed order, the CMD said they are talking to both Airbus and Boeing for placing an order of over 100 aircraft. The deal will be finalised in a month, he said, adding that the whole order will either go to Boeing or Airbus. "We are going to finalise in a month. It will be either Boeing or Airbus. We will not be rushed into a decision. It will not be mix of both. It has to be done at right price. So, we have to be very careful. We have closed many issues related to aircraft purchase. It could be more than 100 aircraft," he said. He said the budget airline is also mulling to operate flights from Hyderabad to Tier-II cities like Nagpur, Calicut and Bhubaneswar. The Airline has continuously been making profits for the few quarters on the back of operational efficiency, he claimed.

By Mary-Ann Russon October 14, 2016 12:59 BST Close Embed Feed EmDrive Exclusive: Roger Shawyer confirms MoD and DoD are interested in controversial space propulsion tech IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/21144" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> EmDrive inventor Roger Shawyer has confirmed that the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the US Department of Defense (DoD) are both interested in the controversial space propulsion technology, in an exclusive new interview with IBTimes UK. "Yes, the UK MoD and the US DoD are interested in EmDrive. It would clearly be useful for any intelligence-gathering platform. It provides good manoeuvrability and stealth orbits to be maintained... clearly EmDrive has no exhaust signature and is very stealthy," said Shawyer. While he cannot say much on this topic, Shawyer indicated that the EmDrive's controversial reputation and ridicule on the internet serves a key purpose for the UK and US military – if it is actually possible to create a propellant-less rocket engine, then this would be really useful in spy satellites, as it would enable the military to get close to a target without anyone knowing it was there. Shawyer, 69, is a certified chartered electrical engineer who spent 40 years working in the space and defence industry on UK government defence contracts, primarily for BAE Systems and Matra Marconi Space (MMS, now Airbus). During his career, he was a senior engineer and project manager for multiple satellite contracts including the Skynet 4 military satellite, the NATO-4 satellite serving Nato and the British Ministry of Defence, and the French Euteselat Hot Bird TV broadcast satellite. Shawyer explains that he was inspired to use a gyroscope to create an electromagnetic thruster after watching Professor Eric Laithwaite's 1974 Christmas lecture at the Royal Institution. He experimented with the concept in the 1980s in his garage and then told his employers at MMS, but his idea was rejected outright – and was told that his career would suffer if he mentioned it again. Eventually he was told MMS was unwilling to consider any new propulsion concepts for another decade due to the firm's investment into the Arianne 5 heavy lift launch vehicle, and so in 2001 Shawyer left MMS and decided to go it alone, setting up Satellite Propulsion Research Ltd (SPR). Interest from the UK government, US Air Force, Nasa and Darpa The full uncut version of the EmDrive video interview with Roger Shawyer, which is 20 minutes long and explores his life and other interesting facts about the EmDrive story SPR was awarded a grant from the UK government to continue to research the EmDrive for five years from its beginnings as a feasibility study, right up through the first experimental thruster and to the eventual demonstrator engine, which produced up to 8g of thrust. And despite the furore of the New Scientist article in September 2006, which saw a huge backlash from members of the public as well as academics in the international space community, and the fact that a group of naysayers persuaded a British MP to ask in Parliamentary Questions why the EmDrive was being funded, the UK government continued to fund the research until its completion in 2007. There was also a huge interest in the technology in the US – in 2008, Shawyer was invited to the Pentagon to make a high level presentation on the EmDrive technology to members of the US Air Force, Nasa and Darpa, and following this presentation, Boeing stepped in and asked to licence the technology. "The UK MoD agreed to an export licence, and we designed, built and tested a Flight Thruster for use on a test satellite. The thruster gave 18 grams of thrust," said Shawyer. "All design data was transferred to Boeing and the contract was completed by July 2010. We waited for them to sign the licence agreement, which had been prepared by Boeing's lawyers and agreed by SPR. However, once we confirmed the test data it all suddenly went quiet, and we have heard no more from Boeing since then." Working with Gilo Industries Shawyer has continued to develop the EmDrive, and over the last year began hinting that he is working with an unnamed UK aerospace company on a second generation superconducting thruster that will produce thrust many orders of magnitude greater than that observed by Eagleworks or any other laboratory (view his latest patent application here). However, he has confirmed that the company he is working with is none other than Gilo Industries Group, the inventors of the personal aviation paramotor vehicle Parajet Skycar, which famously flew TV survivalist Bear Grylls close to Mount Everest in 2007 and is now being developed as an all-terrain flying car. "Gilo Cardozo approached me. I confirm that we are in a joint venture. Universal Propulsion is the name of the joint venture and it's located in Dorset," said Shawyer. "It's a very innovative, modern young company. He has an excellent track record. He employs professional scientists and engineers who reviewed the science of the EmDrive. Like many people who don't say much, these guys go through it very carefully. Gilo has the engineering expertise and resources to do this, so it's a good match between us." Shawyer says that he's not interested in fame the way entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are, but he never expected to receive the amount of personal abuse he was subjected to for a mere invention. "Some insults still appear on forums, but I have got immune to it now. There are some very strange people out there on the internet," he said, emphasising that he intends to keep going with developing the EmDrive so it can be used in flying cars and to make low cost access to space possible. "I don't think engineers become superstars, particularly not in the UK. We just quietly get on, having fun and enjoying our job, whilst trying to make the world a safer and better place."

Photos by Katherine Frey/The Washington Post   Matt and Ann MacPhail built a state-of-the-art recording studio in their home basement in Arlington, Virginia.; they call it Undisclosed Location Studios.   Matt and Ann MacPhail pose with their piano in their living room, which also can be used for recording.   Guitars hang on one wall of the studio.   By Michele Lerner Special to The Washington Post Washington, D.C., and its suburbs are well known as a setting for spies, clandestine meetings and hidden safe rooms for the powerful, and now a new secret has been revealed: Undisclosed Location Studios, a state-of-the-art recording studio, is hiding in an Arlington, Virginia, basement. "We can't claim to have invented the joke about being in an undisclosed location, but we like the tongue-in-cheek reference to being near D.C. and the Pentagon and at the same time to refer to the fact that no one can drive by our house and know that it has a recording studio inside," says Matt MacPhail, who owns News at Eleven Productions, an audio-production business, with his wife, Ann MacPhail. The MacPhails' Queen Anne-style Victorian home, designed to fit in with the neighborhood and reminiscent of nearby Victorian homes, includes a home theater for professional and personal use as well as a recording studio with a control room and three isolation booths, all completely invisible to outsiders. While that invisibility is intentional, it deprives local residents of being able to point to the new cool thing in the neighborhood: a studio designed by the architect who designed Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, which was pioneering as a musician-owned recording studio. "Recording studios in homes have become pretty common since digitalization allows equipment to be less expensive and smaller," says John Storyk, founding partner of WSDG-Walters-Storyk Design Group in Highland, New York. "While there are thousands of them across the country now, very few are at the professional level of the MacPhails' studio." Storyk says the acoustical accuracy of the MacPhails' studio is exceptional. The couple have always had some type of recording system in their home and have been producing music and voice-overs for nearly 20 years. "Matt and I met in 1996 as founding members of the SoCal Vocals, a rock a cappella group at the University of Southern California," Ann MacPhail says. "They are the only four-time champions of the ICCA [International Collegiate Championship of A Cappella]. The experience of recording an album with the SoCal Vocals sparked our interest in audio production." Among the MacPhails' clients are IBM, MasterCard, Boeing and Bank of the West. "A big part of our business now is audio for video, so it helps to have the home theater connected to the recording studio when we work on sound design for a documentary or narrate an employee safety video for Boeing," Ann MacPhail says. While none of that sounds quite as cool as recording Hendrix or jamming with the Rolling Stones, some of the essential elements of the recording-studio design are the same for Hendrix and the MacPhails, including fully decoupled, room-within-a-room construction and a custom-designed ceiling with varied heights. One of the innovations of Electric Lady Studios was the use of lighting for mood in keeping with the psychedelia in which Hendrix was interested and to make the studio feel less sterile and closer to the live experience for performers. That recording studio, like the MacPhails' and most other studios today, was intended to encourage creativity and artistry. "The democratization of recording studios means that artists have more control over their own work," Matt MacPhail says. "Hendrix was one of the first artists to own his own creative space, but there are challenges in designing a recording studio. Acoustic isolation requires a tight seal, so you can't always get the ventilation you need. Now we have ventilation, and even if we turn on the air conditioning, it's quiet enough that we don't pick up any sound on our recordings." The subbasement includes a studio reception room for clients, the isolation booths and control room, along with an elevator and stairs to the basement level, which has a separate entry for clients, a full bathroom and the theater. "Because this is our house as well as our workspace, we worked with the designer to have two entrances into the theater, so that clients never have to walk through the residential part of the house," Ann says. In addition to the theater, the basement level has family spaces, including a recreation room, access to the garage, storage closets and another full bathroom. The entire house has approximately 5,400 finished square feet, with purely residential functions on the first and second floors. Getting started Matt MacPhail attended Georgetown University and worked at WETA-FM for a few years and always intended to return to the D.C. area after graduate school in California. The couple decided to relocate to the region a few years ago to be close to friends and to raise their children, Gabriel, 12, and Lucas, 10, here. The couple spent seven months searching for an appropriate site for their home. They have lived in it for about four years but only recently have rededicated their time to their recording business. "Our focus was first on the residential aspect of our home and second on the studio, but from the very beginning, we worked with the recording-studio designers and our architects to make sure everything worked together," Matt says. In their previous home, Ann says, clients had to step over the toys and walk through the kitchen to get to the professional area, so the couple planned for a dedicated entrance for when clients occasionally came to the studio. "We wanted a theater but weren't sure whether it was family space or professional space," Ann says. "It's actually worked out to be both. We use it for work, but we also had 'Downton Abbey' watch parties and [watched] the Olympics with our sons. It's a fun social space." The MacPhails enjoy playing music and singing with friends in their great room, which has space for a grand piano. The great room has been designed for enhanced acoustics and has microphone and data lines linked to the recording studio in case the MacPhails want to record the spontaneity. "We've enjoyed entertaining in the house because the open floor plan makes it so easy," Ann says. "We held a '70s-themed fundraiser for our kids' school and even set up a 'Not-So-Newlywed' game with Matt dressed up like Bob Eubanks, and [had] a disco ball and laser lights. The next year, we had an '80s fundraiser, and Matt built a console with working buttons to replicate 'Family Feud.' He dressed up like Richard Dawson for that one." The MacPhail boys enjoy using the recording studio equipment for karaoke, and the couple donated a two-hour recording studio session as an auction item for a fundraiser. "We love using our space for community-building events and love that this is such a socially active neighborhood," Ann says. Design team The MacPhails' residential architects, John and Marilyn Burroughs, principals of New Leaf Collaborative Architecture and Design in Ashburn, Virginia., collaborated closely with Storyk and his team from the very beginning of the project. "Getting in on the master planning level helped make this a success," Storyk says. "We did the architectural design for the basement and subbasement, but the challenge here was that it's a very tight site. We had to piggyback the studio and the home theater and the multipurpose space on top of each other." The MacPhails wanted three small isolation booths, so that was another challenge, says Storyk, who says it's easier to control sound in a bigger room than in the series of smaller rooms. Storyk says that while being underground helps maintain acoustic isolation, not all recording studios are in basements. "People want privacy, but they also want sunlight, and we can easily use glass to create sound isolation," Storyk says. "But daylight isn't an asset for a professional theater, so it was easier to design that underground." Storyk says Matt is an expert in lighting design, so he created a low-voltage LED lighting system that can be adjusted and programmed. The lighting can be set to automatically mimic the time of day. "We deliberately designed the architecture of the studio and home theater to be different from the rest of the house, to be more neutral, since these are professional work spaces," Storyk says. Ann had photos and ideas of what she wanted, with a definite desire for a Victorian house with a front porch on the outside but a modern feel inside, Marilyn Burroughs says. "The exposed beam ceiling, arches and traditional cabinets in the kitchen warm up the contemporary open floor plan," she says. The most dramatic feature of the residential portion of the building is the great room, which the Burroughses designed with a 22-foot-high vaulted ceiling similar to a church nave. "I literally drew what I wanted on a napkin for the great room, and it came out even better than expected," Ann says. "I wanted to be able to see everyone from the kitchen, but I also wanted the space to be both elegant and warm." The ceiling has exposed timber trusses, and the room has a sliding glass "NanaWall" partition to separate it from the kitchen, which is open to a dining alcove in a bay window. Outside the kitchen and dining area is a screened porch. "Ann wanted the great room to be capable for making recordings, but she still wanted the open floor plan for entertaining, so the NanaWall was perfect for that," Marilyn Burroughs says. The first floor also has a guest bedroom and bathroom with universal design features such as a curb-less shower, which John Burroughs refers to as the "backup master suite" in case one of the residents needs to live on one level. This level also has an office with a storage closet. An elevator reaches all four levels of the home -- from the subbasement to the bedroom level on the second floor. The second floor has a master suite with a balcony, a walk-in closet and private bathroom; two more bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet and private full bathroom, and a laundry room. Efficient focus While the MacPhails' priorities included comfortable living space for their family, room to entertain and space for their business, they also were committed to using sustainable, efficient building techniques. They recycled every part of the house that had been on the lot before theirs. "The MacPhails wanted to do the right thing throughout the project and to have a minimal impact on the environment," John Burroughs says. The home has two cisterns to collect rain water and to collect water from the sump pump. "We have a rain garden and permeable pavers to help us conserve water," Matt says. "We use the water from our cisterns for landscaping, and we hope to use it as gray water in our home in the future." The home was designed to maximize the benefits of a tighter envelope and insulation and natural light. Solar panels generate electricity on-site, and a separate solar hot-water system provides radiant floor heating as well as for domestic use. Energy-efficient appliances and systems are in place, and the whole home is controlled by a smart home-management system. Working with professional architects for each of the dual purposes of their home resulted in the MacPhails' getting exactly what they wanted: a family-oriented home in a friendly neighborhood along with a secret, high-caliber recording studio so they can seamlessly move between their private and professional lives.

WALLOPS ISLAND (USA), (Sputnik) — General Director Igor Arbuzov told RIA Novosti on Friday the first unmanned test launch of the heavy-lift Atlas V vehicle with Boeing's Crew Transportation System (CTS) capsule is expected in 2017. The Atlas V CST's manned test launch is expected in 2018, he added. "The crew had already been selected and is being trained. It was determined that the Atlas V manned program will be implemented using the Russian RD-180 engines," Arbuzov said. He pointed out that the RD-180's and Atlas V's tried and tested performance gives confidence that manned launches could take place within specific time frames. "Moreover, one can say with confidence that no other engine in the world except the RD-180 is ready for manned launches as part of the Atlas V rocket," the Energomash director stressed. US Launch Operator to Buy 10-20 Russian RD-180 Space Rocket Engines © Photo: Pixabay Next Small Step & Giant Leap: United States to Send Humans to Mars by 2030The United Launch Alliance (ULA) operator plans to purchase 10-20 of Russia's RD-180 space rocket engines, the Energomash space and rocket engine director said. Arbuzov expressed confidence to RIA Novosti that the new contract could be signed after the November 8 presidential elections in the United States. "Not only do I expected it, but I am certain that this will happen. Even the currently available supply of Russian engines in the US does not fully meet its needs under the developing 2020-2023 program," Arbuzov said. © Flickr/ Official U.S. Navy Page Dropping Russia's RD-180 Engines is Like 'Burning $100 Mln for Fun'Washington itself concedes that its gradual transformation from the Atlas V launcher to the Vulcan vehicle using the domestically produced BE-4 engines could stretch into 2024, he added. Asked if ULA had made a commercial offer for the RD-180 engines, Arbuzov said he discussed it with the joint venture's CEO Tory Bruno, who he said had made "optimistic statements" about the purchase. Russian Space Bureau to Deliver 14 RD-181 Rocket Engines to US Manufacturer in 2017-18 Energomash will deliver 14 RD-181 engines to the US Orbital ATK aerospace and defense industry company over the next two years, Arbuzov said. "According to the signed contract, we are required to deliver 14 engines from 2017 to 2018. I do not think there will be any replacements in favor of other engines, the time for experiments has expired and no alternatives have been found," he told RIA Novosti. Orbital ATK's Antares vehicle equipped with two RD-181 first stage engines is expected to send the Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station on October 16 after numerous delays. ...

It's designed to shoot a laser beam, which then heats up the drone until it explodes or crashes.  And the only ammunition it needs is energy, meaning that as long as it has power, it can fire.  According to Boeing's Jim Leary, it's one of the neatest parts of the system.  "Having a penny per shot system to take down these cheap drones being proliferated is really he most economical way for the US military to defend itself", he said.  other similar systems have been deployed already by the military, but Col. Dorrian wouldn't go into specifics.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily! Your notification has been saved. There was a problem saving your notification.

Liftoff is scheduled for 8:03 p.m. Sunday. The mission seeks to put the state-owned launch pad back into business. It's been idle since the 2014 rocket explosion that caused about US$15 million in damage. The Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority owns and operates the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on an island that NASA uses to launch small research rockets. Most of those launches are suborbital, and they've continued. Orbital and SpaceX are the two private companies that NASA has hired to keep the space station stocked. As Orbital returns to the repaired launch pad, some industry observers are still waiting to see if the private company model will succeed in the long run. “Unless Congress is willing to spend a lot more money on NASA, this is what we have to work with,” said Marco Caceras, senior analyst and director of space studies at the think tank Teal Group. SpaceX and Boeing are supposed to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next year or two. In the meantime, the United States is relying on Russia to get astronauts there. NASA began investing in private companies for space station missions after President George W. Bush announced the space shuttle would retire (the last flight was in 2011). The agency needed to refocus its efforts on bigger missions, such as sending humans to Mars, so it turned to private industry. The agency spent nearly US$800 million to help SpaceX and Orbital develop launch systems, less than half of each project's cost. Now it is paying the two companies billions to ship cargo to the space station. Since 2012, Space X and Orbital have shipped food, equipment and scientific experiments on 12 successful missions. Two have failed. Orbital lost its rocket and NASA cargo shortly after liftoff from Wallops on Oct. 28, 2014. A liquid oxygen turbo pump caught fire in a decades-old Russian engine, according to a NASA investigation. Since then, Orbital has fulfilled its contract by launching from Cape Canaveral using another company's rocket. “Orbital ATK has conducted two resupply missions using our Cygnus spacecraft aboard an Atlas V (rocket) in December 2015 and March 2016 in order to continue to support NASA space station operations while we worked to put Antares back into service,” said Orbital spokeswoman Trina Helquist.

Speaking to reporters at the Young FICCI Ladies Organisation (YLFO) SpiceJet's chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said, "We are going to finalise the deal in a month or so." The low-cost carrier would also buy five aircrafts from Boeing and lease three aircraft from Bombardier this financial year to increase daily flights and enter into newer international destinations. "We have significant financial resources to fund the purchase of the aircrafts as we have been profitable for the past few quarters and also have significant ability to use the (credit) limits from banks," added Singh. SpiceJet plans to tap two to three international destinations in the four to five hour haul from the current presence in six countries including Dubai, Bangkok, Colombo and Maldives. With a growing fleet of aircrafts which stands at 43 currently, the low cost airlines will also be hiring nearly 600 pilots taking the total to 1,000 in the coming few years.

Home Industry Companies With Rafale fighter jets deal in bag, IAF eyes F-16s, Saab jets under Narendra Modi’s Make in India drive With Rafale fighter jets deal in bag, IAF eyes F-16s, Saab jets under Narendra Modi’s Make in India drive After concluding a 7.8-billion-euro deal with France’s Dassault Aviation for 36 Rafale fighter jets, the Indian Air Force is looking for the next round of combat aircraft acquisition. By: Huma Siddiqui | New Delhi | Updated: October 15, 2016 6:54 AM France’s Dassault Aviation for 36 Rafale fighter jets, the Indian Air Force is looking for the next round of combat aircraft acquisition (Reuters Image) After concluding a 7.8-billion-euro deal with France’s Dassault Aviation for 36 Rafale fighter jets, the Indian Air Force is looking for the next round of combat aircraft acquisition. The Gripen fighter plane manufactured by Sweden’s Saab and American giant Lockheed Martin’s F-16 are seen to be top contenders for grabbing the lucrative IAF contracts and both firms are open to setting up production lines in India under the Modi government’s Make in India drive, official said. US firms Boeing and Lockheed have made several presentations to the Indian defence ministry where they discussed manufacturing top-line aircraft with high-end technology in India as well as technology transfer and licensing parameters. Lockheed, sources said, has offered to move its lone production line of the latest version of fighter aircraft F 16-Block 70 to India from Texas to meet Indian and global requirements, but with a rider that the IAF has to choose the world’s largest-sold fighter aircraft for its fleet. From India’s perspective, besides the 36 Rafale fighter planes from Dassault, there is an urgent requirement for almost 100-plus aircraft. “The number of squadrons has gone down to 32 from the required 45. In 2007, IAF was looking for 126 medium multirole combat aircraft, with a follow-on order, bringing the number to 200. There is still a need for another 100 aircraft with a follow on for another 50 machines to meet the requirements,” said a senior IAF officer. As far as the IAF is concerned, the F-16, which is presently being operated by the Pakistan Air Force, would be unsuitable from operational, strategic, and technological angles. The F-16 is a 40-year-old airframe, and all the upgrades that are possible are already done. There is no room for any more growth. A 40-year-old design does have its limitations that cannot be overlooked. Industry sources, however, have pointed out that if the competition is between Lockheed and the Swedish firm, then probably the US giant will have a tough time getting a local partner. “The company does not have a strong partner to work with here locally. However, its partnership with Tata is not exclusive as it is also partnering with Boeing,” said a source. “The offer we have given to the Indian government is unmatched and from our side unprecedented,” Randall L Howard, F16 business development head at Lockheed had said here. He said the company wants to make F 16-Block 70 “for India, from India and export to the world”. But some analysts have added a cautionary note. Air marshal M Matheswaran (retd), former deputy chief, integrated defence staff, said: “The F-16 has outlived its time.

The airline re-launched domestic destinations October 14, 2016 after a government bailout. NDI EUGENE NDI | NATION MEDIA GROUP  NDI EUGENE NDI in Yaoundé Friday, October 14   2016 at  17:32 comment Cameroon’s national carrier Camair-Co Friday re-launched its domestic flights with an inaugural journey between Yaoundé and Bafoussam. The re-launch follows the suspension of Camair-Co's lone intercontinental route last month. An extra-ordinary board of directors’ meeting earlier this month in Douala agreed that the Paris route be suspended for the company to concentrate on its domestic destinations. A new management team appointed last August has been struggling to revamp the ailing state firm that has been grappling with financial and managerial crisis since it launched operations in March 2011. The company Transport minister Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo’o announced on Wednesday that the government had disbursed $50.5 million (FCFA 30 billion) for the rehabilitation of the company. The infusion is part of a $101 million (FCFA 60 billion) recommended by a US consortium in a new business strategy to the government of the central African nation earlier this year. Boeing Consulting findings revealed Camair-Co recorded a deficit of $59 million (FCFA 35 billion) between 2012 and 2014, urging for a bailout to help the airline to continue flying. Mr Ngo’o said the government was also seeking to absorb the company’s debts. Flag carrier Boeing will accompany Cameroon for 18 months in the implementation of the new business plan, which authorities hope will make Camair-Co return to stability. The head of Boeing Consulting team, Mr Michael Bangue Tandet, said the US firm was working with the new Camair-Co management to ensure the plan was implemented “as quickly as feasible”. Camair-Co is the successor to Cameroon Airlines, the central African country’s pioneer flag carrier, which was dogged by losses and safety challenges. Five years later, observers say there were no indications that Camair’s successor would be profitable.

Looking to parallel this rapid development, Boeing’s Commercial Planes’ Product Development team is now experimenting with new ideas to bring connectivity to the modern day aircraft. Recent tests of a networked ‘smart cabin’ interior mock-up reveal new ways to order food and drinks, check bathroom availability and manage lighting options through a flyer’s smartphone, smart watch, or tablet. Note that passenger devices aren’t supplied for the flight, rather they’re the same ones they use on a daily basis. By linking up via secure chips located near each feature—a completely separate system from the electronics used for flight that doesn’t require Wi-Fi—users can then change the settings to match their preferences. Eventually these chips will be programmed to inform on-the-ground service teams about necessary maintenance, streamlining the repair process to ensure more timely flights and overall customer satisfaction moving forwards.

Davey Alba Science Date of Publication: 10.14.16. 10.14.16 Time of Publication: 4:25 pm. 4:25 pm Obama Geeks Out Over a Brain-Controlled Robotic Arm That ‘Feels’ Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson When Nathan Copeland got into a car accident in 2004, he suffered a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed in both arms and both legs. Eventually, Copeland got a prosthetic—but one that is very different from most anyone else’s out there. Copeland is the first person in the world to use a system created by DARPA and the National Science Foundation, which allows him to “experience” the sensation of touch via a special robotic prosthesis. He has a brain implant that lets him control and feel the system with his mind. Pretty amazing stuff. Oh, he’s also one of the few Americans who has personally met the President of the United States. ‘I confess I’m a science geek. I’m a nerd. I won’t make any apologies for it.’ President Barack Obama Yesterday in Pittsburgh, during the White House Frontiers Conference, Barack Obama went on a tour of the most cutting-edge US technologies. With just a few months left in office, Obama is seeking to cement his legacy as a whole-hearted supporter of science—something that has been a clear differentiator between camps in this crazy election year. Science and technology, Obama seemingly hopes to underline, leads to progress—and, yes, American success. But more than just being a trumpeter of this message, watching Obama nerd out on science projects himself proves how much of one he is. “I confess I’m a science geek,” Obama announced at the conference. “I’m a nerd. I won’t make any apologies for it.” And this much was clear as he spoke with a handful of Pittsburgh scientists and academics who let him tinker with their machines and ask about their research. The first stop on the tour was to shake Copeland’s hand. The President chatted quietly, almost conspiratorially, with Copeland, and with University of Pittsburgh assistant professors Robert Gaunt and Jennifer Collinger, who explained to him the science of how the robotic arm worked. Obama held the fingers on the arm, which was mounted to a metal post by Copeland’s side, and moved them one by one. Then he shook the robotic hand. “Do you want to blow it up?” the President asked Copeland. “Let’s blow it up!” The two fist-bumped and mimicked exploding fingers. “Boo-yah!” Obama said. Then, rather suddenly, he turned to the gathered crowd: “Does everyone fully grasp what’s going on here?” Obama explained not only was Copeland moving the arm himself, using his own brain, whenever he moved the hand it also sent signals to Copeland. “You can imagine what this means over time as this gets miniaturized and more sophisticated,” Obama said. “Somebody who may currently have paralysis but now has, essentially, a set of robot limbs? Nathan’s going to be in a position where there’s all the kids of stuff he’s going to be able to do, and do it without having to manipulate something mechanically—but simply generated by what he’s thinking.” “Is it painful?” a member of the press called out. “No, never painful,” Copeland answered. “Look at him!” Obama chimed in. “He’s pretty chill.” “Tiring?” a reporter pressed. As Copeland said next to no effort was needed, Obama joked, “If you moved your arm up and down all day, you’d get tired of it too.” Obama then met with a NASA astronaut and Boeing representative, who taught him how to operate a spacecraft flight and docking simulator. The video game-like contraption—complete with dual screens, various knobs and levers, and a sloping hood above Obama’s seat—is the training setup that NASA’s own astronauts are using to prepare for future missions to the International Space Station. “Uh, let me try to get comfortable,” Obama said, approaching the intimidating-looking machine. “Let me take my jacket off.” He shed his coat and sat in front of the controls, rocking the chair back and forth like a kid testing out the seat of an arcade game. The experts coached him on how to use the simulator—left, right, left. The representative from Boeing representative told Obama what speed he should aim for, but told him not to go so fast that he crashed into the ISS. ‘Your ride is here, baby!’ the President said as he docked the spacecraft into the ISS. “I don’t want to crash!” cried Obama. “This is really expensive stuff… OK, let’s drive.” A few minutes later: “I’m so tense!” Obama said, struggling to follow the commands and not let the spacecraft drift. The scene made for a pretty good case for anyone who wants to defend their childhood love of video games. And finally, after several moments: “Your ride is here, baby!” the President said as he docked the spacecraft into the ISS. “This is like the Uber shuttle. Just call, they’ll be there in five minutes.” The press crowd, trailing Obama, hurried over to an autonomous flying machine demo from Carnegie Mellon used for inspecting bridges, imaging, and mapping. Standing in front of one of the screens that apparently sensed motion, Obama flapped his arms for a bit, checking to see if his movements would register. More stories So, President Obama’s Got a Workout Playlist. Let’s Rank Its Songs Barack Obama Talks AI, Robo-Cars, and the Future of the World How to Watch President Obama’s Essential Sci-Fi TV and Films Several minutes away, one last demonstration awaited Obama: a SpaceX Dragon capsule that has been successfully tested by NASA and meant to keep astronauts safe during human spaceflight. “You almost want to get in and take off, don’t you?” Obama asked. He wondered out loud what it’d be like to bring the whole family along for a trip, and how his kids Malia and Sasha might react to being in the backseat. And when a SpaceX representative said the company could one day visit Mars, Obama said, “That’s our goal.” Pushing the frontiers of human achievement, at least to this US President, means one day leaving this world entirely. Presidents: they’re kooky science lovers, just like us! Apart from the cabal of Secret Service keeping crowds back at all times. Oh, and they have access to cooler toys, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Following recommendations from a civil aviation ministry committee headed by joint secretary B S Bhullar to set up a flight simulator for every 20 aircraft, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is drafting a regulation in this regard. A ministry official said the recommendation had been approved and DGCA would be issuing draft guidelines in the next two weeks. Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said the government wanted aircraft manufacturers to set up simulators in India. “We want to build an aviation ecosystem in the country,” he said, adding that the companies would not be arm-twisted to provide simulators. Currently, Air India and Jet Airways have their own simulators for their Boeing and Airbus aircraft, while other airlines send their pilots to third-party simulators in India and abroad. There are no simulators in India for ATR, Bombardier, and Embraer aircraft. The issue of simulator training also came up during a recent meeting between the civil aviation ministry and representatives of Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. The Japanese company is developing a regional jet and is looking for customers in India. Pilots have to undergo simulator checks once every six months. Also, simulators are used for training pilots on new aircraft type. The sector criticised the move, saying it was impractical. Airline executives said building a simulator was not part of the core business of airlines and such a mandate would increase their costs. “Expert organisations should build that; airlines are only customers,” said the chief executive of a private airline. Queries to Vistara and IndiGo were not responded to. SpiceJet said airlines should be left alone to decide whether they would go for leasing for pilot trainings or investing in simulators. And, the government has no role to play in such investment decisions. “If the government is serious about building flight simulator facilities and training ecosystem in India, it should slash the import duties on simulators and Indian banks should be allowed to finance the process. Teg cost of credit and dollar-rupee fluctuations make it impossible for airliners to build such facilities in the most economical way,” said the spokesperson. Experts corroborated this saying it’s not feasible for airlines in India to set up their own simulator, citing high costs. “A fairly average quality simulator costs $4 million in the current market price. Asking the airlines to set up one such simulator for every 20 aircraft is not at all practical – who will pay for it?” said Mark Martin of Dubai-based Martin Consultancy. According to Martin, the government can build such training facilities and monetise it by opening them to the airlines. “In that way, the government makes money and also becomes a facilitator to build an ecosystem,” Martin said. Currently, domestic airlines operate around 450 planes and have 700 aircraft on order. There is a shortage of trained commanders and airlines are hiring foreign pilots to operate aircraft. Setting up an in-house simulator could make pilot training easier and help the airlines reduce dependence on expatriates. The initiative is also part of the overall government vision to build an aviation ecosystem in the country.

Govt wants airlines to set up simulators Airlines that mostly outsource training criticise the move citing high setup cost Airlines that mostly outsource training criticise the move citing high setup cost The civil aviation ministry wants airlines and aircraft manufacturers to set up flight simulators to meet the rising demand for trained pilots in India. Following recommendations from a civil aviation ministry committee headed by joint secretary B S Bhullar to set up a flight simulator for every 20 aircraft, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is drafting a regulation in this regard. A ministry official said the recommendation had been approved and DGCA would be issuing draft guidelines in the next two weeks. Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said the government wanted aircraft manufacturers to set up simulators in India. “We want to build an aviation ecosystem in the country,” he said, adding that the companies would not be arm-twisted to provide simulators. Currently, Air India and Jet Airways have their own simulators for their Boeing and Airbus aircraft, while other airlines send their pilots to third-party simulators in India and abroad. There are no simulators in India for ATR, Bombardier, and Embraer aircraft. The issue of simulator training also came up during a recent meeting between the civil aviation ministry and representatives of Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. The Japanese company is developing a regional jet and is looking for customers in India. Pilots have to undergo simulator checks once every six months. Also, simulators are used for training pilots on new aircraft type. The sector criticised the move, saying it was impractical. Airline executives said building a simulator was not part of the core business of airlines and such a mandate would increase their costs. “Expert organisations should build that; airlines are only customers,” said the chief executive of a private airline. Queries to Vistara and IndiGo were not responded to. SpiceJet said airlines should be left alone to decide whether they would go for leasing for pilot trainings or investing in simulators. And, the government has no role to play in such investment decisions. “If the government is serious about building flight simulator facilities and training ecosystem in India, it should slash the import duties on simulators and Indian banks should be allowed to finance the process. Teg cost of credit and dollar-rupee fluctuations make it impossible for airliners to build such facilities in the most economical way,” said the spokesperson. Experts corroborated this saying it’s not feasible for airlines in India to set up their own simulator, citing high costs. “A fairly average quality simulator costs $4 million in the current market price. Asking the airlines to set up one such simulator for every 20 aircraft is not at all practical – who will pay for it?” said Mark Martin of Dubai-based Martin Consultancy. According to Martin, the government can build such training facilities and monetise it by opening them to the airlines. “In that way, the government makes money and also becomes a facilitator to build an ecosystem,” Martin said. Currently, domestic airlines operate around 450 planes and have 700 aircraft on order. There is a shortage of trained commanders and airlines are hiring foreign pilots to operate aircraft. Setting up an in-house simulator could make pilot training easier and help the airlines reduce dependence on expatriates. The initiative is also part of the overall government vision to build an aviation ecosystem in the country.

FROM planes to trains, one forward-thinking Sligo native is bringing his camping vision alive. David McGowan managed to capture the imagination of the nation earlier this year after he pulled out all the stops to transport a Boeing 767 to the small village of Enniscrone in Sligo. The plane is to be the centerpiece of McGowan’s Quirky Nights Glamping Village. But it’s not the only vehicle that will be on display in Enniscrone when the village opens its gates to the public. The enterprising undertaker is today beginning his transport of a train from the UK to Enniscrone. The train will be moved from London to the west of England. It will arrive at Dublin Port on Sunday at 5pm before making it to Enniscrone at about 6am on Monday. “It seems to going well and the permits are all in place in this side of the water,” McGowan said to Today FM’s the Anton Savage Show today. “If there’s anyone there in Ireland that wants a life home we’ll be leaving this evening at about 7 o’clock. We’re going across London… so if there’s anyone from Ireland looking for a lift home give us a shout… It won’t cost you anything. You can’t fault the man for vision.

November 14, 2016 0353 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:170293 Publish Date: Fri, 14 Oct 2016 20:13:56 GMT Service: Iran Bombardier says unfazed by late start in Iran Canada’s flag-carrier airline Bombardier says it has no concerns to find a foothold in Iran’s aviation market even though it has been late on chasing opportunities in Iran. Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said he expects his company to be able to catch up with its rivals following Canada’s lifting of sanctions against Iran. Bellemare added that Bombardier currently has teams on the ground in Iran, stressing that the company was not concerned about winning its share of new orders in the Iranian market. The Montreal-based plane and train maker sees opportunities to sell regional rail services along with regional jets and CSeries planes as Iranian companies look to modernize, reported Canada’s Toronto Starnewspaper in an article on its website. Iran has signed an agreement with the French plane-maker Airbus to purchase over 100 planes.    The country has also signed another agreement with the American aviation giant Boeing to buy some 80 passenger jets worth $25 billion at price lists. The tentative deals have already hit a speed bump because major global banks are refusing to handle transactions with Iran for fear of running afoul of US sanctions on the country. One major roadblock was lifted last month when the US government granted Airbus and Boeing permission to sell aircraft to the Islamic Republic. Apart from Boeing and Airbus, Iran has also already started talks with Canada’s Bombardier, Brazil’s Embraer and Japan’s Mitsubishi over plane supply agreements. Iran’s current civil aviation fleet consists of 248 aircraft with an average age of 20 years, of which 100 are grounded. Iranian officials have announced that the country needs as many as 500 jets to rejuvenate its aviation fleet.     KeyWords Bombardier unfazed Iran   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, Russia cooperating on Middle East issues: Larijani EU must play more active role on regional, global issues: Zarif Iran beats USA in world kabaddi meet to reach semifinals Iran seeks secure, stable Iraq: Parliament speaker Iran crowned at 1st world Pahlavani bouts Iran fit enough to win world physique title Top Iranian, Russian parliamentarians meet in Tehran President Rouhani inaugurates three oilfields in Khuzestan Official: Over 1m Iranians enter Iraq for Arba’een rituals Iran to join Paris climate change treaty Most Visited Protests erupt in Cincinnati after mistrial in police shooting of black male Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1535 sec

Even Samsung's heir apparent admitted that the incident was the trigger for him to pull the plug on blundered smartphone. The incident put the airline industry into panic mode. In short order they've now begun to outfit planes with fire-containment bags capable of withstanding 1,760C heat to stop smartphone and laptop battery fires from spreading throughout the plane.   The first airline to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. With the Samsung incident, several other airlines have gone into high gear to adopt these new bags.   A new report states that following explosions of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, airlines are taking steps to protect their planes from mobile devices with fire-suppressing systems.   Three US airlines have started rolling out new fire-containment bags capable of sealing up an overheating smartphone or laptop battery to prevent a disaster mid-air.   The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops. The bags, which retail for $1,800 each, can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers to withstand temperatures up to 1,760C.   Virgin America installed fire-containment bags on all its 60 or so planes, while Seattle-based Alaska Airlines finished adding them to its 219 planes in May.   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines said that it too would be adding such bags to its more than 900 planes, prioritizing the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, which will have two of the bags each by the end of the year.   "This has been on the to-do list, but has been accelerated by recent events," said Morgan Durrant, communications manager for Delta.   Other airlines, including American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, have yet to deploy the bags, but do have aircrew training and fire extinguishers to deal with high-energy fires mid-flight.   Note 7 Costs to Dramatically Rise for Samsung   On Tuesday Samsung's preliminary estimates over the costs of the first recall rang in at US$4 billion. Today Samsung let it be known that the costs will rise to what amounts to US$6.1 Billion.   A Korean report this morning states that Samsung announced that "In total, the halts in sales and production of the fire-prone Note 7 cost Samsung Electronics more than 7 trillion won ($6.1 Billion U.S.).   The operating profits of the company's internet and mobile division in the fourth quarter is also estimated to drop more than 20 percent year-on-year to close to 2 trillion won, according to analysts' estimates.   To cover the cost from the Note 7, Samsung plans to focus on other premium smartphone brands such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The tech giant also reportedly plans to shift operations of plants in Gumi and Vietnam -- originally for the Note 7 -- to produce the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.   Samsung, reeling from the painful Note 7 fallout, also vowed to improve its product development that critics say is largely at fault due to its rigid organizational culture."   Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Securities stated for the report that "Samsung may improve earnings in its mobile division in the first quarter of next year if it investigates the causes of the explosions, discloses the solution for the production of the Galaxy S8, and adopts compensation programs in case of possible explosions."   What's disturbing about Samsung's handling of their Note7 crisis is that they sent out replacement Note7's in quick fashion without even knowing if that would actually solve the problem. When the replacement batteries began exploding, their theory also went up in smoke.   Just yesterday Samsung vowed to figure the root causes of the Note 7 problem. This is what's damaging to Samsung's reputation: The admission that they never had a clue as to what was going wrong behind the scenes while telling the press that it is was all due to a bad batch of batteries. They lied, which means that the anger expressed by their customers in China were right all along. It's not the battery, it's something within the Note7's architecture that has a problem controlling the charging of the battery.   Now the fact that analysts want Samsung to adopt compensation programs in case their future Samsung S8 explodes tells you that there's deep fear even at the broker level about Samsung ability to resolve this problem.   Yet the thing that might have saved the Galaxy S7 Edge from having an overheating problem is that they adopted a liquid cooling system for that model; something that couldn't have been adopted by the Note 7 due to precious internal space being reserved to accommodate their S-Pen or stylus.   Without a doubt, this has been one of the worse weeks for Samsung in decades and a baptism of fire for their heir apparent Jae-yong Lee.   Samsung's CES 2017 Surprise has Likely Gone Up in Smoke   It was discussed in the Korean press just yesterday that Samsung was planning to unveil their new Galaxy S8 in a surprise event at CES 2017 and launch it while at the Mobile World Congress in late February.   Yet with the demise of the Note7 this week, those plans are likely to have gone up in smoke, as such a market surprise would now be interpreted as Samsung in panic mode rushing out yet another smartphone release. The ripple effect of the Note 7 crisis continues.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Recently, we have included three Bombardiers in our fleet and going to add another three by the next year. At present, we operate flights to six international destinations and preparing to operate in more countries."

The new routes include Kolkata-Silchar-Guwahati, Kolkata-Aizawl-Guwahati and Kolkata-Gorakhpur-Delhi. It will also deploy a dedicated fleet of three Q400 for the north-eastern markets. On the connectivity from Hyderabad to other tier-II cities, Singh said, "We are considering to run flights from Hyderabad to Nagpur, Calicut and Bhubaneswar. Already, we have planned to start a flight from Hyderabad to Kolkata from this November." The company is in talks with Airbus and Boeing to order more than 100 aircraft. The deal is likely to finalise in a couple of months, according to him. SpiceJet has reported a net profit of Rs 149 crore during the first quarter of FY17 and it will also be making profits in the coming quarters due to the improved operational efficiency, he added.

Source: IHS/James Hardy South Korea has received its first lot of Taurus KEPD 350K cruise missiles during a ceremony at the headquarters of Taurus Systems in Schrobenhausen, Germany, it was announced on 14 October. An undisclosed number of missiles were formally handed over to the Republic of Korea Air Force (RoKAF) during the event, which took place on the same day as the announcement. The RoKAF signed a contract for the Taurus KEPD 350K in November 2013, with reports putting the number at either 170 or 180 missiles. The Taurus KEPD 350K is being integrated onto the RoKAF's Boeing F-15K Slam Eagle fleet. According to MBDA Deutschland (the lead company in the Taurus Systems consortium, which also includes Saab Dynamics), this work is now in its final stages. The missile is an enhanced version of the Taurus KEPD 350 fielded by Germany and Spain on its Panavia Tornado, and Boeing EF-18 Hornet and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft respectively. Sweden is looking at integrating it onto its Saab JAS 39 Gripens also. The baseline Taurus KEPD 350 missile is a 350 km to 500 km-class weapon designed for use against hardened and buried targets with its Multi-Effect Penetrator Highly Sophisticated and Target Optimised (MEPHISTO) penetrator warhead and intelligent fuzing system. Once launched, the missile, which is powered by a small turbofan engine, flies at extremely low altitudes (30 m) at speeds of up to Mach 0.9. The Taurus KEPD 350 missile measures 5.1 m in length, 63 cm wide, 32 cm high, and weighs in at 1,400 kg. The Taurus KEPD 350K for the RoKAF differs slightly in that it is equipped with a new Rockwell Collins GPS receiver that comes with a Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) to prevent jamming.

Three US airlines will now provide fire-containment bags which can be used to seal up an overheating smartphone or other device. Virgin America, Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines have started rolling out the bright red bags which can be sealed using Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and are capable of withstanding 1,760C heat. Related: Best Note 7 replacements Virgin America has already installed the fire-resistant bags on all its 60-odd planes and Alaska Airlines has also ensured its 219 planes are fully Note 7-proof. Delta Air Lines is yet to kit its planes out but has said it will make sure its 900 aircraft, starting with the 166 that cross oceans and some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, will have two of the bags on-board before the end of 2016. The move follows a warning from the US Federal Aviation Administration to passengers, advising them not to use or charge Note 7 devices on-board planes. Samsung meanwhile has been forced to stop production of the explosion-prone handsets, after initially offering supposedly safe replacements to customers. The South Korean firm made the decision after reports of replacement devices catching fire began to surface, one of which related to a Note 7 exploding before take-off on a Southwest Airlines flight in the United States. Royal Mail this week has also said it will not allow the phones to be returned via its network, due to the lithium-ion batteries used in the devices, which have been identified as the source of the overheating problems. If you still have a Note 7, Samsung has issued a global recall and strongly advises powering the phone down and returning tit for a refund as soon as possible.

The launch operator is expected to purchase up to 20 engines for the current mission. “It has been decided that the Atlas V manned program will be implemented using Russian RD-180 engines. The crew had already been selected and is being trained,” NPO Energomash General Director Igor Arbuzov told RIA Novosti on Friday. Read more No space for US without Russian rockets The missions will be carried out aboard the heavy-lift Atlas V vehicles with Boeing’s Crew Transportation System (CTS) capsules. The first unmanned test launch is expected in 2017, while manned test launch is scheduled for 2018, Arbuzov said. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) operator which is responsible for the launches plans to purchase from 10 to 20 Russian engines for the missions. “One can say with confidence that no other engine in the world except the RD-180 is ready for manned launches as part of the Atlas V rocket,” Arbuzov said, adding that the RD-180 engines’ and Atlas V's joined performance has been very successful over the years. Arbuzov specified that the engines that have already been shipped to the United States will be used for both test launches and the first manned flight along with those that are to be delivered between 2017 and 2019.  READ MORE: Pentagon defends use of Russian rocket engines as matter of national security “The package for 2017-2019 has been fully approved. It is a solid contract. What will be happening after 2019 is currently being discussed with our American colleagues,” he noted, adding, however, that the new contract could be signed after the US presidential elections to be held on November 8. Russian RD-180 rocket engines © Iliya Pitalev / Sputnik “I am certain that this will happen,” Arbuzov said, stressing that the currently available supply of Russian engines in the US does not meet its needs under the developing 2020-2023 program. The RD-181 engine was developed specifically for the US Antares rockets; it allows more cargo to be brought up to the International Space Station. While RD-180 was chosen for the US Atlas rocket in early 1996. In spring 1999, the RD-180 was officially certified for use in Atlas III carrier rocket, and a year later, for use in Atlas V launch vehicle, whose first flight took place in August 2002. Despite over 13 years of successful cooperation in the field and steady supply of engines, doubts about using the RD-180 for the US space program arose following the Ukraine crisis in March 2014, which affected US-Russia relations. American lawmakers banned future military use of the Russian engines after Crimea joined Russia in 2014.  Commercial Crew Transportation System (CCTS) capsule © Bruce Weaver / AFP However, the US Congress weakened the ban in 2015 in order to keep its space program going. ULA has also maintained that Russian engines are cheaper than the US alternatives, and that view is shared by the Pentagon. Still, the use of Russian engines for American rockets remains a political issue in the US, where some politicians like Republican Senator John McCain strongly advocate replacing them. To break the dependency on Russian engines, in 2014 ULA has partnered up with Blue Origin, a private US-based aerospace research and development company, to develop the BE-4 LOX/methane engine to replace the RD-180. However Arbuzov said these replacement plans could stretch well into 2024. “Indeed, [we’ve heard] statements that the development of Blue Origin’s methane engines BE-4 is going on schedule.  However, in my opinion, these engines will not be able to compete with our RD-180s, at least until 2020,” he concluded. via GIPHY Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2016.

REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won Reuters/Lee Jae-Won Friday, Oct 14, 2016 Abu Dhabi: The trade relations between the UAE and the US are strong with bilateral trade reaching $25.44 billion in 2015, an increase of 2.24 per cent from 2014, Chairman of American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Abu Dhabi told Gulf News in an interview. “The US-UAE trade relations are currently the strongest as have ever been. The UAE is the largest US export market in the Middle East surpassing Saudi Arabia, Turkey and India. This is due to a strong focus on the defence, health care, oil and gas and education sectors,” said Sharief Fahmy. The total US exports to the UAE have reached $22.98 billion (Dh84.33 billion) last year surpassing other regional trade partners including Saudi Arabia ($19.69 billion), India ($21.53 billion), Turkey ($9.56 billion) and Egypt ($4.75 billion, according to figures provided by AmCham Abu Dhabi. The top exports were transportation equipment including aircraft and commercial aviation equipment accounting for $8.7 billion. Advertisement There is also a huge presence of the US companies in the UAE with the number exceeding more than 1500 in different sectors including aerospace, finance, oil and gas, health care, tourism among others. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon are some of the companies in the defence and aerospace sector. In the oil and gas, Occidental petroleum has a tie up with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) in the development of Shah gas oilfield in the Western region on Abu Dhabi and Exxon Mobil has concession agreement with Adnoc in the development of the emirate’s offshore oilfields. From the UAE side, Abu Dhabi based Mubadala has $6 billion investment in GlobalFoundries, a semiconductors manufacturer based in California. “We’ve seen consistent growth in trade between the two countries and moving forward I see the relationship strengthening further with boost in investment and trade.” With the UAE planning to diversify their economy due to drop in oil prices and the introduction of the bankruptcy law next year, the number of US companies in the UAE is likely to go up. “The introduction of bankruptcy law is going to benefit our SMEs significantly. A lot of companies will feel more secure to invest in the UAE.” The UAE bankruptcy law approved by the UAE Cabinet last month is likely to come into effect early next year. The new law will pave the way for companies in financial distress to restructure and allow the possibility of getting fresh loans under terms set by the law. When asked whether change in the guard in the US after the elections in November will have any impact on the bilateral trade relations, he said business will continue to progress irrespective of whether a democrat or a republican candidate wins the elections. “From a chamber perspective, we are non-partisan. We’ve been fortunate with Obama administration and the policies that came out in the last eight years. We expect the same spirit to continue whether it is Trump or Clinton administration.” He said the Obama administration has attached special significance to the UAE with the US administration sending invitations to Emirati companies to come and be part of the select USA Investments Summit in Washington DC in June this year. Thirteen companies represented the UAE and received special status with private meetings with the US Secretary of Commerce Pritzker, he added. Set up in 1986, AmCham Abu Dhabi is represented by more than 600 American and Emirati companies including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and big corporations with huge investments in the UAE.

The geek-in-chief was in his element Thursday as he toured cutting-edge projects during a White House Frontiers Conference. Obama beamed as he took the chair of a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator, with its panoply of buttons and monitors and futuristic gizmos. “Right, left, left,” his trainer said, urging minute course corrections. “Your ride is here, baby,” Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. “This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we’ll be there in five minutes.” Minutes later, the president gawked at a self-directed quadcopter, or mini-drone, used to inspect infrastructure like bridges. As a computer screen showed the drone’s preset path, the drone moved up and down, left and right, emitting neon green light and whizzing loudly. He offered a presidential fist-bump to Nathan Copeland, a paralyzed man who is the first person who can feel sensation through his mind-controlled robotic arm. The Harvard-trained lawyer has never been shy about his fascination with all things scientific and high-tech. Over the years he’s fired off a high-speed marshmallow air cannon at a White House science fair and rubbernecked at robots built by teenagers. He used his appearance Thursday to scoff at those who “willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand,” such as those who question global warming. “Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn’t deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn’t have worked,” Obama said. “No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon.” Urging a new aspiration for the nation, Obama has set a goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, and in Pittsburgh he got a look at the SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft, part of ongoing research to develop vehicles that could transport astronauts to the red planet.

Scoot Print Singapore Airlines' budget siblings, Scoot and Tigerair, are embarking on their biggest-ever recruitment drive for cockpit and cabin crew as the group positions itself to capture a bigger share of the low-cost travel market. From 400 pilots today, the total headcount for the two airlines, which now operate as one, will increase to 700 by 2020, Captain Rohan Hari Chandra, the airline's advisor of flight operations, told The Straits Times yesterday. About 2,000 cabin crew will also be hired during the same period, almost double the number today. Since May, when SIA set up a new holding company to operate both budget carriers, Scoot and Tigerair have been working closely to grow their market share. Capt Rohan said: "We know the expansion is coming, the planes are coming and we need pilots to fly them." Scoot, which operates medium and long-haul flights with 12 Boeing 787s, will grow to 20 planes by 2019. Tigerair, which flies single-aisle planes within the region, will grow from 23 to 38 aircraft by 2022. With strong demand for low-cost air travel, SIA is counting on its budget offshoots to move quickly in this sector. This is critical given intense pressure the premium carrier faces in the long-haul market, with stiff competition from rivals that include the Middle Eastern airlines and Cathay Pacific. Finding enough pilots, though, will be tough, experts say. American plane maker Boeing estimates that the world will need about 617,000 new pilots and 814,000 cabin crew over the next 20 years. The Asia-Pacific region will soak up 40 per cent of the total due to the growth in the single-aisle market, driven by low-cost carriers, the firm said. Capt Rohan said he is confident Scoot/Tigerair will be able to fill the available positions. Remuneration packages are competitively pegged to what other budget carriers in the region offer, he added, without disclosing details. And while there are those who prefer to join full-service airlines - perceived as more glamorous - "we generally get the hungry guys", he said. "They want to get on with their careers and get their command (captain rank) quickly," he noted. Budget carrier pilots typically move from trainee to captain in about seven years, compared with more than 10 years for pilots with full-service long-haul airlines. This is because they tend to clock more flying hours and flight cycles in a month with shorter flights. A recent recruitment exercise drew over 1,000 candidates, of whom about 150 were shortlisted for a test yesterday. One of them, Brian Chow, 22, said: "I always thought I would become an engineer until I signed up for a flying course last year. "I now know I want to become a pilot." karam@sph.com.sg Get MyPaper for more stories. Sign Up Now! Enjoy 2 weeks of unlimited digital access to The Straits Times. Get your free access!

Clark's job was with Emirates, an airline set up with a US$10 million loan from Dubai's royal family. Its first flight took off from a dusty runway bound for Karachi. Brought in as head of airline planning, the economics graduate had a vision that would go on to see Dubai at the heart of an aviation boom like no other. With two-thirds of the world's population within eight hours of the emirate, Clark aimed to have his new airline carrying millions of them. By various measures, that vision has come to fruition; the airline's growth has been staggering. While other established airlines have folded, merged or gone backwards, Emirates has known only one trajectory - up. Thanks to its international reach and billions of dollars spent on promotion, marketing and sponsorship, it's the biggest brand in aviation, has the largest available flight kilometres of any international carrier and in absolute size, is in the top three behind American and United Airlines. "I wouldn't have dreamt that in 1985 when we set the thing up," says Clark - now Sir Tim, and one of aviation's most powerful executives. Asked about Clark's place in the airline industry, a leading aviation analyst this week described him as being "slightly south of God". Clark extends a half-hour interview with the Herald to nearly an hour at Sydney's Shangri-La hotel. There are fine views out to the Opera House, but much of his focus is on the meeting room, where there are two scale models of the Airbus A380 superjumbo, Emirates' signature aircraft. The airline now has more than 80 of the double decker planes and close to 150 other widebody aircraft flying to more than 150 destinations. Almost the same number of aircraft are on order and it carries more than 50 million passengers a year. Continued below. Related Content Air NZ getting WiFi - next year Joke spreads among Aussies and Kiwis over UK's Marmite misery New airline's cut-price fares on longest route "By the mid 1990s we had 40 aircraft and probably thought we would cap out at about 120. We thought we could be at the scale of Singapore Airlines (which today has 103 aircraft) and everyone said we were barking mad." Watch: Emirates boss explains A380 interior design: Video The NZ connection Emirates has been flying to Auckland since 2003, adding a Christchurch service the following year. It scaled up massively in 2009 with three A380 services to Auckland and from the end of this month capacity will surge again with the number of superjumbo services increasing to five, including replacing 777s on the Christchurch route and the direct Dubai-Auckland service. This will add 2500 more seats a week each way. Growth elsewhere is strong. So far this month the airline has announced new services to all parts of the globe: Guangzhou, Moscow and Florida. What about fares? Rival Middle Eastern carrier Qatar will start Doha-Auckland services from next February and Clark says there is ``theoretically'' room for both carriers. ''Both carriers are growth animals they thrive on growth and looking for new markets and being innovative and experimental in what they do.'' The extra competition meant times couldn't be better for New Zealand travellers. "The fares are already down. In this part of the world we're seeing arfares that were around eight to 10 years ago - that's supply and demand,'' he says. The big Asian carriers were adding more capacity to Australasia and boosting competition but Clark says there are product differences. ''If they come in and trash the pricing then that's up to them but it is a long way to go and if you've got a moderate or mediocre product.'' Video When will Emirates' growth end? "When we increase supply and demand doesn't grow with it, we're not there yet simply because there are multiple city pairs that we want to do," Clark says. The airline has modelled up to 60,000 places in the world that could be linked, including little-known cities in China and Latin America. "If you get disequilibrium you will know the model has maxed out. I don't see that happening because there are so many city pairs that are untouched by long-haul carriers in the second level segments where the markets are, but people don't believe in or don't know about." Clark says the main constraint is at its Dubai hub, which can't keep up with capacity growth in spite of a seemingly never-ending building programme. The airport needs to push through tens of thousands of people an hour and increase the number of gates three-fold to meet Clark's growth goals. "If you can build a hub to to do that then it opens up a huge spectrum of offerings. Will this model work? - yes with the geocentricity of Dubai." he says. "It goes back to the business model of 1985 with access to primary markets." Emirates business class seats. Photo / Grant Bradley Storm clouds about The fall in fuel prices is double edged for Emirates, in an industry that was notorious "for racing to the bottom," he says. "Now we've got low costs everyone's saying 'let's go and grab all the business' but unfortunately everyone has got it at the same time - consumers globally have had an absolute field day." Analyst Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the CAPA Centre for Aviation, says there are other storm clouds about. Emirates is facing growing competition from Middle Eastern carriers Etihad and Qatar, and also the big Chinese long-haul operators. "It's a tough world on long-haul now," says Harbison. "We used to say the thing that kept Tim awake at night was the Chinese carriers." And there's something else, deeper, that Clark has in the back of his mind. Outside the usual economic and demand fluctuations, popular anger that fuelled the Brexit vote and is behind support for Donald Trump could play out in aeropolitics. The introduction of the jumbo jet in the late 1960s has been credited with making mass long-haul travel feasible, bringing about profound political and social change. Similarly, when Emirates - and then other airlines - ramped up global operations and linked cities in ways that had not been imagined, they broke down barriers too. Now Clark wonders how long that will last. It is possible he has to understand the balance because aeropolitics drives the global demand for Boeing aircraft which is the largest single exporter in the US. If you compromise that then down they go. Peter Harbison, CAPA's executive chairman "You've got to be very careful about that because at this particular juncture you see the effects of globalisation and free trade." Moves that were good for the global economy in the 1990s are now being questioned. "All the fantastic things that were happening in general as we knitted as a community and we broke down all the barriers about faith and creed, colour sexuality and gender. "We thought this could last forever and have deployed capacity to the most bizarre city pairs and seen traffic move - now that's all changing. Are there paradigm shifts in this?" He says that question could be answered by the result of next month's US election next month - not that he'll be drawn on who he supports. "I'm not going to take sides on this otherwise I will get in big trouble, but if there is a move to the strange right position, if that happens, if the kind of statements he's [Trump's] been making about trade - a degree of isolationism - will this pan through to aeropolitics? "It is possible he has to understand the balance because aeropolitics drives the global demand for Boeing Aircraft, which is the largest single exporter in the US. If you compromise that then down they go." Emirates A380 aircraft.

Opponents "threw bricks" at Emirates in the early days, says Clark, and "said we were cheating, saying we had free oil, government money, because they couldn't understand how this could happen and for us to still make money and quite good money." The airline has spent years pushing back on those claims, and others about paying low wages, especially from opponents in the United States where the big three carriers have fought hard against Emirates entering that market. Analyst Harbison - who offered the "south of God" line - says Clark is right about the Emirates standing on its own. "He's a phenomenon, one of the two (along with Maurice Flanagan) who set up an airline with two aircraft, no guarantee from the government that it would have any protection whatsoever and built the most massive empire in the world," said Harbison, on the sidelines of the inaugural New Zealand Aviation and Travel Summit in Auckland. "Tim's no softie - when you've knocked around in the airline industry as long as he has you have a few battle wounds and a few good scars to cover them up, you know how to fight." Emirates economy class on an A380. "Put in the big windows" Plane makers know the power of a Clark pushback too; in 2014 he walked away from a $16b Airbus deal. When Clark was named Aviation Week's person of the year in 2013, Airbus president Fabrice Breglier said: "He knows everything you could possibly know about an aircraft, just give him the parameters and he'll tell you immediately if it's a go or a no-go." Clark says it's a matter of historical record that the bigger the airline got, the more successful it became. "We didn't buy [aircraft] in twos or threes, we bought them in 100s and 200s so it was only a matter of time before the manufacturers began to look at what we were doing, understanding we were a serious player and it was probably a good idea to adapt what they did." "With the 777X (which Emirates will get in four years) we worked with them and said 'put the windows in like the 787' they said structurally they just couldn't do it. I said 'just put them in' so they put them in." He is also is demanding that manufacturers produce aircraft capable of flying for 20 hours, which could link Dubai and Chile. Circling the globe Emirates has about 15 per cent of traffic on the transtasman route and the respect of home carrier Air New Zealand, which with Virgin Australia has just over half of the market. "We have a huge amount of respect for what Emirates does on a global basis," says Air New Zealand chief revenue officer Cam Wallace. "They have a different business model to us and obviously our businesses do overlap and compete. "We're very pragmatic and have to compete with anyone, we're up for it." The diplomatic tone is a far cry from when Emirates first entered Australasia, when Qantas (now in a deep partnership Clark's airline) and Air New Zealand expressed anger and alarm at the prospect of the Middle Eastern giant using rights to fly on across the Pacific and to the Americas, creating a massive operation circling the globe. "There was a shock reaction in New Zealand with open skies - now they're going to go across the Pacific they'll be in Los Angeles and we'll be all toast," says Clark. Clark is now in his mid-60s and this year the Gulf News reported he had up to another decade at the airline. So there's no hurry to join all the dots and Clark says he "doesn't deny that Emirates has aspired to a global operation in terms of circumnavigation." - NZ Herald Grant Bradley travelled to Sydney courtesy of Emirates.

(Courtesy Glenn Carberry) Published October 17. 2016 12:01AM  GLENN CARBERRY, Special to The Day When you live along the eastern seaboard, it is difficult to appreciate the differences between our region and the coastline of the Pacific Northwest. The Northeast Corridor, which consists of large and small cities located between Boston and Washington, is sometimes characterized as a single metropolis with close to 56 million people. In contrast, the sparsely populated northwest features wide beaches, spectacular mountains and a few cities with a reputation for cleanliness, friendliness and outdoor living. We recently had an opportunity to visit some interesting destinations along the Pacific coast by land and by sea and enjoyed it immensely. Ironically, there is considerable debate as to how to define the Pacific Northwest. Most people agree that it includes the states of Oregon, Washington and the Vancouver area of the Canadian province of British Columbia. Others believe that the geographically and climatically similar parts of California located from San Francisco north are also part of the Pacific Northwest. It is difficult to do justice to this vast area in a short article, but here some places worth visiting. San Francisco: The City by the Bay is a spectacular place to look at from almost any location — whether you are crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, sitting in a café having a Dungeness crab at Fisherman’s Wharf, or gazing out of a prison cell at Alcatraz planning an imaginary escape. San Francisco has a most interesting history. It once served as the northernmost outpost of Spain’s empire in the Americas, but later emerged as America’s own foothold on the Pacific coast after the Mexican-American War and the California Gold Rush of the 1840s. The vibrant waterfront became the center of activity for maritime shipping and commerce. By 1915, a world exposition confirmed San Francisco’s recovery from its famous earthquake and showcased the region’s reputation for innovation and an eclectic lifestyle. Today, there is plenty to do in San Francisco. Many of the 50 or so commercial piers that dominate the northern part of the city now feature an array of stores, restaurants and clubs, as well as an aquarium, sea lion platform and an interesting National Maritime Museum. Ferries leaving from the waterfront transport tens of thousands of people each day to communities around the bay or to the infamous federal prison at Alcatraz. Gangsters and other dangerous felons were imprisoned on the massive rock island there from the 1930s to 1963. The audio tour brings to life the Spartan conditions under which both prisoners and guards served time there, and the legends they created. Within a short distance from San Francisco are many other attractions worth visiting. Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge lies the bayside village of Sausalito, where Mediterranean-style villas cling to the hillside and tourists flock to cafes and shops along the waterfront. Another few miles along Route 101 lies Muir Woods, where a forest of redwoods containing some of the world’s oldest and tallest trees can be visited. Finally, many people travel to the more than 400 wineries located near San Francisco in the Sonoma or Napa valleys to sample the wares and take in the countryside. Astoria and the Oregon Coast: The rugged coastline of Northern California, Oregon and Washington extends from San Francisco to Seattle for a distance of almost 1,000 miles with only two small cities in between: Eureka, California, and Coos Bay, Oregon. The three main ways to travel north are via ship; along Route 101, a two-lane coastal highway that meanders through small towns and mountain passes; or by Interstate 5, which is located about 50 miles east of the coast and passes through Portland, Tacoma and Seattle into Canada. Perhaps the most interesting section of the Oregon coast is the area around the small city of Astoria, where the mighty Columbia River comes down from the mountains to the east and empties into the Pacific. Astoria is historically significant since it marks the location where the explorers Lewis and Clark first viewed the Pacific in 1805 after years of traversing the wilderness. Six years later, millionaire John Jacob Astor established a trading post there, which, by the end of the century developed into a regional center for the fishing, timber, fur-trading and shipping industries. The strategic location of the town and the treacherous nature of the waters also led to the establishment of important forts and Coast Guard installations in the region. This interesting history is told at the Columbia River Maritime Museum and Fort Stevens, the only mainland military installation fired upon by the Japanese in World War II. Today, Astoria is also known as the gateway to the beach communities of the Oregon coast, which are populated by retirees, tourists and weekenders from Portland. One of the most interesting places to see along the coast is Cannon Beach, located about 30 miles south of Astoria. The wide beach there is enhanced by views of Haystack Rock, a 235-foot-high geological marvel that juts out of the sand just a few feet offshore. Families also will enjoy Seaside Beach, located closer to Astoria, with its beachfront promenade and worldwide sand castle championship. Seattle: Seattle is one of the nation’s major cities with a population of 3.6 million people in the metropolitan area. Known and respected today as the headquarters or founding place of major companies such as Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks, Nordstrom, UPS and Amazon, the city also has a reputation for its beautiful surroundings and a cosmopolitan outlook. It is built on several hills on a narrow strip of land bordering on Puget Sound and Lake Washington. In the distance, the Cascade mountain range and snow-clad Mt. Rainier are visible, along with evergreen forests. Seattle is reputed to have mild temperatures and frequent precipitation, but most visitors are able to work around the elements to take in several enjoyable sites. First, the 600-foot Seattle Space Needle, built for a 1962 World’s Fair, offers spectacular views of the region from its observation deck and revolving restaurant. Second, many people enjoy a visit to Pike’s Place Market, which features local merchants selling fresh seafood, produce, flowers and retail products. Third, people travel north of the city to Everett, Wash., to tour the Boeing Flight Aviation Center and see jets on the assembly line being designed and completed. Vancouver: Vancouver is an important stop along the Pacific coast. Located just 30 miles north of the Canadian border, Vancouver could have ended up being part of the United States if expansionists in Congress seeking a border with Great Britain at the 54th parallel rather than the 49th parallel had prevailed instead of President James Polk. Today, Vancouver has become a gateway into Canada for foreign investors and immigrants from Asia and elsewhere. Like Seattle, Vancouver has a large harbor for shipping, is protected from harsher norther weather by the surrounding mountains and separated from the Pacific by the 400-mile-long Vancouver Island to the west. These natural features plus a favorable business climate have made Vancouver a popular place for movie and TV production, world festivals and the arts in general. Other prominent industries in Vancouver include computer software, forestry and consumer products. Vancouver is densely populated with a high cost of living, but the city often is cited as having a high quality of life for residents and many outdoor attractions for visitors. Like much of the northwest, it is not hard to find tours or guides offering activities from whale watching and plane rides to kayaking and hiking in this outdoorsy city. For the less adventurous, one feature is Stanley Park, which recently was named the top park in the world by TripAdvisor. Stanley Park is adjacent to the downtown area and includes more than 1,000 acres of public land on the water with forest trails, playgrounds, an aquarium, beaches and wildlife. Granville Island is considered a must-see attraction because this restored industrial district offers hundreds of shops, theaters and markets all in one location. Glenn Carberry of Norwich is a local attorney who practices in New London. A frequent traveler, he has visited more than 50 countries and more than 100 World Heritage sites. He writes for The Day about the places to which he has traveled with his wife, Kimberly. Stanley Park, recently named the top park in the world by TripAdvisor, and Canada Place Wharf in Vancouver.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The road to Mars is getting closer every day. Even with Elon Musk’s grand dreams of colonizing the Red Planet, his vision is much more difficult that you think. It requires a lot of planning, much of which I’m sure Mr. Musk has thought about. But even if he doesn’t begin to think about it, NASA is and it is enlisting other companies to help develop the tools necessary for this dream to be a reality. During the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnership (or NextSTEP) Board Agency Announcement, NASA announced it has selected six companies to begin the research and development for concepts, tools and ideas that will be integral to reaching Mars and beyond. Some of these concepts improve the already in place components of space exploration, but their ultimate goal is to turn these concepts into useful space habitat exercises that can be regularly accomplished, and not just live in our imaginations. The six companies chosen are Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, Nanorocks, Bigelow Aerospace and Boeing. The different concepts the companies are working on range from designing logistic modules for shuttle resupply missions to creating unmanned cargo spacecrafts. Some of their ideas even involve building long-duration habitats that will be constructed in space. Boeing is building a modular habitat system that it plans to send up to space in 2024. Some of these ideas are pretty wild, but probably the right out-of-the-box thinking that will get us to Mars sooner rather than later. Just contemplating about reaching Mars is crazy, but it’s also insanely cool that this might become a reality in our lifetime. We’ll keep our eyes on these companies to see if their efforts yield fruitful tools for our eventual trip to Mars.

October 16, 2016 12:24 AM WASHINGTON (AP) — Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Advertisement – Content Continues Below Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their phone service provider or retail store. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

To help make the transition, NASA is allowing private companies to add their own modules to the International Space Station and two industry leaders are preparing to launch their own habitats into orbit. NASA is moving from the development stage to the demonstration stage as it tests technology for a manned Mars mission and that means moving out of the International Space Station, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden told FastCompany. “We’re going to get out of ISS as quickly as we can. Whether it gets filled in by the private sector or not, NASA’s vision is we’re trying to move out.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nwbLls-PCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The space agency didn’t reach this decision over night. In 2014, NASA asked their private space partners to develop new ideas for the ISS and they received a ton of innovative ideas. In response to the flood of inquiries, NASA decided to allow private companies to attach their own modules to the ISS in preparation for the launch of commercial space stations and the development of an economy in orbit. There’s no word yet on whether the crew of the private modules will be civilian contractors or NASA astronauts, but two companies are already planning the next phase of expansion. Bigelow Aerospace is building inflatable modules to attach to the ISS with plans to eventually build an entire expandable station that promises to be much more roomy than anything built with rigid modules. (Image by Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images) In 2006 and 2007, Bigelow launched two inflatable habitats into orbit, and this year, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module was attached to the ISS where it continues to be monitored by NASA astronauts. In 2020, Bigelow plans to launch two huge independent B330 inflatable space stations into orbit aboard United Launch Alliance rockets, Bigelow founder and CEO Robert Bigelow told Space.com. “This constitutes a stand-alone space station. It needs no other support, no other modules, no other kinds of facilities.” Launch Ready! Waiting for Sunday, Oct. 16 at 8:03 p.m. for lift off. #OA5 #Antares pic.twitter.com/v6UWJopaNu — NASA Wallops (@NASA_Wallops) October 14, 2016 Meanwhile, Axiom Space is planning to launch a more traditional rigid module to the ISS in 2020 and rent out space to private customers and foreign governments, chief engineer Mike Baine told Space.com. “There’s a lot of interest by other governments looking to get into the space arena. [Some will likely be] anchor customers.” Eventually, when NASA ditches the ISS in 2024 and watches it burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, the Axiom module will detach and hook up with another recently launched Axiom module to form an independent space station. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, along with several private space travel companies, hopes the commercial stations will help jumpstart a new economy in orbit above Earth, he wrote in a blog post. “A vibrant user community will be key to ensuring the economic viability of future space stations.” (Image by NASA/Getty Images) As part of that economy, the ULA, a Boeing and Lockheed Martin partnership, is building their own version of a reusable rocket, called a space truck, to carry cargo into low Earth orbit. Instead of reusing the first stage of the rocket, like SpaceX does, the ULA wants to reuse the second state, the part that normally carries the cargo to its final destination. The ULA envisions a fleet of space trucks and thousands of employees working in orbit above the Earth. Also competing for a spot in the developing cislunar economy in low Earth orbit is Deep Space Industries, which is developing a prospecting spacecraft capable of mining water, in the form of ice, that can be used as fuel. Using water-based fuel obtained from passing space rocks would be much cheaper than hauling it up out of Earth’s gravity well and could allow the developing economy to flourish. What do you think of the new economy developing above Earth?

U.S., Canada ban Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from airliners by Joan Lowy, The Associated Press Posted Oct 14, 2016 9:43 pm EST Last Updated Oct 15, 2016 at 2:32 pm EST National World Passengers and flight crews are banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under emergency orders issued Friday by both Transport Canada and the U.S. Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The orders, which were effective immediately in Canada and at noon EDT Saturday in the U.S., say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

(WPVI) AP JOAN LOWY Saturday, October 15, 2016 Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which went into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (Information from the DOT): If passengers attempt to travel by air with their Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices, the phones may be confiscated and passengers may face fines. Passengers who attempt to evade the ban by packing their phone in checked luggage are increasing the risk of a catastrophic incident. Anyone violating the ban may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Passengers currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone. Samsung has provided guidance for customers about refund and replacement options, as well as how to contact wireless carriers, at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/. Samsung is also answering customers' questions at 1-844-365-6197. If an airline representative observes that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Note7 device prior to boarding an aircraft, the air carrier must deny boarding to the passenger unless and until the passenger divests themselves and their carry-on and checked baggage of the Samsung Galaxy Note7 device. Passengers absolutely should not pack the phones in their checked luggage. If a flight crew member identifies that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 device while the aircraft is in flight, the crew member must instruct the passenger to power off the device, not use or charge the device while aboard the aircraft, protect the device from accidental activation, including disabling any features that may turn on the device, such as alarm clocks, and keep the device on their person and not in the overhead compartment, seat back pocket, nor in any carry-on baggage, for the duration of the flight.

Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

Monday 14 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 07:25 / GMT - 03:55 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories World Sat Oct 15, 2016 4:38 Russian S300, S400 Air-Defense Systems Ready to Confront Possible US Attacks in Syria Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- The Russian Defense Ministry warned against any military attack on its forces deployed in Syria, adding that the country's most advanced air-defense systems are ready to give a crushing response to any possible assault by the US. "Russia will use its S300 and S400 anti-aircraft systems to target any attack on its naval base in Tartus and its airbase in Humeimim," the ministry said, adding, "The S300 and S400 air-defense missile shields can easily intercept and target any advanced model of stealth planes too." The S-300 system can be used to defend against aircraft and cruise missiles. Meantime, it can intercept ballistic missiles. As tensions between Washington and Moscow flare, the Russian military is warning the United States that it had the ability to target stealth aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit that might be operating over Syria with the Almaz-Antey S-400 (NATO: SA-21 Growler) and the recently arrived S-300V4 (NATO: SA-23 Gladiator) air and missile defense systems. However, Western defense officials and analysts are skeptical and note that both the F-22 and the F-35 were specifically designed to counter those Russian-developed weapons, the National Interest reported. "Russian S-300, S-400 air defense systems deployed in Syria's Humeimim and Tartus have combat ranges that may surprise any unidentified airborne targets,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Russian state media outlet Sputnik.  “Operators of Russian air defense systems won't have time to identify the origin of airstrikes, and the response will be immediate. Any illusions about ‘invisible’ jets will inevitably be crushed by disappointing reality.” However, while Moscow makes bold claims about the counter-stealth capabilities of their S-400 and S-300V4 air defense systems, the fact remains that even if Russian low-frequency search and acquisitions radars can detect and track tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft such as the F-22 or F-35, fire control radars operating in C, X and Ku bands cannot paint low observable (LO) jets except at very close ranges. Stealth is not—and never has been—invisibility, but it does offer greatly delayed detection so that a fighter or bomber can engage a target and leave before the enemy has time to react. Tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft must be optimized to defeat higher-frequency bands such the C, X and Ku bands—that’s just a simple matter of physics. There is a ‘step change’ in an LO aircraft’s signature once the frequency wavelength exceeds a certain threshold and causes a resonant effect. Typically, that resonance occurs when a feature on an aircraft—such as a tail-fin or similar— is less than eight times the size of a particular frequency wavelength. Fighter-sized stealth aircraft that do not have the size or weight allowances for two feet or more of radar absorbent material coatings on every surface are forced to make trades as to which frequency bands they are optimized for. That means that radars operating at a lower frequency band such as parts of the S or L band are able to detect and track certain stealth aircraft. But ultimately, to counter lower frequency radars, a larger flying-wing stealth aircraft design like the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit or the B-21 Raider—which lacks many of the features that cause a resonance effect—is a necessity. But at the UHF and VHF band wavelengths, designers are not trying to make the aircraft invisible—rather engineers hope to create a radar cross-section that will blend in with the background noise that is inherent to low-frequency radars. Low frequency radars can be used to cue fire control radars however. Additionally, some US adversaries have started to make an effort to develop targeting radars that operate at lower frequencies. However, those lower frequency fire-control radars exist only in theory—and are a long way off from being fielded.  “Stealth is ‘delayed detection’ and that delay is getting shorter. SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) radars are shifting their frequencies into lower frequency bands where U.S. stealth is less effective,” said Mark Gammon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F and EA-18G program manager for advanced capabilities, had told me some time ago. “Early warning radars are in the VHF spectrum where stealth has limited if any capability. These radars are networked into the SAM radars giving the SAM radars cued search.” But low-frequency radars do not themselves provide a “weapons quality” track that is needed to guide a missile onto a target. There are various techniques that have been proposed to use low frequency radars for such purposes, but none of those are likely to prove viable. US Air Force Col. Michael Pietrucha had described one possible approach to me to accomplish such a feat in an article I wrote for Aviation Week & Space Technology a few years ago. However, U.S. Air Force officials were dismissive of the technique. “Just because something is technically possible doesn't make it tactically feasible,” one Air Force official with extensive stealth aircraft experience explained. Meanwhile, operational Raptor pilots tell me “it would be really classified to discuss specific SAM counter tactics,” however, the F-22 is more than capable of defeating any of the current Russian surface-to-air missile systems that are currently or projected to be fielded. Hopefully, we will not have to find out the how effective the Raptor truly is during a shooting war over Syria—since conflicts can rapidly escalate out of control, as history loves to teach us over and over again . Despite the theoretical bases put forward by the National Interest report, the Russian air defense unit deployed in Humeimim and Tartus have managed to identify several radar evading aircraft of the US army from a long range in practice. Last week, a US spy plane was spotted flying off the coasts of Syria near the Russian base in Tartus while another one was picked up by radars as it was conducting reconnaissance operations over the Russian fleet near Crimea in the black sea, western websites said. The western websites that monitor military movements across the globe reported that a US spy plane of RC135W with tail number 62-4138 left Souda Bai Airbase in the Greek Crete Island and launched reconnaissance operation over the Russian navy fleet Southwest of Crimea's coast. The website added that another US P-8A spy plane with tail number 169958 also left Sigonella Airbase in Sicily on a reconnaissance mission over the Russian warships and base in Eastern Mediterranean Sea and Southern Cyprus. The US plane's spy operation near Syria's waters lasted for around half an hour before it moved towards Lebanon. Also last month, a US P-8A Poseidon spy plane was spotted again flying off the coast of Lebanon and Syria, near Tartus. The US Navy reconnaissance plane was spotted at the time flying a few kilometers away from Russia’s Humeimim airbase in Syria. The P-8A Poseidon aircraft flew close to Syria’s Mediterranean coast where Russia’s naval task force operates. It was the fourth time that a US spy plane was spotted near the Russian base in Humeimim. Humeimim military airport, Southeast of the city of Lattakia, is Russia’s strategic center of operations against the ISIL and other terrorist groups. According to reports, the P-8A Poseidon aircraft, designed and built for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, took off from the Mediterranean island of Sigonella in Sicily. The aircraft, with tail number 168761 then flew over Syria’s coast for one and a half hours in close proximity to the Russian airbase and logistics facility located at Tartus port, South of Lattakia. Observers believe that the US spy planes have recently increased their flights over Syria to gather intelligence on the Syrian army and the Russian forces' moves in the region. According to reports, on August 30, September 2 and September 17, the P-8A Poseidon spy plane was also spotted flying toward the vicinity of the Russian airbase.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Battle for Mosul Day 27: Iraqi Forces Win Back Ancient City of Nimrud Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- After seizing control of Dhahiat al-Assad and Menyan in the weekend, the Syrian army and popular forces continued their advances against the terrorist groups in New Aleppo, Jamiat al-Mostaqbal, Menyan and al-Hamdaniyeh regions.

The order is part of the Commercial Crew Program, which was started by NASA six years ago as a way of making sure the United States continues to have human access to space. NASA ordered a first mission from SpaceX back in November of 2015, and it ordered two from Boeing — the other company involved in the CCP — in May and December of 2015. NASA initially embarked on this program because the Space Shuttle program was scheduled to end in 2011.

EMBED </>More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://6abc.com/video/embed/?pid=1556238" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. (WPVI) AP JOAN LOWY Saturday, October 15, 2016 Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which went into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (Information from the DOT): If passengers attempt to travel by air with their Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices, the phones may be confiscated and passengers may face fines. Passengers who attempt to evade the ban by packing their phone in checked luggage are increasing the risk of a catastrophic incident. Anyone violating the ban may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Passengers currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone. Samsung has provided guidance for customers about refund and replacement options, as well as how to contact wireless carriers, at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/. Samsung is also answering customers' questions at 1-844-365-6197. If an airline representative observes that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Note7 device prior to boarding an aircraft, the air carrier must deny boarding to the passenger unless and until the passenger divests themselves and their carry-on and checked baggage of the Samsung Galaxy Note7 device. Passengers absolutely should not pack the phones in their checked luggage. If a flight crew member identifies that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 device while the aircraft is in flight, the crew member must instruct the passenger to power off the device, not use or charge the device while aboard the aircraft, protect the device from accidental activation, including disabling any features that may turn on the device, such as alarm clocks, and keep the device on their person and not in the overhead compartment, seat back pocket, nor in any carry-on baggage, for the duration of the flight.

Story continues below The orders, which are effective immediately in Canada and at noon EDT Saturday in the U.S., say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. READ MORE: Samsung Note 7 recall to cost at least $5.3 billion Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. WATCH: Samsung Note7: Use gloves or return to store?  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. READ MORE: Samsung expands Galaxy Note 7 recall in US to include replacement phones Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. READ MORE: Samsung sending Galaxy Note 7 users fireproof boxes, gloves The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. READ MORE: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall ranks among the largest product failures Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

Read more Air NZ bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from all flights Last updated 22:55, October 15 2016 SIMON MAUDE / FAIRFAX NZ Samsung Galaxy Note7's have been banned from flights into the United States. Air New Zealand has issued a total ban on fire-prone Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on all of its flights from 5am on Sunday morning. A spokeswoman said the airline strongly advised travellers not to bring these devices to the airport with them.   "They cannot be accepted for travel and there is no storage facility available for them at our check in areas," the spokeswoman said. GEORGE FREY / GETTY IMAGES Spark have notified customers of the first reported case of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 exploding in New Zealand. It came after the United States Department of Transportation issued a total ban on passengers and flight crews bringing the phones on airline flights into and out of the United States. READ MORE: * NZ Post tells Samsung Note 7 owners not to put them in the mail * US Samsung Note 7 recall expanded to replacement phones in US * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 pulled from sale, users told to turn off "Air New Zealand apologises to customers for any inconvenience, however, this is an FAA and US DOT safety requirement." BRIAN GREEN/REUTERS This fire-prone smartphone began smoking inside a Southwest Airlines plane on October 5, 2016. The Civil Aviation Authority this week told airlines they had to ensure passengers turn off any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices when travelling, but fell short of an outright ban. The US order, which goes into effect at 5am on Sunday morning New Zealand time, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones worldwide, citing a battery manufacturing error, and discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. Ad Feedback In New Zealand, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 buyers will be given $100 compensation – on top of a cash or credit refund – to compensate them for the "stress" and inconvenience of having to return the smartphones. New Zealand Post has told consumers not to post or courier Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones back to retailers because of the safety risk. Instead it is telling buyers to return the smartphones to retailers in person. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle.

Samsung’s brand mystique seriously at risk after death of the Note 7 Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a UN agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.   Most Popular Viewed 1 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 2 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 3 In extraordinary move, Obama condemns FBI for Clinton email disclosure: ‘We don’t operate on innuendo’ 4 Obama caught in middle of unseemly spat over Clinton emails 5 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 3 Hong Kong government slammed for taking too long to test hairy crab samples for dioxins 4 Six things you need to know about Hong Kong’s proposed retirement protection scheme 5 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election Commented 1 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 2 Mainland paper slams Hong Kong independence advocates in 1,000-word commentary 3 Tesla urges Hong Kong government to keep e-vehicle tax breaks 4 Driver of BMW arrested after cyclist killed in Kowloon Bay crash 5 Blow to Brexit as British High Court rules parliament vote needed to trigger EU exit Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2016 2H       You may also like China How new Xinjiang party boss became front runner in race to be one of China’s most powerful men 30 Oct 2016 - 11:24pm 2 Shaping up: Home-grown app, Green WALK Hong Kong, is the pick of the mobile apps In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Why bankers and cocaine are best of friends 30 Oct 2016 - 8:46pm 9 American Express corporate payment solutions help businesses drive savings for growth Presented by: American Express Hong Kong Illegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights 30 Oct 2016 - 8:07am 21 Hong Kong Should history lessons in schools include details about Hong Kong’s 1967 riots? 30 Oct 2016 - 10:29pm 9 China A billion billion calculations per second: where no computer has gone before 29 Oct 2016 - 8:00am 4 Hong Kong Meet Viveca Chow, Broadway musical star from Hong Kong Oct 28th 2016, 11:57pm World Plane bursts into flame at Chicago airport Oct 29th 2016, 3:45pm China China has world’s most skewed sex ratio at birth – again 27 Oct 2016 - 10:04pm 2 Post Magazine The Asian men who buy sex with Cambodian virgins 28 Oct 2016 - 10:54am 3 Post Magazine With the paedophile-hunters on the streets of Phnom Penh 28 Oct 2016 - 10:55am 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries.

Photo / Creative Commons / eosdude Air New Zealand is investigating further steps to contain burning objects on planes as concern about the danger of lithium battery-powered devices catching fire grows. At least three United States airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. An Air New Zealand spokeswoman said the airline carries flame resistant gloves on board its aircraft to protect a person who may be handling an object that has overheated or caught fire. ''In addition to this we are currently looking into other possible containment equipment options." The Associated Press reports the issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. The US Federal Aviation Administration has taken the unusual step of warning passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. The warnings are also given on aircraft operating in New Zealand. The first airline to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment, AP reports. The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire. Continued below.

New Zealand customer reports 'incident' with Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone Air NZ offers cheap seats to Taranaki The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 1760C. They sell for $2350 each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount. Virgin America has installed fire-containment bags on all its planes, said spokeswoman Jennifer Thomas. The airline has about 60 jets. Delta Air Lines noted yesterday on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags. The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year. In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners."This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events," Durrant said. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires. Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades. Lithium ion batteries used to power Boeing 787 Dreamliner systems also caused problems when that plane was introduced, with a small number catching fire and forcing the global fleet to be grounded. Boeing came up with a fire containment system where batteries are housed on the aircraft. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) Posted: Friday, October 14, 2016 4:18 pm | Updated: 8:02 pm, Fri Oct 14, 2016. Gov't bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from airliners Associated Press | WASHINGTON (AP) — Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their phone service provider or retail store.

A planned nighttime launch this weekend from Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore will be visible along parts of the coast if the skies are clear. Liftoff is scheduled for 8:03 p.m. Sunday. The mission seeks to put the state-owned launch pad back into business. It's been idle since the 2014 rocket explosion that caused about $15 million in damage. The Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority owns and operates the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on an island that NASA uses to launch small research rockets. Most of those launches are suborbital, and they've continued. Orbital and SpaceX are the two private companies that NASA has hired to keep the space station stocked. As Orbital returns to the repaired launch pad, some industry observers are still waiting to see if the private company model will succeed in the long run. "Unless Congress is willing to spend a lot more money on NASA, this is what we have to work with," said Marco Caceras, senior analyst and director of space studies at the think tank Teal Group. SpaceX and Boeing are supposed to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next year or two. In the meantime, the United States is relying on Russia to get astronauts there. NASA began investing in private companies for space station missions after President George W. Bush announced the space shuttle would retire (the last flight was in 2011). The agency needed to refocus its efforts on bigger missions, such as sending humans to Mars, so it turned to private industry. The agency spent nearly $800 million to help SpaceX and Orbital develop launch systems, less than half of each project's cost. Now it is paying the two companies billions to ship cargo to the space station. Since 2012, Space X and Orbital have shipped food, equipment and scientific experiments on 12 successful missions. Two have failed. Orbital lost its rocket and NASA cargo shortly after liftoff from Wallops on Oct. 28, 2014. A liquid oxygen turbo pump caught fire in a decades-old Russian engine, according to a NASA investigation. Since then, Orbital has fulfilled its contract by launching from Cape Canaveral using another company's rocket. "Orbital ATK has conducted two resupply missions using our Cygnus spacecraft aboard an Atlas V (rocket) in December 2015 and March 2016 in order to continue to support NASA space station operations while we worked to put Antares back into service," said Orbital spokeswoman Trina Helquist. For Sunday's planned launch at Wallops, Orbital will use a newer engine, also Russian built, on its Antares rocket. On June 28, 2015, a SpaceX rocket with cargo for the space station broke up about two minutes after liftoff from Cape Canaveral. Investigators blamed a failed strut assembly on the rocket's upper stage. The problem has since been fixed. Associated Press staff writer Steve McMillan contributed to this report.

The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. In this Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2016 photo, Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphones are displayed at its shop in Seoul, South Korea. Samsung Electronics said Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, it has expanded its recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in the U.S. to include all replacement devices the company offered as a presumed safe alternative after the original Note 7s were found prone to catch fire. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

Newsmakers LAFF TV Follow Us BREAKING NEWS 2 killed in violent West Hills car crash Full Story Email share share tweet email NEWS Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones banned from US airliners Email share share tweet email none In this Sept. 8, 2016 file photo, a Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is displayed at the headquarters of South Korean mobile carrier KT. (AP Photo) AP Friday, October 14, 2016 WASHINGTON -- Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. MORE: Smoking Samsung Note7 prompts airplane evacuation Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. MORE: Samsung halts sales of Galaxy Note7 after replacements catch fire "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their phone service provider or retail store. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. MORE: Have a Samsung Galaxy Note7? Here are your options Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL DETROIT -- A senior leader of the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center will be honored at the 21st Women of Color Science and Technology, Engineering and Math Conference Oct. 15. Juanita Harris, AMRDEC's director of Weapons Development and Integration Directorate, was nominated for the Professional Achievement-Government Award. "I am very honored to get the award, especially knowing [former U.S. Army Materiel Command commanding] General Via nominated me," said Harris. "I'm humbled by the opportunity to be recognized in this way. I don't think I'm doing anything more than others, but I do feel I am a role model for the Center and my organization." Since 1995, Women of Color magazine's annual conference recognizes significant contributions of women in STEM fields to attract and leverage talent in America's scientific and technical workforce. Harris has been recognized as a pathfinder in her field, becoming the first African-American woman from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, selected for the government's Senior Executive Service. In her current role, Harris manages the science and technology portfolio for AMRDEC's missile systems. "This has been a challenging opportunity for me," Harris said. "Our focus is to provide new technologies, new capabilities to create an advantage. We want to provide that overmatch for the Warfighter. A part of what my organization does is to develop those cross cutting, new, innovative solutions." She began her career in 1985 as an engineer for Boeing, eventually making her way to Huntsville in 2000. Before her current position, Harris was the deputy director for AMRDEC's Aviation Development Directorate. As a native of East Saint Louis, Illinois, Harris attributes her successes in life to her family and various mentors throughout her career. She says it is her experiences and qualifications she hopes people recognize, not solely the color of her skin. "I think there need to be more opportunities for not just women, but minorities in general. If you look at me and all that you see is the fact that I'm a female and black, then I think you're missing the real benefit I bring to the organization; the diversification of the activities I've worked on, my expertise in developing a workforce, my leadership, my critical thinking. It is the culmination of everything that I bring to the table." The Women of Color STEM conference is a three-day event that offers career networking opportunities and hosts award ceremonies. Attendees have the opportunity to meet and learn from executives representing Fortune 500 companies that are committed to diversity and to the advancement of women in the workforce.

The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

(Reuters/Kim Hong) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Batteries October 14, 2016 Battery fires continue to vex airlines, even after Samsung scrapped production of its exploding Galaxy Note 7. Some carriers are putting up a new line of defense against burning mobile devices: bright red fire-containment bags that can withstand temperatures of 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit (1760 degrees Celsius). In a call with investors this week, Delta Air Lines said it would add fire-resistant bags to its fleet. Delta CEO Ed Bastian specified that the bags were fully capable of containing lithium-battery fires. Since September, the US Federal Aviation Administration and several airlines have been instructing passengers not to turn on, charge or pack in checked luggage the doomed Samsung smartphone model. On Friday, the US Department of Transportation issued an emergency ban of any Galaxy Note7 phones on all air transport, including cargo. But smartphone bans are nearly impossible to enforce because so many devices look so similar. Even after the Note 7 was recalled, a replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 started smoking on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. Delta has more than 900 aircraft, all of which will eventually get the bags. The first bags will go to 166 planes used on transoceanic routes and some Boeing 757s used for domestic service, the airline told The Associated Press. The rest of the fleet will be equipped next year, the airline said. Alaska Airlines and Virgin America have also added fire-containment bags to their fleets, the AP said. The FAA reported 23 incidents of smoke, fire, explosion or extreme heat from lithium ion batteries or unknown types through Sept. 7 in airplanes or airports. That’s up from just 16 in all of 2015 and nine in 2014, so on-board fire-containment bags may soon become as common as seatbelts. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL DETROIT -- A senior leader of the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center will be honored at the 21st Women of Color Science and Technology, Engineering and Math Conference Oct. 15. Juanita Harris, AMRDEC's director of Weapons Development and Integration Directorate, was nominated for the Professional Achievement-Government Award. "I am very honored to get the award, especially knowing [former U.S. Army Materiel Command commanding] General Via nominated me," said Harris. "I'm humbled by the opportunity to be recognized in this way. I don't think I'm doing anything more than others, but I do feel I am a role model for the Center and my organization." Since 1995, Women of Color magazine's annual conference recognizes significant contributions of women in STEM fields to attract and leverage talent in America's scientific and technical workforce. Harris has been recognized as a pathfinder in her field, becoming the first African-American woman from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, selected for the government's Senior Executive Service. In her current role, Harris manages the science and technology portfolio for AMRDEC's missile systems. "This has been a challenging opportunity for me," Harris said. "Our focus is to provide new technologies, new capabilities to create an advantage. We want to provide that overmatch for the Warfighter. A part of what my organization does is to develop those cross cutting, new, innovative solutions." She began her career in 1985 as an engineer for Boeing, eventually making her way to Huntsville in 2000. Before her current position, Harris was the deputy director for AMRDEC's Aviation Development Directorate. As a native of East Saint Louis, Illinois, Harris attributes her successes in life to her family and various mentors throughout her career. She says it is her experiences and qualifications she hopes people recognize, not solely the color of her skin. "I think there need to be more opportunities for not just women, but minorities in general. If you look at me and all that you see is the fact that I'm a female and black, then I think you're missing the real benefit I bring to the organization; the diversification of the activities I've worked on, my expertise in developing a workforce, my leadership, my critical thinking. It is the culmination of everything that I bring to the table." The Women of Color STEM conference is a three-day event that offers career networking opportunities and hosts award ceremonies. Attendees have the opportunity to meet and learn from executives representing Fortune 500 companies that are committed to diversity and to the advancement of women in the workforce. This award comes after two leadership awards Harris previously received in 2015 including the inaugural Dred Scott Freedom Award for government service in December 2015 and the Women Honoring Women award for technology in September 2015. --- The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to ensure decisive overmatch for unified land operations to empower the Army, the joint warfighter and our nation. RDECOM is a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Materiel Command.

Brookfield, up 16% year-to-date, owns office and retail property, toll roads, hydroelectric dams, transmission lines and ports. Macauley said the company's "scale, global operating footprint, and contrarian approach" make them among the best at this in the world. The Hennessy Focus Fund is up 3.1% thus far in 2016, according to Morningstar. The $2.4 billion fund has returned an average of 8.5% annually over the past three years, outpacing 87% of its rivals in Morningstar's mid-cap growth category. Macauley is also bullish on shares of American Tower (AMT) , which are up 18% thus far in 2016. Macauley said the largest cellular tower owner in the U.S. is rapidly growing its international portfolio and is benefiting from the rollout of 4G technologies to support the surging demand for mobile data. "Mobile data demand growth has been explosive and that will provide a decade or more of growth at American Tower," said Macauley. Hexcel  (HXL) is another one of Macauley's top picks. The advanced materials company has seen its stock drop 9% thus far in 2016, but Macauley believes Hexcel has excellent growth prospects as Boeing and Airbus compete to make lighter, more durable and more fuel-efficient planes. "Aerospace customers are increasingly using carbon fiber over aluminum, growing Hexcel's addressable market," said Macauley. "And as the most vertically integrated supplier in the industry, Hexcel is better able to control costs, quality and delivery of its product." Finally, Macauley is a fan of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) , down 9% year-to-date, saying the media giant has "built-in pricing power" for its cable networks and the best growth profile in the space.

Lockheed Martin is the only competitor for the GBSD contract to replace the USAF's legacy LGM-30 Minuteman ICBMs (pictured) to have revealed its industry team. Northrop Grumman and Boeing have also submitted bids but have not revealed partners. (USAF) The company's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) programme team includes General Dynamics, which is working on the system's command and control capability; Draper Laboratories, which is developing guidance, navigation, and control systems; Moog, which is providing cross-vector control systems; and Bechtel, which is working on launch facilities. John Karas, Lockheed Martin vice president and GBSD programme manager, also told reporters that the company is considering both Aerojet Rocketdyne and Orbital ATK to work on the propulsion system for the new missile. "Each company has different benefits and advantages for different stages," Karas said of the engine vendors. "It's too early to tell, but both of those teams are working with us." Boeing and Northrop Grumman also confirmed their intent to bid for the work but have declined to name industrial partners. The programme will replace the USAF's ageing Minuteman III missile. All three companies delivered their proposals for the work to the air force on the 11 October deadline, according to company statements. The USAF released a request for proposals (RfP) for GBSD on 29 July. The service revealed its plan to award up to two 36-month technology maturation and risk reduction contracts by the end of the fiscal year and to field a new system in the late 2020s. The RfP and its supporting documents are classified 'secret'. GBSD, previously known as Minuteman IV, is expected to leave much of the legacy infrastructure and even some associated components in place, officials have said. Want to read more?

We will not be rushed into a decision. It will not be mix of both. It has to be done at right price. So, we have to be very careful. We have closed many issues related to aircraft purchase. It could be more than 100 aircraft,” he said. He said the budget airline is also mulling to operate flights from Hyderabad to Tier-II cities like Nagpur, Calicut and Bhubaneswar. The Airline has continuously been making profits for the few quarters on the back of operational efficiency, he claimed.

Beautiful scenery, jovial ground crew, and white-knuckle crosswinds that mean the autopilot stays off; according to the pilots we questioned, that's the secret of job satisfaction.  1. Naples, Italy “The views during descent and approach are breath-taking! I enjoy the challenges this airport brings due to the steeper than normal approaches to both runways. The approach to Runway 06 is also offset requiring a visual transition to line up with the runway centreline. Stepping out onto the ramp into the sunshine during the turnaround is always an added bonus! Instagram : by pilotbaffo - Landing in Naples #vesuvio #napoli #golfodisorrento #pilotjob #pilotview #pilotlife #la… pic.twitter.com/1ARuE9x7ql— ✈ Dorian BENTEJAC ✈ (@DeltaBravo33) November 3, 2015 “Closer to home, my absolute favourite is London Heathrow. On a clear day the views of the city approaching Runways 27L and 27R from the north are amazing. The air traffic controllers here are second to none, another reason I love flying into this airport.  It always amazes me the outstanding job they do in precisely managing the heavy flow of traffic both into and out of here.” – Captain Sonya Bissett, Aer Lingus 2. Christchurch, New Zealand “I love to fly into Christchurch as it has the most incredible landscape: it's the ultimate scenic flight. Alps covered in snow, valleys filled with cerulean blue snow melt and patchwork fields covered in tiny white sheep-dots. After landing we're always met with a friendly Kiwi smile and a subtle ribbing as to how we're doing in the rugby or cricket.” – Captain Mark Goodwin, Qantas The view landing into Christchurch looks so warm!!⛄️ pic.twitter.com/x8DUpNl5Pr— Nathan Jack (@nathanjack10) July 27, 2016 3. Leeds Bradford, UK “Returning to Leeds Bradford after the dry plains of Spain is always a treat. From the flight deck I can see the beautiful rolling hills of Yorkshire. What always surprises me is just how green the landscape is. “I also love going into Gibraltar. It has such a great approach as you sweep around the massive rock with a view of all the gigantic tankers moored out in the bay. It really is a truly epic arrival but no chance to take photos – for obvious safety reasons!” – Pilot Paul Fox, Monarch 4. Funchal, Madeira, Portugal “Funchal is always exciting. The airport is on the stunning volcanic island of Madeira, rising out of the Atlantic in an archipelago of a few small islands. The runway is carved into the side of a mountain with a steep slope on one side and a 200ft drop into the sea on the other. Half of the runway is actually built on stilts as there was not enough land to build a runway of sufficient length. “All approaches to Funchal are visual: pilots must use their high levels of training, judgement and flying skill to negotiate the curving approach to the runway. This is while managing the wind conditions that swirl around the mountain and cause quickly changing cross and tailwinds. Only certain pilots are certified to fly there.” – Captain Ally Wilcox, British Airways 5. Innsbruck, Austria “Innsbruck Kranebitten Airport in Austria is my favourite airport. The views of the Alps that we get from the flight deck on most days are just amazing. “We get special training every year in the simulator for this airport as it’s especially challenging: the mountains that surround the airport; the possibility of heavy snow; strong winds that can come down the Brenner Pass causing quite bad turbulence; and a rather short runway. But that makes it even more rewarding flying there!” – Pilot Rob Kooyman, Monarch @MarkGrigg @markv747 #windowweekend on the approach to land at Innsbruck. Not exactly a normal view! pic.twitter.com/y9z91TxQIF— Cam Chapman (@CamRChapman) September 10, 2016 6. Jersey, UK “My favourite UK airport would be Jersey. It is technically interesting: it has a fairly short runway for a medium-sized jet aircraft which requires careful planning and landing distance calculations. When the doors are opened it is almost always warmer than mainland UK – it just shouts ‘holiday time’ at you. “Further afield, my current favourite is Athens. We normally arrive onto the northerly runway 03L due to prevailing local winds. It’s a very early arrival and we watch the sun rise on the way in. After landing we are usually met by Stavros our local crazy Greek handler who has us all laughing with his latest escapades – often in rather too much detail…” – DB, European Freight operator 7. London Heathrow, UK “I love arriving at London Heathrow. First officers, who sit on the right side of the cockpit, usually have the best views when landing. I love to see the Thames, and the old docklands once famed for their ‘forest of masts’, a reminder of London’s great maritime history that’s somehow particularly pleasing to contemplate from the flight deck of a modern-day vessel like a 747. Hello London! #london #uk #aircraft #landing #heathrow #skyline #theshard #towerbridge #thames #model #modellife #luxury #jetset #lifestyle pic.twitter.com/wvBBDiHAKj— Carmen PK (@CarmenPKu) October 3, 2016 “Cape Town is also spectacular. After a long, quiet overnight journey across Europe and from one end of Africa to the other, there’s nothing quite like the sight of Table Mountain rising just as dawn breaks. From the air, looking out at one of the world’s most beautiful intersections of land and sea, it’s obvious why this city remains one of the most popular destinations for crew and customers alike. “It’s also handy for Diaz Beach, my favourite beach in the world, which is near the Cape of Good Hope. It’s at the bottom of a challenging set of steps, and it’s often too rough and cold to swim here, but it’s the perfect place to put on your headphones, catch some sun, and watch two oceans at work.” – Pilot Mark Vanhoenacker, British Airways Rt"@vargasmoni: Cape Town seen from the cockpit ... #pilotsview #pilotlife 😊✈️🌈 ©® pic.twitter.com/3M69uX8lem"— laty (@laty72) April 5, 2015 8. New York, USA “JFK's 'Canarsie' approach is my personal favourite. Named after the navigation aid (VOR) on which it is based, this approach is essentially a cloud break manoeuvre to runway 13L at Kennedy, designed to get you in position to complete the landing visually. “Quite often given at short notice, this can be a challenging approach in a large aircraft, and a daunting one if the weather is poor. It is one of very few approaches in a large commercial aircraft where a pilot has the opportunity to switch all the automation off and fly the aircraft manually whilst remaining visual with the runway on a curved descent profile, often with a healthy tailwind until close to the runway.” – Captain Michael Landy, Aer Lingus @MarkGrigg #windowweekend -YMMT out of JFK on the sleeper service 182 #wannagoback! pic.twitter.com/x4M86949xl— Otto Lillebø (@OttoLillebo) September 10, 2016 9. Hamilton Island, Whitsundays, Australia “The approach to Hamilton takes you across beautiful island beaches and turquoise ocean vistas. Yachts are regularly in the vicinity and the airport is next to a marina. The surroundings, along with the demeanour of the staff, make you feel more relaxed as soon as you arrive. It makes you never want to leave!” – Captain Al Crawford, Qantas Landing at Hamilton Island Credit: alamy 10. Stavanger, Norway “One of my favourite approaches is on to Runway 18 at Stavanger Sola Airport in Norway. On a clear day, flying down the coastline and then over the lakes as you approach the airport is absolutely stunning.” – First Officer Hannah Vaughan, British Airways  11. Gibraltar “Gibraltar can be rather challenging with the limits on the wind as it rolls around the rock and can make it extremely turbulent on landing, but what I really like is the fact it's also rather an old school approach.  They have no landing aids at Gibraltar, so it’s back to basics: just the stick and rudder.  Gibraltar landing is as dramatic as ever... pic.twitter.com/BtRvBJEdG2— Chris Stringer (@ChrisStringer65) September 20, 2016 “No autopilot is used and it is hand flown visually; its great when landing onto the easterly runways and you come in low around the rock and pass the harbour for a touchdown on a very short runway. The main road into Gibraltar actually crosses the runway, so they stop the traffic and pedestrians. “The easiest place to land is Faro on the Algarve. The flight is very straight forward, with very little radio talk. Portuguese air traffic control is very chilled: the minute you come into Portuguese airspace you're cleared straight to final approach. Its ground crew are very relaxed too.” – Anonymous commercial pilot Strong crosswinds cause tricky landing for Boeing plane at Prague airport Play! 02:41 12. Beijing, China “When I started going to Beijing more than 20 years ago, all the aircraft cleaners (up to 20) stood on parade to meet the arrival. They stood at attention, to one side, all dressed in the same uniform, only breaking ranks to come on board once you had parked. It gave the impression to the crew and customers of being met by a guard of honour, and is something that will always remain with me. “The other destination that stands out for me is Malė in the Maldives which still has the most fantastic views of coral atolls that you are likely to see anywhere in the world.” – Captain Geoff Leask, British Airways The Maldives, as seen from above Credit: AP 13. Kittilä, Finland “My home country Kittilä, in northern Finland, is at its best during the winter months when there is hardly any daylight and often freezing fog, which gives it a fairytale-like lighting when the lights reflect upwards and there is a lot of snow. You are met by friendly staff, and the passengers are like children playing with in the snow when exiting the plane. During the winter season you might even see Santa Claus with his reindeer.   Worldwide, my pick would be Hong Kong with the tiny islands popping up from the sea and the high green hills around the populated area. One would never think that there is so much unpopulated land around the city with skyscrapers and millions of inhabitants. I guess there is hardly an office with a better view…” – Captain Camilla Sommar, Finnair 14. Ilulissat, Greenland “I recently flew to Ilulissat, a very remote coastal town in the Qaasuitsup municipality in western Greenland. With a population of only around 5,000 people and because of its location north of the Arctic Circle, it is one of the most peaceful places that I have ever been to. @MarkGrigg #windowweekend Flying over Greenland on board a BA A380 on the way to SFO pic.twitter.com/eBNfb9XLoX— Rob Taylor (@TaylorRob96) September 11, 2016 “The nearby Ilulissat Icefjord is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with astonishing giant white icebergs coming off the most productive glacier in the northern hemisphere. You can’t help but be captured by the serenity of the place.” – Jonny Nicol, Founder and CEO of Stratajet 15. San Francisco, USA “An amazing approach with spectacular and iconic views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. It's also a wonderful city to spend a few days in. “I normally set off for a bike ride at first light, cycling over the Golden Gate Bridge, stopping for breakfast in Sausalito before heading out into the hills in the Marin Headlands. To get back across the bay at the end of the day it's either the ferry or back up over the bridge depending on how much energy I have left.” – Senior First Officer Ian Palframan, British Airways @MarkGrigg Inbound SFO a few weeks ago #WindowWeekend @British_Airways #aviation pic.twitter.com/LfD6Xy0BcU— Ben Kay (@Benjamin_Kay) September 10, 2016 Follow the latest Telegraph Travel news Read more 24 Oct 2016, 1:30pm The confessions of an airline pilot 25 Sep 2016, 8:00am Quiz: The myths of air travel - can you sort fact from fiction? 01 Sep 2016, 10:00am What causes turbulence, and is it dangerous? 12 Jul 2016, 1:23pm Incredible photography by the pilots of Instagram - but is it legal? 04 Jul 2016, 3:07pm How dangerous is a bird strike?

The global aircraft heavy maintenance visit (HMV) market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.78% during the period 2016-2020. According to the report, rapid development in ultrasonic technique will be a key trend for market growth. Ultrasonic inspection is a sensitive method of nondestructive testing metallic, nonmetallic, magnetic, or nonmagnetic components of aircraft. This technique is widely used for the detection of internal defects in materials. With only single surface accessibility, the ultrasonic test can detect small flaws and estimate the location and size of the defect. Further, the report states that OEMs have a major role to play in the HMV market. They have the license for the supply of spare parts that cannot be purchased by PMAs. This domination has created a niche market for the MRO service providers or third parties, especially for the engine OEMs. Further, dynamic technology in new aircraft opens new opportunities for the OEMs to penetrate further in the market. In addition, they are augmenting their presence by extending aftermarket services to the end-users. Such moves by the OEMs inevitably challenge the presence of service providers and PMAs. Questions Answered: What will the market size be in 2020 and what will the growth rate be? What are the key market trends? What is driving this market? What are the challenges to market growth? Who are the key vendors in this market space? What are the market opportunities and threats faced by the key vendors? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the key vendors?

That’s changing, thanks to one remarkable drone technology.   The sight of a drone hurling across Rwandan skies usually inspires fear on the African continent as it’s regarded as an instrument of death. But instead of destroying lives, it’s here to save them, reports CBS News correspondent Debora Patta.  “What this represents is an opportunity ... to leapfrog over the absence of roads and provide first-world medical care to every single person in the country, regardless of where they live,” said Zipline co-founder Keller Rinaudo.  Zipline is a California-based tech company that uses engineers -- with experience at companies like NASA and Boeing -- to build and develop drones capable of accessing remote areas, dropping blood instead of bombs.  Play Video CBS Evening News American farmers getting assist from drones An increasing number of American farmers are using a high-tech tool to make their jobs a little easier. Drones are being put to work by a New Jer... Half of the 65,000 units of blood currently delivered by road each year are used in life-saving transfusions for women who lose too much blood during childbirth. Doctor Kajibwami Espoir said that in his rural hospital, it can take hours for the blood to arrive. The forward thinking Rwandan government’s wants to change this and is the first African nation to sign up with Silicon Valley to bring cutting edge technology to a nation’s infrastructure that is far more third world in places. “From this distribution center, we can serve thousands of doctors and health workers,” Rinaudo said. “And or those individuals, the experience of the system is super simple -- send a text message and we will send a product that will save a person’s life.” Each package is placed into a cardboard box attached to a paper parachute, then secured onto the drone before heading off on its life-saving mission using GPS coordinates. One flight took a mere five minutes to deliver blood to a clinic that is 33 miles from the nearest blood bank. The launch of the Zipline drones today puts Rwanda on the cusp of a technological revolution that could ultimately turn around its health care and see similar projects implemented across the continent. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops. The bags, which retail for $1,800 (£1,475) each, can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers to withstand temperatures up to 1,760C. Virgin America installed fire-containment bags on all its 60 or so planes, while Seattle-based Alaska Airlines finished adding them to its 219 planes in May. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines said that it too would be adding such bags to its more than 900 planes, prioritising the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, which will have two of the bags each by the end of the year. “This has been on the to-do list, but has been accelerated by recent events,” said Morgan Durrant, communications manager for Delta. Other airlines, including American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, have yet to deploy the bags, but do have aircrew training and fire extinguishers to deal with high-energy fires mid-flight. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Samsung Note7 customer shows charred remains of phone after it caught fire The issue of potentially dangerous lithium-ion batteries within electronics on aeroplanes has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. The US Federal Aviation Administration took the unusual step of warning passengers not to use or charge Note 7 devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. Other aviation authorities took similar steps, while airlines have been warning passengers both at airports and before take off to switch off the phones and not to charge them. In February the UN’s aviation agency prohibited cargo shipments of lithium-ion batteries on passenger aircraft over concerns by pilots and plane makers that they are a fire risk. Boeing also had issues with lithium-ion batteries built into its 787 Dreamliners that caught fire, forcing changes to the battery design that took five days to perform per plane.

By: AP | Seattle | Published:October 14, 2016 11:51 am Burlington Mall attack: Shortly after Arcan Cetin’s visit to the gun shop, Cetin used his stepfather’s .22-caliber Ruger rifle to open fire at a department store cosmetic counter at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, authorities said. (Source: AP Photo) Detectives have confirmed that the man accused of shooting and killing five people in a mall north of Seattle tried unsuccessfully to buy a handgun just hours before the slayings. Arcan Cetin, 20, was identified by members of the Skagit County Multi-Agency Response Team Wednesday as the man on surveillance video recorded by the gun store, according to agency spokesman Sgt. Mark Francis. The store owner said something was “off” about the man who came into her store between 5 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 23, asking about purchasing a .45-caliber handgun, the Seattle Times reported. The woman said she immediately decided not to sell him a firearm. The store owner asked the newspaper to only identify her by her first name, Dawn, because of safety concerns. Shortly after Cetin’s visit to the gun shop, Cetin used his stepfather’s .22-caliber Ruger rifle to open fire at a department store cosmetic counter at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, authorities said. He shot all five people in one minute and left the rifle with a 25-round magazine on a cosmetics counter before fleeing, police said in court documents. The victims ranged from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Cetin was arrested the following day about 30 miles from the mall near his apartment. He has been charged with five counts of premediated murder. After his arrest, Cetin acknowledged to detectives that he was the man on the video carrying a rifle inside the mall, “and he did bring the rifle into Macy’s and shot all five victims,” court documents said. Cetin, who has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged with assaulting his stepfather last year, was ordered by a court not to possess firearms. Cetin’s stepfather, David Marshall, previously told reporters the family had been trying to get Cetin help for mental health issues.

Follow Us On Facebook Follow Us On Twitter Most Viewed on the Web Popular on Twitter Receive Our Daily Headlines   HOME | Society (Click here for more) Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, Heir Apparent to the Thai Throne BANGKOK  The heir apparent to the throne of Thailand, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, receives a difficult legacy from his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the longest-reigning and most revered monarch in the history of Thailand who died Thursday in Bangkok. The only son of King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit will become King Rama X, the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty after his coronation. He was born on July 28, 1952 at the Dusit Palace in Bangkok, two years after his fathers ascension to the throne. He received his primary and secondary education at Chitralada School in Bangkok before continuing his studies in private schools in the United Kingdom and Australia. In 1975, he graduated from Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra, Australia. In 1987, he received a degree in Law from Sukhothai Thammathirat University in Bangkok. At the age of 20, he was named the crown prince in a ceremony in which he swore: I will be loyal and honest to the nation and the people. I will dedicate all my efforts and abnegation to fulfill my responsibilities for the prosperity, happiness and security of Thailand until my death. In the following years he served in the Directorate of Army Intelligence and the Royal Thai Army in 1975. He participated in training programs in Australia and the United States, and traveled to the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands for training in special warfare strategies, parachute, aircraft flight, helicopters and use of modern weapons. In Thailand, the crown prince took part in several military operations including counter-insurgency campaigns in the north and northeast of the country, and engaged in action to protect Cambodian refugee camps in Khao Lan, Trat province. His military career led him to hold the ranks of General in the Royal Thai Army, Admiral in the Royal Thai Navy, and Air Chief Marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force, as he took a prominent role in assuming ceremonial duties. His vocation for airplanes with more than 1,000 flight hours in different types of aircraft earned him the title Jouw Pha Nak Bin (Pilot Prince) in Thai press. In 1987, he won the annual Air Tactical Operations Competition held in Lopburi province. In 1994, he became an instructor pilot for the F-5 E/F fighter aircraft, a lightweight supersonic fighter which was manufactured by Northrop in the United States. The Prince has followed in his fathers footsteps in social development programs. Since he was young, he accompanied the King to rural communities to inaugurate or follow royal projects aimed to improve the sanitation and use of natural resources. Under the patronage of the heir apparent to the throne, six schools in underprivileged areas and 21 hospitals named Somdej Phra Yupparat have been established. In 2007, Vajiralongkorn piloted a commercial airplane, a 737-400 Boeing, from Bangkok to Chiang Mai in the north with the intention of raising funds to purchase medical equipment for hospitals in the southern provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat. As for his personal life, the prince has been married three times. His first marriage was in 1977 to Soamsavali Kitiyakara, a relative from maternal side, which ended with a divorce. Together they had one daughter, Bajrakitiyabha. Later he had a publicized and long relationship with the actress, Yuvadhida Polpraserth, which led to a wedding in 1994 and divorce in 1996. Their marriage produced four sons, who now reside abroad, and one daughter Sirivannavari Nariratana. His third marriage became public knowledge in 2005. He married to Srirasmi Suwadee, who bore him one son, Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, in the same year. The marriage came to an end in 2014, when a scandal involving the family of Srirasmi over abuse of power erupted and they were all stripped of their titles.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

One of the first airlines to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment.

The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 3200 degrees Fahrenheit.

"This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events,'' Durrant said. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires.

Arcan Cetin, 20, was identified by members of the Skagit County Multi-Agency Response Team Wednesday as the man on surveillance video recorded by the gun store, according to agency spokesman Sgt. Mark Francis. The store owner said something was "off" about the man who came into her store between 5 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 23, asking about purchasing a .45-caliber handgun, the Seattle Times reported (https://goo.gl/1PsVgh ). The woman said she immediately decided not to sell him a firearm. The store owner asked the newspaper to only identify her by her first name, Dawn, because of safety concerns. Shortly after Cetin's visit to the gun shop, Cetin used his stepfather's .22-caliber Ruger rifle to open fire at a department store cosmetic counter at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, authorities said. He shot all five people in one minute and left the rifle with a 25-round magazine on a cosmetics counter before fleeing, police said in court documents. The victims ranged from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Cetin was arrested the following day about 30 miles from the mall near his apartment. He has been charged with five counts of premediated murder. After his arrest, Cetin acknowledged to detectives that he was the man on the video carrying a rifle inside the mall, "and he did bring the rifle into Macy's and shot all five victims," court documents said. Cetin, who has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged with assaulting his stepfather last year, was ordered by a court not to possess firearms. Cetin's stepfather, David Marshall, previously told reporters the family had been trying to get Cetin help for mental health issues. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Another View: US support for Saudi war on Yemen must end Thursday Oct 13, 2016 at 8:54 PM Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editors The following editorial appeared in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Saudi Arabia’s air strikes on a funeral in Yemen Saturday, killing at least 140, should be the last straw in America’s support of the kingdom in its intra-Islamic, Sunni vs. Shiite war in that tragic country. The Saudis took the occasion of a funeral in Sana, the Yemeni capital, of a patriarch of a large, prominent family to carry out a three-wave bombing attack on the hall where the ceremony was being held. One argument that President Barack Obama’s administration uses to sustain America’s policy of continued support for the Saudi-led coalition is that the intelligence the United States provides its air war against Yemen enables its planes to be more precise in hitting military rather than civilian targets. What that line of argument would lead to this time is either that it isn’t an accurate description of what is occurring, or that U.S. intelligence helped the Saudis target the attack on the funeral. Neither “explanation” is acceptable to American principles. What is likely more accurate is to refer to the fact that the United States has sold the Saudis and the other Sunni Persian Gulf Arab states the aircraft and technology that they are using to wage war against the Shiite Houthis in Yemen. The figure for sales to the Saudis is $100 billion during the Obama years. Companies profiting from the sales include Boeing, General Dynamics and United Technologies. The Department of Defense has yet to assure there are no U.S. co-pilots in the Saudi aircraft carrying out attacks in Yemen. The other argument used to justify continued U.S. support of the Saudis in their intra-Islamic war is that America is placating the kingdom, based on its opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement concluded last year. The Shiite Islamic republic exchanged its nuclear program for the immediate and middle future in return for an alleviation of economic and financial international sanctions against it. Unfortunately, at this time, Yemenis — citizens of the poorest country in the Mideast — are paying the price in blood to please the Saudis and their theocratic regime for the Iran deal. Saturday’s slaughter makes it clear that the time is long since past when the United States should stop using U.S. companies’ arms sales and defense of the Iran deal as reasons to continue to help Saudi Sunnis slaughter Yemenis, even if they are supported to a degree by Iran. A lethal attack on a funeral is simply an atrocity that qualifies as a war crime. The United States should disassociate itself from Saudi war-making quickly: Cancel the contracts if that is what is required to end U.S. involvement in this war.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen NEW YORK – Some airlines are taking extra steps to prevent a disaster in case a passenger’s device powered by a lithium ion battery catches fire during flight. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Story continues below The issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. READ MORE: Samsung sending Galaxy Note 7 users fireproof boxes, gloves The Federal Aviation Administration has taken the unusual step of warning passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. The first airline to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire. The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit. They sell for $1,800 each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount.

The airline, which is based in Burlingame, California, has about 60 jets. Delta Air Lines noted Thursday on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags. The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year. In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners.

Rep. Ted Lieu of California urged the Pentagon to suspend cooperation with a Saudi-led coalition conducting airstrikes in Yemen, saying in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry released on Wednesday that civilian casualties from the strikes “appear to be the result of war crimes.” A funeral struck by Saudi missiles last weekend killed 140 mourners and Lieu is requesting that US arms sales to Riyadh be suspended until a White House review is completed. The Peruvian Ministry of Defense has received a number of R-312AT helicopter radio systems from JSC Rosoboronexport, subsidiary of Russia’s Rostec State Corporation. Delivery of the systems comes as part of an offset deal in connection with 24 Mi-171Sh helicopters and is expected to save Lima over $12.5 million. Rosboronexport have also promised to allocate $1 million for the building of a helicopter training center for Peru if eight offset projects agreed to are implemented. Middle East & North Africa In response to missile attacks on US and allied vessels off the coast of Yemen, the Pentagon has ordered the US Navy to launch missile attacks at targets operated by Houthi rebels. On October 13, the USS Nitze fired three BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles at radar sites in Yemen which were believed to have been active during previous attacks and attempted attacks on vessels. A defense official said the radar sites were in remote areas where there was little risk of civilian casualties. The Houthis meanwhile, reiterated their denial that they were responsible for the attack on US warship the USS Mason. Europe As a way of saying sorry for the ditched Caracel military helicopter deal, Poland is to offer France alternative investment projects, according to the Polish Prime Minister. The previous Polish administration had agreed to buy 50 Airbus utility helicopters in April 2015 for $3.5 billion as part of efforts to modernize their military forces at a time of tensions with neighbor Russia. Beata Szydlo told Polish media that the French foreign minister will be presented with “cooperation proposals, when it comes to investment of another type, or a purchase of other equipment” when they make a visit to Warsaw, which is planned for the near future. Proposals for new tanks and aircraft have been submitted by the Italian armed forces for parliamentary approval. On October 11, the defense commission of the lower house of the Italian parliament began debating plans by the Italian military to buy the Centauro II tank and an updated version of its A-129 Mangusta helicopter. While once nothing more than a rubber stamp for military acquisitions, the parliament’s defense commission was given greater influence over defense spending due to legislation passed in 2012. They have until November 8 to offer an opinion on the purchases. Asia Pacific In order to curry favor with the Indian government, Saab will share their Advanced Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar with Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology with India they if they select the Gripen fighter. The list of sweeteners also includes the previous offer of co-developing India’s indigenously manufactured fighter aircraft Tejas MK1A by setting up a production line in India under the “Make in India” scheme. Company officials said that both the LCA and the Gripen are of similar class and also share the same General Electric engine citing commonality in maintenance and operation. Boeing has revealed some of the potential upgrades offered to Japan’s F-15Js. The company’s defense head in Japan announced that AESA radars, a new mission computer, a new electronic warfare suite, conformal fuel tanks, and additional missiles would all be included as part of any deal. A model on display at Boeing’s stand at this week’s Japan Aerospace show depicts an F-15 loaded with 16 Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles: double the load now available. Kawasaki Heavy Industries are confident that they can poach customers away from Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon aircraft in favor of their own P-1. The company said that customers looking to move away from their older P-1 Orions see a number of advantages in the Japanese anti-submarine warfare plane over its American counterpart. One advantage touted over the P-8A is the P-1’s four turbofan engines, as a single engine failure will not result in the termination of the mission and allows the plane to operate at lower altitudes.
