Whittington Follow Following Rate the news Is NASA looking at commercial alternative to the Orion? Deep space versions of the Boeing CST-100 and the SpaceX Dragon could fly to the moon and beyond Low NASA Budgets Threaten Spaceflight Safety: Report - space.com Advertisements #Donald Trump is not yet president of the United States but NASA is already drumming up some options for his incoming NASA Administrator concerning what kind of vehicles will take astronauts into deep #Space, according to Ars Technica. In a Request for Information concerning the Orion deep spaceship the space agency has quietly asked commercial companies if they might have any alternatives. Boeing and #SpaceX are already developing spacecraft that will take astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Blue Origin envisions taking passengers to low Earth orbit on its planned New Glenn launch vehicle and beyond in the follow on New Armstrong. The Orion, along with the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket, is far along in its development cycle. A version of the spacecraft has already flown on a Delta IV Heavy rocket. Another Orion is slated for an uncrewed mission around the moon in 2018. A third Orion will take a crew of astronauts on a lunar orbital mission in the 2021-23 timeframe. Beyond that, the manifest for deep space missions is a little vague. The incoming Trump administration has expressed support for more commercial participation in NASA’s space exploration program. So it makes sense to explore deep space versions of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner and the SpaceX Dragon, not to mention other possibilities. On the other hand, an attempt to cancel the Orion in favor of another, cheaper vehicle is likely to spark a fight with Congress, already irate over President Barack Obama’s cancellation of the Constellation space exploration program. Orion’s supporters will point out that the NASA spaceship already exists and is being built. Commercial spacecraft are right now concepts, not even designs. On the other hand, supplementing Orion with commercial spacecraft is always a possible option. The Trump administration’s space exploration program is quite ambitious, involving astronaut voyaging throughout the solar system by 2100. Enough room may exist for both Orion and commercially built deep spacecraft. And, if NASA is headed back to the moon under the new order, commercially developed landing vehicles is always a possibility.

SHANGHAI: As a candidate, Donald Trump aimed some of his most blistering words at China, declaring that "we already have a trade war" and suggesting ominously that "we have the power over China, economic power." As president of the United States, Trump can use trade - a cornerstone of his populist rise - as a weapon, with the potential to drastically reshape the world's two largest economies, as well as the companies, industries and workers who depend on their hundreds of billions of dollars in closely linked goods. But neither side may win. Cutting off trade will not bring back the bulk of US manufacturing jobs lost to China in previous decades as it became the world's factory floor. Already, some industries that left the United States years ago, such as garment making and some light manufacturing, are now leaving China for even cheaper places. An aggressive stance with China also risks antagonizing an authoritarian government with its own brand of economic nationalism. Yet the unsettling reality for Beijing is that Trump has a variety of ways to get back at China for trade practices that he, his supporters or people in the affected industries view as unfair. China sells a large array of goods to the United States that he can aim at for higher tariffs. The opportunities for China to retaliate would be more limited. In the most basic terms, China buys less from the United States. But China could make some strategic strikes at targets like Boeing, US automakers and American farmers. Beijing exerts tight control over China's airlines, for example, and sometimes steers contracts to Airbus, Boeing's European rival, when officials feel that Washington is uncooperative. "Boeing complains, 'We have been pretty good friends with China. Why are we always a target?'" said He Weiwen, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now the co-director of the China-US-EU Study Center at the influential China Association of International Trade in Beijing. Or China could wreak havoc on the vast yet delicate supply chain behind a wide range of products like iPhones and auto parts. Six years ago, Chinese restrictions on exports of obscure yet vital minerals led to a global outcry by manufacturers. Early indications are that trade could take a more prominent place on the White House's China agenda, which under President Barack Obama was dominated by Beijing's territorial claims in East Asia and its influence over North Korea. In a strong signal, Trump has turned to Dan DiMicco, a longtime steel executive and trade critic, to oversee trade issues during his administration's transition. DiMicco writes a personal blog, liberally sprinkled with exclamation points, that blames America's industrial decline on cheating by trade partners, particularly China. "Hillary Clinton has claimed Trump's trade policies will start a 'Trade War' but what she fails to recognize is we are already in one," he wrote on his blog last summer. "Trump clearly sees it and he will work to put an end to China's 'Mercantilist Trade War'! A war it has been waging against us for nearly 2 decades!" China over the last two days has emphasized that a healthy relationship would benefit both sides. On Thursday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said, "It is in the common interests of both countries to develop a long-term, stable and prosperous trading relationship, and any American politician would take a policy in the interest of his country and the American people." Trump's views veer widely from the free-trade positions of the Republican Party in recent years and signal a return to the more hawkish positions of the Reagan administration, which repeatedly went after Japan on trade issues. Since President Ronald Reagan, Republican and Democratic administrations have been reluctant to confront countries that may be subsidizing or dumping exports, either because the evidence is unclear or because of a risk of damaging diplomatic or strategic relations. "This is the kind of stuff you learn in law school, and in the early days of your law career," said Alan H Price, a longtime lawyer for the American steel and aluminum industries at Wiley Rein. When used, the measures were sometimes deemed ineffective. In one rare example, Obama used his powers to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on imports of Chinese tires soon after he took office. The tariffs prompted China to impose steep tariffs on US chicken meat and automotive products. Both countries complained to the World Trade Organization, which mostly sided with the United States. The case resulted in the United States producing more tires, but imports from other countries rose even faster. And the Obama administration later became more cautious about challenging China with trade restrictions. Any trade actions by Trump would face limits. This year, he mentioned imposing a tariff of 45 percent on all imports from China. But he later avoided specifics - and he has limited power to do so anyway. The law allows him to impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent, and for as long as 150 days, on all imports, unless a national emergency is declared. Other laws allow him to impose tariffs on targeted goods. Should Trump want to signal an aggressive stance quickly, he could move against imports of steel and aluminum from China. The Obama administration has been preparing to file a World Trade Organization case against China over claims that it subsidized aluminum exports. And the United States, Japan and the European Union already complain that Chinese government subsidies have produced a bloated domestic steel industry that they say dumps millions of tons of excess goods on world markets each year. China is more vulnerable given the sheer amount of stuff it sells to America. For more than a decade, China has consistently exported about $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of goods that it imports. Exports to the US represent about 4 percent of the Chinese economy; US exports to China are only about two-thirds of 1 percent of the US economy. "We don't have many things in the toolbox for retaliation, because we export more than we import," said He, the former Chinese commerce ministry official. Still, China could inflict pain on sensitive areas that provide US jobs, like Boeing's jetliners. Boeing declined to comment except to say, "We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to make sure we continue to grow the global economy and protect our people." General Motors and Ford Motor Co, consider China a big contributor to sales. They mostly manufacture in China to supply the domestic market. But much of the design and engineering work is still done in the United States. China could hurt the automakers by adopting domestic policies that help their big European rivals, notably Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz. Other US companies may be less opposed to trade limits than in the past. Some US companies have been struggling to sell in China. Beijing has steered contracts to Chinese telecommunications companies after Edward Snowden's revelations about US intelligence gathering in China. And Chinese state-owned enterprises have shifted much of their investment banking business from Wall Street to homegrown rivals. US farmers have welcomed Chinese purchases, but it is unclear how badly they could be hurt by any trade action. Chicken meat, soybeans, corn and other foodstuffs are commodities traded in world markets, and farmers are often able to sell elsewhere. Chinese goods have long helped keep prices down for Americans. But Chinese exports play a shrinking role in holding down prices as labor costs rise in China and as rivals like Indonesia, Vietnam and India expand manufacturing. China's biggest potential weapon is to disrupt the supply chains of multinationals by halting exports of crucial materials or components. But that could damage China's reputation as a reliable supplier. "I don't think we will go that far at the moment, because there is a lot of room to negotiate," He said. "If we are forced too much, nothing can be excluded." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) How the Trump agenda could change the way St. Louis does business By Jim Gallagher and Jacob Barker St. Louis Post-Dispatch Nov 14, 2016 (…) President-elect Donald Trump smiles as he arrives to speak at an election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) The Associated Press He would cut taxes, repeal the Affordable Care Act, build roads and build walls — a real one against Mexican immigrants and a tariff wall against unfair imports. President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda for America will make a difference in the lives of many people and change the way St. Louis does business — if he can pass it. That may be difficult. Some things he wants to change, such as Obamacare and the North American Free Trade Agreement, are enshrined in law, notes Ken Warren, political science professor at St. Louis University. Trade issues, among other things, put Trump at odds with leaders of his own party. Presidents have lots of power in foreign policy, but much less authority at home, notes Warren, a scholar of the presidency. To do most important things, Trump needs to win over Congress, including some Democrats in the Senate, and a sometimes recalcitrant federal bureaucracy. “What we’ve found is that the president usually doesn’t make much of a difference,” said Warren. Here’s a rundown on what Trump wants to do and how it might affect St. Louis. Health care Trump has repeatedly promised to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health law, but he may find that easier said than done. Complete repealing or replacement would take 60 votes in the Senate, and the GOP will have only 51 senators on Inauguration Day. Under Senate rules, those 51 votes are enough to cut funding for Obamacare insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion. But repealing the subsidies without repealing the law would probably cause complete collapse in the market for individual health insurance, says Tim McBride, a professor at Washington University’s Brown School of Social Work and Public Health. About 20 million people would likely lose coverage with repeal, he notes, and many of them are sick. “You’re going to start hearing horror stories,” McBride said. Defunding would also set off a “death spiral” in the individual health insurance business, says McBride, prompting cries from millions of self-employed people, early retirees and others who get no Obamacare subsidy at all. The Affordable Care Act forbids insurers from excluding sick people, or charging them more. Those restrictions would remain even if funding was cut, notes McBride. As subsidies disappear, healthy people would be more likely to drop their insurance, leaving insurers with a sicker, more expensive pool. That would cause premiums to skyrocket and insurers to abandon the market. Trump might find enough votes to change or replace the ACA, rather than repeal it. “You’re going to see a willingness on the part of many of us to work with President Trump, as long as he has a replacement” for the law, said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. Trump on Friday indicated that he would be amenable to a deal. “Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,” Trump said. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said he wants to keep the prohibition on denying insurance coverage because of pre-existing conditions and the ability of parents to keep adult children on their company insurance plans. Any replacement must make sure that people with pre-existing conditions can still get coverage, McCaskill said. “I don’t want to go back to the days when everybody was at the mercy of the insurance companies,” she said. Outright repeal would prompt howls from the politically influential medical establishment, which would lose a way of getting paid. That means more cost-shifting, said Mike Peters, vice president for government affairs at Chesterfield-based Mercy Health. “If you have individuals that are treated without any form of payment, the cost of operating that facility is shifted onto the patients who have the ability to pay,” he said. So premiums for employer-sponsored insurance could rise. One major local employer — Centene Corp. of Clayton — has already taken a hit. Centene, which manages Medicaid programs for the states, has seen its stock slide 24 percent since the election. The ACA greatly expanded Medicaid coverage in 32 states that agreed to participate, providing work for Centene. Missouri opted out. McBride, who consults with Congress on rural health issues, says Republicans in Congress understand the danger in repealing the ACA, and will likely try to work out compromises to bring enough Senate Democrats along. “They say they want to dismantle it, but they’ll tweak it,” predicts Warren, the political scientist. “They are not going to cause chaos by doing away with it.” Trump has been vague about what might replace Obamacare. He favors health savings accounts, which are usually coupled with high-deductible health plans. His “contract” with voters also favors allowing people to buy insurance across state lines and giving states more freedom to manage how they spend Medicaid money. That fits with a broader plan issued by GOP House leadership in June. That plan, called “A Better Way,” would remove many requirements on what insurers must cover. Insurers could also charge more to people with pre-existing conditions. People who don’t get coverage at work would get subsidies to buy plans on the open market. The government would also subsidize high-risk insurance pools for those who can’t get other coverage. Republicans would give states a set amount of money to pay for Medicaid, which would limit the cost of the insurance program for the poor. But states would get more freedom in how to spend it. Trade St. Louis buys from the world and sells to it — and Trump may influence both. Trump made trade a major issue, blaming the North American Free Trade Agreement for causing “devastation” in the Midwest. He wants to renegotiate the deal and cancel it if Canada and Mexico won’t go along. He pledged to brand China a currency manipulator, and has threatened tariffs of 45 percent on Chinese imports and 35 percent on some Mexican products. His complaints might resonate with roughly 1,500 workers who were laid off early this year from United States Steel’s Granite City Works. The big steelmaker cited unfairly cheap imports from Asia as one reason for the mill’s partial shutdown, although a fall in demand for steel pipe from the suffering U.S. oil industry was a major cause. Jefferies, an investment firm, upgraded U.S. Steel stock to a buy after the vote, saying it should benefit from Trump’s trade policies. The Obama administration has been listening to Big Steel. The industry’s victory in an anti-dumping case last spring saved nearly 500 jobs at the Granite City mill. U.S. Steel kept its finishing line open because the government imposed penalties on Asian imports, noted Dan Simmons, president of United Steelworkers Local 1899 in Granite City. Simmons wonders if Trump can really succeed in cracking down on unfair imports, noting that Republicans in Congress tend to support free trade agreements. While steel suffers, other St. Louis companies live by exporting. Local firms shipped $8.9 billion in products abroad last year, with $3.5 billion of that shipped to Canada and Mexico, partners in the NAFTA accord, according to the Commerce Department. Exports worth $4.4 billion went to Asian nations covered under the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which Trump opposes. Chemicals are the metro area’s biggest export, followed by electronics, transportation equipment and machinery. Any move to boost U.S. tariffs would bring “very quick and very decisive retaliation” from foreign nations, says Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “That’s going to be a real problem if President-elect Trump is serious about trade restrictions.” “If he begins to get in a trade war with a lot of countries, American jobs will suffer,” McCaskill said. “We really don’t know what he means because he has said so many different things.” That worries David Shogren, CEO of U.S. International Foods in Grand Center. The tiny company exports American food products to China, and a trade war would hurt his business. “I was in China last week and talked to a lot of customers about nuts,” he said. The Chinese can buy cheaper nuts from Vietnam than from him because a trade agreement lowers tariffs between those nations. “The U.S. is on the outside looking in,” he said. “I’m quite concerned because his rhetoric has been so anti-China and anti-trade.” Boeing Co., one of the region’s biggest exporters, might feel both pain and gain from Trump policies. It builds fighter jets in St. Louis, both for the Department of Defense and for export to Australia and the Middle East. Boeing, which employs nearly 15,000 people in metro St. Louis, just finished a new plant in north St. Louis County to make wing parts for its new 777X airliner. Trump’s plan to boost defense spending might aide Boeing on one side of its business, while a trade war would hurt its commercial sales. Some of the 777X planes would be sold to Iran under a recent agreement. During the campaign, a Trump press release complained about the Iran sale, saying that “the world’s largest state sponsor of terror would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal.” The GOP-led House has also moved to block the sale. Taxes Prospects for tax reform seem bright under Donald Trump. House Republicans were working on their own tax cut plan before the election, and some Democrats find it hard to oppose lower taxes. Trump would reduce the number of tax brackets for individuals from seven to three — 12, 25 and 33 percent — along with much higher standard deductions. The corporate tax rate would fall from 35 to 15 percent. The middle class would see lower tax bills. Trump’s campaign estimated that a middle-class family would see a 35 percent tax cut, including new deductions for child and elder care. But other analysts note that the largest cuts would go to the wealthy. They would see their top marginal bracket fall from 39 percent to 33 percent. The Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution estimates that a typical middle-income family would see a cut of $1,010 or 1.8 percent of after-tax income. The poorest taxpayers would save $110. The richest 0.01 percent of Americans, with incomes over, $3.7 million, would get a $1.1 million tax cut, equaling 14 percent of income. Democrats are anxious to point out the difference. “If he has a tax plan that takes care of him and his friends, he will have a great deal of trouble getting it through Congress,” McCaskill said. She noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan has his own tax plan, “and it’s not the same.” The Trump plan would cut federal revenue, raising the national debt, but there is debate over how much. The Tax Policy Center puts the lost revenue at $6.2 trillion over 10 years. The more conservative Tax Foundation gets a lower number by assuming that tax cuts will stimulate the economy and put more people to work. The foundation sees the revenue loss at $2.6 trillion to $3.9 trillion. Trump also would allow multinational companies to bring home their foreign profits from abroad at a 10 percent tax rate. That could provide a one-time revenue bonus that might be used to fund an infrastructure stimulus plan. Still, big tax cuts, along with an infrastructure plan, would expand the national debt, which might draw opposition from Trump’s own party “He doesn’t strike me as a fiscal conservative,” McCaskill said. “He strikes me as an opportunist.” Environment, energy The prospects for Obama’s landmark climate regulation, the Clean Power Plan, appear dim under President Trump, who has called global warming a hoax. For the coal-reliant St. Louis region, efforts to mitigate carbon emissions hold big consequences. Two of the world’s largest coal companies — Peabody Energy and Arch Coal — are based here, and both filed for bankruptcy earlier as demand for the fuel fell among power plant operators and steelmakers. Ameren Missouri generates about three-fourths of its electricity from coal-fired power plants that ring the metro area. A Trump appointment to the Supreme Court could certainly lead to the plan being struck down, and then the U.S. will struggle to meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement reached last year. That in turn could make other large nations less willing to tame carbon emissions, especially if Trump follows through on statements that the U.S. won’t pay to help poor countries, like India, meet climate targets. “This election outcome is not good news for environmental policy,” said Bill Lowry, a political science professor at Washington University who focuses on the environment. “I think the Clean Power Plan … is probably history. And I think the Paris Agreement is in a lot of trouble.” While coal backers seemed jubilant — Peabody Energy shares jumped 50 percent Wednesday morning, even though the company remains in bankruptcy — a Trump presidency can’t reverse broader economic pressures facing the industry. “No, there will not be a bunch of new coal plants being built just based on this election,” said Andy Smith, an analyst at Edward Jones who follows utilities. Utilities look decades into the future to make decisions, and much of coal’s woes have been driven by cheap natural gas and more competitive pricing on wind and solar energy. Ameren, for instance, doesn’t plan to retire its Meramec coal plant in south St. Louis County until early next decade, and its long-term plans call for a new natural gas plant and wind and solar generation, not coal. Peabody, for its part, said its strategy remains the same: focus on the development and funding of high-efficiency, low-emission coal power plants and carbon capture technologies that would make coal viable for the long term. That being said, Peabody spokesman Vic Svec says, “It’s good to see coal being recognized as an essential part of the energy mix.” Urban policy Like most of the Rust Belt, St. Louis has spent years working to revitalize an urban core hollowed out by suburbanization and deindustrialization. Federal support for cities has been falling for decades, although the Obama administration has brought new attention to urbanism, launching several pilot programs that St. Louis seemed poised to benefit from. Trump’s support largely came from unexpectedly high turnout in rural areas, and city voters across the country largely backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. If traditional political calculus holds, cities may be not be a high priority under the president-elect. “You reward your base,” said Todd Swanstrom, a professor of public policy at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who focuses on urban issues. “He’s not going to send resources to cities per se, but that’s a generalization.” Trump has called for more tax incentives to spur inner-city development, and has said he wants to ease access to bank credit for blacks trying to start businesses in urban areas. However, he will be working with a Congress dominated by traditional conservatives who often hail from nonurban areas. They aren’t likely to allow deficits to explode if Trump pushes for large tax cuts and a big infrastructure spending bill. When Republicans control the White House and Congress, funding for cities through Housing and Urban Development has suffered in order to make room for tax cuts, said Sarah Coffin, a professor of urban planning and development at SLU. “What I would expect to see happening is a lot of that stuff will be shifted back to a block grant approach, which is much easier to whittle away at to make room in your budget,” she said. “They’re going to have to be much more resilient at the local level figuring out how to do more with less.” Areas most ravaged by the loss of jobs and investment — north St. Louis and north St. Louis County — have been included in a federal “Promise Zone” that moves St. Louis and local organizations up in line for federal grants. And the city was recently named a finalist for a federal Choice Neighborhoods grant that could pump $30 million, and leverage millions more, into neighborhoods north of downtown near the planned new western headquarters of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. “They were kind of pilot programs that if there were a Democratic and urban majority in Congress, I would have expected them to be expanded,” Swanstrom said. “There’s not going to be much time left. So I fear that St. Louis is going to lose out, because we were really looking good for Choice.” Trump has also called for additional funding for police, which could mean more money for police departments. St. Louis has struggled to find money for additional police officers to help manage an uptick in the homicide rate over the last two years. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Coffin said police funding needs to include money for training if cities across the country hope to better connect with and police black communities that have grown increasingly estranged from law enforcement in the wake of high-profile police shootings. “Will this money only be used to buy police cars and to buy riot gear and to hire police officers?” Coffin said. Infrastructure One of Trump’s campaign promises has been a call for a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure spending bill. That has some regional leaders hopeful an older postindustrial city like St. Louis will be able to fund some big priorities. “We’re encouraged by the words of the president-elect, and I think it could be a very good thing for our region,” said Bi-State Development President and CEO John Nations. Bi-State operates public transit in the region and coordinates the new St. Louis Regional Freightway, which aims to boost St. Louis’ standing as a logistics hub. The Freightway’s infrastructure priorities include replacing the Interstate 270 bridge over the Mississippi River and widening the highway there to six lanes. The top priority to boost the region’s freight capacity is replacing the 128-year-old Merchant’s Bridge rail crossing, which Nations called “a bottleneck to growth.” Only one train can cross the bridge at a time because of its age, and demand is high to move goods across the Mississippi River. A big boost in infrastructure spending that appears to have a chance with Republican control of Washington “could be particularly good news here in St. Louis as we work on the St. Louis Regional Freightway,” he said. Prospects are less clear on another big project regional officials have rallied behind: a new MetroLink line that bisects St. Louis north to south. The Federal Transit Administration, which awarded Bi-State a $375,000 planning grant for the line last month, sent its top leader to St. Louis earlier this month to tour the area with Mayor Francis Slay. Whether the feds will continue an interest in funding public transit under a Trump administration is unknown. “I think the odds of that just went way down,” said Swanstrom, the UMSL professor. “I will say this: We don’t know his views on public transit.” Nations agrees it’s too early to know what a Trump administration will do for public transit. He recalled that under former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, federal funds that helped public transit systems pay for operations stopped and instead shifted to paying for capital projects. Nations said federal funding will be necessary to cover some of the projected $2 billion cost of a new line. A St. Louis County ordinance requires federal help before local funds are used in an expansion, he said. Because the state of Missouri doesn’t fund public transit at all, Nations adds, “we have to be concerned every year, regardless of who the president is and who the administration is.” Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said Trump’s infrastructure plan won’t be a top priority. “The question is, can he get Republican votes?” McCaskill said. “They were not interested in funding infrastructure under President Obama.” Corporate mergers Donald Trump railed against the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner on the campaign trail. With corporate consolidation growing and increasing concerns from some economists over a lack of competition and innovation due to the domination of business behemoths, might a new Trump administration be pushed by his populist followers to take a harder line on mega-mergers? “We’re at the beginning of something significant that could happen with Trump in terms of this populism,” said Maurice Stucke, a law professor at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville who worked in the antitrust division of the Justice Department. “You might have antitrust enforcement like under Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican appealing to a populist base.” St. Louis is no stranger to the effects of major tie-ups: InBev’s purchase of Anheuser-Busch in 2008 cost the city corporate jobs and its status as a national node of advertising talent. American Airlines’ acquisition of TWA in 2001 cost Lambert-St. Louis International Airport its hub status. “That has taken a toll on the St. Louis community,” Stucke said. Hundreds more jobs are projected to vanish when TD Ameritrade buys Town and Country-based Scottrade. Also concerning for the region’s standing as an agriculture technology hub is the loss of Monsanto’s headquarters if Bayer wins regulatory approval to buy the Creve Coeur ag giant. With two other mega-mergers — Dow combining with DuPont and ChemChina acquiring Syngenta — the agriculture sector is poised to be dominated by just three companies. Stucke thinks Trump’s rural base may be skeptical, and he may face backlash if he gives the mergers a green light. “If he takes that route, and two years from now they have midterm elections, what’s the change? What’s the hope, what’s the change he’s offering to his populist base?” Stucke said. The Obama Justice Department has already sued to block two giant insurance mergers: Anthem’s acquisition of Cigna and Aetna’s takeover of Humana. If Republicans are serious about rolling back Obamacare, they need to retain a competitive market, said Tim Greaney, a law professor at SLU who studies antitrust law and health care. “If you want to create vouchers for Medicare, you better have a competitive marketplace where consumers can buy health care,” he said. “It would be flatly inconsistent with the market-based alternatives that they’d apparently be considering to put the brakes on antitrust.” Republicans are traditionally more friendly to business leaders and Wall Street, which backs mergers, but the two experts agreed that Trump’s actual philosophy is unknown. It will all depend on whom he appoints to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. “It’s going to take strong intellectual leadership,” Stucke said. Immigration Perhaps Trump’s most famous campaign promise was to build a wall on the border with Mexico and deport millions of illegal immigrants. “While there was a lot of rhetoric about immigration, the truth of the matter is some of his really large flagship proposals would be difficult if not impossible to do,” said Anna Crosslin, president and CEO of the International Institute of St. Louis, which offers adjustment services to refugees and immigrants. Larger deportations, if they do happen, “would probably impact cities besides St. Louis more dramatically because they have larger” numbers of undocumented immigrants, Crosslin said. However, St. Louis has benefited from refugee programs that could be scaled back under Trump. Bosnians helped repopulate neighborhoods in south St. Louis and have become a major part of the region’s cultural fabric after arriving here by the thousands in the 1990s. The refugee crisis stemming from the Syrian civil war has led to about 271 Syrians settling in St. Louis, Crosslin said. Overall, St. Louis took in about 1,024 refugees last year after the Obama administration upped the number it said the country would accept to 85,000. Trump has called for “extreme vetting” of Syrian refugees over concerns about terrorism, walking back his earlier proposal to ban Muslim immigrants. St. Louis gets a little more than 1 percent of refugees allowed into the country because the region has more room than many large metropolitan areas, Crosslin said. Trump could cut back by tens of thousands the number of refugees allowed into the U.S., which Obama planned to increase to 110,000 over the next year. That could limit population growth and the associated demand that comes with it in a region that sorely needs it for economic growth, Crosslin said. “They are also an important source of new population to a city that has struggled from depopulation since 1950 or so,” Crosslin said. “It’s not just St. Louis. It’s Cleveland and Dayton (Ohio) and Detroit and Philadelphia and all of these former Rust Belt cities that are looking to reinvent themselves using the knowledge and talents of a multicultural workforce.” Samantha Liss of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

REUTERS/Jim Young The Seattle Times Nov 11, 2016 at 6:00 pm | Print View The nearly catastrophic explosion of an engine that caused a fire on an American Airlines Boeing 767 just short of takeoff in Chicago on Oct. 28 occurred when a specific part that had never before failed broke into pieces. The breakup of a heavy metal disk that rotates in the engine core reveals a new risk to airline passengers that, however rare, has already spurred a scramble by engine-maker General Electric and government safety agencies to find and fix the vulnerability. “The risk will be eliminated,” said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member with more than 40 years’ experience in the aviation-safety industry. “Will it be eliminated before the next one? That’s the real question. Everything relies upon the timeliness of the system to correct itself.” American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami was speeding down the runway at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago when the second-stage disk of the high-pressure turbine broke apart inside the right engine with a loud explosion that blew metal shrapnel out through the engine casing. Hot metal ripped through the wing, igniting aviation fuel. Slamming on the brakes as the jet reached a speed of 154 miles per hour, the pilot brought the plane to a halt within 25 seconds and 900 yards further down the runway. Moving quickly, the cabin staff evacuated all 161 passengers and nine crew using the escape slides on the undamaged left side of the aircraft. Twenty people suffered minor injuries. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy stresses the reliability of the CF6 engine involved. The latest models, introduced in the 1980s, currently power about 4,000 widebody jets, including Boeing 767s, 747s and Airbus A330s, and have flown for more than 220 million hours. “The CF6 is the workhorse engine of jumbo jets on a level never experienced before,” Kennedy said. The NTSB said one piece of the broken disk went through the right wing, then arced high over the airplane and came crashing through the roof of a UPS warehouse almost 1,000 yards away. “Any time a turbine disk fails, it’s a big deal,” said Goglia.

Saudia Director General Saleh Bin Nasser Al-Jasser, Saudi media and some of the airlines employees were the passengers of the new aircraft that flew in from Seattle on Nov. 9, and landed in Riyadh the next day. Minister of Transport and President of the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), Sulaiman Al-Hamdan with Saudia Director General Saleh Bin Nasser Al-Jasser at the press conference. — Courtesy photoOnce the airplane arrived in the Riyadh private aviation area on Nov.10, Minister of Transport and President of the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), Sulaiman Al-Hamdan celebrated with Al-Jasser, and other officials, the arrival of the new airplane to the fleet. During the press conference held soon after the plane had arrived, Al-Hamdan said, “I am pleased to see today the new product of the Saudi Arabian Airlines that includes special suites in the first class of the new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. “This step confirms the interest and care of the national aviation to develop its products, which has become an important element within the competitive advantages between airlines.” Al-Hamdan added, during his speech, that it is worthwhile to note that aligning with the Kingdom Vision 2030 the civil aviation and air transport industry is an important element that is sure to play a vital role in developing the national economy. He also stressed on the efforts that are being made for the development of the air transport system in the Kingdom in order for it to play its role more effectively in the overall development programs, which is part of achieving the National Transformation Program of 2020. The minister added that the Saudi Arabian Airlines is following effective steps to implement its development program to achieve transformation and to attain its strategic objectives. The airlines recently implemented several changes including, developing the aircraft fleet and developing the airlines products and improving its services. “There are other effective steps that are being implemented for the development of the air transport industry in the Kingdom. One of the steps that was recently implemented and was successful was the transference to Terminal 5 in King Khaled Airport in Riyadh and smooth operations of the flights, while also launching Nesma and Gulf Saudia airlines flights. Other efforts have also been made to achieve the new developing goals that would support the national economy,” he said. During the conference Al-Jasser explained that he is pleased with the launching of the new product that includes suites in first class and he illustrated that having another 777-300 ER to the airlines fleet is part of the airlines goals. By implementing the goals of the program, the airlines will increase the achievements of 70 years, especially in the coming 7 years through many initiatives. Al-Jasser added several initiatives have been implemented including, the signing of an agreement with the Ministry of Education to give thousands of Saudis scholarships to study aviation and aviation engineering. “We also signed another agreement for having around 113 aircrafts that are newly produced to be added to the airlines fleet and we have started receiving some of these starting from August,” Al-Jasser added. During the media conference it was explained that the new plane has 12 distinguished compartments for the first class passengers each with an electronic seat which can easily be adjusted for complete relaxation and can also be made into a comfortable bed. There is an electronic keyboard that will enable the passenger to control the seat, which is supplied with a flexible lighting system. There is also space to store their personal belongings. Each wing will also have sliding doors to provide the passenger with more space and a 24-inch HD plasma that will enable him/her to enjoy the entertainment programs throughout the flight in addition to a large dining table for two people to be served with food. Saudia has concluded an agreement with Boeing to purchase 10 such aircraft four of which will be received later this year and five in 2017.

Goodluck and well done, Saudia represents the pride of all Muslims under the world skies.

NHTSA recommends owners check for recall information, and if their vehicle is part of the recall, contact a local dealer for a free repair. Just in case you haven’t heard, the City of Chicago is in deep trouble with their employee pension costs. Chicago will pay about $1 billion next year into four separate pension funds. To cover that in part, their city council increased telephone surcharges in 2014, adding about $35 million a year in revenues. A 2015 property tax increase will raise taxes by $543 million over the next four years. On September 14, 2016 their city council voted to raise water and sewer taxes to generate an additional $240 million annually by 2020. A new study could reassure men with early prostate cancer that whether they opt for radiation, surgery or no treatment, their risk of dying of the disease in ten years is very low, less than one percent. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said new studies add to mounting evidence that men with localized prostate cancer can safely opt to postpone treatment. Our State Senator Holly Mitchell’s sponsored bill, SB629, has been signed by Governor Brown and goes into effect on January 1, 2017. The Senator’s bill does not alter the penalties, but simply removes the inflammatory and misused term from the penal code as it relates to lynching. The number of federal inmates who are serving time for drug offenses, among them thousands of nonviolent offenders sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, is 100,000. If I lived in McKinney, Texas and wanted that city to furnish public documents under the Texas Public Information Act relating to a white police officer pointing his gun at black youths, it would require 2,231 hours of programmer time at a cost approaching $80,000. This figure is so high, it effectively keeps information hidden that the city is legally obligated to provide. United Airlines found Boeing’s new plane, the 787-9, has such a range that it flies nonstop between San Francisco and Tel Aviv and Singapore and Auckland. Yes, folks, the 787-9 will carry 252 passengers 8,786 miles. My, oh my, have things changed. Recently Vietnam bought commercial aircraft worth $11 billion. For travelers, Holiday Inn Express was ranked number 1 in customer service and #1 in trust. My former employer, the Boeing Aircraft Company, is a proving ground for the robotizing of the production assembly line for the 777 jet. As these robots displace workers, the companies are hiring a highly trained group of human workers to fix robots when they break down or need maintenance. Recently Boeing projected airlines would need 617,000 pilots in the next 20 years worldwide and an additional 20,000 pilots over the next 10 years here in the United States. Can it be true, folks? According to disclosure reports filed Thursday, June 30 with the Florida State Commission on Ethics, for the period January 1, 2015 to December 15, 2015 the Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi, last year earned $128,872. To put it in perspective, the top super-duper Culver City City Attorney, Carol Schwab, made over $100,000 more than Bondi. That’s right. Carol, representing 40, 000 residents, made more than Bondi, representing millions of people in the Sunshine State. Did you read the Reno, Nevada Gazette – Journal recently? Well, partner, it seems their city attorney was involved in settling a lawsuit against a police officer accused of assaulting a man during a traffic stop. I bet you are wondering about the cost. Well, it was a $23,000 settlement. As of June 1 the good people of Idaho are able to carry a concealed gun without needing a license or training. Now that the United States made Cuba our friend again, Cousin Neil was looking forward to restocking his shelves with rum and cigars, but, alas, the only product that was removed from the list of items barred from being imported from Cuba was coffee, and that will probably be on your favorite supermarket shelf around the first of December. I will try it, but the coffee will have to be marvelous to keep me away from my Yuban.

Donald Trump bought this Boeing 757 in 2011 and spent millions converting it into a penthouse in the sky, long before he decided to run for president Amanda Miller, the Trump Organization's Vice President of Marketing, is pictured on board Mr Trump's plane. She gave a video tour of the plane in 2011, after it was refitted  HOW DO THEY MEASURE UP?  Air Force One Obama boarding Air Force One in London  A customized Boeing 747-200B, bearing the words 'United States of America' and the President's seal  Top speed of 563mph and room for an entire West Wing of presidential advisers  A mobile command center, 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, a medical suite/operating room, two food preparation galleys which can feed 100 people     Trump's plane Trump boards his plane in North Carolina  A Boeing 757-200, which was bought in 2011 and kitted out at a cost of $100m, it is embossed with the legend 'Trump' Top speed of 500mph and space for 43 passengers   Marble and gold bathroom, 24-carat gold-plated seatblets, a video lounge with 57-inch screen and sound system similar to a 'top Hollywood screening room'   In fact there are two Air Force One planes. They are identical Boeing 747s which are rotated every few months.  Air Force One are customized Boeing 747-200B aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000.  They are given the special designation VC-25A and fly under the strictest security. White House in the sky: One of the two Air Force One jumbos is seen flying President Bill Clinton to Italy in 1999. Hillary only ever flew on it as a First Lady  Air Force One is emblazoned with the words United States of America, a flag on the tail and the Seal of the President. It can be refueled in midair, giving it an unlimited range and can stay in the hour for many hours if required to by an extraordinary crisis.  Air Force One's onboard electronics are designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, and it is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing it to function in the event of an attack on the White House.

Share this article Share 1.9k shares President Trump will be protected on board by Secret Service officers but can also invite onto the plane political advisers, journalists and other guests, including of course his wife Melania and other members of his family.  But it will be a far cry from the luxury of Trump's own plane, sometimes known as Trump Force One, which has wood panelling and 'yards and yards of elegant silk', silk pillows embroidered with his family crest and gold and marble bathrooms.  Air Force One usually flies in convoy with several cargo planes, containing surplus stores, and fighter jets. President Barack Obama wears an Air Force One jacket on his first flight aboard the famous plane from Andrews Air Force Base to Newport News, Virginia in February 2009 President Obama and many of his predecessors have often opted to use a helicopter, known as Marine One, for short flights from Washington for example to New York or to Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Maryland countryside.   The presidential air fleet is operated by the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Field, Maryland.  The Presidential Airlift Group, part of the White House Military Office, is in charge of Air Force One.  On the campaign trial: Trump gives a thumbs up to the crowd after a rally in Vandailia, Ohio way back in March 2016. He was able to sleep in his bed on board while flitting between campaign stops Trump Force One, or the 'T-Bird' as the tycoon refers to it, is luxuriously fitted out (pictured) The bedroom on Trump's plane, where he often napped while flying between cities on the campaign trial, is complete with silk pillows containing his family crest (pictured)  Trump and his campaign organizers would have sat around this conference table discussing speeches and tactics over the last few months Amanda Miller (pictured) graduated from the University of Rhode Island and worked as the receptionist on the 2008 season of Celebrity Apprentice. She was hired by Trump after working as a 15-year-old waitress at his golf course in Westchester, New York Amanda Miller shows off the bathroom on board Trump Force One (left) but security is much tighter on board Air Force One (pictured, right, during a trip to Baghdad in 2006) In May 2009 Louis Caldera resigned as director of the White House Military Office after an embarrassing incident - New Yorkers panicked when they saw Air Force One flying low around the city.  It turned out to be a photo opportunity but many people thought the U.S. was under attack again like on 9/11. In 1974 the Air Force One pilot took dramatic evasive action, including a dive, when, on its approach to Damascus for an official visit, President Richard Nixon's plane was approached by Syrian fighter jets. Trump was able to travel in extreme comfort on his plane (pictured) while keeping in contact with his staff on the ground. It is not clear what will become of the plane in January Amanda Miller, who was hired by Trump after he spotted her working as a 15-year-old waitress, is pictured showing off the tycoon's $100m plane  Goodbye, Mr President: A rainbow in Kingston, Jamaica, frames Obama as he boards Air Force One at Norman Manley International Airport after a trip to the Caribbean President Hafez al-Assad - father of the current dictator, Bashir - a former air force officer himself, had sent the planes up to escort Nixon's plane but they had failed to notify the crew of Air Force One.   Vice President-elect Mike Pence, by the way, will have his own Boeing C-32, which is also fitted out to be a mobile command center in the event of the President's sudden death.

I’ll never forget a couple of years ago waking up at 4am in St Lucia and hearing the dawn chorus as the sun rose above the Pitons, knowing that back home it was a bitter, murky February day. Or the sheer excitement of threading through the cloud-capped Andes to land at Quito airport, the first time I visited South America. And it seems I’m not alone.

And while there have been some improvements for long-haul fliers – the introduction of the highly rated Boeing Dreamliner, for example – other news, such as this week’s revelations that BA is to cram even more seats into some of its planes, isn’t so encouraging. But there is still a lot you can do to make long-haul flying more affordable and more bearable.  Here we have set out the best strategies for planning and booking your trip. First among them is the importance of talking to a knowledgeable specialist travel agent before you book. Buying long-haul flights is not the same as picking up a return fare to Europe – especially to destinations in South America, Asia and Australasia. There are many more options regarding your choice of airline, timing and itinerary. Fares are also structured differently, and agents have access to rates and deals you can’t get by booking directly with the airline. It’s also one of those areas where talking through your plans with an expert can pay dividends beyond the simple cost of the flight. They will have ideas and insights that you probably haven’t thought of, and which you could never track down by surfing online. They may even suggest a routing via a country you hadn’t even considered visiting, but which might make the journey more bearable and the holiday more enjoyable. All the fares quoted in this article were provided by Trailfinders (020 7938 3939; trailfinders.com), which, over many years, has consistently topped our annual readers’ survey. They are all return fares from London airports, are normally subject to booking by a certain date, and are valid for a particular time of year – often in this case May 2017. Please treat them as indicative – fares change all the time, and offers are ended, extended and introduced at short notice. As ever, talking to more than one company is a good idea and will give you a better picture of what is going on. You are probably spending a lot of money, and it never hurts to get two or three competitive quotes. Other agents that still offer a good customer-focused service include Dialaflight (0330 100 2220; dialaflight.com) and STA (0333 321 0099; statravel.co.uk). And specialist long-haul tour operators – Kuoni (0800 144 8156; kuoni.co.uk) for example – are useful if you want to book a hotel or resort-based holiday. Choose the right airline ￼The first point to consider when booking a long flight is which airline you prefer to fly with, though you might be choosing for two different reasons – price and comfort. In terms of overall experience, the top three airlines for long-haul travel, as rated by Telegraph readers in our latest annual travel survey, were Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand. Just because they are good doesn’t necessarily mean that they are expensive. Currently you can get to Perth, Australia, with Emirates (via Dubai from Gatwick) from £499; and good fares in business class with Singapore Airlines and a round-the-world bargain with Air New Zealand are listed below. Be wary, though, of code-share arrangements which mean that although your ticket is booked through one airline, you may actually be flying with another – and it isn’t always easy to tell from your booking details.  Revealed: The worlds best airlines Another key point to consider is the type of plane. There is a general consensus that flying on one of the new Boeing Dreamliners is a vastly more relaxing and enjoyable experience than on, for example, an old 747. More and more airlines now offer them on flights from Britain: including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada, United Airlines, Etihad, Qatar Airways, Kenya Airways, Aeromexico, Avianca and Air India. And some charter flights are also operated on Dreamliners – Tui, for example, flies them. But they only fly on certain routes and at particular times, and working out which is also difficult without advice from an agent. The Airbus equivalent to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the A350, which has recently started flying to Britain with Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair and Ethiopian Airlines. A new breed of no-frills, low-cost long-haul airlines is also offering a growing number of long-haul destinations – especially in the United States. Try Norwegian (norwegian.com) and Wowair (wowair.co.uk), which flies via Reykjavik. Finally, if you want to research more deeply into the quality of seat and service offered by other airlines, there are useful details on the amount of legroom and ratings for all carriers on websites such as airlinequality.com or seatguru.com. Low-cost long haul Take advantage of special offers ￼You will almost certainly also want to choose your flights according to price. This is where the long-haul market becomes really complicated and a good agent’s advice can pay off. Offers come and go, and may be on airlines or routes that you might not immediately think of, but, if you don’t mind a longer journey, can be exceptionally good value. So, for example, you can currently get to Sydney with China Eastern airlines (via Shanghai) from £611. There is a fare to Johannesburg with KLM and Air France, changing at Amsterdam on the way out and Paris on the way back, at £475. And the cheapest ticket to Bangkok is with Air China (via Beijing) at £361. When speaking to an agent, it is also always worth asking about “IT” fares. These are special deals that reduce the cost of your ticket by including a hotel as part of a “package” price along with the flight. It sounds counterintuitive, but it is one of the ways that airlines offload spare capacity on flights they know won’t sell out and so get around formal rules on pricing. So, for example, you can fly to Sydney with Malaysia Airlines and include five nights at a three-star hotel on arrival for £699 (per person, based on two travelling together and sharing a room). The cheapest ticket to Bangkok is currently with Air China Credit: ALAMY Plan a stopover ￼If you can plan your trip to include a stopover for a night or two, you might not only enhance your holiday experience but also make the journey much more bearable, and very possibly – because of IT fare rules (above) – cheaper too. So, for example, Trailfinders has what amounts to a flexible package to New Zealand which, for £1,639, gives you three nights in a four-star hotel in Los Angeles on your way out, and two nights in a three-star Auckland hotel on arrival, then eight days’ motorhome hire in New Zealand. You can then extend your trip in whatever way you like. AT A GLANCE | How to beat jet lag Planning a stopover may also help you to avoid what I think is the real killer on a long-haul journey – the night flight. Not everyone agrees: some can sleep on a plane without a problem and see it as a time-saving advantage. But for me, they are a guaranteed way to lose sleep, and a stopover may allow you to recalibrate your departure times to reduce the amount of night flying. For some destinations, there is not much you can do. Flying to Cape Town, for example, it is overnight both ways. On a few routes, however – notably Boston and New York with BA – you can fly both out and back during daylight, with the added advantage that daytime flights are often less popular with businessmen who are short of time, and so they are likely to be cheaper and less crowded.  Consider a long weekend in LA en route to New Zealand Credit: Andrew Bayda - Fotolia/Andrew Bayda Fly east to west  ￼This strategy obviously only works if you arrange to fly round the world (RTW) rather than out and back. But, if you are particularly susceptible to the effects of jet lag, it is a plan worth considering for trips to Australia, New Zealand or even Hong Kong. The idea is that you avoid the worst effects of jet lag because your body tends to adjust more easily to the new time zone if you travel in a westerly direction. When you arrive, you can sleep in for longer, rather than find yourself lagging behind the clock, although the time you gain on each leg will be lost the moment you cross the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean. Suddenly an entire day will be wiped out. It’s only when you travel the other way, like Phileas Fogg, that you will gain a day – though it comes at the cost of losing out on each leg.  The round-the-world option works particularly well for travel to New Zealand. One of the cheapest RTW tickets is the Tiki fare with Air New Zealand, which would allow you, for example, to stop in San Francisco en route to Auckland, then return via a stop in Hong Kong for £1,115. This compares with a normal standard return price of about £1,000.  Other options via Australia are a ticket with Qantas and British Airways routing from London to Sydney via Los Angeles and returning via Dubai from £1,414, and you can add extra stops in Auckland and certain Asian cities relatively cheaply. Top 10 | Cheapest long-haul destinations Fly off-peak  ￼The less crowded the flight, the better the chance of good service, the more space and the more “fresh” air you will get during the flight. In theory, working out the busiest times is complicated – especially if your itinerary involves more than one leg. However, it is generally worth avoiding weekends and particularly Mondays, which is the busiest flying day of the week. But in practice, the rule is a simple one – because fares are priced according to demand, the cheaper the fare, the more likely it is that there will be fewer people on the plane. Bag the best seat ￼If you are stuck with flying in economy, you can improve the experience by making sure you get a decent seat. There is a huge difference between stretching your legs out by the emergency exit and being squashed into a middle seat in the back row by the loos. The problem is that almost every airline has a different policy and most now charge for the better seats, or just the privilege of selecting your preferred option. British Airways, for example, charges £20 per person for an economy-class standard long-haul seat request, or £50 for an economy-class exit seat. And Emirates charges for economy-class seat requests on special offer and saver fares but not other fare types – the charges range from £10 to £30 depending on flight duration. They do not charge for exit-seat requests; however, this can only be done at the airport and is at the discretion of the airport staff. Again, this is something that it is worth taking advice on from an agent who knows the different policies and can see at a glance if, for example, an exit-row seat is available and what it will cost. If you are choosing a seat, your preferred option will probably depend on the type of plane, and the configuration of the seats. You can check this on the airline’s website or on a useful specialist site, seatguru.com. Its interactive seating plans highlight individual seats with most legroom, and flag up those with particular disadvantages. You won’t always be able to bag the best seats – they may have been taken already. But you can make sure you avoid the worst. Ones to avoid in particular are bulkhead seats: those are the ones near the front of each section in economy class. These are where parents with very young babies are often seated – not ideal on a night flight. Those in the last row often don’t recline. And any seat near a lavatory is likely to suffer from disturbance, as passengers queue to use it.

You have much more space, you can usually lie flat if you want to and the food is much better, with more choice over what and when you eat. You have access to the lounge before departure and you can be – if you so choose – last on, and first off the plane. You also get a more generous luggage allowance. But the price difference is, of course, very significant. Currently, for example, you could fly to Sydney with BA for £715 return in economy class, but you would have to pay more than five times more (£3,705) to fly in club. With Virgin to LA, you would pay £631 in economy, and £2,982 in business class – again about five times the price. The secret to getting a free upgrade Play! 01:59 There is a middle way. Several airlines offer premium economy, which gives you a bigger seat, less-crowded cabin and a bit more legroom, and for that the extra cost is more moderate – £1,084 for the LA fare just quoted, though £1,913 for Sydney fare. Part of the problem is the very high rates of British departure tax applied to travel in business and premium economy class – £150 for a flight over 2,000 miles. You can get around these, and reduce the fare a lot, if you book the outward leg in economy and the return in club or premium. So that fare to Sydney reduces to £2,202 if you fly out in economy and back in business. Do it the other way around – out in business, back in economy – however, and because of the way that tax is applied, it will cost you £2,277. Again, look out for special offers – British Airways is offering a return to Lima with an upgrade to premium economy on the way home for £145 extra; Malaysian Airlines is offering return flights to Perth, Australia, for £2,299 in business class (via Kuala Lumpur); and Singapore Airlines has a business-class offer to Sydney from £2,739. On the flight ￼Everyone has their own ways of coping with a flight. Olympian Greg Rutherford recommends noise-cancelling headphones to dull the continual roar of the engines, for example. I prefer to bring snacks and water rather than rely on cabin service; an iPad rather than a laptop – easier to use, at least in economy class; and a neck pillow – vital to prevent cricks and cramps.

(Source: File Photo) Boeing has said it is in talks with Indian companies to collaborate under the ‘Make in India’ initiative to manufacture Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) that could be used for surveillance by the Indian Navy. Brad Jeisman, Senior Business Development Manager of Insitu Pacific which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boeing, said since the Indian Navy is looking to acquire a UAS, it is “actively working” on it. “We had discussions with a number of Indian companies on what could be possible to support our make and buy Indian (products). We are working with different companies. We are meeting with some of the larger ones that we typically expect, but we are also interested in small to medium scale industries,” Jeisman said. Watch what else is making news Insitu Pacific builds UAS, apart from Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and supplies it to Australia and other countries in Asia-Pacific. Under the UAS, it manufactures ‘ScanEagle’ that gives images and live video feed on land or at sea and can be used for surveillance methods. ‘Interceptor’ is another such UAS with cameras and communication capabilities. Boeing recently announced its joint venture with the Tatas namely Tata advanced System Ltd (TASL) – Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited (TBAL). He said the company is also in talks with small and medium enterprises in India. Talks are also in progress on how much per cent of the product could be manufactured in India under the ‘Make in India’ initiative, he added. “What we have found in our discussions, observations and meetings that India has incredibly gifted small and medium-sized companies with amazing technology on your doorstep,” Jeisman said.

Emirates’ fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft will have a smaller environmental impact as both aircraft types have better fuel efficiency and emissions performance than the retired aircraft, the airline said in a statement. It added that it plans to further phase out some 25 aircraft over the course of 2017 and 2018 to ensure that the operating fleet remains modern and efficient. Emirates recently retired A6-EAK from operational service. The aircraft was the last of the 29 Airbus A330 aircraft that had been operating as part of its fleet. A6-EAK joined Emirates in 2002 and had flown for over 60,000 hours, travelling close to 45 million kilometres in 14.5 years. Emirates also phased out A6-ERN, the last serving Airbus A340 in the fleet which had joined the airline in 2004. Advertisement Since January 2015, Emirates has retired 18 A330 and five A340 aircraft from its fleet. The average age of the Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft phased out from the fleet is 16.5 years — a figure that is well below the industry standard retirement age of 25 years, Emirates said. By the end of 2016, Emirates will have taken delivery of 36 new aircraft; 20 Airbus A380s and 16 Boeing 777. This also includes the next generation Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, with upgraded business class seats and other features including a lower fuel burn ratio. These will be delivered from November 2016. Emirates is currently the largest operator of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft with 85 Airbus A380s and 160 Boeing 777s in its fleet.

Done with the introduction of first two stationary aircraft-prototypes, he turned to the guests with a smile, arm stretched at the last simulator and announced, “that is the A330/340 simulator, but we no longer use such aircraft at the Emirates.” Not quiet a few of the visiting journalists were surprised at the declaration and they didn’t hide it. Walid got the message too and quickly offered: “From this month, we only operate triple sevens and 380s. Before, we used to have A330 and 340, but we don’t use them anymore,” he said with air of pride. The perplexity was not limited to the journalists from Nigeria; it actually reverberated around the world of aviation. Just imagine; 251 brand new wide-body A380 and 777 aircraft with the latest state-of-the-art gadgets assembled all as one airline! “That is what Emirates now offers; the youngest fleet in the world,” Walid said. Divisional Vice President, Customer Experience IFE and Connectivity at Emirates, Patrick Brannelly, had last month announced that the airline would be phasing out its remaining A330-200s and A340-300s. The planes being retired in 2016 are 12 A330-300s, four A340-300s, one A340-500, six Boeing 777-200ERs, two Boeing 777-300s and one Boeing 777-300ER. Era of A380 and Boeing triple-seven machine In matters of modernity, comfort and efficiency, Airbus 380 and Boeing 777 are front runners. A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner designed for modern airports with upgraded facilities. It is the world’s largest passenger airliner with amazing fuel-efficiency designed by the European Union manufacturer to challenge Boeing’s monopoly in the large-aircraft market. The aircraft provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in an all-economy class configuration. As of October 2016, Airbus had received 319 firm orders and delivered 198 aircraft; Emirates is the biggest A380 customer with 142 ordered of which 83 have been delivered. Boeing 777, which Airbus currently rivals, indeed ranks as one of Boeing’s best-selling models. Airlines around the world have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. The competition between Airbus and Boeing notwithstanding, both makes a good couple in a marriage consummated by Emirates airlines jostling for 100 per cent efficiency. “Emirates is removing some of the older Airbus A330 and A340 jets, both of which are very fuel-inefficient,” said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at Strategic Aero Research. Fuel is the largest component of an airline’s cost. For Emirates, fuel accounted for about 28 per cent of its operating cost, according to its latest financial results. “The airline is removing not just old jets. It reduces costs by not having to support an ageing fleet and can redeploy pilots and crew on newer jets in its fleet,” Ahmad said. It didn’t come cheap The achievement, 251 aircraft-fleet today, didn’t happen overnight. Way back in November 2001, in the heat of one of the worst crises in the global aviation industry, Emirates took the world by surprise announcing that it has placed a $15billion order for new set of aircraft. As if to prove skeptics wrong, the airline in 2005, announced the largest order ever for the Boeing 777 family of aircraft – 42 in all – in a deal worth DH35.7 billion ($9.7 billion). Not done, at the Dubai Airshow in November 2007, Emirates announced a historic civil aviation aircraft order when it signed contracts for 120 Airbus A350s, 11 A380s, and 12 Boeing 777-300ERs, worth an estimated $34.9 billion in list prices. The agreement with Airbus comprises firm orders for 50 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s, plus 50 options for the A350-900s, with the plan to have the first A350 delivered to Emirates in 2015. During 2010, in line with the airline’s strategic growth plan, Emirates significantly increased its order for new aircraft. In June at the Berlin Airshow, Emirates announced an order for an additional 32 Airbus A380s and in July at the Farnborough Airshow, 30 more Boeing 777-300ERs were ordered. The combined value of these orders is $13.4 billion. A year after, at the Dubai Airshow, Emirates placed the single largest aircraft order in dollar value in Boeing’s history when it requested an additional 50 777-300ERs, worth approximately $18 billion. The order also included 20 777-300 ER options valued at $8 billion, for a total of 70 aircraft valued at $26 billion. Today, Emirates order-book stands at more than 280 aircraft, with a total value of approximately $138 billion as of November 2014. In combination with what is already one of the youngest and one of the most modern fleets in worldwide commercial aviation, this commitment to the future reflects its ultimate goal to develop Dubai into a comprehensive, global, long-haul aviation hub. Built for comfort Mansy said that the feat was part of the goal at Emirate, to keep the fleet young and maximise the comfort available to its passengers. According to him, “What happen is after sometime, we replace the old one. And when we replace, we always target the new ones. Both 777s and the 380s are the most advanced aircraft that are flying now and can offer a lot of facilities to the passengers, fuel economy cost, long destinations and others are considered. We want aircraft that can go everywhere in comfort. The average years of our fleet are four to six years.” And indeed, depending on the ticket affordable by a passenger – First Class, Business or Economy – the aircraft types are programmed for maximum comfort. From private suites to shower spas in First Class to flat-bed seats in Business Class and extra leg room in Economy, along with in-flight Wi-Fi throughout the aircraft, a journey on this aircraft is truly comfortable. Beginning from 2003, Emirates started the delivery of the award winning Information Communication and Entertainment (ICE) system on board. The system affords a passenger between 24 to 42 inches personal TV screen to watch latest movie and music collections, podcasts and audio-books as well as live television programme. Today, phone and Wi-Fi services that used to be a no-no, are now possible some 35,000-plus above sea-level. It is indeed a bedroom experience on a six or 10 hours flight. With 251 aircraft on its fleet, Emirate currently delivers 420 flights to 153 destinations a day.  Emirates’ mainline passenger fleet constitutes at least 85 A380-800s, 10 B777-200(LR)s, 10 B777-300s and 124 B777-300(ERs). Training Specialists at Emirates Aviation College (EAC), Dubai, Dennis Kelly, noted that the services would not have been possible without huge investment in training programme that prepare crewmember, ab initio and recurrent, for the onboard hospitality. Conducting the team of visiting Nigerian journalists round the college, Kelly informed that the EAC welcomes no fewer than 5000 new cabin crew members and 16,000 recurrent for re-skilling every year (2015 figures). One of the special trainings on offer, besides safety and group medicals, is onboard sales of duty-free goods to Emirates customers. While no less than 26 A330 and 340 were phased out – either leased or sold out – the airlines will have over 320 aircraft by 2018 and 400 aircraft in its fleet by 2020. More than just acquiring a new fleet and outdoing its competitors, the mood of the likes of Walid, Kelly and a host of others at the college suggests a gulf airline that is indeed the programmed workhorse of a larger vision. A vision that is Dubai, to be the hub of global tourism, beginning from when passengers step on board the Emirates airplane anywhere in the world.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau says he’s heard the gripes about high air fares, and is taking steps to open up competition.  (PATRICK DOYLE / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   By Vanessa LuBusiness reporter Sat., Nov. 12, 2016 Canadians have long complained about sky-high air fares and fees on domestic routes, and on flights down south, millions are willing to trek across the border in search of better deals at U.S. airports. Transport Minister Marc Garneau says he’s heard the gripes, and is taking steps to open up competition by raising the limits on foreign ownership in Canadian airlines, in hopes of spurring no-frills airlines, known in the industry as ultra-low-cost carriers. Those carriers like Allegiant Air in the U.S. or Ireland’s Ryanair offer only the basics — and passengers will often pay for any extras, whether it’s to bring a carry-on bag or to print a boarding pass at the airport. In a speech last week in Montreal, Garneau said the Liberal government would bring in legislation to raise the foreign ownership cap from the current 25 per cent to 49 per cent — though no single investor can own more than 25 per cent. “This will lead to more options for Canadians, and allow the creation of new, low-cost airlines in Canada,” Garneau said. Article Continued Below But it’s unclear whether the raising of foreign ownership caps will be enough to lower the price of flights within Canada, with some calling for additional relief for existing airlines or even more dramatic changes to long-held airline regulations. Garneau’s move certainly seemed to have an immediate positive impact on the industry. In an unusual move, the minister granted exemptions to two companies — Vancouver’s Canada Jetlines and Calgary’s Enerjet — which had asked for the restrictions to be lifted, not wanting to wait for Parliament to enact legislation. Later that same day, Enerjet announced it already has an investor lined up — Phoenix-based Indigo Partners, which helped launch low-cost carriers Spirit Airlines and which also owns Frontier Airlines. Enerjet chief commercial officer Darcy Morgan says his carrier has a working name — FlyToo — which signals its goal of ensuring everyone can afford to fly, too. “We truly believe we are on a path to democratize travel in this country,” he said, arguing cheaper air fares will have a ripple effect on the economy and create jobs. Canada Jetlines president Jim Scott also praised the swift action. “We were very surprised, and very pleased,” he said. “But it also signals that this government is very serious about establishing a third carrier to provide affordable air fare.” His company is planning on going public by doing a reverse takeover, which is when a private company merges with a dormant or shell company that already has a public listing, without having to go through an initial public offering process. It plans to team up with junior miner Jet Metal, which has the ticker JET on the TSX venture exchange, and Scott estimates it needs to first raise $6 million by year’s end. Then it will look for other investors to help the carrier get off the ground, including paying for jets already on order with Boeing. “I’ve had steady calls from interested parties,” he said, adding partners should be finalized and announced in March, with launch by next summer, promising lower fares for consumers. Next week, Jetlines staff will be touring southern Ontario airports looking at options that include Hamilton, Waterloo and London, and possibly others like Windsor or Kingston. Jetlines has said it plans to have main bases in Vancouver and Hamilton, and will fly across Canada, the U.S., Mexico and Caribbean, starting with six Boeing 737 aircraft in the first year. In theory, more competition should bring better prices, but not everyone thinks that will happen. “Don’t hold your breath,” says Ambarish Chandra, an economics professor at the University of Toronto. “I am skeptical. I’ll cheer them on. I would be happy to see more airlines, especially domestic airlines, but I would be surprised to see them build the network they need.” That’s because Canada’s geography and population base just doesn’t have the market size to support the kind of competition that is required, Chandra said. “To run a nation-wide airline with an efficient network requires economies of scale,” he said. “The odds are stacked against them (new airlines). I would be surprised to see them grow very fast, or do very well.” NewLeaf Travel, which has launched service out of Hamilton, argues it’s already growing, offering seats on Kelowna-based Flair Air, to cities in the west and east. NewLeaf emphasizes it is not an airline, but a travel company, so not subject to any foreign ownership rules. “We have managed to find a way into the marketplace under the current constraints,” New Leaf CEO Jim Young said. “We have carried 80,000 customers since July.” NewLeaf runs a very limited schedule — often flying to certain destinations just once a week — with three planes. Its launch did prompt WestJet to begin to match routes including Hamilton to Edmonton — and just this week, WestJet says it will fly between Hamilton and Vancouver four times a week, starting next April. NewLeaf’s launch was initially delayed over licensing questions — which forced the company to cancel reservations and refund customers. Enerjet’s Morgan argues his company is in a much better position to take off, given it already has an aviation operating licence, and is just looking for funding from investor. It has also operated charters to send workers to oilsands projects in northern Alberta, down south to sun destinations for Transat, overseas in Europe for European airlines. He acknowledged that the deal with Indigo Partners still needs to be finalized, but he touted the experience of its executives. “They are the pre-eminent financial backer (for low-cost carriers) and have an excellent track record,” Morgan said, adding Indigo Partners will be the lead backer but not the only investor. He estimates tens of millions of dollars will need to be raised. “We would have a year advantage or maybe 18 months, just to get started,” he said, though the company would have preferred no restrictions on foreign ownership as long as it was Canadian controlled. Canada’s two biggest airlines, Air Canada and WestJet Airlines, are not happy with the exemptions granted to the two carriers, adding the government should also tackle the issue of high airport fees and aviation taxes. “We don’t necessarily like where the playing field is not levelled, in terms of the speed with which exemptions and other decisions are made,” Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said on a conference call this week. “If there is a process to change laws, to change restrictions, then we look forward to everybody having the opportunity to benefit within the same time frame.” Air Canada said it’s prepared to compete on fares, noting it has faced low-cost competition from the likes of Transat and WestJet for years, resulting in competitive fares. Rovinescu also pointed to its discount carrier Rouge, which has a lower operating cost structure, saying it could be deployed on domestic routes, if needed. Rouge has flown routes during peak summer travel season and is flying now between Toronto and Kelowna, B.C., and Toronto and Deer Lake, N.L. WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky said in a statement that the biggest challenge to ensuring low fares for Canadian consumers is the rising cost of aviation infrastructure. “Canada is a much more expensive jurisdiction in which to operate than other jurisdictions,” Saretsky said last week. “We are disappointed the government has not signalled more clearly a willingness to meaningfully review aviation taxation and cost structure.” In fact, Chandra believes the best way to ensure lower fares in Canada is to open up domestic routes to foreign carriers, allowing U.S. airlines or British Airways or Lufthansa to fly between Toronto and Vancouver, or Halifax and Montreal. “It would allow competition on the busy routes — and it would have eventual spillover effect on other routes,” he said. That’s not permitted now and foreign airlines are not allowed to fly domestic routes inside the United States. But in Europe, carriers from other countries are permitted to fly such routes, resulting in cheap fares within European cities. “Given how large Canada is geographically and how small our population is, we need to be bold and think of new measures to create competition,” Chandra said. “In an ideal world, we would have more competition. But it would take bold thinking, beyond just raising ownership caps,” he said. Read more about: United States, Westjet, Air Canada The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

A businessman by profession, Donald Trump is one of the wealthiest and most influential individuals in the world. U.S. presidents through history have their private jets supplied by the government: the Air Force One. However, Trump may be the only president (or presidential candidate) that has a Boeing 757 turned private jet, and it is one of the most luxurious.  Advertisement The Trump Force One, or T-Bird as Trump would like to call it, has cost him an incredible $100 million, according to some reports. The newly elected president has owned this mean machine since 2011 and has turned it into a castle floating in the clouds.   One of the most impressive aspects of this plane is that it has a Rolls-Royce engine allowing it to achieve a striking 500 miles per hour, making it one of the fast Boeing airliners in the world. The interior is probably one of the most notable designs for any multi-passenger aircraft as the original 239-seater plane has been turned into a 430seater plane. All these seats are made from leather and could be transformed into beds. It boasts of its entertainment system which houses a video room with cinema, all of the latest technology.  It doesn't end there; it has a dining room, private guest rooms, and a bedroom. As the icing on the cake, there is a bath with 24-karat gold fixtures. This jet has accompanied Trump in his travels all over the U.S., making it one of the most iconic in the world. It has been the presidential candidate's home during his travels, a great percentage of his budget. It is believed to be one of Trump's instruments in making people believe that America can be rich once again.   Advertisement   TagsTrump, president, US Elections, luxury jet, trump force one © 2016 NatureWorldNews.com All rights reserved.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 12 November 2016 Manufacturers gain from growth of medical device, aerospace and test equipment industries by david tan Phang: ‘From 2002 to 2015, approved investments in medical devices totalled RM18.4bil with 53.5 coming from foreign sources. The increase in FDI reflects the continuing confidence in the industry ecosystem.’ THE global medical device, aerospace and test equipment markets are experiencing growth, generating spillover effects for the local manufacturing base in the country. These growing industries have augmented the approved medical investments in the country and created new business opportunities for aerospace and test equipment companies. According to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida), from January to August 2016, there are 27 approved medical device projects with investments of RM1.72bil. Of the total, 16 are expansion and diversification projects. The other 11 are new. A total of 3,973 job opportunities will be created from these investments. Mida deputy chief executive officer Datuk Phang Ah Tong tells StarBizWeek that in the first half of 2016, approved investments saw a two-fold increase to RM1.6bil compared with RM534.4mil in the corresponding period last year. “From 2002 to 2015, approved investments in medical devices totalled RM18.4bil with 53.5% coming from foreign sources. “The increase in FDI reflects the continuing confidence in the industry ecosystem,” Phang adds. Most of these investments for January to August 2016 were from Luxembourg, US, Singapore, Hong Kong and UK. In terms of the number of projects, the top five recipients were Selangor (8), Penang (6), Johor (4), Perak (3) and Negeri Sembilan (2). For Penang, five out of the total projects are new and will create 970 job opportunities. The local medical device industry is also projecting growth in the export of medical devices from the country. The Association of Malaysian Medical Industry (AMMI) forecasts that export sales AMMI members will experience annual double digit percentage growth of 15% to reach RM9.61bil in 2016 and RM11.06bil in 2017. According to AMMI, the overseas sales of medical device industry in Malaysia is expected to enjoy double digit percentage growth of 15% to reach RM17bil in 2016. “Over 200 medical device projects approved by MIDA since 2009 are at various stages of implementation and ramping up production volume for export purposes. “Existing manufacturers will also have the advantage of exporting with a weakened ringgit against the US dollar,” says AMMI chairman Hitendra Joshi. Joshi says about 40% of AMMI members surveyed indicate they have future expansion plans in the pipeline, involving buildings, machinery, equipment, facilities and product lines. “The combined projected value of these foreseeable future development plans is about RM875mil. “AMMI members collectively project that 2,000 additional talents are required to support industry growth in 2016,” Joshi says. According to Joshi, competition from manufacturers in China, India, Thailand and Vietnam will continue to add pricing pressure to AMMI members in Malaysia. “Despite a weaker ringgit and other extraneous factors that dampened the economic outlook of this country, most AMMI member companies remain bullish about business prospects in Malaysia in 2016 and beyond,” Joshi adds. Moving ahead, Joshi says the industry’s new verve is to manufacture and export high-end medical products such as orthopaedic implants, pacemakers, surgical instruments, and intravenous cannula. The planned merger and acquisition exercises to be undertaken by medical multi-national corporations underpins the positive outlook of the local medical device industry. Abbott Laboratories’s plan to sell its eye care business to Johnson & Johnson (J&J) for about US$4.33bil cash to focus on cardiovascular devices and diagnostics business can be good news for Malaysia. As Abbott Laboratories has an business unit in Kulim, intraocular lenses (IOL) manufacturer, Abbott Medical Optics, there are market talks that the deal once sealed would lead to an expansion of the Kulim operations. Then there is the proposal from Abbott Laboratories to take over St Jude Medical Inc in a deal that values the maker of heart devices at US$25bil, making its biggest ever acquisition as the industry consolidates to gain bargaining power with hospitals. Should the deal is inked, we could also expect St Jude Medical’s operations in Penang to expand. Aerospace industry Meanwhile, Boeing has forecast a need for over 39,600 airplanes valued at more than US$5.9 trillion over the next 20 years, which will benefit the growing local aerospace industry. In its ‘About our Market: Current Market Outlook 2016-2035’ report, Boeing says 38% or about 15,000 of the new airplanes will be delivered to Asia. According MIDA, from January to August 2016, approval was given for three aerospace projects with investments of RM260mil. These investments, mainly from Singapore, are expansion and diversification projects in Malacca and Penang that would create 144 new jobs. Aerospace companies in the country have already responded with plans for expansion. In an interview in March 2016, SAM Engineering & Equipment (M) Bhd chief executive officer Jeffery Goh Wee Keng says the company’s existing facilities are already running at full capacity and the expansion would cater for new orders. He says RM70mil has been allocated for a new plant on a four-acre site in Bukit Minyak to produce nacelle beams for the new Airbus A320neo aircraft. “The other RM30mil would be to equip an existing facility on the island to produce smaller aerospace components,” Goh says. In its 2016 annual report, the group says it is confident that the aerospace business will grow to hit the targeted 80% revenue ratio. According to the annual report, SAM has obtained long term contracts to supply Airbus 320neo nacelle beams and prismatic parts for the Airbus 350, Boeing 787 and Bomabardier C-series aircraft. “These new projects will contribute to SAM’s growth by 2018. Our contractual backlog stands at RM3.5bil,” the annual report says. The aerospace contribution is now about 57% to the group’s revenue. CTRM Aero Composites Sdn Bhd has also invested in a new RM100mil plant operational by the second quarter of 2017 in Malacca to ramp up its production capacity to meet the demand for aircraft composite components. CTRM expects an average increase of RM218mil in revenue for the next 15 years due to amendments in its contract with Rohr Inc in late 2015. Rohr is a UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS) company incorporated in Delaware, USA. The existing agreements and the contract amendments relate to the supply by CTRM-AC to UTAS of aft cascade rings, fan cowl and thrust reverser products, and related spare parts for use in the commercial aerospace industry. Last year, UMW Group has also secured an RM830mil deal with Rolls-Royce Ltd to manufacture and assemble aero engine fan cases. The 25-year agreement will see UMW M&E Sdn Bhd and subsidiary UMW Aerospace Sdn Bhd make fan cases for Rolls-Royce’s Trent 1000 engines which power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Test equipment sector Local test-equipment companies are expected to do well in 2017, as SEMI has projected an 11% growth in 2017 to hit US$41.1bil from US$36.9bil projected for 2016. In particular, the world-wide spending for test equipment is projected to be US$3.36bil in 2016, compared to US$3.36bil, and US$3.46bil in 2017. SEMI is the global industry association serving the manufacturing supply chain for the micro- and nano-electronics industries. Penang-based Pentamaster Corp Bhd is expected to deliver 100 units of test equipment with a value of about RM70mil for the smart device and automotive industries. “These test equipment would be used for checking the sensors in audio and visual systems for smart devices and automobiles,” Chuah says. “Everytime they come out with a new smart device model, there will be a need for new testers to check the various sensors that go into the device. “These are micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMs) motion, signal, sensors, audio, and pressure sensors,” he says. According to Chuah, more than RM500mil worth of jobs is outsourced annually to SME vendors by test equipment companies in the country. “The precision tooling components and the metal fabricated parts are used in new test equipment and as replacement parts in current machine,” he adds. He adds that the group was increasing in 2016 the outsourcing of precision tooling and metal fabrication work to local small and medium vendors. “This year the outsourced amount would increase to RM60mil from RM40mil spent in 2015,” Chuah says. Elsoft Research Bhd chief executive officer CE Tan says the feedback from customers so far indicates that the first quarter of 2017 would not be a conventional soft period. Elsoft’s order for the second half had registered over RM30mil worth of orders for test equipment. “We are in the process of delivering the test equipment for used in the automotive lighting, smart devices, and general lighting segment. “We expect the flow of steady order to continue in the fourth quarter,” Tan says. Tan adds the group had already outsourced more than RM16mil worth of jobs to local SMEs to make customised metal fabricated and standard parts. “This is more than what we spent a year ago on outsourcing,” he adds. From January to August 2016, MIDA gave approvals for 68 electronic and electrical (E&E) projects with investments of RM7.13bil. Of the total, 59 are expansion and diversification projects, while the other nine are new. A total of 12,960 job opportunities will be created from these investments. Most of these investments are from UK, China, Germany, Belgium and Japan. In terms of the number of projects, the top 5 recipients were Penang (22), Johor (19), Selangor (8), Kedah (6) and Perak (4). For Penang, the majority of the projects are expansion and diversification projects and will create 4,580 job opportunities.

Lester Graham / Michigan Radio Listen Listening... / 4:26 Listen to Dave Groh talk to Lester Graham about vintage WWII airplanes. Credit Lester Graham / Michigan Radio World War II vintage planes are big attractions at air shows across the nation, but keeping them in the air means repairs and new parts. That’s where Dave Groh comes in. He operates Yesteryear Aviation Incorporated near Mason, Michigan. He rebuilds and makes parts for planes that were used to train pilots. He’s got one himself. Their mostly wood and canvas bi-planes. Why rebuild WWII trainers? “Because we love aviation,” he chuckled, adding, “and we like World War II aircraft in particular.” Groh says he’s owned some of these Boeing Stearman bi-planes.   He had to learn to rebuild them. Then other people wanted his help. The number of people who know these training planes is shrinking. A lot of the craftsmen were WWII veterans. There are a lot fewer of those guys still around. Groh pretty much does it all. He rebuilds the intricate wood and canvas wings, he manufactures parts, he even rebuilds the engines. A lot of those engines just happen to be Michigan made products. The old Boeing Stearman engine was made by Continental out of Muskegon. The steel forgings throughout the bi-plane were made by Atlas Drop Forge in Lansing. “A lot of the stuff was done here in this state. This airplane was built at the (Boeing) Wichita plant,” Groh explained. Dave Groh with a photo of his plane. The photo rests on a wing's wood skeleton. Credit Lester Graham / Michigan Radio There are about 2000 of these bi-planes still around. Groh says that many planes combined with so few people still around who can do the work ends up keeping his shop busy. “We manufacture a lot of parts under FAA approval for these airplanes,” Groh said. He makes about 95 parts for the bi-plane now and he needs to add to the list of parts he can produce. They also repair aluminum clad AT6 advanced trainers. Grant Dowell with Yesteryear Aviation was busy working on a wing after the plane had a mishap. “It went off the runway and ended up in a ditch and smacked the wing. It ended up doing some damage to the main spar here and some stringers,” Dowell said. Hundreds of rivets have to be drilled out to remove the aircraft’s metal skin. Then structural repairs or replacements are made.  After that, Dowell will rivet it all back together again,  making a 75 year old airplane look like it just came off the factory floor. Grant Dowell working on the wing of an AT6 advanced trainer. Credit Lester Graham / Michigan Radio Both Dowell and Dave Groh are pilots. Groh said there was a point he had to make a decision, fly for one of the airlines or rebuild these WWII vintage planes. “I would have had a better paycheck in the end, but I don’t think I would have been as happy as working here. Plus, I get a lot of family time. Money isn’t everything,” Groh said, smiling. Support for arts and culture coverage comes in part from the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs.

After winning the election, Trump broke tradition by taking his own Boeing 757 jet to a meeting with the outgoing president Barack Obama to discuss the transition period. Having acquired the jet in 2011, Trump has spent a small fortune of about $100m customizing the aircraft to his liking with the latest technology and finest decor. Trump is set for the White House in January 2017 and he would have to give up his luxurious jet for the Air Force One, which is owned by the US military and equipped with special security features to protect the commander in chief while in flight. READ ALSO: 11 facts about Donald Trump’s presidential armored car Below are some amazing features of the jet which he affectionately calls ‘the T-Bird’ 1. Powered by Rolls Royce engines The Boeing 757 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines. Trump was very keen to have this feature on his plane. It is incredibly powerful, although it is not the most fuel-efficient engine in the world. The plane has Rolls Royce engine 2. 24-karat-gold fixtures The seat belts, master bath, taps in the bathroom are 24-carat gold plated. Virtually every fixture in the plane is 24-karat-gold plated. 3. The bedroom Trump has an elegant silk-lined master bedroom equipped with a big-screen entertainment system. The pillows are embroidered with his family crest. There’s also a private guest room with another entertainment system. 4. The seats The seats on the jet have personal entertainment systems and convert into beds. The headrests and pillows are embroidered with the Trump family crest. READ ALSO: Michelle Obama and Melania Trump meet for the first time 5. The video lounge There is a 57-inch screen TV and sound system – installed video room with cinema system similar to a ‘top Hollywood screening room’  with access to 1,000 movies. 6. Other features Everything is controlled by touch screen even access to “The Donald’s” DVR. Trump’s jet can carry only 43 passengers. The Boeing is outfitted with a modern glass cockpit. What you should know. Trump was not the jet’s first owner. Boeing 757-2J4ER first flew in May 1991. In 1995, it was bought by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen and served as a corporate runabout for his various interests. In 2011, it took the place of Trump’s former plane, a Boeing 727 built in 1969. See how Trump is being whisked around in complete luxury. Anybody that says money is not good is such a LIAR!

Iran News ... 11/11/16 GOP in new push against Iran-Boeing deal Source: Press TV Shortly after the victory of Donald Trump as the president-elect of the United States, an early indication has appeared to show that the Republicans are already gearing up to undo the achievements of the outgoing President Barack Obama in his approach toward Iran. The US House Rules Committee announced on Thursday that it is preparing to debate legislation that aims to block US financing for sale of $25 billion worth of planes to Iran by American aviation giant Boeing.  Frontpage of Iranian daily Monaghese The bill from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., would prohibit US banks from financing the plane sale and would revoke any Treasury Department approval of the sale granted before the legislation is approved, reported The USA Today. The bill would "prohibit the secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a US financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran." Boeing received a Treasury license to sell 80 planes to Iran, under a memo signed in June. Yet, it is still negotiating with Iran for selling the planes to the country's national airline Iran Air. Boeing's European rival Airbus also announced in September that it had received Treasury Department's approval to sell planes to Iran. President Obama could veto the legislation if Congress sends it to him. But the bill represents the latest salvo from lawmakers opposed to the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran, which President-elect Donald Trump has criticized and said he would overturn, added The USA Today. The House Rules Committee would meet Monday to set the terms for how the bill is debated on the House floor. Even if approved in the House, it is unclear whether the legislation could clear the Senate during the lame-duck session of Congress, it added. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told The USA Today that he "strongly opposed" the bill, warning that it could undermine the nuclear agreement with Iran. But Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who supported the bill, said it didn't violate the agreement. He suggested that Iran could default on loan payments to US banks. "Let's not expose American depositors and banks to the risk that they will not be paid tens of billions of dollars by Iran," Sherman said. ...

At Shadetree airstrip in Lyman, they keep three airplanes manufactured in the 1940s, used to train World War II pilots and still flying today. Danny Miller, who owns the airfield, says there’s nothing like owning one of these historic aircraft. Miller has the first plane aspiring Army and Navy pilots climbed into, a primary trainer known as the Boeing Stearman. When he flies the plane, Miller thinks about the young cadets who climbed into it for the first time to earn their wings and fight for their country. The airplane is basic. With an open cockpit, low horsepower, fixed landing gear and no radio. “It’s needle, ball and air speed,” brother Jimmy Miller explained: The ball tells you if you’re flying true, the needle if you’re turning and the air speed how fast you’re going.” Danny Miller bought the plane six years ago from an owner in Dover, Delaware, who flew it down. The Millers say about 13,000 were manufactured, with only 1,000 still around. Jimmy Miller has an even rarer bird, a Vultee BT-13, the basic trainer pilots graduated to after they mastered the Stearman. “There’s fewer than 40 flying, and I got one,” he said. “I shopped four, five years until I found the one I wanted and then I went to California and flew it home.” That was a little more than a month ago. He ran into some bad weather on the trip. “It took me five days to get it home,” Jimmy Miller said. “The airplane performed flawlessly. I flew a 1944 airplane from Monterey, California, to Gulfport Mississippi. There’s a small group of people in that club, and I’m one of them.” In the Vultee, pilots learned radio communications and navigation with instruments. They also flew faster because the Vultee engine has double the horsepower of the Stearman. The third training aircraft housed at Shadetree, an AT-6, an advanced trainer manufactured by North American, is owned by a Kiln resident. It is currently in Jackson for repairs, but also is air worthy. Boeing describes the plane as transitioning World War II pilots from trainers to “first-line, tactical aircraft.” The brothers take their planes to air shows in the region, but mostly, they enjoy giving friends and admirers rides in the unique aircraft. Flying in the World War II trainers is a one-of-a-kind experience. Both brothers graciously gave this nervous Sun Herald reporter rides on a sunny Thursday afternoon. First, the Stearman. What a beautiful flight in an open, double cockpit. It wasn’t loud at all because of the 220-horsepower engine, or even overly windy with its compact windshield. The sprawling subdivisions, lakes and piney woods of South Mississippi unfolded as the plane climbed to 500 feet. Danny Miller executed a hard left turn, advising his novice passenger up front before undertaking any maneuver. “We’re going to go low and fast,” he said, checking for obstructions on the runway. And then he nodded toward the Vultee far below: “You’ve got to ride in that beast,” he said. Really? OK. The Vultee was louder, a glass dome covering the double cockpit. It rattled, too. Pilots called it the Vultee Vibrator. Both landings were like touching down in butter instead of on a grass airstrip. Way to go, Millers. Thanks for unforgettable flights in these working pieces of American history.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French GOP in new push against Iran-Boeing deal Fri Nov 11, 2016 8:4AM Home Iran Economy The US House of Representatives has approved a Republican bill to block US financing for sale of $25 billion worth of planes to Iran by Boeing. Shortly after the victory of Donald Trump as the president-elect of the United States, an early indication has appeared to show that the Republicans are already gearing up to undo the achievements of the outgoing President Barack Obama in his approach toward Iran. The US House Rules Committee announced on Thursday that it is preparing to debate legislation that aims to block US financing for sale of $25 billion worth of planes to Iran by American aviation giant Boeing.  The bill from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., would prohibit US banks from financing the plane sale and would revoke any Treasury Department approval of the sale granted before the legislation is approved, reported The USA Today. The bill would "prohibit the secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a US financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran." Boeing received a Treasury license to sell 80 planes to Iran, under a memo signed in June. Yet, it is still negotiating with Iran for selling the planes to the country’s national airline Iran Air. Boeing’s European rival Airbus also announced in September that it had received Treasury Department’s approval to sell planes to Iran. President Obama could veto the legislation if Congress sends it to him. But the bill represents the latest salvo from lawmakers opposed to the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran, which President-elect Donald Trump has criticized and said he would overturn, added The USA Today. The House Rules Committee would meet Monday to set the terms for how the bill is debated on the House floor. Even if approved in the House, it is unclear whether the legislation could clear the Senate during the lame-duck session of Congress, it added. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told The USA Today that he "strongly opposed" the bill, warning that it could undermine the nuclear agreement with Iran. But Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who supported the bill, said it didn't violate the agreement. He suggested that Iran could default on loan payments to US banks. "Let's not expose American depositors and banks to the risk that they will not be paid tens of billions of dollars by Iran," Sherman said. Loading ...

Tracey Curtis-Taylor was celebrated for completing a solo flight from Cape Town, South Africa, to Goodwood in 2013. The flight was organised to retrace Lady Mary Heath’s 1928 journey – flying in a classic 1940s open cockpit Boeing Stearman biplane. As a result of the trip, the 54-year-old was presented the prestigious Bill Woodhams trophy awarded for navigation by the Light Aircraft Association. But members of the aviation body decided to rescind the title at their latest annual general meeting after it was claimed the pilot flew only a handful of the 36 legs alone. Ms Curtis-Taylor denied her own trip was ever planned as lone voyage – despite an official press release by supporters Boeing at the time, which described it as a ‘solo journey’. She said she had intended to make the journey in the biplane flying solo, but denied claims she had made ‘false assertions’ about the trip. In a statement, Ms Curtis-Taylor explained several people had flown with her on multiple legs between Cape Town and the UK, including her engineer Ewald Gritsch. But she added: ‘I have never made false assertions about the nature of my flights and I dismiss the suggestion that they are “mired in controversy”. ‘A combination of elements resulted in fundamental changes being made to the nature of that expedition.’ The controversy comes amid calls to strip the famed pilot of other honorary titles presented to her in Portsmouth. Last year, Ms Curtis-Taylor was awarded the rank of Lieutenant Commander in the maritime reserve. And in July this year, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Portsmouth for her adventuring. Her defiance has infuriated the father of a serving Royal Navy officer, based at HMS Collingwood, who said she should be stripped of her rank and all her titles. Mike Flynn, a former BBC reporter and pilot, said: ‘She’s embellished this great aviatrix story which just is not true. She’s fooled everybody.’ Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Atlas V launches WorldView-4 out of Vandenberg November 10, 2016 by William Graham The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket – interrupted by a wildfire – finally conducted a rare commercial launch on Friday, tasked with orbiting the WorldView-4 Earth-imaging satellite in a mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The launch was set to take place in September, prior to the standdown. Atlas V Launch: The launch of WorldView-4 was the tenth commercial launch for the Atlas V rocket, although six of those launches were made more than ten years ago before the rocket was established as a workhorse for United States government customers. The initial launch attempt back in September was proceeding to the final minutes of the countdown, prior to a decision to standdown due to a small ground side LH2 leak resulting in an ice ball forming on an umbilical. ULA CEO Tory Bruno noted this was outside of ULA’s historic experience, thus resulting in a scrub – for at least 24 hours – to resolve. Later, a ULA source noted the next attempt would be 48 hours after the scrub in order to allow time to replace a Fill and Drain (F&D) valve that was deemed to be the problem during first attempt. However, that Sunday’s attempt was called off early in the morning due to brush fires in the region. Those fires became a much larger problem during the days that followed, with large wildfires ravaging the area. They reached within eye shot of the pad. However, responders ably managed to keep the launch site safe, with Atlas V protected inside the launch tower. WorldView-4 was the second satellite to be launched by the Atlas V for its operator, DigitalGlobe, following WorldView-3 in August 2014. See Also UPDATES Atlas V WV-4 ULA Forum Section 65 Launch Vehicle Manuals (L2) Click here to Join L2 WorldView-4 was originally constructed for GeoEye Incorporated as GeoEye-2. Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract to build the satellite in March 2010, followed in October of the same year by a contract to provide launch services. Lockheed Martin developed the Atlas V rocket. However, in 2006 it transferred the rocket to the newly-formed United Launch Alliance (ULA), a jointly-owned venture with Boeing who transferred their Delta II and Delta IV vehicles to the company. Under this agreement, Lockheed Martin still markets the rocket to commercial customers, subcontracting the launch to ULA. GeoEye merged with DigitalGlobe in January 2013, four months ahead of the planned launch of GeoEye-2. With DigitalGlobe’s own WorldView-3 scheduled to fly the following year, the company decided that launching both satellites in such a short timespan was unnecessary and opted to keep GeoEye-2 as a ground spare until needed in orbit. A year later DigitalGlobe announced that due to market demand they were considering moving the launch up and that the spacecraft had been renamed WorldView-4; in late 2015 the launch was set for September 2016. DigitalGlobe itself was formed in January 1992 as WorldView Imaging, and from 1995 to 2001 the company was named EarthWatch, before taking on its current name. The company’s first satellite, EarlyBird 1, was launched by a Start-1 rocket in December 1997. However, the spacecraft failed three days after launch. A second satellite, Quickbird-1, was lost in a Kosmos-3M launch failure in November 2000, before Quickbird-2 successfully reached orbit atop a Delta II the following October, achieving thirteen and a quarter years of service before its retirement in January 2015. Today, the company has four satellites in service: WorldView-1 was launched atop a Delta II 7920-10C from Vandenberg in September 2007 and was designed for a minimum of seven and a half years’ service which it has already exceeded. WorldView-2 followed atop another Delta II in October 2009, with WorldView-3 launching on an Atlas V in August 2014. The fourth satellite is GeoEye-1, inherited in the merger with GeoEye, which was launched by a Delta II 7420-10C in September 2008. Although GeoEye-1 has already surpassed its seven-year design life, it carries sufficient fuel for fifteen years of service. WorldView-4 is a 2,087-kilogram (4,601 lb) satellite, based on Lockheed Martin’s LM-900 bus and LMx avionics package. The LM-900 bus has only previously been used for two satellites: a pair of Ikonos imaging satellites operated by one of GeoEye’s predecessors – Space Imaging – which were launched by Athena-2 rockets in 1999. The first failed to achieve orbit. However, the second – Ikonos-1 – remained in service for fifteen and a half years. It was transferred to GeoEye when the company was formed in the 2006 merger of Space Imaging and the Orbital Imaging Corporation, or OrbImage, and was still operational when transferred to DigitalGlobe in the 2013 merger – finally being decommissioned in March 2015. In the eighteen years since its last launch, Lockheed Martin has improved on the LM-900 bus, incorporating the same avionics package used in planetary missions including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Juno and GRAIL. Lockheed Martin has also upgraded its LM-1200 bus, jointly designating the two platforms with improved avionics as the LMx series. WorldView-4’s GIS-2 imaging systems were developed by Harris Corporation and are capable of panchromatic or multispectral observations over a 13.1-kilometre (8.1 mile, 7.1 nautical mile) swath width. Panchromatic imaging will capture light at wavelengths between 450 and 800 nanometres, with a resolution of up to 31 centimeters (12.2 inches). In multispectral operation the satellite can sample a blue band of wavelengths between 450 and 510 nanometres, green between 510 and 580 nm, red between 655 and 690 nm and infrared between 780 and 920 nanometres. The satellite’s maximum multispectral resolution is 1.24 meters. The WorldView-4 satellite has a design life of seven years; however it is expected to exceed this with ten to twelve years of service envisioned. The satellite will be operated in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 617 kilometers (383 miles, 333 nautical miles). The Atlas V that launched WorldView-4, AV-062, was an Atlas V 401. The smallest Atlas V configuration, it consists of a Common Core Booster (CCB) first stage and a single-engine Centaur second stage with a four-metre payload fairing and no solid-fuelled booster rockets. AV-062 was originally intended to launch NASA’s InSight mission to Mars in March, however efforts to repair a leak in the InSight spacecraft’s primary instrument could not be completed in time to make its 27-day launch window, necessitating a delay to 2018, the next time Earth and Mars will be aligned to facilitate placing the spacecraft into a suitable transfer orbit between the two planets. Assembly of the Atlas V for the InSight mission was already underway, so the vehicle was kept integrated atop its launch pad in preparation for the next mission, WorldView, which was to use the same 401 configuration. WorldView-4 was launched from Space Launch Complex 3E (SLC-3E) at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Part of a two-pad complex that was originally built as Launch Complex 1 of the US Navy’s Point Arguello facility, the pad became part of the adjacent Vandenberg Air Force Base when the sites were merged in 1964 and was subsequently renamed SLC-3E in 1967 with the complex’s other pad becoming SLC-3W. The first launch from SLC-3E – then still part of Point Arguello – was made by an Atlas LV-3 Agena-B on 12 July 1961, the first of several Atlas-Agenas to launch from the pad. After the Atlas-Agena the complex was used by three Atlas SLV-3 vehicles which made suborbital launches with the PRIME lifting body in 1966 and 1967, followed in 1968 by a single launch of a leftover Atlas SLV-3 with a Burner II upper stage which failed to achieve orbit. After this launch, the pad remained inactive for ten years. Beginning in 1978, SLC-3E began to be used by the Atlas E/F rocket, based on the Atlas-E and Atlas-F missiles, to launch early Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites; followed by Atlas-H launches with first-generation Intruder ocean surveillance satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. The pad again became inactive following the final Atlas-H launch in May 1987. However, in the 1990s it was rebuilt for the Atlas II. Three Atlas II vehicles launched from Vandenberg; the first carrying NASA’s Terra Earth observation satellite with two subsequent launches deploying third-generation Intruder satellites for the NRO. The Atlas V was not originally expected to launch from Vandenberg; due to the relatively limited subset of Government missions requiring a West Coast launch only the Delta IV was to have facilities there. This changed after Boeing were stripped of several launch contracts following a corporate espionage case, and the former Atlas II pad was adapted for the larger Atlas V. AV-062 will be the twelfth Atlas V to fly from SLC-3E. The second pad at Space Launch Complex 3, SLC-3W, is no longer in use. It supported its last launch in March 1995 with the retirement of the Atlas E/F and despite conversion by SpaceX to launch Falcon 1 rockets in the mid-2000s, the pad was never used again for a launch. The Falcon launch facilities at SLC-3W have since been dismantled. Launch of the Atlas V rocket with WorldView-4 began with ignition of the rocket’s RD-180 engine 2.7 seconds before the countdown reached zero. Developed by Russian manufacturer NPO Energomash, the RD-180 is derived from the RD-170 series of engine developed for the Zenit rocket and burns RP-1 propellant mixed with liquid oxygen within twin combustion chambers. A single RD-180 powers the Atlas V first stage, or Common Core Booster (CCB). Liftoff of AV-062 occurred when the thrust from the RD-180 engine exceeded the weight of the rocket; which occurred 1.1 seconds after the zero mark in the countdown. Atlas began its ascent, making a series of pitch and yaw maneuvers beginning seventeen and a half seconds after launch to place itself on the pre-planned launch trajectory. The rocket flew south from Vandenberg along an azimuth of 185.6 degrees over the Pacific Ocean. At 79.1 seconds into the flight the vehicle passed through Mach 1, the speed of sound, followed by the area of maximum dynamic pressure, or Max-Q, 13.4 seconds later. Four minutes and 3.1 seconds after liftoff, the Common Core Booster cut off, having completed its role in the mission. The spent stage separated six seconds later, with the second stage engine beginning its prestart sequence. The second stage, Centaur, is powered by a single RL10C-1 engine which burns cryogenic propellant; liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Centaur ignition occurred ten seconds after stage separation. Prior to the deployment of WorldView-4, Centaur made a single burn lasting eleven minutes and 15.9 seconds. At the start of the burn, 8.1 seconds after ignition, the rocket’s payload fairing separated from around the WorldView spacecraft. For this mission a Long Payload Fairing (LPF), the shortest of the three four-metre fairings available, was used to encapsulate the satellite. Separation of WorldView-4 is occurred at nineteen minutes and 15.9 seconds mission elapsed time; three minutes and 39 seconds after the end of powered flight. The target deployment orbit is 610.46 by 628.29 kilometers (379.31 by 390.40 miles, 329.62 by 339.25 nautical miles) at an inclination of 97.96 degrees to Earth’s equator. Centaur’s mission did not end with the separation of WorldView-4. During its second revolution around the Earth, seven smaller satellites were deployed under a mission designated Enterprise, which is sponsored by the National Reconnaissance Office. All of the secondary payloads conform the CubeSat standard. AeroCube-8C and 8D are 1.5-unit CubeSats which form part of The Aerospace Corporation’s IMPACT mission, carrying technology demonstration experiments that include a new form of ion propulsion, materials research involving the use of carbon nanotubes for radiation shielding, and studies of the performance of solar cells. AeroCube-8C and 8D follow the AeroCube-8A and 8B satellites launched as secondary payloads to the X-37B spaceplane last May as part of the AFSPC-5 launch. The US Air Force Research Laboratory’s CELTEE satellite is a single-unit CubeSat which will be used to evaluate the on-orbit performance of an Enhanced Location Transponder (ELT) developed by M42 Technologies of Seattle, Washington. The one-kilogram (2.2 lb) satellite is expected to operate for three to six months while researchers on the ground track the satellite to determine how well the transponder serves its purpose. The AFRL’s second CubeSat aboard the mission is named Untitled 2U, or U2U, and is a two-unit CubeSat which will carry out an experiment named Electron and Globalstar Mapping – presumably indicating that its research will involve the Globalstar communication satellite network. Preliminary results from the U2U mission are scheduled to be presented at a December conference of the American Geophysical Union. Two 1.5-unit Prometheus satellites, developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, form part of an experiment into using small satellites to relay video, voice and data communications between field terminals and ground stations. Prometheus 2A and 2B are the first members of a second-generation Prometheus constellation, building on research conducted by the eight-satellite first-generation constellation which launched aboard a Minotaur I rocket in 2013 as part of the ORS-3 mission. Further second-generation spacecraft will be launched as secondary payloads on the maiden flight of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket, currently scheduled for next year. The final secondary payload, Radiometer Assessment Using Vertically Aligned Nanotubes – or RAVAN – is a three-unit CubeSat built by Blue Canyon Technologies for operation by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. Designed for a six-month mission, the five-kilogram (11-lb) satellite will use highly light-absorbent carbon nanotubes to collect as much of the radiation emitted and reflected by the Earth as possible across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. A radiometer will be used to measure the total radiation output of the Earth, which scientists will compare to the energy input from the sun to study the imbalance between incident and outgoing radiation – or the amount of energy retained by the Earth. The CubeSats separated from Centaur in four groups, between two hours, eleven minutes and 45.9 seconds and two hours, twenty-five minutes and 45.9 seconds mission elapsed time. After all seven CubeSats deployed, the Centaur is likely to fire its RL10 engine again in a disposal burn, taking itself away from the operational orbits of its spacecraft. The final destination of the Centaur from the launch is expected to be heliocentric orbit, with the disposal burn propelling it to Earth escape trajectory. The launch was the sixth of the year for the Atlas V rocket, following on from the successful deployment of the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft bound for asteroid (101955) Bennu, which flew from Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas V 411. It was the ninth launch of 2016 for United Launch Alliance, who have also launched three Delta IV vehicles. An Atlas V launch had been scheduled for early October with the SBIRS-GEO-3 missile detection satellite. However, this mission has been delayed due to apparent concerns that the satellite uses a similar component to one that had recently failed on another satellite. Details of the component and other satellite in question were not given, other than the satellite was not built by Lockheed Martin – the manufacturer of the SBIRS-GEO spacecraft. The concerns likely refer to the Intelsat 33e satellite whose apogee motor failed after launching on an Ariane 5 earlier this year. Beyond SBIRS-GEO-3, ULA’s plans for the remainder of 2016 currently an Atlas V mission with NOAA’s GOES-R satellite later this month November, potentially followed by two launches in December with NROL-79 for the National Reconnaissance Office and the commercial EchoStar XIX communications satellite. A Delta IV launch will carry the eighth Wideband Global Satcom spacecraft for the US Air Force before the year is out. (Images via ULA, WorldView, Lockheed Martin).

(collectSPACE) November 11, 2016 — Astronauts from four branches of the U.S. military spent Veteran's Day at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday (Nov. 11), attending the launch of a public attraction devoted to honoring America's spaceflight pioneers. James Lovell, who served as a Navy Captain; Buzz Aldrin, who was a U.S. Air Force Colonel; Walt Cunningham, who was also a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps; and Bruce Melnick, who is one of only two astronauts to hail from the U.S. Coast Guard, joined more than 20 other military and civilian astronauts at a ceremony and ribbon cutting for the new "Heroes & Legends, featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame" exhibit at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. "It is no coincidence that we chose to celebrate the grand opening of Heroes & Legends on this day, Veteran's Day," said John Zarella, a former CNN news correspondent who served as the master of ceremonies. "Many, many of our astronaut heroes are also members of the United States Armed Forces, but not only that, they have all served their country as members of NASA's elite astronaut corps, each one willing to undertake extremely dangerous missions to advance scientific study to benefit all of humanity." Click to enlarge and view video in a new pop-up window. (NASA) Intended as the first stop after guests enter the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Heroes & Legends focuses on the early years of U.S. human spaceflight to explore the concept of heroism. The 37,000 square foot (3,440 sq. m.) attraction marries cutting-edge technology with immersive visual effects, authentic astronaut artifacts and interactive exhibits. "This great big attraction also has a great big name — 'Heroes & Legends, featuring the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, presented by Boeing. That is because this attraction tells the story of many, many people — not only the astronaut heroes whose daring missions are brought to life inside these walls, but also the countless people and companies who worked behind the scenes to enable those missions to happen," said Therrin Protze, chief operating officer of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. Protze delivered his remarks standing in front of the post-modern-inspired façade of the new exhibit, which features a towering bas relief of America's first astronauts, NASA's original Mercury 7. "It was the six surviving Mercury astronauts who were the first to conceive a place where space explorers would be remembered," said Dan Brandenstein, an Astronaut Hall of Fame inductee and chairman of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. "I can only imagine how proud and humbled they'd have been, not only to see themselves immortalized on this wall, but to see the legacy of spaceflight that they all created." "I'm certain that Heroes & Legends far surpasses anything that they would have imagined," said Brandenstein. The opening ceremony for "Heroes & Legends" at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida. (collectSPACE) Heroes & Legends is the first attraction at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex to bear the name of its corporate sponsor, Boeing, which now comprises the companies that built the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft showcased in the exhibit. "I think it is appropriate going into our next 100 years as a company ... that we look back at the heroes that got us to this point," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager of Boeing's Space Exploration division. "We are excited to partner with the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on this Heroes & Legends attraction." The goal of Heroes & Legends, as described by the Visitor Complex, is for the public to gain a renewed sense of pride and more indepth understanding of the qualities of heroism represented by NASA's pioneering astronauts — and why they deserve admiration and respect. "I think it is important as you tour this exhibit to remember all of the dedication and the hard work that it took for those of us who were involved in the astronaut program," said Charlie Duke, who in 1972 became the tenth man to walk on the moon. "Hopefully, it will be an inspiration to you and your grandkids and your kids."

Through the Eyes of a Hero is a custom-built theater featuring a multisensory 4-D experience during which guests vicariously join NASA’s heroes and legends on the most perilous stages of their missions. A spirited pyrotechnics display marked the opening of the new attraction, which was attended by more than 25 veteran and current NASA astronauts, including revered Gemini and Apollo space program astronauts Buzz Aldrin, James Lovell and Thomas Stafford. They were joined by the adult children of the late-astronauts Alan Shepard and Neil Armstrong, as well as representatives from NASA, The Boeing Company and Delaware North.  Hundreds of park guests also attended the ceremony, which was held on Veterans Day to honor all military heroes, including the many astronauts who are also military veterans. Designed to be the first stop upon entering Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Heroes & Legends uses the early years of the space program to explore the concept of heroism, and the qualities that define the individuals who inspired their generation. The 37,000-square-foot, retro-fitted building marries cutting-edge technology with mesmerizing special effects, priceless artifacts and thought-provoking exhibits. “The opening of Heroes & Legends today marks a true milestone for Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex,” said Therrin Protze, chief operating officer. “And it is such an honor to have so many astronaut heroes here with us to share in the celebration. We are so grateful that they can personally experience this living tribute to their sacrifices, determination and achievements. “Heroes & Legends offers the opportunity to learn about the amazing attributes of our heroes behind the transformative and historical events that have shaped the way we look at space, the world and the future. It will not only entertain and inspire guests, but lay the groundwork for their interactions throughout the other amazing attractions to create memorable space experiences,” Protze said. Through engaging storytelling, guests embark on an awe-inspiring journey through Heroes & Legends that begins with an immersive exhibit designed to spark thought and discussion about how society defines a hero. Cutting-edge technology, interactive elements and engaging exhibits work together to introduce visitors to the heroes of the NASA space program: the pioneers who made space exploration possible. The deliberate architectural design for the new building is meant to celebrate spacecraft throughout history and into the future, and features a 30-by-40-foot bas-relief sculpture of the seven Mercury astronauts on its facade. A dramatic, sweeping ramp entrance simulates the journey to the stars, and features an elevated slingshot path through the Rocket Garden. Heroes & Legends is separated into three distinct experiences, plus the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame: In the stunning 360-degree discovery bay, What is a Hero?, guests explore how society defines heroism through diverse perspectives. Each examination of heroism starts with the following questions: What is a hero; Who are the heroes of our time; and What does it take to be a hero? During the seven-minute presentation, the historic beginning of the space race is acknowledged as the impetus for America’s push to the stars in NASA’s early years and the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Through the Eyes of a Hero is a custom-built theater featuring a multisensory 4-D experience during which guests vicariously join NASA’s heroes and legends on the most perilous stages of their missions. Artistically choreographed lighting and special effects are enhanced by intense, deeply resonant sound effects and surrounding images to create the sensation of being “in the moment.” The seven-and-a-half-minute show takes guests on an intimate journey with four space-age heroes – Alan Shepard, Neil Armstrong, John Glenn and James Lovell – to fully immerse them in the awe, excitement and dangers of the first crewed space program missions. The third experience, A Hero Is…, offers interactive exhibits that highlight the nine different attributes of our history-making astronauts:  inspired, curious, passionate, tenacious, disciplined, confident, courageous, principled and selfless. Through the use of holograms and augmented reality, visitors will be able to interact with space program artifacts in a way never before possible. A collection of nine exhibit modules explores each aforementioned attribute through the actual experiences of NASA’s astronauts and memorabilia. Their stories are enhanced with real artifacts from the astronaut and the space program, including a Gemini IX capsule featuring a realistic projection of astronaut Gene Cernan climbing out of the tiny spacecraft. Other interactive features inspire further exploration of the original Mercury Mission Control room consoles, with a periodic flashback to the tense moments preceding the landing of Freedom 7 by astronaut John Glenn. Rounding out the collection of authentic artifacts is a Sigma 7 Mercury spacecraft, which is paired with a Mercury-Redstone rocket, and Gus Grissom’s Mercury spaceflight suit. The culminating exhibit of Heroes & Legends is the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. Housed in a majestic rotunda, the exhibit intimately connects the visitor to each of the nearly 100 astronaut inductees through the use of state-of-the-art interactive technology. A signature element of the experience is the ability to capture a memento: a special photo opportunity that allows guests to pose with one of the Mercury astronaut heroes and legends. “The goal is for visitors to leave both attractions with a renewed sense of pride and a more in-depth understanding and appreciation of the qualities of heroism represented by NASA’s pioneering astronauts, and why they deserve admiration and respect,” Protze said.

The move by the Australian authorities has given rise to speculation that ATSB is using a public relations cover for its decision to base the search on its “death dive” theory of an unpiloted rapid descent at the end of the flight, the Australian reported Friday. Alternately, it is also suggested that authorities may be reviewing to identify a new search area. Last week, Australia's Transport Minister Darren Chester reportedly conducted a three-day meeting in Canberra of the ATSB’s Search Strategy Working Group, made up of experts from air crash investigation organizations in the U.S. and Britain, satellite group Inmarsat, Boeing, European aerospace group ­Thales and the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organization. Representatives from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Geoscience Australia and the Malaysian and Chinese governments attended a "first principles review." Experts would “review all the available data and analysis ­associated with the search to date” and “inform the remainder of the search effort, and develop guidance for any future search operations," Chester said.  Roger Gott­lob, spokesman for the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, said the report “is currently being drafted and will be released in the coming months,” but did not mention whether it will be complete before the search ended. “The main focus for all concerned will continue to be finding the aircraft to assist the Malaysian investigation team and to bring closure to the families of the passengers and crew of MH370,” Gottlob said. ATSB announced last month that bad weather in the search zone in a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean pushed the operation's end to January or February next year. The search of a 46,000-square-mile area has been ongoing for nearly three years with no concrete clues about the plane's whereabouts.

The ATSB was “just trying to write a cover story to protect themselves," professional pilot and aviation commentator Byron Bailey reportedly said, adding that "they started with the wrong basis for the search that the pilot was unresponsive." Air crash investigator John Cox reportedly said the ATSB review was “the next logical step.” “It is self-evident that the search effort, to date, has not been successful,” Cox said, according to the Australian, adding: “Therefore, it is reasonable to put the experts in a room to review all the available data for ideas and recommendations. If this group finds reason to, and recommends searching in a different area, it will be much ­easier to persuade the involved countries.” Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Finding Flight MH370: Will the Search be fruitful? Let’s See! Posted By: Faramarz HedayatiPosted date: November 13, 2016In: Social Page 1 of 212» The Malaysian airline flight MH370 vanished from its route on the 8th of March 2014 and has continued to be the most mysterious cases of all times. The reason behind its going off the grid has still not been clear. The search for the carrier of 239 passengers has proved to be costly and unsuccessful. Its last contact with the air traffic control was when it was flying over the South China Sea. The Malaysian military radar kept track of the plane till it drifted westwards and finally disappeared for good. Numerous underwater searches have been conducted in order to unearth the mystery. The speculated reasons have ranged from lack of oxygen to a destructive pilot. The case saw a ray of hope when there was some debris found near Mozambique and Australia. But, there was never a clear explanation about the course of events that led to this fate. However, there has been information that has emerged in order to build the picture of the probable cause of the accident. A new report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau says that the flight was seen shooting towards the sea with a high rate of descent. The plane’s landing flaps were also stowed which confirms that the passengers and crew were not preparing for a water landing. The reports also suggest that there was no one controlling the plane before it crashed. Theories suggest that there could be a fire which led to a shortage of oxygen in the cabin or a breach in one of the windows. Due to these reasons, the passengers and crew might have been dead much before the plane ran out of fuel and was seen descending into the Indian Ocean. So far, 11,000 square kilometers of deep sea search for the remainder of MH370. But, there’s hardly anything to prove it. Officials suggest that final conclusion is close to impossible till such time the exact location of the Boeing 777 is found through satellite coverage. There are also speculations that suggest towards someone still controlling the plane towards the end of its flight. But that complicates the search operations further more as it would increase the possible area of crash by three times. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director suggests that the study of the wing flap found in Tanzania suggests that it was not deployed. This further suggests that the Boeing was not controlled and the area being search is in fact, the only area to find possible wreckage. A summit was held in Canberra in order to examine the performed search and possibilities for further search with a team including international and Australian experts. Up till now, 20 parts of debris has been discovered, that are either speculated or confirmed to be of MH370. But the sonar search conducted underwater led to no successful findings. However, the search will continue further as planned in hopes of discovering something else related to the plane going missing. Barring the deep sea search, no other sort of search has been scheduled yet. The planned search of the remaining area will be complete by early 2017 and the team does not plan on extending this search unless concrete evidence if found. The current operation is to find where exactly did the first piece of debris come from. The study will look into the place from where it might have drifted towards Tanzania, which could be helpful in finding the major part of the debris.

Advertisement In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect's name and his support for a DAMAC project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other U.S. firms are strong. The United States imported $32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing and a number of U.S. defence firms. The Gulf's sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump's campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding which has stakes in U.S. firms including Citigroup and Twitter , called him a "disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America". However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: "President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency." Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump's Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the U.S. if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump's comments on Muslims "were for the election only" and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favour of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the U.S. Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers. "FAIR COMPETITOR" Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC told Reuters on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al-Ardhi, executive chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp , which has billions of dollars in U.S. real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. "Investcorp knows that Mr. Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal," Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewellery firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 percent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major U.S. cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest $35 billion in the U.S. over five years. Spokesmen for the QIA and ADIA declined to comment on the election. UNCERTAINTY FOR AIRLINES Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with U.S. carriers. A group including American Airlines and United Airlines say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favour U.S. interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. "It's so important for our business that the liberalisation that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on Oct. 18, adding Trump "may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade". A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways' Group Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. "Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position," he said in a statement to Reuters.

But not because of a rocket launch! Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/7973151-kennedy-space-center-heroes-legends Continue Reading Heroes & Legends Grand Opening highlights featuring Hall of Fame astronauts U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame Jim Lovell, U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame Heroes & Legends featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame presented by Boeing Representatives of NASA, Boeing and Delaware North, which operates Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex for NASA, are joined by 25 Hall of Fame astronauts from the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs to celebrate the opening of Heroes & Legends featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame presented by Boeing. Through the Eyes of a Hero is a custom-built theater featuring a multisensory 4-D experience during which guests vicariously join NASA’s heroes and legends on the most perilous stages of their missions. A spirited pyrotechnics display marked the opening of the new attraction, which was attended by more than 25 veteran and current NASA astronauts, including revered Gemini and Apollo space program astronauts Buzz Aldrin, James Lovell and Thomas Stafford. They were joined by the adult children of the late-astronauts Alan Shepard and Neil Armstrong, as well as representatives from NASA, The Boeing Company and Delaware North.  Hundreds of park guests also attended the ceremony, which was held on Veterans Day to honor all military heroes, including the many astronauts who are also military veterans. Designed to be the first stop upon entering Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Heroes & Legends uses the early years of the space program to explore the concept of heroism, and the qualities that define the individuals who inspired their generation. The 37,000-square-foot, retro-fitted building marries cutting-edge technology with mesmerizing special effects, priceless artifacts and thought-provoking exhibits. “The opening of Heroes & Legends today marks a true milestone for Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex,” said Therrin Protze, chief operating officer. “And it is such an honor to have so many astronaut heroes here with us to share in the celebration. We are so grateful that they can personally experience this living tribute to their sacrifices, determination and achievements. “Heroes & Legends offers the opportunity to learn about the amazing attributes of our heroes behind the transformative and historical events that have shaped the way we look at space, the world and the future. It will not only entertain and inspire guests, but lay the groundwork for their interactions throughout the other amazing attractions to create memorable space experiences,” Protze said. Through engaging storytelling, guests embark on an awe-inspiring journey through Heroes & Legends that begins with an immersive exhibit designed to spark thought and discussion about how society defines a hero. Cutting-edge technology, interactive elements and engaging exhibits work together to introduce visitors to the heroes of the NASA space program: the pioneers who made space exploration possible. The deliberate architectural design for the new building is meant to celebrate spacecraft throughout history and into the future, and features a 30-by-40-foot bas-relief sculpture of the seven Mercury astronauts on its facade. A dramatic, sweeping ramp entrance simulates the journey to the stars, and features an elevated slingshot path through the Rocket Garden. Heroes & Legends is separated into three distinct experiences, plus the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame: In the stunning 360-degree discovery bay, What is a Hero?, guests explore how society defines heroism through diverse perspectives. Each examination of heroism starts with the following questions: What is a hero; Who are the heroes of our time; and What does it take to be a hero? During the seven-minute presentation, the historic beginning of the space race is acknowledged as the impetus for America’s push to the stars in NASA’s early years and the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Through the Eyes of a Hero is a custom-built theater featuring a multisensory 4-D experience during which guests vicariously join NASA’s heroes and legends on the most perilous stages of their missions. Artistically choreographed lighting and special effects are enhanced by intense, deeply resonant sound effects and surrounding images to create the sensation of being “in the moment.” The seven-and-a-half-minute show takes guests on an intimate journey with four space-age heroes – Alan Shepard, Neil Armstrong, John Glenn and James Lovell – to fully immerse them in the awe, excitement and dangers of the first crewed space program missions. The third experience, A Hero Is…, offers interactive exhibits that highlight the nine different attributes of our history-making astronauts:  inspired, curious, passionate, tenacious, disciplined, confident, courageous, principled and selfless. Through the use of holograms and augmented reality, visitors will be able to interact with space program artifacts in a way never before possible. A collection of nine exhibit modules explores each aforementioned attribute through the actual experiences of NASA’s astronauts and memorabilia. Their stories are enhanced with real artifacts from the astronaut and the space program, including a Gemini IX capsule featuring a realistic projection of astronaut Gene Cernan climbing out of the tiny spacecraft. Other interactive features inspire further exploration of the original Mercury Mission Control room consoles, with a periodic flashback to the tense moments preceding the landing of Freedom 7 by astronaut John Glenn. Rounding out the collection of authentic artifacts is a Sigma 7 Mercury spacecraft, which is paired with a Mercury-Redstone rocket, and Gus Grissom’s Mercury spaceflight suit. The culminating exhibit of Heroes & Legends is the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. Housed in a majestic rotunda, the exhibit intimately connects the visitor to each of the nearly 100 astronaut inductees through the use of state-of-the-art interactive technology. A signature element of the experience is the ability to capture a memento: a special photo opportunity that allows guests to pose with one of the Mercury astronaut heroes and legends. “The goal is for visitors to leave both attractions with a renewed sense of pride and a more in-depth understanding and appreciation of the qualities of heroism represented by NASA’s pioneering astronauts, and why they deserve admiration and respect,” Protze said.

Lim @pauljlim Nov. 11, 2016 SHARE Richard Drew—AP Trader Anthony RInaldi, left, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, November 7, 2016. The conventional wisdom appears to be flawed. Before Tuesday’s election, conventional wisdom said the stock market would tank if Donald Trump were elected president, given Wall Street fears over his threats to rip up global trade deals. That turned out to be dead wrong. While stock market jitters certainly spiked in after-hours trading following his upset win, the Dow Jones industrial average actually jumped nearly 500 points in the first two trading days following Trump’s surprise win. Wall Street’s new take: Trump could fuel a strong rally in stocks as he seems to be promising an unusually bipartisan form of government stimulus. He says he wants to give Republicans the massive tax cuts they want while simultaneously promising hundreds of billions of dollars for infrastructure projects that will create jobs that Democrats support. Yet this bit of conventional wisdom is also be flawed. If you look at the market’s reaction to Trump, it’s actually been a tale of two markets, with big winners but also a lot of big losers. You can get a better sense of who those winners and losers are by simply looking at two of the market’s benchmarks: the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite index. What the Dow Is Telling You The Dow, made up of just 30 large stocks that are supposed to reflect the nature of our economy, has been soaring in the wake of Trump’s victory. Understand which stocks drive the Dow. More than 40% of the benchmark index is composed of old-guard industrial stocks and financial shares that stand to be big winners initially under a Trump administration. Why industrials win: Trump has pledged to spend up to $1 trillion on infrastructure projects around the country to spur job creation and economic growth. “Potential fiscal stimulus would be of net benefit to infrastructure plays,” says Tom Stringfellow, chief investment officer for Frost Investment Advisers. That means companies like Caterpillar CATERPILLAR INC. CAT 0.29% , which makes heavy construction equipment needed for bridge and road construction jobs. At the same time, Trump promised throughout the campaign to boost military spending, which would benefit defense contractors such as Boeing BOEING COMPANY BA -1.25% and United Technologies. Why financials win: Shares of big banks and financial institutions have soared more than 10% in just the past week. Why? The fiscal stimulus that Trump promises through infrastructure spending and tax cuts is likely to re-inflate the economy — and with it comes inflation. Because bond investors hate inflation, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has soared from 1.8% before the election to 2.14% today. This is important because banks raise capital by taking in short term deposits on which they currently have to pay next to nothing in interest because short-term rates controlled by the Federal Reserve are so low. Then they lend that money out at longer term rates, which are now rising. If 10-year yields continue to lift, profit margins at banks will rise too, which is good for this sector. At the same time, Trump has promised to dismantle financial regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act, which was created in the aftermath of the financial crisis. What the Nasdaq Is Telling You Less than 13% of the Nasdaq composite consists of financials and industrials. Technology and healthcare stocks make up about 60% of the index. This explains why the Nasdaq has fallen while the Dow has risen in the aftermath of Trump’s win. Why technology may lose. As much as Trump has been a champion for business, he has saved his most critical remarks for Silicon Valley, a huge source of fundraising for the Democrats. In fact, During the campaign, he accused Amazon as having “huge antitrust problems” and accused Amazon of not being taxed enough. Meanwhile, he questioned whether Google was suppressing search hits on bad news for his rival Hillary Clinton. As a result, the so-called FANG stocks that have been leading tech’s run in recent years — Facebook FACEBOOK INC. FB 1.84% , Apple APPLE INC. AAPL 1.31% , Netflix NETFLIX INC. NFLX 0.19% , and Google ALPHABET INC. GOOGL 2.91% — have all lost value since Nov. 7, even as the rest of the market has risen. Why some healthcare may lose. To be fair, some parts of the healthcare sector have seen a lift in the wake of Trump’s win. Biotech stocks, for instance, have jumped nearly 16% in the past week while pharmaceutical shares are up nearly 8% on expectations that there will be less regulations. They also moved as the market feared that Hillary Clinton might impose price controls on that sector. “Trump hasn’t railed against the industry’s drug pricing the way Hillary Clinton did while campaigning,” notes Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research. On the other hand, Trump’s threat of killing the Affordable Care Act means that fewer Americans will be covered by health insurance. Fewer people covered means fewer customers for the nation’s hospitals and health insurers. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Expectations of a bonanza of defense spending soared on Republican Donald Trump's first day as president-elect. (U.S. Army photo/Aaron Ellerman) Posted By: Brendan McGarry November 11, 2016 The big defense firms already had predicted good times ahead no matter who won the election, and the expectations of a bonanza of defense spending soared on Donald Trump’s first day as president-elect. Even as the market initially tanked Wednesday on word that Trump had won, stocks for Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp., Boeing Co., Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. and others bucked the trend and were posting major gains. The market then rallied and the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of 18,807.88. In late October, when polls showed that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win, Northrop was touting solid third-quarter earnings as a sign of more profits ahead for the defense industry. “It is an interesting time in that it’s clear that there’s a significant re-capitalization wave that’s underway across a number of our customer communities,” Northrop Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush said. “Quite frankly, it’s one that’s been deferred for quite a long time.” The company last year won the contract to build the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber for the Air Force. Since the Trump victory, defense industry analysts have predicted defense spending would surge as the new White House administration and the Republican-controlled House and Senate move to end the sending caps known as sequestration under the Budget Control  Act of 2013. In a post for Forbes, analyst and Pentagon consultant Loren Thompson said “it appears the Obama-era drought in Pentagon demand for new weapons is over.” “Combined with Republican retention of majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump’s win signals that the gridlock restraining increases in defense outlays will soon disappear,” said Thompson, chief operating officer for the non-profit Lexington Institute. Thompson and other analysts pointed to Trump’s campaign pledges to boost the size of the Army and the Marine Corps, add 1,200 fighter aircraft to the Air Force and increase the size of the Navy to 350 ships. In addition, Trump has argued to speed up the modernization of the nation’s nuclear force to include replacements for the aging Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and a new class of ballistic-missile submarines. In a September campaign speech, Trump said, “We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915, and the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.” Trump vowed a turnaround, but how he would pay for it was unclear beyond general pledges of “common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks.” Whether the spigot of defense funding opens and becomes a bonanza remains to be seen.

Gulf executives who were upset by Donald Trump's campaign trail comments about Muslims took a conciliatory tone following his election victory and said they were open for business with the United States. In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect's name and his support for a DAMAC project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other U.S. firms are strong. The United States imported $32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing and a number of U.S. defense firms. The Gulf's sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump's campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE which has stakes in U.S. firms including Citigroup and Twitter, called him a "disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America". However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: "President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency." Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump's Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the U.S. if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump's comments on Muslims "were for the election only" and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favor of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the U.S. Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers. 'Fair competitor' Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC told Reuters on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al-Ardhi, executive chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp, which has billions of dollars in U.S. real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. "Investcorp knows that Mr. Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal," Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewelry firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 percent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major U.S. cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest $35 billion in the U.S. over five years. Spokesmen for the QIA and ADIA declined to comment on the election. Uncertainty for airlines Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with U.S. carriers. A group including American Airlines and United Airlines say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favor U.S. interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. "It's so important for our business that the liberalization that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on Oct. 18, adding Trump "may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade". A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways' Group Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. "Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position," he said in a statement to Reuters.

These members of the U.S. Armed Forces were the guests of honor at this annual event that honors their service to the country. The festivities started in the museum's B.B.'s Stage Door Canteen, where Shotgun Jazz Band performed. Many partygoers also discovered the dessert station, located in the American Sector Restaurant, which offered up an array of desserts throughout the night.     The main event was held in the U.S. Freedom Pavilion: the Boeing Center, where event organizers tried something a little different this year: instead of having a formal, sit-down dinner, the food -- conceived by American Sector Restaurant Chef Eric Cook, who once served in the Marine Corps -- was served buffet style with stations around the room. Museum President and CEO Nick Mueller greeted partygoers from the stage, where he honored those active-duty and veterans in the armed forces by asking them to stand up for recognition. He also introduced the event's presenting sponsors Jessica and Ray Brandt (of the Ray and Jessica Brandt Family Foundation); Mr. Brandt is a new museum board member. Event co-chair Bill Detweiler (along with wife Maureen Detweiler) introduced officers in the audience, including Lt. General Rex McMillian (U.S. Marine Corps), Mjr. General (Ret.) David M. Mize (U.S. Marine Corps), Mjr. General (Ret.) Thomas Sands (U.S. Army Corps), Col. Michael Clancy (U.S. Army Corps), Mjr. General (Ret.) Ron Richard (U.S. Marine Corps) and Rear Admiral David Callahan (U.S. Coast Guard). "This year's Victory Ball begins a new tradition at the museum," said the Detweilers in a joint statement. "It provides an opportunity for us to honor our veterans and members of the military from all wars and conflicts, and to express our thanks for their service and sacrifice." Once the official duties were completed, the Victory Swing Orchestra returned to the stage with the Victory Belles to perform Big Band songs from the 1940s; later in the night, DJ Ann Glaviano played songs from the 1950s to the 1970s. Among the attendees who filled the building were Paulette and Frank Stewart, Pam and Bill Ryan, Jackie Clarkson, Ben Martinez, Pam Friedler and Eduardo Rodriguez, Sheryl and Bob Merrick, Madlyn and Paul Hilliard, Cindy and Ron Mistrot, Marshall Hevron, Shannon and Mark Ferketish, Lillian and Jimmy Maurin, Ann and John Koerner, Beth Mueller, Sylvia and John Laborde, and Renee and Peter Laborde.  ****** To reach Sue Strachan, send an email to socialscene@nola.com or call 504.450.5904.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:30 PM, November 11, 2016 DUBAI - Gulf executives who were upset by Donald Trump's campaign trail comments about Muslims took a conciliatory tone following his election victory and said they were open for business with the United States. In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect's name and his support for a DAMAC <DAMAC.DU> project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other U.S. firms are strong. The United States imported $32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing <BA.N> and a number of U.S. defense firms. The Gulf's sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump's campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding <4280.SE> which has stakes in U.S. firms including Citigroup <C.N> and Twitter <TWTR.N>, called him a "disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America". However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: "President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency." Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump's Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the U.S. if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump's comments on Muslims "were for the election only" and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favor of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the U.S. Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers. "FAIR COMPETITOR" Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC told Reuters on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al-Ardhi, executive chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp <INVB.BH>, which has billions of dollars in U.S. real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. "Investcorp knows that Mr. Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal," Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewelry firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 percent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major U.S. cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest $35 billion in the U.S. over five years. Spokesmen for the QIA and ADIA declined to comment on the election. UNCERTAINTY FOR AIRLINES Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with U.S. carriers. A group including American Airlines <AAL.O> and United Airlines [UALCO.UL] say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favor U.S. interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. "It's so important for our business that the liberalization that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on Oct. 18, adding Trump "may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade". A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways' Group Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. "Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position," he said in a statement to Reuters.

(TSX: AVP) (the “Company”, “Avcorp” or the “Avcorp Group”) is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a long-term production contract with the Aerospace Company of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (“FHI”), a tier-one supplier to major original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) of commercial and defence aircraft around the world. Avcorp will produce complex composite structural components for FHI that will be assembled for the Boeing 787 center wing box. Avcorp, which will produce the components from its Composite Fabrication facility located in Gardena, California, expects that production volumes will grow by as much as 50% over historical supply rates. “The contract award with FHI is significant on a number of levels,” said Mr. Peter George, CEO of Avcorp Industries. “First, it transitions our role with FHI from being a supplier with short-term purchase orders to one with a long-term contract for complex composite components for the Boeing 787 platform. Second, it extends our reach within the Boeing supply chain by complementing our long-standing relationship with the OEM. Both developments are due to our growing reputation as a quality supplier and to the recent investments we have made towards developing expertise in the manufacture of complex composite materials.” As a result of the contract award, Avcorp’s order backlog is currently estimated at $901 million. The new total reflects the cumulative net effect of recent production deliveries as well as the addition of production contract with FHI.

Daoud Kuttab Will Palestinian airlines fly again? A resident from the Gaza strip, holding dual citizenship [AFP] Date of publication: 11 November, 2016 Share this page: 0 twitter Comment: Could the possibility of a joint Jordanian, Israeli, Palestinian airport somewhere in the northern part of the West Bank revive Palestinian hopes for a better future? asks Daoud Kuttab Tags: Palestinian Airlines, Palestine, Israel, Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, Avigdor Liberman, Boeing Ask any Palestinian and especially those living in Gaza about their number one problem of living under occupation and they are most likely to say that freedom of movement is the most difficult issue they face. They will cite permanent checkpoints or temporary ones in the West Bank. They will most certainly talk about the next to impossible task of getting a permit to travel 45 minutes from Gaza to Jerusalem or simply the long and dangerous Wadi Nar road connecting Ramallah with Bethlehem without going through the walled East Jerusalem. While Gaza has been under a siege for nine years, West Bankers wishing to travel have no choice but to go through Jordan which means that they need to pass through Palestinian and Jordanian border patrols at the King Hussein bridge, with no way of knowing how long it could take. Palestinian airlines at one time was a godsend to the people of Gaza. Using the Rafah airport, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip where able to fly from Rafah to Amman, Cairo or Baghdad and if needed, from there to anywhere in the world. In 1999 a Palestinian could travel from Amman or Cairo and reach his Gaza home within an hour or two and that included going through an Israeli security check. In its short lifetime since establishment in May 1995, Palestinian airlines owned two propeller planes and an older Boeing jet that was donated by Prince Walid Ben Talal. It was one of the Palestinian government agencies that was actually producing revenue in addition to it being a huge relief for the population of Gaza. Those were the golden days according to Khaled Mubarak, Palestinian Airlines' CEO who is based in Amman, Jordan. "When the second intifada broke in October 2000 and the Israeli airport liaison officer was killed, we were not able to fly. Israel dug up the runway and prevented us from flying either way." For a while, Palestinian Airlines was able to use the nearby El-Arish airport, but eventually the siege of Gaza and the deteriorating security situation in Sinai and meant that this airport alternative was unusable. 'Israel dug up the runway and prevented us from flying' - Khaled Mubarak, Palestinian Airlines CEO The lack of an airport has crippled the newly established airline company, forcing it to find alternative activities for its small fleet. The company's CEO says that one propeller plane was rented out in Africa while the other is now in Holland for maintenance. The old Boeing was sold for parts and the company's 120 staff have nothing to do as they await a political solution that can allow them to fly again. Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defence minister touched on this subject in his recent interview with the Palestinian daily Al Quds. He spoke as a typical colonial occupier; offering perks and using threats. If Hamas stops digging tunnels and launching rockets we will not only let them fly out of Gaza but we will rebuild their airport for them, he said. Lieberman's carrot also included the threat that in the next war Gaza will be the last one "because we will completely destroy them". Israel has also unilaterally suggested creating a $5 billion dollar man-made island off Gaza that can include a sea port and an airport. Palestinians have not even been consulted on this idea, which many believe is aimed at diverting attention from their illegal siege of Gaza. The lack of an airport has crippled the newly established airline company Without a solution that could lead to the end of the Gaza siege some Palestinians are thinking of an alternative airport in the West Bank. Former Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad had suggested in 2009 the building of an international airport near Jericho.  The Japanese government officials are discussing the possibility of a joint Jordanian, Israeli, Palestinian airport somewhere in the northern part of the West Bank. Japan has also been focused on supporting Palestinian agricultural exports. The issue of a Palestinian airport or using Palestinian airlines to travel seems such a farfetched dream that Palestinians have long since written it off. The political and security restrictions imposed by the Israeli occupiers have been so powerful that they have stunted any creative thinking in this direction. The emotional and moral power of Palestinians using their own airlines and traveling the world from their airport could do more to revive Palestinian hopes and aspirations of a better future, than thousands of words by politicians or empty political rhetoric in conferences.

Well, there’s nothing like a nice rocket launch to keep your mind off current events — and also remind you of the incredible things that humans can accomplish when they work together. The United Launch Alliance, the Boeing and Lockheed Martin partnership, is sending one of its Atlas V rockets into space today. The vehicle is slated to take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 1:30PM ET. Riding on top of the rocket is WorldView-4 — a commercial imaging satellite that will be operated by DigitalGlobe. The probe will join three other WorldView satellites already in orbit and capture high-resolution images of the Earth’s surface. WorldView-4 has the ability to image close to 263,000 square miles a day, and the entire four-satellite constellation can capture a single location up to 4.5 times daily. WorldView-4 will sit in a sun-synchronous orbit To get these awesome images, WorldView-4 will sit in a Sun-synchronous orbit. It’s a polar orbit that will take the satellite from pole to pole, unlike lower Earth orbit, for instance, which runs from west to east near the equator. Sun-synchronous orbit is a special kind of polar orbit, too, that allows a satellite to travel over the same part of Earth at the same time each day. It’s taken a few months for this launch to finally get off the ground. WorldView-4 was originally scheduled to launch on September 16th, but takeoff was delayed after ULA detected a small fuel leak. A second attempt to launch the satellite two days later was then scrubbed due to wildfires in a canyon south of Vandenberg Air Force Base. The launch pad was unharmed, but the fires took a week to contain and damaged electrical wiring to the facility. That damage has taken a few weeks to repair. But now, everything is look good for the mission today, with a 90 percent chance of launch according to ULA CEO Tory Bruno. The company has a 15-minute launch window starting at 1:30PM, and to see this rocket take flight, check back here at 1:05PM ET when ULA’s live broadcast of the launch begins.

S. equities in the aerospace and defense sector. The companies in the ETF include manufacturers, assemblers and distributors of aircraft and aircraft parts, makers of drones, and other highly specialized defense assemblies. This fund receives Morningstar’s highest rating (five stars), and on Wednesday its rating by Standard & Poor’s was increased to “overweight.” Market Return Performance as of Oct. 31: Year-to-date +11.08%, three-year 11.62%, five-year 18.42%. Top ten holdings include: Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE:COL), Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), and L-3 Communication Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LLL). At the current price, this ETF has an annualized dividend yield of approximately 1% with a net expense ratio of 0.44%, or $44 per $10,000 invested annually. The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 After the Brexit plunge in June, ITA rallied to a new all-time closing high on Aug. 15 at $132.73. However, a combination of profit-taking and the government’s projection of less defense spending caused a gradual decline to a triple bottom along the bullish support line. The final, and successful, test of the line occurred this week, when the ETF jumped from its support, cutting through the 50-day moving average (blue line) and on Wednesday closing at a new all-time high. That high was extended on Thursday, again with extremely high volume. However, two back-to-back high-volume days are often the sign of institutions’ covering of short-sales. If I am correct, the stock could pull back and attempt to close the open gap, the mid-point of which is about $132. Thus, buyers should wait to see if new money can drive the stock higher, or the lack of short-covering drops the stock to the open gap at $131 to $132.50. Either way ITA should be purchased as a long-term hold.

Lawmakers of three main opposition parties raised a flurry of questions about Choi's involvement in important state affairs, including the US missile shield deployment decision, while none of ruling Saenuri Party members requested an inquiry. Ahn Min-seok of the main opposition Minjoo Party inquired Defence Minister Han Min-koo about whether the defence chief was informed of the contacts of Jeong Yoon-hoe, Choi's ex-husband, with arms lobbyist Linda Kim and the Lockheed Martin side. Lockheed Martin is a manufacturer of Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), a US missile defence system which South Korea agreed in July with the United States to deploy in its soil by the end of next year. It was a surprising decision given that Seoul had refrained from the issue and seemingly felt uncomfortable with even mentioning it. Choi, whose friendship with President Park dates back to the mid-1970s, had maintained an acquaintance with the arms lobbyist at least since 2000, according to Joongang Ilbo newspaper. The lobbyist was detained in October for drug-administering charges. Some of local media outlets and opposition lawmakers speculated that Choi may have engaged in South Korea's weapons procurement projects as well as the THAAD deployment decision. Boeing's F-15 Silent Eagles were supposed to be selected as South Korea's next-generation fighter jets in 2013, but the widespread expectation was overturned in September of the year as the defence ministry's arms procurement committee voted it down. About two months later, Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets were offered as a sole candidate and finally picked to replace South Korea's decrepit combat planes. President Park took office in February 2013. Chung Dong-young of the minor People's Party claimed that the defence minister was excluded from the THAAD installation decision and that his claim is sufficient to make President Park impeached. Chung asked Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn about how to think about Choi's involvement in the decision to shut down Kaesong Industrial Complex. In response, the prime minister said he had not heard of the private citizen's engagement. The inter-Korean factory park in Kaesong, the border town of North Korea, was closed down by South Korea following the North's fourth nuclear detonation in January and the launch in February of a long-range rocket. Choi, a private citizen who has no public position, is suspected of deeply meddling in government affairs, ranging from selecting wardrobe to be worn by the president in official events to the editing of presidential speeches and the appointment of cabinet members. Allegations include decisions on the shutdown of the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean economic cooperation, THAAD deployment and the state-authored history textbook that sparked concerns that new textbooks may beautify military dictatorships and the Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, South Korea is pushing a hush-hush military intelligence pact with Japan after a botched attempt four years ago, as public attention is being centered on the political scandal. Seoul's defence ministry said the two countries would initial the accord next week in Tokyo to share military intelligence on North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. If internal procedures are passed smoothly, the deal is forecast to be formally signed in late November. Former President Lee Myung-bak sought the pact in 2012, but it failed at the last minutes amid a public outcry over the hurried, closed-door deal without any social consensus and parliamentary consultations. Many South Koreans still see such a deal with Japan as unacceptable as the Japanese leadership has yet to sincerely apologise for its militaristic history. The country was colonised by the Imperial Japan between 1910 and 1945. The main opposition party said Thursday that it will propose the resignation of the defence minister if the push for the military pact with Japan continues in defiance of oppositions from the public and the parliament. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Flash Floods Hit Klang Valley, Putrajaya 1MDB Highly Politicised By Certain People For Own Political Benefit - Najib With Or Without TPP Malaysia Committed To Strengthen Ties With US, Says Najib Other News Headlines Avoid Poor Jokes Syndrome At UMNO General Assembly 2016 - Analysts- politic Malaysian Franchise Industry Flourishing Amid Challenging Economy - Hamzah- business Syria, Iran Draw 0-0 In 2018 World Cup Qualifying Round- sports Malays Need To Relearn Their Culture- features Egypt Court Overturns Morsi Death Sentence, Orders Retrial- world Most Read News Avoid Poor Jokes Syndrome At UMNO General Assembly 2016 - Analysts Flash Floods Hit Klang Valley, Putrajaya No Excuse For Inaction On Global Warming, Warns Malaysia Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

In the course of his campaign, Trump said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), enact steep tariffs against China and Mexico, and possibly even pull out of the World Trade Organization, among other things. But if he were to follow through on those promises, the U.S. would likely face a trade war that would hit California and Washington hard in the labor market, as well as impacting the rest of the U.S. economy, according to a September analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). In California, San Mateo and San Francisco counties would be hit hardest in the business-services sector, while Alameda and Santa Clara counties would be hit hard in at least one specific sector. Washington state, under a full trade-war scenario, could expect to lose more than 5 percent of its jobs -- at least 170,000 jobs and the highest percentage in the nation -- the analysis found. The fact that the trade organization analyzed Trump's and Hillary Clinton's trade policies at all is something of a rarity in itself. "Since international economic policy has largely been an area of continuity and bipartisanship, at least since World War II, there has not been the need to examine trade in previous elections," the authors wrote in the PIIE analysis. "In this election, however, the need is pressing for an unbiased, transparent, and evidence-based analysis." The report noted that both Trump's and Clinton's trade policies could have negative impacts on the American economy, but Clinton's policies would have had mild impacts compared to the potential to incite a trade war and drive a recession from Trump's policies. A trade war would be anything but good for the U.S. "Enormous economic damage to U.S. firms, workers, and communities could ensue from a trade war long before the legal battlefield is cleared," the authors wrote. "It would be a mistake to suppose that the US courts will intervene to stop a trade war." Though many of Trump's proposals would likely be legal initially, opponents would likely challenge them in Congress and in the courts. But it would take several years before either body of government could -- if at all -- reverse his policies, the analysis found. "U.S. citizens and firms should not rely on the U.S. courts or Congress to shield them from the consequences of Trump's threats, should he carry them out," it read. A trade war could take many shapes, but an "asymmetrical" trade war -- if other nations retaliated more harshly than just with steep tariffs -- could have more sweeping impacts that would also be harder to overcome. China, for example, could end imports of U.S. aircraft, hitting Boeing disproportionately hard as China picks up a major share of Boeing's sales.  The Seattle metro area could lose 31,000 jobs -- 2 percent of private employment -- due to Boeing cuts, according to the analysis. China could also end its use of U.S. business services, cutting another 4,000 King County jobs, the report found. Any legal challenges would take years to complete, possibly longer than Trump's time in office. The results could be grim at best. "The analysis presented here shows that the trade war these policies is likely to spark would send the U.S. economy into a recession and cost millions of Americans their jobs," the report read. "His (Trump's) policies place at risk the livelihoods of millions of Americans, most of whom probably do not think of their jobs as tied to international trade. The American casualties in this trade war would be drawn disproportionately from the ranks of lower-income and lower-skilled workers."

He will not serve fried chicken and taco bowl salads at state dinners. (Though his first honoured guest would surely be Vladimir Putin.) Marla Maples (right), Trump’s second wife from 1993 to 1999. GETTY Nor will he attempt to install a casino in the East Wing, replace the annual Easter Egg Roll with the annual Easter Roulette dice roll, or dig a tunnel to his nearby, brand new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. The possibility of an inauguration day next January involving Mr Trump taking the Oath of Office is surely already giving the 96 full-time and 250 part-time custodial staff at the mansion conniptions. How do you transform in two hours its 132 rooms - it is big - to accommodate the tastes of a former reality television host when the man leaving is understated Barack Obama? Then there will be the Trumps themselves. While the immediate family is large, especially if you include two ex-wives, it is likely that only three of them will actually be moving in to live there - President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania and their son, 10-year-old Barron. Slovenian-born Melania (46) should give the old place a bit of high-glam glitz. She was a model once. Come to think of it, which of the Trump women weren't on the runway earlier in their lives? Ivanka, the daughter born to Mr Trump and his first wife, Ivana, was a model before she joined the Trump enterprises as president of development and acquisitions. She can now boast of having helped him acquire America. Such are her good looks her father has been known to make off-colour remarks about them. Ivana Zelnickova, Trump’s first wife from 1977 to 1992 and who is mother to Eric, Donald, and Ivanka. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard...I In a 2003 Howard Stern radio interview, he averred that his eldest daughter has "got the best body". Likewise, during an appearance on ABC's 'The View' in 2006, he said that if Ivanka wasn't his daughter he would be dating her. Arguably, the most appealing of the Trump offspring, Ivanka would surely be a regular visitor to Washington. And she has her own brood. This summer she had her third child with husband Jared Kushner - she converted to Judaism after marrying him in 2009. Mr Kushner (never a model) is the son of a prominent New York property developer and has been owner of the weekly 'Observer' paper in New York for 10 years. Also prominent in the campaign and certain to claim some right to hang at the White House is Donald Trump Jr (38), first son of Donald and Ivana. His wife, Vanessa, was a model, once signed with Wilhelmina Models. According to New York Magazine, she also dated Leonardo DiCaprio when she was 20. They have given Donald no fewer than five grandchildren. Donald Jr has made a few gaffes of his own in the heat of the campaign, like the day he compared sweets to refugees. "If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?" he wrote on Twitter. "That's our Syria refugee problem." Then there is Eric Trump, who was a campaign fixture. Like his elder brother, he likes to shoot large animals like bears and lions in Africa. There is one famous snap of him posing with a severed elephant's tail. Not a former model exactly, Eric's wife of two years, Lara - they wed at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump spread in Palm Beach that could serve as the Winter White House - is, however, a former personal trainer. Tiffany Trump (22), the daughter of Donald and his second wife Marla Maples (nee Cuhutta Georgia), recently graduated from University of Pennsylvania and wants to be - a model. She made her New York Fashion Week debut in February this year. Young Barron, as far as we know, has no modelling aspirations. He is fan of sports, especially tennis, and, we are told, golf.

In the Fox News coverage playing on screens in the ballroom, Megyn Kelly turned to Karl Rove. “It didn’t happen under Reagan or the Bushes. When was the last time a Republican president had a Republican Congress?” “1928,” Rove answered. “Incredible,” Kelly said. Yes, quite: Republicans actually had unified control for four years under George W. Bush and for two years under Dwight Eisenhower, as Rove amended when I followed up with him. But the 1928 comparison is instructive. It’s the last time a Republican president enjoyed anything like the majority Trump will have, particularly in the House. And how did that work out for them? Hoover took over in a time of general prosperity but stagnant wages and vast income inequality. Populists in Congress proposed dramatic increases in tariffs to help the struggling agricultural sector, the equivalent of today’s beleaguered blue-collar workers. The proposal divided Republicans in Congress and Hoover before they produced the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, setting off retaliation, freezing international trade, contributing to the Great Depression and accelerating a ruinous cycle of nationalism around the world. Hoover’s ghost should haunt the GOP right now. A populist, protectionist president has come to power at a time of long-depressed wages and vast inequality. He threatens to implement a 45 percent tariff against China and 35 percent against Mexico, and he’s about to collide with free-traders and pro-business interests in his own party. If they jettison Trump’s agenda and proceed with business as usual, they risk inflaming Trump’s already furious followers. If they do what Trump has promised, there will be chaos as they pursue what amounts to a mission impossible: enacting a huge tax cut, making enormous spending increases on infrastructure and the military and cutting the debt in half — all without touching Social Security and Medicare. With unified control, Republicans now own every issue — health care, the economy, national security — and Democrats, who narrowly won the popular vote and are supported by exit polls showing tepid support for many of Trump’s policy priorities, have little incentive to cooperate. Some early signs show Trump won’t hesitate to disappoint supporters. Drain the swamp? Trump has packed his transition team with a who’s who of the K Street lobbying trade, according to Politico. Among those in charge of staffing the new administration are people who have lobbied for or represented Altria, Visa, Anthem, Coca-Cola, General Electric, HSBC, Pfizer, PhRMA, United Airlines, Southern Company, Dow Chemical, Rosemont Copper Company, Boeing, Duke Energy and Nucor. The Trump-proposed ban on Muslims entering the country? As the Washington Post’s Jose A. DelReal reported, the Trump campaign removed that policy’s webpage Thursday, then restored it after the reporter’s inquiries. That wall on the Mexican border? “Going to take a while,” Trump lieutenant Rudy Giuliani said Thursday, suggesting “he can do it by executive order by just reprogramming money within the immigration service.” “Reprogramming” money away from … deportation? Truly building the wall would cost many billions of dollars and require approval from Congress. Giuliani said prosecuting Clinton would be “a presidential decision” — an extraordinary departure from the American tradition of removing the president from prosecutorial decisions, particularly since President Nixon tried to block the Justice Department’s Watergate probe in 1973. The Trump transition sounded another Nixonian note when Trump surrogate Omarosa Manigault told a conservative website that Trump is keeping an enemies list. The conflicting signals suggest Trump himself hasn’t settled on his course. His gracious victory speech was about reaching out to the opposition, but Breitbart News, whose once and future leader ran the campaign, has been whipping up racial fears (“Shock Video Shows White Man Viciously Beaten in Chicago After Election“). On Thursday night, the president-elect tweeted that “professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!” Friday morning he reconsidered: “Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!” Trump’s internal tension is understandable. He can leave supporters disillusioned, or he can keep his promises — and send us all back to 1928.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor Our SpaceFlight Heritage: Heroes and Legends exhibit opens at KSC Visitor Complex Jason Rhian November 12th, 2016 Attendees welcome the opening of the Heroes and Legends exhibit on Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. Photo Credit: Mark Usciak / SpaceFlight Insider KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — With more than 50 years since the dawn of the Space Age, a new exhibit is poised to open its doors this weekend honoring the men and women who have (literally) blazed a trail. The word astronaut dreams up images of powerful individuals who venture into the unknown black of space. The new exhibit provides a stunning venue honoring those who have made the journey to orbit. Many of the exhibits were moved from the “old” Astronaut Hall of Fame that resided down the road from the Visitor Complex. Photo Credit: Carleton Bailie / SpaceFlight Insider The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex opened its new ‘Heroes and Legends’ facility on Friday, Nov. 11. The event was attended by more than 25 U.S. astronauts, including Buzz Aldrin and Jim Lovell. Aldrin and Lovell also marked the 50th anniversary of their Gemini 12 mission, which launched on Nov. 11, 1966. According to a report appearing on the Orlando Sentinel, this event was stocked full of those whose names grace the halls within. “The new Heroes and Legends exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center amplifies the visitors’ experience and tells the story of human exploration as well as those who made it possible,” said Brian Duffy, a four-time space shuttle astronaut and SpaceFlight Insider Technical Consultant who attended the event. When asked what he thought, Duffy unequivocally said, “…It’s a terrific addition to what the Visitor Complex already offers!” Other astronauts on hand include Brian Duffy, Kathryn Thornton, Charlie Duke, Al Worden, Fred Gregory, Rhea Seddon, Karol “Bo” Bobko, Jerry Ross, Bob Cabana (who serves as Kennedy Space Center’s current center director), Curt Brown, Dan Brandenstein, Vance Brand, Kent Rominger, and numerous others. They came together to mark the unveiling of the 20,000-square-foot facility that sits across from the visitor complex’s Rocket Garden. “The new Hall of Fame is spectacular and a great addition to the Kennedy Space Center Visitors complex,” Al Worden, the Command Module Pilot on Apollo 15 told SpaceFlight Insider. “It will stand with the Saturn V Center and the Atlantis display as examples of what a nation can do when challenged. Absolutely worth the trip to see our heroes and legends on display.” This week’s events, sponsored by Boeing, were held in conjunction with Space Rendezvous 2016. This means those who come to see this new exhibit open also had the opportunity to attend this year’s Astronaut Autograph & Memorabilia Show. This weekend will be a “target rich” environment with breakout sessions held with an array of industry insiders, including International Space Station Flight Controller Ryan East (himself an Astronaut Scholar), NASA Senior Advisor for Commercial Space Charles Miller, and artist Chris Calle presenting. However, this part of this weekend’s events wasn’t held at the visitor complex but at the Hilton Cocoa Beach Oceanfront. The exhibit was constructed by BRPH – an international architecture and engineering firm which repurposed a portion of the “Early Exploration” building already at the visitor complex. “BRPH has a long history of involvement with exhibits at the Visitor Center, including Forever Remembered, the Rocket Garden, Space Shuttle Atlantis and the Shuttle Launch Simulator, to name a few,” said BRPH Senior Project Manager, Nick Gigante via a release. “We are humbled to one again be involved in a historic exhibit, honoring those who risked their life to make the world a better place.” Want to see more from this event?

Credit: NASA/Glenn Benson CAPE CANAVERAL — A building dedicated to the heroism of American astronauts, who put their lives on the line and became legends in the process, opened today at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. The new Heroes & Legends attraction, which brings the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame from Titusville to the KSCVC main property, enjoyed its grand opening with more than two dozen spaceflight veterans on-hand. Famed Apollo astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Jim Lovell, the children of the late Neil Armstrong and Alan Shepard, plus other former astronauts greeted the public to the new facility. Packed with astronaut memorabilia and nearly 100 space artifacts, including the original consoles of the Mercury Mission Control room, Heroes & Legends delves into the character traits of the tenacious early pioneers, depicts the risks and thrills of spaceflight in a stunning 4-D “Through the Eyes of a Hero” theater roughly 28-feet tall and pays tribute to the 93 astronauts inducted into the Hall of Fame over the past quarter century. The 36,880-square-foot facility has 4 hours, 52 minutes, 23 seconds of video content to watch, 7,926 photos to see, a 10,900-pound, human-rated Mercury-Redstone rocket — MR-6, from the cancelled 1961 mission — hung from the ceiling and two space-flown capsules — Wally Schirra’s Mercury Sigma 7 from 1962 and Gemini 9 flown by Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan in 1966. Heroes & Legends is presented by The Boeing Company, the title sponsor. The original consoles of the Mercury Mission Control room are preserved and displayed at Heroes & Legends. Credit: NASA/Glenn Benson The U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, originally constructed across the Indian River on the Florida mainland, was created in 1990 by the Mercury 7, America’s first group of astronauts. But that facility, miles away from the central KSC tourist hub, always struggled to garner high attendance numbers despite the remarkable exhibits and personal mementoes on display. Now part of the KSC Visitor Complex, operated commercially by Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts, Inc., the merger relocates the hall into the main campus. The likeness of the Mercury 7 is sculpted into the facade of the building, and guests walk by Mercury-Redstone and Mercury-Atlas rockets towering around the entrance. Credit: NASA/Glenn Benson KSCVC sees more than 1.5 million tourists each year. Bus tours of the space center are popular and the public can watch today’s Atlas, Delta and Falcon rocket launches from nearby pads. Other parts of the complex include the retired space shuttle Atlantis, preserved for future generations to see up close in a rousing display facility, the Apollo/Saturn V Center with an actual moonrocket, the Shuttle Launch Experience motion-based ride and the Rocket Garden with replicas of historic space boosters.

The satellite, known as WorldView-4, was lifted into orbit atop an Atlas 5 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. WorldView-4 is the latest in a series of imaging satellites built by Lockheed Martin. It is operated by Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, which provides high-resolution images for government and private customers including first responders. The camera aboard the satellite is so sharp that it can spot the make of a car from nearly 640km above Earth, according to Lockheed Martin. It joins sister satellite, WorldView-3, which launched from the Vandenberg base in 2014. Both satellites can capture images of objects as small as 30cm across. Friday was the ninth launch for United Launch Alliance this year. ULA, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing, has launched 112 times since it was founded in 2006. Its next launch is a Nasa weather satellite scheduled for next week from Cape Canaveral, Florida. WorldView-4 was supposed to launch in September, but was postponed by a minor tank leak and two wildfires at the sprawling base, which encompasses nearly 405km² along the Pacific Ocean. The fires forced the evacuation of administrative buildings, but did not affect the launch complex. Firefighters who were assigned to the launch were diverted to corralling the flames.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon After an extraordinary, 90-minute meeting between political arch-enemies Thursday, Donald Trump declared it a “great honour” to meet Barack Obama. The president, making equally nice, pledged to do whatever he could to help his brash successor transition into the job. Don’t expect those warm and fuzzy sentiments to last long. Trump has vowed to shatter virtually every pillar of Obama’s presidential legacy, a dismantling of eight years in the Oval Office that might be unprecedented in U.S. history. The property tycoon ran largely against Obama’s record, promising to repeal, “cancel” or replace everything from Obamacare to the Iran nuclear deal. The Republican is supremely well armed for the legacy-smashing mission. His party controls both houses of Congress, and many of Obama’s signature polices – non-starters as bills in a hostile legislative branch — were implemented by executive order. That means they can be countermanded with relative ease by the next president. Here are five bastions of Obama’s legacy targeted by Trump and the challenges he may face in dismantling them. Obamacare The president’s signature policy, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act came into force in 2010 in response to the many Americans without  health-care coverage. About 20 million more people now have insurance, but the law has been unpopular with many others, some of whom saw big premium hikes or rankled at being forced to get insurance. Trump vowed almost daily to “repeal and replace” Obamacare and, with Republican majorities, seems well-equipped to do so. The Democrats could filibuster in the Senate, but if the GOP used “reconciliation” bills that chip away at the act, rather than throw it out wholesale, they could avoid blockages. The measures in one such bill passed in 2015, then vetoed by Obama, would have effectively eliminated health insurance for 22 million Americans, said Dr. Nancy Nielsen, a health policy expert with the State University of New York at Buffalo. “They could dust that off, put it through again,” said the former American Medical Association president. “That would be easy to do.” Trump has promised vaguely to replace Obama’s system with tax-sheltered “health savings accounts,” but Nielsen says those would be of little benefit to poorer people who don’t pay much tax to begin with. She predicts there will eventually be a “symbolic” repeal, followed by a long period to develop and implement a replacement, and try to temper any blowback. Immigration Obama failed to interest Congress in a comprehensive immigration reform bill to address the millions of illegal immigrants – mostly Mexican – living and working in the U.S.. But he did pass some executive orders, such as one that temporarily protected from deportation undocumented immigrants who arrived with their parents as children. Trump has vowed to repeal that order, while customs officials now have contact information on more than 700,000 people who came forward to take advantage of it. Iran-nuclear deal The U.S. was one of six countries to sign the agreement that lifted punishing sanctions on Iran in return for halting its nuclear-weapons program, one of Obama’s paramount foreign-policy achievements. Republicans have castigated the deal as a gift to the Iranians that won’t stop them from making a bomb. Trump vowed to dismantle it, something he could try to do with an executive order that reinstated American sanctions. But that could well just prompt Iran to resume its weapons program, while antagonizing European countries – and U.S. companies like Boeing – that are doing business with the country again. Climate change After a slow start in his first term, Obama made combating climate change a key part of his last four years, culminating with signing the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Trump has promised to undo much of it, not surprising for a man who says climate change is a hoax and fixing it would only hurt U.S. business. He says he would take America out of the Paris deal, repeal Obama’s Clean Power Plan to limit emissions from power plants, and approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta, reversing the president’s thumb’s-down. To top it off, Trump has proposed climate change skeptic Myron Ebell as head of transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. Ebell insists global warming is “nothing to worry about.” Stephen Cohen, executive director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, is surprisingly sanguine about Trump’s potential impact. He may slow progress, but the movement from fossil fuels toward renewable energy is unstoppable, much as horse-powered transport gave way to the internal-combustion engine a century ago, says Cohen. “It’s just a question of when,” he said. “Meanwhile, most utilities and businesses are assuming the future is going to be one with less greenhouse gases, so it doesn’t matter who the president is.” Cuba détente The agreement to normalize relations between the U.S, and Cuba — negotiated in Canada — ended almost 60 years of mutual hostility across the Gulf of Mexico, one of the last vestiges of the cold war. Trump says he will scrap the rapprochement unless the Raul Castro regime agrees to free political prisoners and restore political freedoms. Repealing could be complicated. Lawyers told the Miami Herald that airlines, hotel companies and others already doing business with Cuba based on the deal would have to be compensated if it was reversed, while American efforts to encourage entrepreneurs in the communist country would grind to a halt.

Military Duncan Hunter mentioned for defense, national security positions in Trump administration Rep. Duncan Hunter Union-Tribune file photo Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Alpine, speaks during a ceremony at Camp Pendleton in June 2015. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Alpine, speaks during a ceremony at Camp Pendleton in June 2015. (Union-Tribune file photo) Carl PrineContact Reporter Widely considered to have made the short list of candidates for top national security jobs in Donald Trump’s administration, Rep. Duncan Hunter of Alpine pledged Friday to make the Pentagon great again after eight years of Democratic control. “I’m excited about a warrior culture, a warrior mentality put back into the (military), as opposed to a corporate culture ruled over by the bureaucrats and lawyers,” Hunter, a Republican member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a phone interview. “The warrior culture is going to get infused into (the department) again. It’s probably going to take a while because a lot of guys who had that mentality are no longer there, but maybe people’s true colors can show now, a little bit,” he added. An early endorser of Trump’s presidential campaign, Hunter remained steadfastly loyal to the New York TV star and real estate tycoon, even after the presidential candidate rankled many military veterans and key GOP national security figures through a series of controversial statements. On the campaign stump, for example, Trump mocked Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam; claimed to be smarter than many of America’s generals; and proposed a slew of divisive plans such as forcing Muslim-Americans to register for a counter-terrorism database. “Listen, he’s not a politician. He’s never been in public office,” Hunter said Friday. “He’s never had to talk and had everything that he says dissected and taken apart, right? There’s a learning period here and it’s pretty steep, but I think he’s doing great now.” Hunter, a Marine combat veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, has been rumored for several top spots on Trump’s national security team. Those include secretary or deputy secretary of defense, Army secretary or a spot on the National Security Council — a position also of interest to retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a Trump confidante.  Caption A rare cancer linked to parasites in raw fish is quietly killing Vietnam vets Some of the hundreds of U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War who suffered from cholangiocarcinoma, a rare bile duct cancer believed to be linked to liver fluke parasites in raw or poorly cooked river fish.

Recently re-elected in a landslide, Hunter insisted that holding a safe House seat in a largely Republican district pales in importance to serving his nation at the highest levels during wartime, a belief he said is shared by his constituents. “Unanimously they’ve said, ‘Do it. Get into the administration and try to affect things from there because Trump needs you,’” he said. If tapped as secretary of defense, the 39-year-old Hunter would become the youngest person in American history to assume the Pentagon’s top post. The short list for that job is believed to include former Sen. Jim Talent, a Republican from Missouri, and Stephen Hadley, who was a national security adviser to President George W. Bush. At the Pentagon, Hunter said, he would work to overturn a string of initiatives launched by President Barack Obama’s administration that he believes make the country less safe, such as opening up infantry and special-operations units to women.  “I’d reverse (that policy) immediately,” Hunter said. He also wants to preserve the Army’s armored brigades and fix a naval force that’s increasingly dependent on vessels like the nimble but small littoral combat ship, which Hunter called a “Navy screw-up and a congressional screw-up.” Design flaws, cost overruns and questionable command oversight have dogged the warships. Criticizing Obama for what he views as hasty and reactive foreign-policy decisions, Hunter said Trump’s incoming team will ink a grand strategy — prioritizing where the president will project power to achieve security goals vital to the nation, often in concert with overseas allies. On the campaign trail, Trump suggested abandoning or reducing America’s commitment to North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies that skimped on defense spending. He also complained about a perceived lack of financial support from longtime allies Japan and South Korea. Hunter said the two Asian nations dedicate substantial resources to host American troops stationed on their home soil, but that several NATO states could spend more to maintain mutual-defense obligations. To Hunter, the thornier problem is how to address rising Russian power. “Keep Russia in Syria, because I think Russia should be in Syria. I’m not a guy who’s upset about that. But get them out of Ukraine,” he said. The San Diego Union-Tribune and a handful of other news organizations received leaked documents from the Trump camp that appear to sketch out the vetting process for picks to fill top agency positions. Despite a campaign highlighted by relentless indictments of establishment GOP figures and calls to “drain the swamp” of Beltway insiders and special-interest groups, Trump’s transition team brims with lobbyists, longtime think-tank hands and retired senior military leaders, according to those documents. The transition “action team” is run by Ron Nicol, a Dallas-based telecommunications consultant who served as a junior Navy officer on a nuclear ballistic missile submarine. Under him is retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a Vietnam War veteran best known for leading part of the Coalition Provisional Authority in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  He is tasked with choosing defense and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs officials. Former Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who retired from the FBI, is overseeing the team charged with identifying leaders for the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council, according to the paperwork. Kellogg and Rogers have delegated key details of the selection process to Mira Ricardel, a Washington-based business strategist and a former vice president for defense contractor Boeing; conservative Heritage Foundation think-tank scholar James Jay Carafano; tobacco industry lobbyist Cindy Hayden; and Ronald Burgess, a retired Army general who directed the Defense Intelligence Agency. Hunter said Trump carries no post-election baggage, such as job promises for national security figures from the GOP establishment. To Hunter, Obama’s White House arrogantly relied more on Ivy League diplomas than it did subject-matter experts and combat-tested military personnel. “Just because you’ve got a degree from a foreign policy place doesn’t make you an expert in the world,” Hunter said. “This (current) administration — which is full of young people with high and lofty ideals and a lot of degrees — frankly, I’d take one of my staff sergeants over them any day. “They understand what war means. They understand the enemy. They understand who we’re fighting.” Hunter’s willingness to join the Trump team clashes with many in the Republican Party’s national security intelligentsia. More than 100 elite Republican defense figures signed open letters urging Americans to reject Trump’s candidacy. Others took to the airwaves and social media to back Trump’s GOP foes during the primary or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.   Christopher Swift, who formerly served in the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, probed terrorist funding and rogue nations undergoing economic sanctions — such as Iran during George W. Bush’s administration.  On Friday, he told the Union-Tribune he won’t budge on his decision to boycott a Trump administration built on “brinksmanship and bullying.” He had supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich during the Republican primary. “If the boss is toxic, then his administration will be toxic,” said Swift, now a prominent attorney and a national security instructor at Georgetown University. “You might think that you can temper that, but you serve at his will.” Trump’s election also sparked debate among defense figures worldwide about future cooperation with his administration. Rex Brynen, a political scientist at McGill University in Montreal, published an open letter in the online journal Business Insider warning Americans on the eve of Tuesday’s election that a Trump administration would “increasingly be seen by (America’s) closest and most loyal allies as part of the problem, not part of the solution.” In the wake of Trump’s victory, the Middle East expert, former intelligence analyst and frequent defense adviser to the Canadian government said he has cut all ties to the United States’ security agencies — except for initiatives such as humanitarian missions conducted jointly with America’s northern neighbor. Citing Trump’s “racist and xenophobic” campaign statements calling for the slaying of suspected terrorists’ families and a ban on Muslims immigrating to the U.S., Brynen said he feared the incoming administration could become “not only dangerous to Canada, but also to the United States.” Trump and his transition team have not specified when they will announce their top agency picks. cprine@sduniontribune.com Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune Canada Donald Trump Duncan Hunter Barack Obama Mike J.

(United Launch Alliance) By Associated Press Published: November 11, 2016, 6:37 PM A   A VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) — A commercial satellite capable of taking high-resolution images from space was launched Friday from a military base along the California coast. The satellite known as WorldView-4 was lifted into orbit atop an Atlas 5 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. WorldView-4 is the latest in a series of imaging satellites built by Lockheed Martin. It is operated by Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, which provides high-resolution images for government and private customers including first responders. The camera aboard the satellite is so sharp that it can spot the make of a car from nearly 400 miles above Earth, according to Lockheed Martin. It joins sister satellite WorldView-3, which launched from the Vandenberg base in 2014. Both satellites can capture images of objects as small as 1-foot across. Friday was the ninth launch for United Launch Alliance this year. ULA, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co., has launched 112 times since it was founded in 2006. Its next launch is a NASA weather satellite scheduled for next week from Cape Canaveral, Fla. WorldView-4 was supposed to launch in September, but was postponed by a minor tank leak and two wildfires at the sprawling base, which encompasses nearly 156 square miles along the Pacific Ocean. The fires forced the evacuation of administrative buildings, but did not affect the launch complex. Firefighters who were assigned to the launch were diverted to corral the flames.

David Eulitt The Kansas City Star A little-known access tunnel runs between Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium and underneath parking lot M. The tunnel is mostly used to move concessions and merchandise from the loading dock to the two neighboring stadiums. Painted walls mark the dividing line between the stadiums. David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com Workers transported beverages and other equipment to Arrowhead Stadium earlier this month as painters added names and jersey numbers of Chiefs Hall of Famers to the tunnel walls. The tunnel, called the commissary, runs underground between Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium and underneath parking lot M. David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com Local mural artist Phil Shafer, aka Sike Style, painted the walls of the Royals’ part of the commissary tunnel that runs between Kauffman and Arrowhead Stadium. David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com The underground commissary tunnel that connects Kauffman and Arrowhead stadium starts with a loading dock at the south end of lot M between the stadiums and branches off below ground to the two venues. On the Royals’ side, the tunnel empties out roughly to the concourse behind home plate; on the Chiefs’ side, it opens to the first level concourse around the 15-yard line of the southeast side of the field. Allison Long along@kcstar.com 1 of 5 i By David Frese dfrese@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Since the invention of football and baseball in the 1800s, writers, poets, screenwriters and other ink-stained wretches have felled entire forests committing to paper the literary struggles of burly men waging sport on eternally green patches of earth. But win or lose, something strangely poetic occurs after each home baseball game in the tunnel connecting Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums. When the millionaires on Kansas City’s baseball team depart the clubhouse after an evening of chasing a little white ball around an impeccably manicured field in front of thousands of blue-bedecked fans, nearly all of them have to walk through the pungent waft of fans’ ballpark garbage to get to their Escalades and tricked-out pickups. That last swallow of Miller Lite tepidly sloshing in a recyclable aluminum bottle. The final remnants of cotton candy hardening like sinew on the cardboard bone on which it was spun. The remaining smears of chili cheese left unwiped from the container once holding delectable ballpark french fries. What was fan enthusiasm only moments before hangs thick in the air as fan effluvium. “That part’s not the best, that’s for sure,” said Pat Tangen, principal for Kansas City’s Populous architecture firm. Tangen was one of a cadre of Populous architects and professionals who worked on the Royals side of the 2009 stadium renovations. Most of his work actually ended at the underground tunnel that connects the Kauffman and Arrowhead stadiums. But he found the idea no less fascinating. “I cannot think of another set of stadiums that have this type of situation between the two,” Tangen said. “It’s a great use of space. It’s a great consolidation of services. Instead of having to do it twice, you do it once.” Called the “commissary,” the tunnel begins at a loading dock off of the coveted “M” parking lot between stadiums. The tunnel dips below ground and splits into a T. Turn right for the Royals, turn left for the Chiefs. If one were to miss the directional signage, one could always follow the blue or the red. (In an ironic nod of coincidence, the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts does something very similar at the back of the house: The backstage area of Muriel Kauffman Theatre is red, and Helzberg Hall’s is painted blue. In common areas between, the walls are painted a delightful nacho cheese gold.) Chief among the Truman Sports Complex underground commissary’s purposes is providing a throughway for pallets of soda casks and beer kegs. On the Royals side, the tunnel opens again in Kauffman Stadium in the bowl behind home plate. On the Chiefs side, it rises, turns slightly and empties out onto the southeast side concourse at about the 15-yard line. (In case you’re wondering, the commissary is not the same tunnel where Warpaint awaits his post-touchdown sprint on the field or where petulant tight ends retreat after being ejected by half-blind officials. Those egresses, as well as the player entrance and locker rooms, are on the west side of the stadium at ground level.) For the most part, the single commissary serves the two teams fabulously. The stadiums are rarely used at the same time, only for the Chiefs’ two preseason dates in August and a couple of regular season games in September. There have been other exceptions: Kenny Chesney concerts and the long-awaited Royals postseason runs. “We’ve really had to work together the last two Octobers,” said Toby Cook, the Royals’ vice president of publicity. “They’re full on with their season, and we were still playing baseball.” On Thursday at Arrowhead, painters applied final touches to the tunnel walls on the Chiefs side of the commissary. One side reads, of course, “This Is Chiefs Kingdom.” The other features the numbers and names of Chiefs Hall of Famers, from Lenny the Cool to Willie Lanier. The Chiefs don’t keep a whole lot of personnel in the tunnels, about 50 during the week, with about 2,000 on game day. It’s mainly a conduit for staff and the two teams’ food service contractor, Aramark. The Royals keep some personnel and offices in their tunnel year-round, from engineering to waste management. There are more workers in the tunnel during the season, of course, including the seamstress who repairs players’ torn pants or adds American League Championship patches to jerseys. The Royals also have dressed up their hallways in recent years, including a 100-foot mural by local artist Phil Shafer of SikeStyle Industries (he had a hand in designing the Chiefs’ mural, too). Shafer said the mural took more than a week to complete. “Working underground messes with your equilibrium,” he said. “I remember going to a brunch a day after I finished and thinking, ‘Whoa, sunshine.’ ” Shafer said staff primed the wall for him, which saved him and his crew a bunch of time. And, artists should take note: Math is important. Shafer said the biggest challenge might have been converting what he designed onto such an enormous canvas. He painted the mural after the 2014 World Series run. He had to return to repaint a World Series championship logo in 2015. “So, really, I painted them a good luck charm,” he said. Down the hall from the mural is painted a baseball diamond with photo displays of Kauffman MVPs fans have never heard of and probably have never even seen. It’s the stadium’s employees of the month board, with spots to recognize up to 10 “Employee All-Stars,” and staff members walk past it every day. In addition to all the incoming food and supplies, the commissary is the aforementioned channel for much of the stadiums’ trash. The Royals say they move more than 890 tons of waste through the tunnel in a year, the equivalent of much more than a Boeing loaded to the max with overweight Americans. That sounds like a lot until you hear Kauffman is recycling and composting even more garbage. Travis Bryant, director of guest experience at the stadium, says nearly 200 tons of glass, plastic, aluminum and cardboard are recycled, and more than 70 tons of food are composted. On the Arrowhead side, about 20 tons of trash and recycling move through the tunnel on game day, according to Brandon Hamilton, the Chiefs’ director of facilities. Most of the stadium waste is cleared out within 48 hours of the start of the game. It goes without saying times have changed in the four decades since the complex was built. And even though the single commissary still functions well, each team might like to one day have its own. “The needs for broadcasting and truck deliveries and trash have changed,” Tangen said. “You didn’t recycle back then, and now it takes a number of different recycling bins just for that. And I think if you asked the Royals and the Chiefs today, they’d like to have twice the space for those functions.” Building something new or expanding what’s there would take some doing. The concrete walls are at least a foot thick, and the whole area would need to be excavated to be expanded. When Cook gave us a tour a week ago, the Friday before the Chiefs outlasted the Jacksonville Jaguars, the tunnel walls were lined with food carts and beverages, and the halls were filled with the incessant back-up bleeps and blorps of forklifts, golf carts and gators. “Until you’re down here and watching things get moved,” Cook said, “you don’t realize how many hot chocolate jugs there are.” David Frese: 816-234-4463, @DavidFrese Related content See the underground tunnel players use between Kauffman and Arrowhead LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Sports Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:06 Odom: Mizzou's Michael Scherer, Terry Beckner Jr. tore ACLs Pause 7:50 Mizzou senior linebacker Michael Scherer discusses injury, career 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 2:35 Eric Berry to high schoolers: ‘Make the most of every opportunity’ 2:16 Evelyn Fields Day remembers childhood home before foreclosure 55:59 Chiefs 20, Panthers 17: Postgame analysis from The Star's sportswriters 1:56 AFC West: Best division in the conference? 0:43 Oak Mites' Bite: Within hours 'I was itching like crazy' 3:49 Bill Self breaks down KU's overtime loss to Indiana 0:44 Royals' Salvador Perez makes a splash at Shark Tank Teacher Edition Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 16 hours ago Mizzou's Cale Garrett on the SEC transition 2:30 16 hours ago Mizzou's Cale Garrett on the SEC transition 3:10 16 hours ago Mizzou's Aarion Penton on Josh Dobbs, defensive TDs 2:21 17 hours ago Mizzou's Damarea Crockett on quest for 1,000 yards View more video Sports Bucs receiver who sat during anthem over Trump speaks for many in sports Royals announce spring schedule: pitchers and catchers will report Feb. 14 Mellinger Minutes: So much Chiefs, a little Royals, and some Stick To Sports K-State player will wear late father’s number vs. Baylor, his former team Five things KU must do to beat the top-ranked Blue Devils in New York Sports Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

(AP) — A commercial satellite capable of taking high-resolution images from space was launched Friday from a military base along the California coast. The satellite known as WorldView-4 was lifted into orbit atop an Atlas 5 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. WorldView-4 is the latest in a series of imaging satellites built by Lockheed Martin. It is operated by Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, which provides high-resolution images for government and private customers including first responders. The camera aboard the satellite is so sharp that it can spot the make of a car from nearly 400 miles above Earth, according to Lockheed Martin. It joins sister satellite, WorldView-3, which launched from the Vandenberg base in 2014. Both satellites can capture images of objects as small as 1-foot across. Friday was the ninth launch for United Launch Alliance this year. ULA, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co., has launched 112 times since it was founded in 2006. Its next launch is a NASA weather satellite scheduled for next week from Cape Canaveral, Florida. WorldView-4 was supposed to launch in September, but was postponed by a minor tank leak and two wildfires at the sprawling base, which encompasses nearly 156 square miles (405 square kilometers) along the Pacific Ocean. The fires forced the evacuation of administrative buildings, but did not affect the launch complex. Firefighters who were assigned to the launch were diverted to corralling the flames. A firefighter died and another was hurt when the water truck they were in overturned on a highway outside the city of Lompoc, miles from the fire lines.

The time for speculating is over. Here's what we know for sure. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 11, 2016 at 11:41AM Has it only been nine months since I last wrote about Donald Trump and his defense policy ... should he ever become president ... which didn't seem at all likely at the time? It has. But now that the speculation has become fact, it's time to get specific. What do we actually know about President-elect Donald Trump? What has he said for certain about defense policy? And what does all of this mean for defense stocks? Image source: Donald J. Trump for President. Defining moment A lot of these questions got answered on Sept. 7, when then-candidate Trump made perhaps his defining public statement on defense matters at the Union League of Philadelphia. In three words, Trump summed up his policy as "peace through strength." Harking back to President Reagan (and before that to Emperor Hadrian),  this concept argues that by building a strong enough military, America can ensure it need not fight wars at all -- or that, if pressed to fight, it will win. But how exactly will President-elect Trump achieve said "strength" in the first place, and what does this imply for investors? I've identified three key themes. More money First and foremost, the overarching theme of President-elect Trump's administration will be one of more military spending. In Philadelphia, Trump blasted Congress and the Obama administration for cutting 10% from the defense budget "even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget." That "only" suggests Trump thinks one-sixth of the budget is a proportion that should be bigger. As for how much bigger, well, as a first step, Trump says he will "ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester," which implies increasing defense spending by roughly 10% right off the bat. More efficiency At the same time, this money will not come with strings unattached. Trump has gone on record blasting Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth fighter jet as "not very good," suggesting that if the plane "cannot perform as well as the planes we already have," then he might not buy it at all. This and similar "common-sense reforms," as he calls them, suggest that despite spending more money on defense in aggregate, individual defense programs that benefit specific defense stocks might still suffer as Trump moves to "eliminate government waste." More troops and equipment Citing statistics that he says show the U.S. has (a) "the smallest Army since 1940," (b) the smallest Navy "since 1915," and (c) "the smallest Air Force since 1947," President-elect Trump promised to grow the Air Force roughly 8% in size, to "at least 1,200 fighter aircraft," the Army 10% in size, to "around 540,000" troops, and the Navy 27%, to a fleet of "350 surface ships and submarines." Such moves promise to be heavily hardware intensive and lucrative to companies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA), which build F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets for the Air Force; to General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), the nation's largest builders of military warships; and to Lockheed Martin, which builds both fighter jets and warships. The U.S. Marine Corps, and companies such as General Dynamics that supply it, could benefit most of all from a Trump administration. The President-elect says he will grow it by more than 50% to "36 battalions." At the same time, lower-profile branches of the Defense Department, such as the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and its key contractors, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and Lockheed, stand to benefit from Trump promises "to rebuild the key tools of missile defense." Thus, while Lockheed Martin might lose business if the President-elect decides to cut the F-35 program short (and even that is not certain), there's still the potential for Lockheed to make up such revenues in other programs such as missile defense, as defense spending continues to grow in the aggregate. The upshot for investors Incidentally, this latter promise also offers the potential to benefit naval shipbuilders General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, as Trump singled out these companies' Ticonderoga-class cruisers as key elements of the U.S. missile defense system. At a cost of $220 million to modernize each cruiser, and there are 22 of them, Trump admits this single project could cost taxpayers nearly $5 billion. And it's just one element of one program that Trump aims to expand. So to sum up, there's going to be a lot of military investment on the table under a Trump administration, and a lot of money to be made by investors who buy these stocks early enough. Will the investment be worth it? Ultimately, Trump says  his goal is to "make our military so big, so strong, and so great, so powerful that we're never going to have to use it." So maybe, just maybe, it really will be worth it. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Talks toward the deal have been going on for months. The partners signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in early February, which led to an agreement signed July 14 at the Farnborough Airshow. After several delays, the deal was expected to close by October. “We are hoping to have our discussions concluded by the end of January. During this period Meridiana Fly also has to deliver certain conditions and achieve certain targets in its performance. We want Meridiana Fly to be a very strong national carrier with a robust international network,” Al Baker said, speaking at a recent media briefing in Florence. Sardinia-based Meridiana is the second largest Italian airline, operating flights to domestic and European destinations using a fleet of Boeing 737s, 767s and MD-82s. The Qatar Airways CEO also detailed further Italian expansion plans during his visit. “Once the runway extension at Florence Airport is complete, we fully intend to start a service to this historic city,” he said. “We are also committed to upgrading the aircraft type currently flying to Pisa from an A320 to a widebody model as soon as we receive more aircraft.” Qatar Airways operates to four Italian destinations: Milan (2X-daily), Pisa (daily), Rome (2X-daily) and Venice (daily).

At 100 that is saying something. Bob was born John Robertson Ward in Dewey, Oklahoma November 4th 1916. Bob’s folks moved to Topeka, Kansas, living there until Bob turned 11. Then it was off to Carthage, Missouri. Before long, during the beginning of the Great Depression, some family moved to the Pacific Northwest. Bob’s mom and dad followed n 1932. As a teen, in those years, Bob took the old Kirkland ferry boat over to Seattle to learn to play the alto-saxophone at Sherman Clay Music downtown. He also loved to hunt and fish with his dad in the Snoqualmie Forest foothills. It was then he learned that smoking and a box of .22 caliber shells was the same out of pocket. He opted for the shells like the good boy scout he was; reaching the rank of Eagle scout. Never shy about work, Bob cut wood and dodged death in the gale of ’34 when a falling tree narrowly missed him. Bob sold vacuum cleaners, worked at Seafirst Bank, met the beautiful Esther Agard and got married by 1936. His gift on their honeymoon was a hike up Mt. Si near North Bend. He is a romantic. When Bob left SeaFirst he hired on as a farm hand in the Snoqualmie Valley where his dad worked for the power and light company. Esther’s family had moved to Ketchum, Idaho. Esther and Bob joined them. A short time later it was back to Seattle for the hard-working couple. They applied at the University of Washington but withdrew when money was short. Bob helped build an airport out at Forks, Wa. Esther got pregnant with their first child. Esther was anxious to show her family her newborn so she and Bob moved back to Sun Valley. Sun Valley was expanding. Bob took a job as an elevator operator. Business was up and down. The ever elegant Esther appeared as an extra in a film starring Claudette Colbert and Melvin Douglas (I met him in Paris). Even show biz was not enough to make ends meet. Back in Seattle Bob took a job at Manning’s Restaurant He later clerked at a small grocery in Snoqualmie. A break came in 1940 when Bob took a correspondence course in aircraft construction and engineering. It paid off with a job at Lockheed, followed by a job in Miami at Northrup. The heat and humidity of Miami was too much for the kids to deal with so Bob applied for work back in Seattle at the Boeing company. For the remainder of WWII Bob had a good job. Boeing laid off several workers at the end of 1945. Bob was in the last round of layoffs but quickly was rehired in 1946. With Boeing hitting its stride in the Cold War, Bob was offered a job in Wichita, Kansas working on the B-47 line. He turned it down for the flight test program on the B-52’s in Seattle. With an adventurous spirit Bob began riding motorcycles. He was 54 sitting atop a BMW 600 and touring a variety of places with his son. He did the same with Esther but in their motorhome. Esther liked the creature comforts. Bob stayed with Boeing until his retirement in 1982. Esther passed away in 2004. Today the family cares for Bob in a home he built near Mt. Rainier High School in Des Moines. After 100 years of working, raising a family and living the better part of it in the northwest, that’s saying something. We encourage our readers to comment.

Watch Listen 07m 51s By now, global markets have rebounded after plummeting upon the news of Trump’s victory. Stocks of some companies surged, including the largest private prison contractor, Corrections Corporation of America—which recently changed its name to CoreCivic—whose shares are up 43 percent since Trump’s victory. GEO Group, another private prison contractor, is up 21 percent. Meanwhile, stocks also surged for many military contractors, including Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. We speak with William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, and Seth Freed Wessler, reporter with The Investigative Fund who has been following private detention centers. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: By now, global markets have rebounded after plummeting upon the news of Trump’s victory. Stocks of some companies surged, including the largest private prison contractor, Corrections Corporation of America, which recently changed its name to CoreCivic, and is up 43 percent since Trump’s victory. GEO Group, another private prison contractor, is up 21 percent. Meanwhile, stocks also surged for many military contractors, including Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined by two guests. William Hartung is director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, his article for Huffington Post, "Trump’s Pentagon Plan Could Cost Almost $1 Trillion; Smart Diplomacy Would Be Cheaper, More Effective." Also here, Seth Freed Wessler, reporter with The Investigative Fund who’s been following private detention centers. His latest piece for The Nation is headlined "ICE Plans to Reopen the Very Same Private Prison the Feds Just Closed." We welcome you both to Democracy Now! So, the night of the election, it looked like S&P was going way down, but there were certain industries that surged: private prisons and military contractors. Talk about the military contractors, Bill. WILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, the contractors paid attention to what Trump was saying. And he gave a speech in October talking about increasing Pentagon spending—bigger Navy, bigger Army, bigger Marines, bigger Air Force, a Star Wars program. And it was pretty much tied to a proposal by the Heritage Foundation, which, as you mentioned, would cost close to a trillion dollars more over the next 10 years than the huge amount the Pentagon already had in store for itself. So they’re popping champagne corks. There was an article by Loren Thompson, who’s basically a paid flack for the industry masquerading as a journalist, who said, "Happy days are here again" for the defense industry. So I think our job is to make sure that that is not the case. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But how does Trump skew that with his claims that he’s against many more military interventions by the United States and these regime change policies of the Obama policy? WILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, there’s no real logic, as is often the case, with Trump. He claims he doesn’t want regime change. He claims he can make the Pentagon more efficient. He wants allies to spend more. That would logically lead to lower Pentagon spending. But he’s kind of tied in with the neocons, with the industry. He seems to be taking a Ronald Reagan peace-through-strength argument. You can never spend enough on the Pentagon, then you decide how to use it. So, he’s made—he’s made the Pentagon a cash machine again for contractors. And I think, you know, those contradictions might be useful in trying to peel off some of his supporters, the ones who are reachable, to oppose some of these policies. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Seth Freed Wessler, what about the prison industry, and the private prison industry especially? SETH FREED WESSLER: Well, immediately after it was clear that Trump had won, we saw the private prison companies CCA and GEO Group, their stocks just soar. And those are not things that happen out there in the economy on their own. They happen because people know that Donald Trump has run a campaign consistently describing what he will do and how he will treat immigrants. He’s been, actually, fairly clear about that. He said that he will deport millions of people. He says that he will repeal Obama’s executive actions that protect young undocumented immigrants, so-called DREAMers, from deportation. All of these people will be like—could be detained, if picked up by immigration authorities. And the size of our detention system is poised to grow. The Trump campaign has also said that it wants to impose new mandatory minimum sentences on people who re-enter the country after deportation, adding—requiring that people who return to the United States are handed years-long sentences for that act of crossing the border, which, if legislation like that passes, will result in, you know, multiple new prisons having to be built. The Obama administration recently ordered the department—the Bureau of Prisons to begin closing federal private prisons. That’s very likely not to happen under a Trump administration. We’re likely to see the opposite of that: a growing population of noncitizens locked up in federal criminal facilities and immigration detention facilities. In the United States, federal private prisons are used to hold immigrants, both in the criminal side and in the civil detention side. Both of those systems are poised to grow, because Donald Trump has consistently promised to deport more people, to round people up. And these are real threats. Communities around the country are gearing up to face a level of attack by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, restarting of things like workplace raids and using local police departments to nab undocumented immigrants and deport them, no matter what they have done or what they’re accused of. We now have news that Kris Kobach has joined the transition team for— AMY GOODMAN: The Kansas secretary of state. SETH FREED WESSLER: The Kansas secretary of state, who helped draft and push SB 1070 in Arizona, the law that has now been fought back in the courts. That sort of law, that allowed local police—it required local police to just ask everybody about their immigration status, made it a crime to be undocumented, that is the kind of thing that the federal government could do by itself all over the country. AMY GOODMAN: So, when Trump becomes president, he could just reverse the Justice Department order to work with for-profit prisons in the federal system? SETH FREED WESSLER: Yeah, it’s basically at this point going to be a question about how much space the Bureau of Prisons needs to lock people up. And if Trump gets what he wants, if he is locking up more noncitizens, the Bureau of Prisons is going to continue—very likely going to continue using that space. Now, there is an order in place. Obama has—the Justice Department has told the Bureau of Prisons to close these prisons, and there are several months now when some of these prisons could be emptied and closed. But what we just saw, under Obama, is that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has now been expanding the size of its detention system already, went in and started using one of those very federal prisons that the Bureau of Prisons just shut down. And I think we’re likely to see more of that: prisons that might have been closed being repurposed or being used as they already were. AMY GOODMAN: Rudy Giuliani, who is a key player right now for Donald Trump—the Daily News reported in July, on July 12th, that Rudy Giuliani’s law firm paid big money—was paid big money to lobby for the Corrections Corporation of America. SETH FREED WESSLER: Yeah, and GEO Group put money into a PAC supporting Trump. I mean, it’s clear that there is a lot of support in both directions. But Trump ran on a policy about going after immigrants. And going after immigrants, deporting immigrants, locking immigrants up, that means detaining and incarcerating people. And that’s very likely to happen through private prisons. AMY GOODMAN: Seth Freed Wessler, we want to thank you for being with us from The Investigative Fund.

clock menu more-arrow Books Inside the finest Star Wars art book ever made The complete works of Ralph McQuarrie, collected for the first time by Charlie Hall@Charlie_L_Hall Nov 9, 2016, 3:30pm EST Image credit: Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books tweet share pin Long-time fans of the Star Wars franchise will no doubt recognize the work of concept artist and illustrator Ralph McQuarrie. He was instrumental in turning George Lucas’ epic into a reality, and played a key role in creating the visual language for the entire universe. This fall, Abrams Books published Star Wars Art: Ralph McQuarrie, the definitive collection of his work. We’ve spent some time with the final product and can say without reservation that it is among the finest Star Wars art books ever made. The two-volume, $250 set comes hardbound with a custom slipcase adorned with the now famous concept art for Star Wars: A New Hope. It’s one of the first paintings that McQuarrie ever did for the project, depicting R2-D2 and C-3PO leaving their "lifepod" and setting out across Tatooine’s Dune Sea. Both black, cloth-bound volumes are 400 pages start to finish, and each full-color page is a dramatic 12-by-14 inches. At that scale, it makes the many two-page spreads inside a genuine treasure. But even more valuable is the behind-the-scenes history of the Star Wars universe that these books contain. While the forward, written by George Lucas himself, is bland in the extreme, the work of the book’s actual authors — Brandon Alinger, Wade Lageose and David Mandel — is extraordinary. It charts McQuarrie’s early days as an illustrator for Boeing where he produced aerospace illustrations and technical documents. Later, it highlights the work he did animating the Apollo missions in the 60s and 70s for television. It even touches on McQuarrie’s service in the U.S. Army, where he fought in some of the Korean War’s most brutal battles. The bulk of the text, however, covers McQuarrie’s working relationship with Lucas and other key members of the Star Wars creative team. Where applicable, the team has added additional works by other artists, including production photos, matte paintings and photographs of hand-made models. Together, they tell the complete story of the original Star Wars trilogy. There are also Easter eggs inside, including illustrations done for LucasFilm corporate holiday cards, toys and merchandise as well as original artwork produced for the Indiana Jones films. Abrams has agreed to share with Polygon’s readers some of the collections’ more than 2,000 images. Among them are new pieces from the LucasFilm archives, renderings of original McQuarrie pieces that have never been seen before in public or published in any book. Concept sketches, Darth Vader. The helmet sketch (right) has been printed frequently in the past, but only from a photographic transparency — the photograph caused the helmet and chest to appear softer than the faceplate, and the helmet appeared distorted. It is accurately reproduced here for the first time. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Illustration, Splinter of the Mind's Eye novel cover, late 1977. A classic piece, presented with a new photograph taken exclusively for these books. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Concept sketches, ice planet mobile turret, circa February 1979. Recently discovered among McQuarrie’s archives, and included here for the first time. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Portfolio illustration, The Emperor's powers, version 1. While McQuarrie had reference photographs from the film available while working on the portfolio illustrations, he sometimes blended in his own ideas as well, such as this evil face for the Emperor. He was subsequently asked to change the piece to match the film more closely. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Production illustration (photoprint), "Artoo and Threepio leave the pod in the desert," version 2. McQuarrie revised the painting twice, presumably at the request of Lucas. The first revision altered C-3PO’s face and abdomen. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Printed drawing with additional work for matte study illustration, Luke in Cloud City hallway. Pieces were retrieved from ILM’s dumpster by a young fan who frequently stopped by with his father to check for souvenirs, circa late 1979 or early 1980. ILM started locking their dumpsters not long after. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Poster illustration, "Fantastic Five", April 1, 1975. Early Chewbacca artwork from McQuarrie's "Fantastic Five" painting as inspiration for Zeb Orrelios from Star Wars: Rebels. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Illustration, "Jabba’s palace – North Gate Bridge", 1992. Star Wars: The Force Awakens was inspired by McQuarrie's depictions of Darth Vader's castle for Maz Kanata’s castle on Takodana. It also used images like this one of Jabba's Palace for the Jakku spaceport. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Concept sketch, snowtrooper commander helmet. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books The 1979 LucasFilm holiday card. Ralph McQuarrie/Abrams Books Printed McQuarrie illustration with coloring by Craig Barron, Ark of the Covenant. This piece was inserted into a prop bible for pick-up shots of Raiders of the Lost Ark completed at ILM.

This route will be the nineteenth link to the Americas served by the airline. Air Europa have announced their latest connection to the Americas. Their service to Ramón Villeda Morales International Airport in San Pedro Sula, Honduras will be detrimental for the Latin American country, as according to 2014 statistics, the airport serves less than one million passengers a year. The route will operate once a week on Airbus 330-200 aircraft which has the ability to carry 275 passengers in economy and 24 in business class. This announcement follows the airline’s plans to begin service to Guayaquil, Ecuador and Cordoba, Argentina via Asuncion, Paraguay. The Guayaquil expansion followed three meetings that took place at Routes events over the past two years between José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport and Air Europa executives. The meetings were supported by air service development consultancy ASM (Airport Strategy and Marketing). The consultancy has been working alongside the Ecuadorian airport on its network development strategy in recent years. Speaking earlier this year when the route was announced, Mike St-Laurent, vice president, consulting, ASM stated: “It is fantastic news that Madrid and Guayaquil are now connected with a new 5x weekly service by Air Europa. Working together with Guayaquil Airport, we presented a strong business case to Air Europa for this new route between the two cities. The new service will open up Guayaquil to a new wave of European tourists and promote business interests within the region.” Last month, the Spanish carrier announced the arrival of their third Boeing 787 Dreamliner of the 22 they placed an order for. Long-haul services are firmly on the forefront of Air Europa’s minds judging by their plans for the aircraft. This year, Miami and Bogota routes have been announced, and the Dreamliner has been earmarked to serve both Madrid to New York and a Buenos Aires link. The order of 22 aircraft consists of eight 787-8 and 14 787-9. The order for 14 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft is the largest every Boeing widebody order from a Spanish carrier. Air Europa boast one of the youngest fleet on the continent. The city of San Pedro Sula is the second largest city in Honduras after the capital, Tegucigalpa. Two-thirds of the country’s gross domestic product comes from the city, largely due to the clothes-weaving factories, better known as maquila. Earlier this year, AeroMexico announced additional frequencies to San Pedro Sula, offering a second daily flight from Mexico City.  This link is due to begin April 26, 2017.   The Fundamentals of Route Development This essential download gives you all you need to get started with air service development.

Economy 2016-11-11T10:54+02:00 10:54 11.11.2016 Kherson airport to stay in municipal ownership after reconstruction The Kherson airport after its reconstruction would remain in municipal ownership, as it is a sensitive facility of national defense, Governor of Kherson region Andriy Hordeyev has said. "I would like to thank previous governor Andriy Putilov who saw a potential in this facility. Since 2014 we jointly with the Cabinet of Ministers have decided to invest in it. We passed the bill on the public fund development in parliament and lobbied for the airport's reconstruction. We could have finished it more quickly, but red tape slowed completion," he said in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine. He said that aprons and two taxi strips will be finished by the end of the year, and the terminal will be rebuilt. "We have two potential investors who are competing. These are foreign investors who are ready to complete reloading, refrigerating and passenger terminals around the airfield. They would provide for logistics. They are interested in reconstructing the runway for Boeing-747 planes – to reinforce it and enlarge by 1,200 meters. My only requirement to them is the financial ability and retaining the facility in municipal ownership. We would not sell it to anyone, as it is a sensitive facility of national defense," he said. He said that this year the airfield was actively used by Turkish Airlines. "The loading of flights with tourists was 86% on average. Today it carried over 90,000 tourists. Even if each tourist gives UAH 500 to our economy (taxies, hotels, cafes, food), this is UAH 45 million in the internal economy of our region. We have invested far less," he said. Hordeyev said that the region has agreements with Ukraine International Airlines (UIA). "They received flight permits and presented a technical rider on the possibility of servicing flights. Thus, the passenger flow would expand more. UIA seeks to launch Kherson-Warsaw flights via Boryspil. This would help to reach Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv with transfers. This would fully open Boryspil and the European destinations. Now we have Kherson-Istanbul – a large transport hub where one can reach any destination with transfers," he said.

Revenue fell nearly 10 per cent to $3.74-billion. (Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg) Bombardier says Trump presidency is unlikely to affect operations Add to ... Nicolas Van Praet MONTREAL — The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 6:10AM EST Last updated Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 5:06PM EST Comments Print / License AA Bombardier Inc. has dismissed the potential impact of a Trump presidency on its operations as it reported a narrower third-quarter loss and said profitability for the full year would be better than previously expected. The shares jumped 9.5 per cent to close at $1.96 in Toronto trading on Thursday, their biggest one-day gain since April. “We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but Bombardier today is a much better and stronger company than it was a year ago,” Bombardier chief executive Alain Bellemare said in a conference call. Mr. Bellemare is one year into a five-year comeback effort for Bombardier, which faced a cash crunch in 2014 when it was trying to bring multiple products to market. He has since reduced the company’s risk by securing more liquidity and concentrating resources on the C Series airliner. Now, the focus is on rebuilding earnings and cash flow with an aim of generating EBIT margins of 8 per cent companywide by 2020. Those plans probably will not be derailed by decisions Donald Trump makes when he is U.S. president, at least as they relate to Bombardier’s supply chains and operations, Mr. Bellemare said. Among the questions investors are asking is how a Trump presidency will affect companies with operations in Mexico. That includes many auto makers as well as Bombardier, which has both rail and aerospace manufacturing facilities there. Mr. Trump directed significant hostility towards the country during the campaign, pledging to build a wall along the Mexican-U.S. border and scrap the North American free-trade agreement among other moves. “I think it would be too early to speculate about what that would imply from a trade perspective,” Mr. Bellemare said, noting that Bombardier is a global player with manufacturing power on several continents. “But I feel, you know, that it shouldn’t impact our operations at all.” There are other questions about what a Trump administration would mean for aerospace companies and rail equipment manufacturers. Bombardier is the only company in the world that is in both camps, because it makes planes and trains. In aerospace, a key question is the future of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a government corporation that finances foreign purchases of U.S.-made goods such as aircraft. Boeing Co. has historically been the biggest beneficiary of the bank, with its commercial airliners representing the majority of Ex-Im deals as measured in dollars, said Scott Hamilton, an aerospace consultant with Leeham & Co. Mr. Trump has sided with those who see the bank as a poster child for corporate welfare. If he closes it, Boeing rivals including Bombardier would gain an advantage, Mr. Hamilton said. “Bombardier would be able to offer Canadian export financing support in [sales] campaigns where Boeing would not.” In trains, Bombardier also could benefit from Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to spend $1-trillion (U.S.) on infrastructure over the next five years, one analyst says. Macquarie Capital Markets analyst Konark Gupta notes that 16 per cent of Bombardier’s train-unit sales currently come from North America. However, the company has struggled to deliver streetcars on time to Toronto. Montreal-based Bombardier reported a net loss of $94-million, or 4 cents a share, for its most recent quarter. That is a dramatic improvement from the $4.9-billion, $2.20-a-share loss a year ago when it booked a charge on the C Series and Learjet 85 programs. Revenue fell 9 per cent to $3.74-billion. Not including special items, Bombardier broke even on a per-share basis. Cash burn was $320-million, better than analysts predicted. This marks the third straight quarter the company has generated margins on earnings before interest and taxes, excluding special items, topping 6 per cent in each of its business units. It now expects full-year EBIT of between $350-million and $400-million, at the high end of previous guidance.

More than 1000 ISIS-trained jihadists returning to Europe every year, coupled with the surge of migrants to Europe are alarming concerns; as present capabilities of the European border, coast guard, intelligence services and immigration agencies simply cannot meet these challenges. The EU-Turkey deal (if implemented) might lead to a significant decrease in the flow of refugees (by March-April 2016 the rate of migrants entering Greece declined by 90%). However, the agreement faces formidable practical, political and legal challenges (e.g., each and every one of the 22 EU parliaments has to endorse the treaty). In the aftermath of the migration crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, a major overhaul of the Western European border security and immigration infrastructure, strategy and funding is already underway. Following a 2010 to 2015 annual market growth of 10-13% the 2015 to 2020 annual market will surge by 104%. The "European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022" report is the most comprehensive review of the market available today. It provides a detailed and reasoned roadmap of this growing market. The European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Market is boosted by the following drivers: The Western European border security, coast guards, immigration agencies and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to counter the surge of refugees and 21st century jihadists who use sophisticated means to return to the continent. The Schengen Area is comprised of 26 European countries that have abolished border control at their common borders. Several Schengen Area governments reinstated border checkpoints by 2015. Europe cannot build a wall to keep out refugees and terrorists or enlist millions of border guards who would need to watch every inch of its over 10,000 land borders and 80,000 coastlines. Europol estimates that up to 5,000 European jihadists have already returned to Western Europe after obtaining combat experience on the battlefields of the Middle East. On 15 December 2015, the European Commission presented a proposal for a new agency that would replace and succeed Frontex, having a stronger role and mandate, and forming a "European Border and Coast Guard" along with national authorities for border management. Of Europe's approximately 50 countries, Russia has by far the longest coastline as well as the longest land border. Western Europe, the largest economy in the world with a 2015 GDP of approximately $22 trillion (vs. the U.S. $17.5 trillion), can invest "whatever it takes" to protect its citizens from the looming jeopardies of mass migration and terrorism. The border security and immigration enforcement industry faces a considerable challenge in seeking to provide the necessary solutions to current and future threats. At the same time, this challenge presents multi-billion USD opportunities to the defense, ICT and security industries able to deliver effective functions, integrate systems, and maximize security and productivity per $ invested. According to European intelligence services, ISIS has approximately 5000 original European blank passports which can be used by jihadists returning to the EU. The EU and the rest of the European border security and immigration infrastructure enforcement market for products and services are served by local defense and security companies. Even with a preference for locally manufactured products, foreign products can usually strongly compete on the basis of cost-performance. They do not encounter any EU direct trade barriers or quotas. Non-tariff, indirect trade barriers may be the approval process of dual use goods, which include many security market products. This report is a resource for executives with interests in the market. It has been explicitly customized for the security industry and other decision-makers in order to identify business opportunities, developing technologies, market trends and risks, as well as to benchmark business plans. * Customers who purchase a multi-readers license of the report will get the "Global Homeland Security & Public Safety Industry – 2016 Edition" report free of charge.

Stater was a ball turret gunner in a B-24 bomber that crash-landed in Yugoslavia during World War II. Travis Heying The Wichita Eagle In 23 bombing missions over Europe during World War II, Harry Stater was a B-24 ball turret gunner who never fired a shot from his machine guns. “War wasn’t a pleasant deal then,” Slater, now 93, said.

Courtesy photo 1 of 3 i By Roy Wenzl rwenzl@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The first thing Harry Stater makes clear, when a visitor comes knocking, is: “I’m no hero.” “OK?” he says. “I’m not. I didn’t do anything.” Maybe so. In 23 bombing missions over Europe during World War II, Harry was a B-24 ball turret gunner who never fired a shot from his machine guns. But some good stories are simple: They tell of ordinary men who do their best when the best is sorely needed. Larry Stater regards his dad as someone noble, because of the war, and what happened after. We’ll start with the war. Depth perception “I was born in Mount Vernon, Mo., in 1923,” Harry said. He’s 93 now, and lives alone in Derby. He’s got no big plans for Veterans Day. “I tried to enlist as soon as the war started. They said they didn’t need me just then. ‘Wait for the draft,’ they said. “So when they drafted me in 1943, they sent me to Fort Leavenworth and asked what I wanted to do. I said the Marines. “Then they did some tests and said, ‘You have good depth perception.’ So they put me in the Army Air Corps.” ‘Wait for the draft,’ they said. Harry Stater, World War II veteran He and his crew learned how to bomb targets from B-24 bombers. They traveled to train: Kansas. Georgia. Texas. Virginia. Harry learned to fire a machine gun backward out of a ball turret on the underside of a B-24. They flew to Europe by way of Maine, then Gander Bay, Newfoundland; then Marrakech in French Morocco, then Tunis in Tunisia, then Italy. From Spinazzolla, Italy, they flew their second bombing mission, in October 1943, over German military war targets near Vienna, Austria. Harry saw smoke from anti-aircraft shells exploding in the air near their B-24. “A couple of our engines were shot out from the anti-aircraft,” he said. That cut their power, which meant they were descending at a time when they had to fly back over the snow-capped Alps to get home. “We got so low we ended up flying between two peaks,” Harry said. It was too much for the B-24. They lost altitude and eventually crash-landed somewhere in what was then called Yugoslavia. “We crawled out of that plane and saw that we’d landed wheels-up, which was quite a sight to itself,” Harry said. “And I never saw so many people, all crowded around us.” They were armed men, but Harry’s suspense didn’t last long. “They were partisan fighters, and they were all for the U.S. They took care of us, fed us, and after about a week over there, they put us on a little boat, and we made our way back to Italy.” More missions Surviving a shoot-down meant you got another plane, and flew more missions. Harry and his crew flew 21 more. ‘Wait for the draft,’ they said. Harry Stater, World War II veteran “Sometimes the smoke from the anti-aircraft was really thick. I saw other planes go down; they looked like a little toy airplane might look if someone just threw it. At times I thought I’d never make it home. “One time we got buzzed by a German fighter, a Messershmitt ME109, and that made a heck of a sound when the machine guns fired. But the last I saw of that ME-109, there was an American P-38 fighter after him.” Was he ever scared? “Only on every mission I flew,” he said. They bombed Germany, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia. They dropped fragmentation bombs on ground troops, and heavy bombs on factories or military targets. They flew their last mission on May 1, 1945, just before the war ended. War trauma “I had some emotional problems; it was hard to keep food down, and sometimes I’d throw up. “I tried to go to college, on the GI Bill, but after nearly a year I realized I could not sit still in the classes and listen to lectures. I was so nervous. So I quit. “War wasn’t a pleasant deal then. No war is pleasant, for that matter. It’s a shame we have to kill each other to prove something.” He scrounged for jobs, drove a cab for a while, went to Wichita one day to visit friends – and ended up working for Boeing for three decades. He married a smart girl from Wellington, Jane Merrill Henderson, who loved him deeply and helped him recover from his war traumas. “A family helps with that.” War wasn’t a pleasant deal then. Harry Stater, World War II veteran He had five children with Jane, including Larry, his oldest son here in Wichita. “But you never know what’s going to happen.” On Aug. 29, 1973, 30 years after he started flying bombing missions, he heard a thud in his bedroom. He ran in, picked up Jane, and put her on the bed. He called police. They called an ambulance. But she died in that room; a heart attack, at age 42. And what did he do after that? “So we live as best we can,” he said. “Here one day, gone the next.” A good person, good dad That cryptic answer, with almost no information or emotion in it, is classic Harry Stater, his son said. “He would not tell us what happened to him in the war,” Larry Stater said. “Or that it bothered him. We knew he’d been shot down. We knew he’d been rescued by freedom fighters. But that was it.” “But here’s what we knew about him: My dad has always been a good person, well liked by everyone he ever met. “He worked for Boeing for 33 years, served at the VFW for many years. And though he worked all the time, he was still concerned with all us kids. “He was a good dad. Our mother died at a young age, and he had to bring the younger ones up by himself, while he was working. That was not easy. It about killed him, losing her. Larry Stater, veteran’s son “It about killed him, losing her,” he said. “That’s the first time I ever saw my dad cry. It was not just a few tears. It was all-out crying. “He did his best by the kids, raising them alone. “He never talked down to us. He tried to teach us as much as he knew. He taught us to be honest and truthful. “He did a pretty good job. We got nobody in jail, nobody in trouble; most everybody has a family.” Harry Stater, who served his country, and was by his own account not a hero, lives alone in Derby, in an assisted living facility. He has five children, 10 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren. He did his best to do right by all those kids – and all the rest of us, Larry Stater said. “I don’t know how much better a man can be than he is.” Roy Wenzl: 316-268-6219, @roywenzl Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Local Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:00 Trump vows to be a president for all Americans Pause 3:15 Whooping cranes at Texas Aransas National Wildlife Refuge 1:57 Wink Hartman Sr. may open downtown grocery 0:42 Supermoon over Wichita 3:49 How Westar sale affects Wichita 0:46 Supermoon rises over Wichita 4:38 Dining with Denise: Wichita's most obscene foods 0:39 Fatal shooting on East Harry 0:32 Crime scene where two were stabbed and one girl is dead 0:28 Eyewitness captures the arrest of 'person of interest' in stabbing death Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 5 hours ago Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 2:20 5 hours ago Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 0:59 18 hours ago Fatality accident on K-254 near I-135 0:42 20 hours ago Supermoon over Wichita View more video Local Police identify man killed in Wichita restaurant Triple-stabbing defendant expected to plead no contest today Planned Parenthood opens its first abortion clinic in Oklahoma Maize school district approves attendance boundaries Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Eagle Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Newsletters Advertising Information Digital Advertising Rates Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Eagle Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Newsletters Advertising Information Digital Advertising Rates Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

(Photo/David A. Barnes) The smoke from North Georgia’s forest fires filled the air at Georgia’s Equestrian Complex. Despite the air, No. 4 Georgia beat No. 2 Auburn, 11-7, to earn its first Southeastern Conference win of the season. Georgia (3-1,1-2 SEC) and Auburn (3-2, 1-1) competed neck and neck throughout the entire day on Friday. With high scoring points throughout the entire match, the level of play between the teams kept raising higher and higher until the last match.   “It’s a big accomplishment,” sophomore Graysen Stroud said. “We’ve worked really hard for all of this.”  Both teams were tied until it reached reining and equitation on the flat, but Georgia swept Auburn 4-0 in reining.    Georgia senior Claudia Spreng sealed the deal for Georgia with her 76-75 victory against Auburn’s Ali Fratessa.  Georgia demolished Auburn throughout the fencing. Auburn was only able to capture one win from the Bulldogs. With all of Auburn’s riders having its career high for horsemanship, Georgia fell to Auburn in that event.   “There is always pressure facing a SEC team,” sophomore Emma Mandarino said. “We utilized the nerves in positive ways and made ourselves better.   Mandarino won Most Outstanding Performance (MOP) for her ride in equitation over fences with a score of 88-82. Mandarino wasn’t the only Bulldog to win MOP, as Stroud won a MOP in horsemanship with her score of 78-76.5  “It’s a big accomplishment,” Stroud said. “We gave it our best and it paid off.”  Last week, Georgia fell to No. 1 Texas A&M, which was its toughest loss of the season.  Today was an important match up for the Bulldogs to defeat the Tigers and grab its first SEC win. The need to win today was key for its ability to get through the recent losses.  “Our competition lit us up, and we were hungry to win,” Stroud said. “We hit a rough patch and this set us up for success for the rest of the year.”  Georgia handed Auburn its second loss of the season and its second SEC lost. Its first loss was also against Texas A&M.  “I don’t even think of it as a SEC win,” head coach Meghan Boeing said. “I think of it as just a ride a great day and great competition.” Georgia faces one more match of the fall semester away at South Dakota State. Boeing said she feels the team is at the right spot for a halfway mark of the season. Georgia equestrian to compete against defending national champion On Friday, Georgia equestrian will have one of its toughest meets of the season. No. 2 Auburn, the 2016 NCEA national champions, will go head-to-head with No. 4 Georgia at the UGA Equestrian Complex.  No. 3 Georgia equestrian falls to No. 1 Texas A&M On Saturday, Georgia equestrian struggled to get points on the board throughout  its away meet against Texas A&M as the No. 1 Aggies defeated No. 3 Georgia 13-7 at the Hildebrand Equine Complex.  Georgia equestrian defeats New Mexico State in 3rd meet of season As the lyrics “I’m unstoppable today” by Sia played over the speakers, Georgia’s sweep in horsemanship was announced. The 5-0 sweep concluded the first half of the meet. Georgia didn’t stop there. As the song suggested, Georgia remained unstoppable throughout the second half of the meet against New Mexico State. Georgia won 17-2.

The Stock Market Is Buying President-Elect Trump's Big Infrastructure Promises Forbes 5 days ago Steve Schaefer, Forbes Staff © President-elect Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 10. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump swept into the White House on a wave of support from voters who feel like the world’s increasingly globalized economy left them behind as manufacturing and industrial jobs left U.S. shores over the last three-plus decades. Popular Searches Boeing Co BA ▼ 148.11 -1.88 -1.25% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 107.11 +1.40 +1.32% Carmike Cinemas Inc CKEC ▲ 34.10 +0.05 +0.15% Walt Disney Co DIS ▼ 97.70 -0.22 -0.22% Judging from the action in stocks since Election Day, the market is betting that president-elect Trump will deliver on at least some of his promises to reverse that trend. Look no further than the stark outperformance of the Dow Jones industrial average over the last two trading sessions. The Dow coasted into Thursday’s closing bell at record highs, up more than 1% for the session, while the S&P 500 notched only a slim gain and the Nasdaq Composite actually declined. A crucial difference between the indexes: the 30-stock Dow is heavy on financial and industrial names and relatively light in technology. Dow component Caterpillar, up nearly 11% in just the last two days, is looking like a growth stock while tech heavyweights Alphabet, Amazon.com and Facebook have slumped since the election. In his victory speech in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Trump offered up thoughts that set the stage for a surging industrial sector. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.,” Trump said, and any kind of big spending program in that realm would benefit the makers of construction equipment, building supplies and materials. In that respect, the rally in stocks like Caterpillar may not be so different from the advance they started in the spring of 2009 when President Obama’s big stimulus package was winning headlines with its focus on “shovel-ready” projects, a pledge that would become a punchline. Traders are ready to believe in Trump though, presuming the big rally of the past two days indicates approval. Only financials performed better than the industrial sector’s 2% gain Thursday, as bank stocks benefited from the prospect that regulatory reforms enacted since the financial crisis will be lightened or eliminated and, more importantly, a steepening yield curve. The industrials group, though, could keep rallying provided Trump’s infrastructure message doesn’t fall by the wayside amid plans to repeal Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. Perhaps most importantly, a spending plan that would go toward building and repairing roads, bridges, tunnels and other critical infrastructure is one of the few planks on which Trump and Hillary Clintion found some common ground. Morgan Stanley strategists advised clients own industrial stocks in a post-election report, citing the likelihood of “excitement in the coming weeks about some additional infrastructure spending, an area where there appears to be some common ground.” The firm highlighted defense stocks like General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and said the broader industrial group’s earnings expectations “don’t appear to be excessively optimistic.” Among the stocks leading the charge on Thursday: Lighting systems maker Acuity Brands, aluminum producer Arconic, water equipment provider Pentair, conglomerate Emerson Electric and toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker.
