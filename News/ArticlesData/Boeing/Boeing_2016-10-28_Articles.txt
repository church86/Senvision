(Jim Young/Reuters) By ALWYN SCOTT and TIM HEPHER REUTERS Investigators were scouring Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Saturday after an engine caught fire on an American Airlines plane attempting to take off on Friday, as a source said a detached engine part had hit a nearby building, something the design should have prevented. No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which crippled a Boeing 767 with 161 passengers and nine crew members aboard as it was departing for Miami and briefly closed all O’Hare’s runways. The failure was so intense that a disk from the engine hit a building roof, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jet engines are designed to keep parts within the outer cover as escaped shrapnel can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such “uncontained” failures therefore are extremely rare and National Transportation Safety Board officials were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine, with maintenance or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6 introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. The NTSB said it planned to release more details at a news conference later on Saturday at O’Hare. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O’Hare assisting in the investigation, GE’s Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of “industry-leading levels of reliability,” Kennedy said. The O’Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The “rupture of the high pressure turbine stage 1 disk” was traced partly to inadequate GE design of the disk and poor FAA oversight of inspections, according to the summary. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.

Disclosure of the "uncontained" failure," in which internal engine parts breach the protective housing designed to keep them safely enclosed, even in a breakdown, came a day after a mishap that authorities said neared the point of disaster but caused no serious injuries. Shrapnel escaping from the engine's outer cover can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such engine failures are extremely rare, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine itself, with its manufacture or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6, introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American Airlines Flight 383, a twin-engine Boeing 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down a runway for departure when the right-side engine failed, forcing the crew to abort takeoff, authorities said. Leaking jet fuel caught fire under the wing, as the crew evacuated passengers via emergency exit chutes from the left side of the plane, and fire crews arrived to begin pouring foam on the flames within minutes. One flight attendant and 19 passengers suffered minor injuries in their escape. NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday that while flames never breached the plane's cabin, some smoke did, though city fire officials have said no one suffered from smoke inhalation or burns. City fire department officials said on Friday the plane was 15 to 20 seconds from becoming airborne, fully loaded with 43,000 pounds of jet fuel. Ward said the aircraft stopped about 3,000 feet from the end of the runway. "That's a lot of runway to have left," she said. FAR-FLUNG ENGINE DEBRIS In a sign of the intensity of the engine breakdown, at least two pieces of a stage-2 high-pressure turbine disk were flung from the scene. One was found at a United Parcel Service warehouse nearly 3,000 feet (915 meters), or about half a mile, south of the accident site. Another was found three-tenths of a mile to the north on airport property, NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday. She said the escaped engine parts would be shipped to a lab for examination, and the crippled right engine would be sent to a GE facility to be dismantled and examined there for clues to what caused the failure. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s, and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE.

The Seattle Times reports the patent details a passenger plane that takes off and lands vertically like a helicopter via tilting rotors. The rotors—horizontal for takeoff and landing—rotate to become propellers during flight. Boeing was one of two developers behind the military's similar V-22 Osprey, which went into service in 2007. However, the Osprey can only carry up to 24 soldiers. And a prototype for a commercial plane that takes off and lands vertically from Bell—the other developer of the Osprey—can only carry nine passengers, according to Business Insider. Boeing's patent calls for a plane that carries 100 passengers. There are other major differences between the Osprey and the plane shown in Boeing's patent. Boeing's plane would have four engines housed in its wings instead of two engines housed in the tilt-rotors themselves. This means less structural reinforcement is necessary. The wings are also positioned lower than the Osprey's, closer to a traditional commercial plane's, in order to make maintenance and fueling easier. A passenger plane that takes off and lands like a helicopter could allow for more regional commercial flights to leave from small airfields, New Atlas reports. But it's unclear if Boeing actually plans to build the new plane. "Boeing files tons of patents, so this might not even come to fruition," a Boeing spokesperson tells Business Insider. "I'm not saying it won't." (The design could have saved Mike Pence a scare last week.)

Boeing will need to reduce its 777 production plans again unless it starts to see a steady stream of orders. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 29, 2016 at 2:25PM With the troubled 787 Dreamliner program finally starting to turn a profit, Boeing's (NYSE:BA) most pressing challenge now is filling its open delivery slots for the current-generation 777 over the next few years. In the past two years, order activity for the 777 has slowed dramatically. Boeing's management has admitted that it will be hard for the company to meet its order goals for the 777. However, Boeing isn't conceding yet. Let's take a look at whether it has a realistic chance of getting the orders it needs to avoid another deep production cut. Order activity grinds to a halt Since the beginning of 2015, a combination of low oil prices, currency volatility, and subpar global growth has taken a big bite out of the wide-body market. For example, Boeing only won 38 firm orders for the current-generation 777 in 2015, compared to a goal of 40 to 60. Boeing hasn't received enough 777 orders recently. Image source: Boeing. As a result, Boeing admitted last year that it might have to reduce 777 production to seven per month from the current rate of 8.3 per month. In early 2016, it confirmed that it would cut production to that level at the beginning of 2017. Moreover, Boeing plans to deliver just 5.5 units per month in 2018 and 2019, as it will start building some 777Xs on the same production line by then. Yet as 2016 progressed, analysts started to doubt that even this reduced target was achievable. As of the end of September, Boeing had just six new net orders for the 777 this year. Last week, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg acknowledged that Boeing may have to reduce deliveries to as little as 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019. Based on Muilenberg's comments, there are about 40 open slots for the current-generation 777 in the 2017-2018 period, assuming no further production cuts. In addition, Boeing would probably need another 100 orders for 2019 and beyond. A year-end order flurry? Still, there have been some hopeful signs. Earlier this month, Qatar Airways ordered 10 more 777-300ERs. Just this week, SWISS ordered a single additional 777-300ER. That brings the year-to-date order total to 17. More orders could potentially be finalized soon. Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) announced last month that it plans to add 15 more 777-300ERs to its fleet. Boeing hasn't reported an order from Saudia yet, so it's not clear whether these are all new orders. Iran Air also hopes to acquire 15 new 777-300ERs. It reached a tentative agreement with Boeing earlier this year and the U.S. government has now approved the sale. However, lining up financing remains a major obstacle due to ongoing financial sanctions against Iran. There's also a lot of political opposition within the U.S. to doing business with Iran, so the deal could potentially be torpedoed at any moment. Time to replace those 747s! Aside from these already-rumored potential sales, Boeing could look to current operators of the 747-400 for new 777 orders. The in-service fleet of 747s has been shrinking rapidly. Rising maintenance costs and declining availability of spare parts could encourage airlines to accelerate their 747 retirements. Many airlines are retiring their 747-400s in a hurry. Image source: The Motley Fool. Many of the top operators of passenger 747s have already ordered enough planes to replace their 747 fleets. But some -- such as KLM, China Airlines, and Thai Airways -- might need to order a few more planes to replace the last of their 747s. There are also a lot of active 747-400 freighters, and many of their operators haven't planned for their replacement yet. The 747 offers some unique advantages over the 777 as a freighter, due to its nose-loading capabilities. Moreover, fuel efficiency is less of a concern for cargo airlines. Nevertheless, Boeing could potentially pick up a few 777F orders as 747 replacements, especially if fuel prices rise in the next year or two. Will Emirates order more 777s? Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates is by far the largest 777 customer in the world, accounting for more than 10% of all orders for the current-generation models. As of last year, it was looking at ordering up to 15 additional current-generation 777s, but it hasn't pulled the trigger yet. If Emirates sees incremental growth opportunities in the next year or two, it could order more 777s for delivery in 2018 or 2019. It could even replace some of its older 777s just to keep its fleet age young. This year, it is retiring nine 777s. Emirates may be interested in buying even more 777s. Image source: The Motley Fool. A fleet refresh could be aided by the growing market for secondhand 777-300ERs. For example, British Airways is interested in acquiring some used 777-300ERs to help replace its aging 747 fleet, rather than buying any more new 777s. Anybody else? FedEx could be another source of incremental orders for Boeing's 777F in the coming years. In fact, the company plans to buy at least 7 777Fs that are not in Boeing's firm order book yet. It could order even more if rising fuel prices or maintenance costs make it advisable to accelerate the retirement of its older three-engine MD-10s and MD-11s. Boeing could also nab some orders in emerging markets if air travel demand grows faster than expected, as the 777 is one of the few wide-body models available on relatively short notice. The bottom line is that aside from potential orders of about 15 planes each from Iran Air, Saudia, and Emirates, there aren't many prospects for big 777 orders out there. There are a large number of potential sale opportunities, but they are mostly for deals of a few airplanes each -- or even just one, as in the case of the recent SWISS order. Unless Boeing has an amazing success rate in closing these deals, it's not going to get enough orders to maintain the current production plan. That said, if it can seal the relatively large Iran Air and Saudia deals in the next few months, Boeing should at least be able to avoid the worst-case scenario of reducing deliveries all the way to 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019.

Biman took the move to include the aircrafts to tackle any immediate problem in its flight operation after phasing out two decades-old Airbus A310-300s. "We've decided to take two 737-800s on dry lease as the airliner has decided to phase out its two Airbus aircraft after September this year," a senior official at Biman told UNB. He also said that the board of Biman gave the green signal to induct the two aircrafts. "We will now start the negotiation with the company for finishing the final tasks," the Biman official said. He also mentioned that Biman is very much optimistic to include the aircrafts by this year completing all procedures. A board member of Biman said that they have given conditional approval to start final negotiation with the lesser company. The conditions include improving the in-flight entertainment system and reconfigurig the seat arrangement as per the desire of Biman with re-registration. The seating capacity of the two aircraft will be of 162 each, with 12 in business class and 150 in economy class, according to Biman's tender documents. It also said the age of the two aircraft will be not be more than 10 years. "We're preferring to press the aircraft into services by this year," the Biman official said.

It also decided to start its operation on Dhaka-Guangzhou (China)-Dhaka, Dhaka-Colombo (Sri Lanka)-Dhaka and Dhaka-Male (The Maldives)-Dhaka routes. Biman also has the plan to start its flight operations on Dhaka-Narita (Japan)-Dhaka route after having suitable aircraft and completion of a commercial feasibility study. The airliner is in a process to resume its much-awaited Dhaka-New York-Dhaka route in the summer season in 2017 if the Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh (CAAB) is upgraded to category-1. As per its fleet plan, the sources said, Biman has a plan to operate its flights to Sydney, Jakarta, Toronto and Madras in phases, the sources said.

Chief Pilot of KLM’s Boeing 747 team Paul van der Ven told RTL News in the Netherlands that the pilots were disappointed that they would no longer be landing the majestic four-engine aircraft at Princess Juliana International Airport. “It is an iconic approach, especially because of the inseparable view of the blue Caribbean sea and the aircraft landing just behind the beach. The Boeing 747 is slowly disappearing from our fleet, but the end of this landing hurts. We find it a great pity, also because of the historic ties that this aircraft has with the island,” Van der Ven told RTL. The last KLM Boeing 747-400 touched down in St. Maarten on Friday at 11:03am, ending an era of what has been termed by aircraft enthusiasts as one of the scariest and most exhilarating landings in the world. Since 1990, KLM has served beach goers hair-raising landings as the Boeing soared at low altitudes over Maho Beach and onto the runway. The landing was one of the main attractions mainly for tourists who crowded the beach to witness the landing and take-off. From now on, the route Amsterdam-St. Maarten will be served by Airbus A330-200, seating. 243 passengers, as oppose to the 408 passengers that fit into the Boeing 747. The reward for passengers travelling from St. Maarten-Amsterdam will be the considerable shorter flying time as this will be a direct flight instead of making a stop-over in Curaçao. The Curaçao route will still use a Boeing 747. Chief Pilot Van der Ven has performed the landing some 12 times in his seven years as 747 pilot. He explained that the approach was very special for pilots because they have to do a large part manually. The height of the aircraft is very important because the runway is short. “At other airports, you make the landing as smooth as possible for the applause and your own ego. But in St. Maarten you have to put the aircraft on the ground at once,” he stated in the RTL article. The pilots are so concentrated when they land that they don’t notice a lot of the crowd on the beach. “But you know that they are there. When we take off, we do see them. We wave at them. Those are precious memories.” The aircraft that will be used on the route Amsterdam-St. Maarten is also a nice plane, but it cannot be compared to the Boeing 747-400, said Van der Ven. Modern aircraft look more alike and they don’t have a second floor and the four engines of the 747. “She is the Queen of the Skies,” said the chief pilot who would not be carrying out the last flight to St. Maarten.

World air cargo traffic to grow at 4.2pc: Boeing PARIS, 18 days ago Global air cargo traffic will grow at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent over the next 20 years, with 930 new and 1,440 converted freighters needed to meet market demand by 2035, according to a new report released by Boeing. The company released its biennial World Air Cargo Forecast at TIACA (The International Air Cargo Association) Air Cargo Forum and Exhibition in Paris, France. "The air cargo market has faced several years of below trend growth," said Randy Tinseth, vice president, Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "As trade continues to recover, we're confident the air cargo market will see growth over the long-term." Boeing projects the e-commerce market will be one of the primary factors driving that growth, reaching $3.6 trillion by 2020. Additionally, China's express market keeps expanding, with a five-year growth rate of 55 per cent in volume and 39 per cent in revenue. The forecast shows markets linked to Asia will lead all other international markets in average air cargo growth. Dedicated freighters still carry more than half of air cargo traffic and remain the leading cargo capacity provider. Boeing forecasts that the world air cargo fleet will expand by 70 per cent by 2035, adding a total of 2,370 freighters to the market. The forecast sees demand for 550 large production freighters, 380 production medium widebody freighters, 400 widebody conversion freighters and 1,040 medium conversion freighters. Boeing products make up more than 90 per cent of the world's dedicated freighter capacity. Boeing offers integrated solution for freighter operators, whether they carry express cargo or industrial goods. "Air cargo is critical to global trade, and Boeing offers the most comprehensive product line-up in the industry," said Tinseth. "Our airplanes provide capacity and reliability advantages that will help our customers adapt and succeed in the evolving air cargo marketplace." From standard-body freighters to large freighters, the Boeing Freighter Family has an unmatched selection of capacity and capability with superior economics. Boeing offers a complete family of production freighters – the 767-300, 777 and 747-8 Freighters – as well as the 737BCF and 767-300BCF conversion freighters. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | air cargo | More Analysis, Interviews, Opinions Stories 5G subscriptions to reach half a billion in 2022 Turning data chaos into value via digital change UAE Bankruptcy Law a 'life support' for businesses GCC can become 'world’s major e-commerce market' Crystal-gazing consumer spending in Saudi Arabia Trump has opportunity to advance growth policies 5G set to be a game-changer for networked society Demonetisation 'could add $18bn to Indian banking system' UAE employees look for flexible working hours Waste generated in GCC to hit 120m tonnes a year Global IoT market likely to top $7 trillion by 2020 Customer analytics key retail growth says report Global inflation about to spike: Saxo Bank Offshore wind power could grow more than 650pc Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The German airline’s last aircraft, a 737-300, marks a historical move as the Boeing twin-engine narrowbody has been in service for nearly 50 years. Lufthansa became the launch customer for the type Feb. 19, 1965 when it ordered 22 737-100s. The 737 received FAA certification Dec. 12, 1967 and the first aircraft was delivered for crew training Dec. 27, nearly two weeks later. The first scheduled flights were domestic. The original Lufthansa 737-100 fleet operated 643,048 hours and made 836,446 takeoffs and landings before it was phased out Feb. 25, 1982. ATW understands Lufthansa had a total of 157 Boeing 737s in service over five decades, including the variants 737-100, 200, 200C, 300, 300 QC (quick change), 400 and 500. In the 1990s, up to 120 737s at one time had been in service with Lufthansa. The Lufthansa 737 fleet completed nearly 5.5 million landings. As of July 2016, Boeing said the 737 had amassed a total of nearly 13,500 orders worldwide. Lufthansa is replacing its 737s with an all-Airbus A320 family fleet.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy Air India in talks with LIC for ₹10,000-cr loan for aircraft purchase Ashwini Phadnis   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet New Delhi, October 28:   Air India is in talks with Life Insurance Corporation of India for a loan of up to ₹10,000 crore to help finance the acquisition of 6 Boeing 787 and three 777 aircraft. The nine aircraft, which are to be delivered in 2016-17 and 2017-18, are a part of the 68 Boeing aircraft order which the airline had placed in 2005. The proposal was discussed at a meeting that Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had with the LIC Chairman recently. Air India will approach the Cabinet to gets its approval for the outright purchase of these nine aircraft instead of going in for a sale and lease back (SLB) arrangement as it had done when it signed an agreement for the purchase of 68 Boeing aircraft in 2005. LIC is keen that Air India own these aircraft so that the loan can be extended. Further, in case of a loan default, LIC can take over the aircraft instead of a leasing company which would be the case if Air India follows the SLB route. Air India is taking up the matter with the Ministry of Civil Aviation pointing out to the advantages of going with LIC for acquiring the nine Boeing aircraft under a rupee loan. “The repayment tenure for the LIC loan will be about 20 years which is longer than the 12-year repayment schedule for the earlier US Exim loan for acquiring aircraft. Besides, this will be a rupee loan so the airline will not be hit by exchange rate fluctuations and the rate of interest will be predetermined and will not be affected by any increase in the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) which was the case in the Exim loan,” a senior Air India official said. The state-owned airline could also get a “moratorium” on the principal for the first few years of the loan which will allow it to pay only the interest during the first few years. Incidentally, this is not the first time that a state-owned airline is going in for a rupee loan to finance acquisition of aircraft. The erstwhile Indian Airlines had gone in for a rupee loan to finance its 43 Airbus aircraft deal about a decade ago. It is also understood that LIC has had a similar arrangement with the Indian Railways to finance purchase of coaches.

Comair flights 'top deck' Boeing Penwell Dlamini | 2016-10-28 14:24:53.0 The four meter cake commissioned by British Airways to celebrate 20 years in SA. Image by: Penwell Dlamini A four-meter chocolate and vanilla cake in the shape of a Boeing - sporting its own navigation lights and propellers - was unveiled by Comair at Johannesburg's OR Tambo airport on Friday to mark 20 years of a franchise partnership with British Airways. Save & Share Tweet Email Print The giant cake‚ made by Cake Extreme‚ was cut before the public and slices were served to anyone who passed by. It is a replica of a new Boeing 737-800 aircraft arriving in November. All the 16 aircraft are expected to be fully delivered in 2020. This year Comair is celebrating 70 years as an airline in the country but also 20 years of partnership with British Airways as a franchise as an operator. Comair CEO Erik Venter explained the importance of this milestone to the company. “In 1996‚ we decided that we want to bring an international brand to South Africa with all technology that it would bring with it. We have been operating for 20 years very successfully with British Airways as an operator. There is a lot of new consumer technology that we have brought over the years. We have introduced a lot of apps and mobile application that people can use. We have a R10-billion programme of new aircraft acquisition we are embarking on. It is 16 new aircrafts in total‚” Venter said. Venter explained how the airline had been able to weather the stormy waters of the South African aviation industry. “People choose based on the value that they get from the product. We have to continue to improve the product and people will make their decision based on the value that they have received from the product.

The deal, signed at a ceremony on Friday, follows an agreement between the two companies inked in September last year to open a centre to install interiors, paint liveries and deliver 737 aircraft to Chinese customers. A Boeing spokesman confirmed the signing to Reuters, which was reported by CAAC News, a publication run by China's aviation regulator. The facility is Boeing's first 737 completion plant outside the United States and comes as the U.S. planemaker and its European rival Airbus fiercely compete for plane orders in China. Airbus already has two plants in China.

Joe Cahill on Business Boeing CEO's goals don't stop at interplanetary travel Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg made news this month when he vowed to beat high-tech polymath Elon Musk to Mars. Less stirring but equally ambitious and potentially more important is his earthly goal of doubling Boeing's profitability in four years. Unimpressive in many industries, Muilenburg's mid-teens operating margin target qualifies as revolutionary for a major commercial jet maker. Boeing's margins have hovered around 8 percent for years, a couple of percentage points better than archrival Airbus, although the European manufacturer is considered more efficient by some measures. “It would be a huge deal if they (Boeing) got to mid-teens,” says aerospace industry analyst Christopher Higgins of Morningstar in Chicago. Fatter margins could alter competitive dynamics, accelerate innovation and launch Boeing's stock skyward. Boeing would gain pricing leverage over Airbus, which has capitalized on its efficiency advantage to win market share in recent years. Bigger profits also would unleash more cash for investment in new planes and other technology, assuming Muilenburg doesn't spend it all on share buybacks. “If Boeing wanted to aggressively pursue product development and new airplanes, Boeing could well have the prospect of recapturing the lead over Airbus,” says aviation consultant Scott Hamilton of Leeham in suburban Seattle, noting Boeing has spent more than $6 billion repurchasing stock so far this year. Muilenburg, who succeeded James McNerney as CEO in July 2015 and added the chairman title in March, aims to achieve all three goals. On a conference call with analysts in July, he said the profit initiative is “about winning, competing and winning in the marketplace. It's about returning value to our shareholders, and it's also about funding our future investments and our innovation.” He also acknowledged the vast scope of the undertaking, calling his profit goal “a challenging target” that “spans all of our internal and external work.” JOB CUTS Photo by Craig M. Newman A stress test model of the SLS crew model is seen in the background at Boeing's assembly facility at the Kennedy Space Center. In fact, Muilenburg's quest for greater profits will involve fundamental changes in the way airplanes are built and painful sacrifices by its workers and suppliers. Automation plays a big role, with robots taking over some work from human employees in Boeing factories. Boeing has eliminated 6,000 jobs this year, reducing total employment to 154,000. Hamilton expects more layoffs, noting that Boeing had 107 employees per aircraft delivered last year, compared with 87 for Airbus. The Chicago-based manufacturer is squeezing suppliers for more savings, after imposing 15 percent price cuts in 2012. A spokesman declines to say how much Boeing hopes to save this time, emphasizing the company is working with suppliers “to help them reduce costs and improve productivity.” Muilenburg, considered more affable than his predecessor, will need plenty of charm to sell these changes. It's hard to inspire a workforce demoralized by job cuts. And suppliers have profit worries of their own. Landing gear supplier United Technologies balked at Boeing's earlier price cuts, and Rockwell Collins complained a few months ago when Boeing extended payment terms. Given these obstacles and other pressures on Boeing, Muilenburg's profit target seems far-fetched to some industry experts. “It's an enjoyable fantasy,” says Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. In discussing third-quarter results on Oct. 25, Muilenburg called his profit goal “realistic” but “challenging.” Either way, he has little choice but to slash costs as revenues flatten out. A long boom in commercial jet orders is ebbing, and Boeing's defense business faces reduced Pentagon spending. Airbus, meanwhile, is pursuing some of the same new production efficiencies Boeing is after. That's the race Muilenburg really must win. Boeing Co.

Sindhu Bhattacharya  Updated: Oct 28, 2016 16:48 IST #air india   #Airbust aircraft   #Airline   #Dreamliners   #fresh loans   #insurer   #LIC   #PSU banks   That ailing Air India needs to do something drastic to pare its huge debt pile of Rs 46,000 crore is a no-brainer. It is also obvious that the state-owned airline will turn to government entities to get a debt lifeline. Airline officials have indicated earlier that talks are on for converting about Rs 10,000 crore worth of existing debt taken from public sector banks into equity so that total annual interest outgo is reduced by a fourth. Now, it seems Air India is also separately seeking to raise fresh loan of another Rs 10,000 crore to fund future aircraft acquisitions. And for this fresh loan, it has sounded out state-owned LIC. Airline needs fresh loans since it still has to take deliveries of 6 Dreamliners (Boeing 787s) and 3 Boeing 777 aircraft till 2017-18 The first proposal of converting existing debt into equity could result in PSU banks owning about 40 percent of the airline’s equity and getting a say in decision making at the Airlines House in New Delhi. This by itself is a big deal, since this will bring in third party shareholders into an entity where the government has been the sole owner till now. And prevent any hair cut for the banks. But the second proposal is even more interesting since it raises two questions: Why fresh loans and why LIC? Well, the airline needs fresh loans since it still has to take deliveries of six Dreamliners (Boeing 787s) and three Boeing 777 aircraft till 2017-18, orders for which were placed during the earlier mega aircraft order of 68 Boeing and 33 Airbus aircraft. And Air India needs to raise funds for taking these deliveries. The only hitch is that as per an earlier clearance of the Union Cabinet, these aircraft were to be inducted under a sale and leaseback arrangement (where the airline does not actually own the aircraft) whereas LIC will agree to give fresh loans to Air India only if the order is an outright aircraft purchase. This means in case of a default by Air India, LIC can repossess aircraft – something it cannot do under a sale and leaseback arrangement. “We have flagged this condition by LIC in the meetings with the government. This fresh loan would not impair the balance sheet since aircraft, an asset, would also be coming in along with the loan. We are now seeking government approval for outright purchase of the nine aircraft which remain from the earlier order,” said an airline official. Why LIC? Well, since Air India’s request is backed by a government guarantee, the interest rate on this loan would come down to anywhere between 7-7.5 percent from the current norm of about 10 percent. It would be a rupee loan from LIC versus a dollar loan, which guarantees insulation to Air India from future currency fluctuations. Besides, the airline may also get a moratorium on repayment of principal for anywhere between three-five years since two government owned entities will be negotiating the deal and there will surely be some nudging by the government to LIC to be gentle with the Maharaja. The repayment period for this aircraft loan would also be longer – at twenty years against just 12 years for a similar loan from the US EXIM Bank, the official quoted earlier said. All of this seems positive for Air India. Whether it will benefit LIC too is another story though. According to this piece LIC’s own gross non-performing assets ratio has been worsening as it becomes the go-to institution for the government for reviving stalled projects and ends up with bad loans. Anyhow, Air India needs to expand fleet and it would be foolish for the airline to tap costly financers overseas when a ready purse is possibly available closer home. As per Air India’s current fleet plan, it would induct 22 aircraft in the current fiscal (including five A320s and nine ATRs), 38 in 2017-18, 19 the following year and 27 aircraft in 2019-20. So by 2019-20, the airline will have had inducted 106 new aircraft when it would also simultaneously be phasing out 21, to take net addition in its fleet to 85 by the turn of this decade. In the overall scheme of things, Air India needs to take drastic measures to tackle its total debt pile, something it has obviously realised. Reducing total debt would be crucial to the airline achieving its net profit target by FY18 and expanding the Rs 105 crore operational profit it reported for FY16 in the current fiscal. also see Govt sells 1.63% in L&T held through SUUTI, raises Rs 2,100 crore Ousting Cyrus Mistry from other cos won't be as easy as evicting him from Tata Sons Of new age authorised service stations.. Though it reduced its operational loss in the first six months of the current fiscal, Air India still has not been able to make an operational profit. The maiden operational profit in FY16 came for the first time in a decade and was also the first time after the two erstwhile airlines (Air India and Indian Airlines) merged to form the present entity. Air India was earlier targeting a 10-fold jump in operational profit this fiscal to about Rs 1,000 crore. So, in order to achieve its target of about Rs 1,000 crore operational profit in 2016-17, it must pull up its socks and hope for a significantly better operational performance in the remaining six months of the year till March 31, 2017.

The hump-backed behemoth got a boost Thursday, however, when UPS announced it has ordered 14 Boeing 747-8 cargo freighters and took an option for another 14. It’s the biggest order for the 747 since Lufthansa ordered 20 back in December 2006. Neither Boeing nor UPS disclosed terms of the sale. At list price, 14 747 freighters would cost $5.3 billion, although big customers routinely get discounts on planes. Boeing has delivered more than 1,500 747s since the first one went to Pan Am in 1970, but the number of 747s rolling off the assembly line has slowed to a crawl in recent years. It’s not just the 747; orders for a much newer four-engine plane, the Airbus A380, have also stalled. As the remaining 747s get older, airlines are retiring more of them. United Airlines recently announced that it would mothball its fleet of 747s by the end of 2018. Before the UPS announcement, Boeing had received only four new orders for the 747 this year — and one cancellation. The 747 accounted for less than 2 percent of commercial planes that Boeing has delivered since the start of 2015. As of Sept. 30, there were only 15 unfilled 747 orders out of a total Boeing backlog of 5,600 planes, mostly 737s. The planes will help UPS haul a growing load of air freight around the globe. UPS expects to take delivery of the first two in late 2017 and put them on international routes. It will shift older 747 models to shorter U.S. routes, where their poor fuel mileage will be less of a factor. Boeing said the 747-8 has 16 percent more room for cargo than the 747-400 freighter and creates 30 percent less noise around airports. It is the fourth generation of the venerable plane. Even if the 747 is nearing the end of the line, it has had a remarkable history. Its distinctive shape made the double-decker among the most iconic planes ever. It has carried millions of passengers around the globe, and its size and financial benefits helped make international air travel possible for the masses. The Air Force tested using a 747 equipped with lasers to shoot down ballistic missiles, but the program was scrapped. More successfully, Boeing modified the big plane to carry the NASA space shuttle piggyback style. And since 1990, 747s have served as Air Force One for presidents from George H.W. Bush to Barack Obama.

(Courtesy of Robocast.com/Handout via REUTERS) By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher, Reuters Oct 29, 2016 at 5:11 pm | Print View CHICAGO — Investigators were scouring Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Saturday after an engine caught fire on an American Airlines plane attempting to take off on Friday, as a source said a detached engine part had hit a nearby building, something the design should have prevented. No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which crippled a Boeing 767 with 161 passengers and nine crew members aboard as it was departing for Miami and briefly closed all O’Hare’s runways. The failure was so intense that a disk from the engine hit a building roof, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jet engines are designed to keep parts within the outer cover as escaped shrapnel can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such “uncontained” failures therefore are extremely rare and National Transportation Safety Board officials were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine, with maintenance or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6 introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. The NTSB said it planned to release more details at a news conference later on Saturday at O’Hare. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O’Hare assisting in the investigation, GE’s Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different widebody jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of “industry-leading levels of reliability,” Kennedy said. The O’Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international non-profit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The “rupture of the high pressure turbine stage 1 disk” was traced partly to inadequate GE design of the disk and poor FAA oversight of inspections, according to the summary. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed life span of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.

In the world of technology, the present time might well be labeled the Age of Drones. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or UAVs, or just drones, have taken over much of the dangerous, difficult, or just plain tedious work that used to be done by human pilots. This development has given rise to much speculation about the role of humans in the cockpit, some people wondering whether they will still be needed at all. Now that same phenomenon is invading the vast, undersea world that once was the exclusive domain of the submarine. Autonomous Undersea Vehicles, or AUVs are growing in capability and sophistication, doing dangerous, difficult, and tedious work that submariners have long performed. The Association of Naval Aviation (ANA) is fortunate to have one of the leading authorities in this field agree to speak at the ANA luncheon on Thursday, Nov. 10. The event will being at 11:30 a.m. at Elks Lodge #1952, 11551 Trask Ave. in Garden Grove. Reservations are required. Please call 562-287-4846, no later than noon on Tuesday November 8. Cost is $15 including buffet lunch. Luncheon speaker Fred Sheldon, a program manager at the Boeing Defense, Space & Security Division, has prepared a fascinating presentation, revealing some of the amazing developments in this very special area of new technology. He is program manager for Advanced Technology Programs, a business area within Boeing that develops maritime acoustics and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions as well as autonomous undersea vehicles. Fred Sheldon, at left, and Echo Ranger, one of Boeing’s autonomous large-diameter unmanned undersea vehicles. Courtesy photos. In his current role, Sheldon is responsible for the development and application of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUV) and projecting the future of AUV platforms and advanced applications in offshore oil and gas and environmental spaces. He has successfully led a diverse portfolio of mission developments and deployments for a variety of customers, including the U.S. Navy, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and commercial markets. His efforts include the very first demonstration of an AUV’s ability to launch and recover through the torpedo tubes of a submerged submarine. Previous assignments include program manager for Quicksilver/Phoenix, a $31 million development and operations maintenance contract; systems engineering integration and test manager for the AN/BLQ-11 Long Term Mine Reconnaissance (LMRS) program; systems engineer and lead test director for LMRS and systems engineering lead for the Naval and Electronic Navigation – Fiber-Optic Gyro Navigation program, where he supported the development and analysis of system mechanization. Sheldon holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Humboldt State University.

McCANN and JOAN LOWY, The Associated Press Published: October 29, 2016, 12:20 am Updated: October 29, 2016, 8:40 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) CHICAGO (AP) — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on a runway at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C. Associated Press writers Michael Tarm and Caryn Rousseau in Chicago also contributed to this report.

McCANN and JOAN LOWY, The Associated Press Published: October 29, 2016, 12:22 am Updated: October 30, 2016, 3:12 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) CHICAGO (AP) — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on a runway at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C.

Photo: AP Dallas/New York: Boeing Co. received a lifeline for its sales-challenged 747 jumbo jet when United Parcel Service Inc. agreed to buy at least 14 freighter versions. The company has warned that the programme could be at risk and halved production this year, to six annually. One bright spot for the 747-8, the newest and largest version, is the US Air Force, which chose it to transport America’s commander-in-chief. The president currently travels aboard two heavily modified Boeing 747-200 aircraft, which are military jets with the designation VC-25. However, when the president steps aboard, the call sign changes to Air Force One. While the Pentagon plans to replace those planes with two of the newer version in 2024, what many may not know is that the US is hardly the only country to make the famous plane the transport of choice for its head of state. Here are seven other countries with their own version of Air Force One. Brunei: The sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, is one of the world’s wealthiest people and passionate about both cars and airplanes. Among the royal fleet, the sultan has a 747-400 and often flies it himself, a fact noted by President Barack Obama during a 2013 state visit. China: China’s president typically travels abroad on a Boeing 747-400, one that has been converted from commercial use. Most of the 747s are flown by Air China. In 2002, that country reportedly found more than two dozen listening devices aboard a government-owned 767 that had been sent to a refurbishment center in San Antonio, Tex. The plane had been planned as a presidential transport but was converted to commercial use. India : When they travel abroad, India’s prime minister and president fly an Air India 747-400 operated by the Indian Air Force. When either is aboard, the call sign is Air India One. The government plans to replace the 747 for transporting heads of state with two Boeing 777-300ERs, acquired from Air India, dedicated full-time to VIP transport. Japan: The Japan Air Self-Defense Force has two Boeing 747-400s that fly in tandem to transport the prime minister, emperor, and other high-ranking government officials. When airborne, the planes’ call signs are Air Force One and Air Force Two. Japan is replacing the 747s with new Boeing 777-300ERs in 2019, after 28 years with the 747s. Saudi Arabia: The kingdom operates four 747s, including the SP (special performance) version, which was built until 1989. The 747SP is the shortest version of the 747, and the reduced weight afforded a longer range for its era, more than 7,000 nautical miles. Yemen: A Yemen Airways 747SP used by the government was destroyed by fire following a gun battle at the airport in Aden in March 2015. War-racked Yemen replaced it with a Boeing 757. The Republic of Korea has a 747-400 for presidential travel. The royal families of the Emirates fly aboard several 747s, including the latest 747-8. The first orders date to 1989.

The Swiss airline said it had previously ordered nine 777s and taken delivery of six this year as it continues to establish the 777-300ER as its flagship. The company said the 777-300ER will be the backbone of its long-haul fleet, increasing frequency to intercontinental markets.

Among the weapons scrapped were Boeing’s ground-based vehicle network for the Army, a Northrop Grumman mini-submarine for Navy SEALs and a chopper from Textron’s Bell Helicopter unit. The tally published this week is the latest edition of a yearly report measuring the effectiveness of the process for spending billions of dollars annually to develop and build new weapons and outlining improvements. The updated list of canceled projects represents 17 percent of the 136 major weapons in advanced development for which the military had set cost, schedule and performance milestones from 1997 to 2015. The individual cancellations all had been announced previously. The most recent was the Navy’s decision this year to kill Lockheed Martin’s underwater drone, which was supposed to hunt down mines for the service’s Littoral Combat Ship. It was scrapped as unreliable even after the Navy spent $700 million, 44 percent more than its original development budget, according to the report. Before that, the most recent cancellations were in 2012. The report directed by Frank Kendall, the Defense Department’s undersecretary for acquisition, said that reflects improvements in crafting requirements for weapon systems up front, more realistic assessments of costs before an initial contract is awarded and tighter financial incentives to control costs. Among the earlier cancellations was the Future Combat System developed jointly by Boeing and SAIC and canceled by Defense Secretary Robert Gates in April 2009. The FCS — a network of wireless, on-the-move communications, drones and sensors — accounted for 35 percent of the $58.3 billion. The RAH-66 Comanche helicopter, developed jointly by Boeing and Sikorsky and canceled by the Army in 2004, accounted for an additional 17 percent. The research and development costs of the canceled programs represent about 3.4 percent of the $1.7 trillion budgeted in those years for developing the 136 programs and an additional 25 active programs in preliminary development, Mark Wright, Kendall’s spokesman, said in an e-mail. “It is also worth noting that sometimes the results and insights from the sunk costs on canceled programs are used on other related programs,” Wright said. The $58.3 billion “isn’t much spread over a 20-year period,” Loren Thompson, a defense industry consultant at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Virginia, said in an e-mail. “Program cancellations arise from many causes, including changing threats and the appearance of new technologies. Also, programs sometimes get killed because rigorous testing reveals unexpected flaws.” The $58.3 billion “is still a lot,” said Mark Cancian, a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former examiner of weapons costs for the Office of Management and Budget. Asked if a 17 percent cancellation rate indicated a poorly functioning Pentagon acquisition system, Cancian said, “Yes and no. Several programs went ahead with unready technologies,” with the Future Combat System “being the most egregious.” “But decision-makers knew they were accepting risk and not following best practices,” he said. “There’s not much a system improvement can do in that case. We know what best practices are, we just don’t always follow them.” The system that most exceeded its original research budget estimates before cancellation was an Army radio for ground combat. Boeing was developing the Joint Tactical Radio System’s Ground Mobile Radios as part of a team that also included Northrop Grumman, Rockwell Collins, BAE Systems and Harris. Kendall cited excessive unit-cost increases when he canceled the program in late 2011 — after $1.8 billion was spent, exceeding its original research budget by 65 percent. Northrop’s mini-sub to carry Navy SEALs from a mother ship was canceled in 2005. It was at least six years late and $600 million had been spent, exceeding its original development budget by 5 percent. The Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter from Bell was axed in 2008 after $600 million was spent, or about 40 percent over its original research and development budget.

Known as V-22 Aerial Refuelling System (VARS), the system will utilize Cobham’s existing FR300 Hose Drum Unit with some modifications. The roll-on/roll-off kit will enable the Marines to use their land and carrier-based MV-22B aircraft to refuel F-35B Lightning II and F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, thereby extending their operational range and loiter times. Design and production of VARS will occur at the Cobham Mission Systems facility in Davenport, Iowa with deliveries expected to commence in 2018. Kevin McKeown, Vice President and General Manager of Cobham Mission Systems, said, “With VARS we continue the tradition of providing industry leading aerial Refuelling capability to war fighters. This program will enable the Marines to extend the flying range of their fighter aircraft and allow for efficient shipboard operations.” U.S. Marine Corps Bell Boeing MV-22 Osprey Aerial Display @ Farnborough 2012 See more: HD Videos and Podcasts.

Source: USAF Cost was the deciding factor in the US Air Force's (USAF's) decision to award Northrop Grumman a development contract for the B-21 Raider bomber aircraft, a USAF acquisition official confirmed on 26 October. Both Northrop Grumman's and Boeing's bids for the work met technical requirements, Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch said during a conference sponsored by the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). "If we weren't comfortable that technically it could be done then we would have done something different," the general said. "But we felt comfortable with the technical approach of both, that they could both do it; then it comes down to the cost." He was referring to information in a new Government Accountability Office (GAO) bomber protest decision report released on 25 October. According to the GAO document, Northrop Grumman's offering came in at a lower total weighted cost and total estimated cost. "We set it up to make sure that they could meet the technical requirements, and if they could all meet the technical requirements, then we would look at the cost," Lt Gen Bunch explained. Further, the air force budgeted to an independent cost estimate rather than to a contract value for the bomber programme, he said, because Congress directed the service to fund to an independent cost estimate and then to try to beat it. Boeing, in its protest, alleged that Northrop Grumman could offer a lower bid because the latter used "unrealistically low labour rates" for inadequately skilled workers. However, the GAO wrote that it saw no evidence that the USAF had failed to account for technical risk, which use of such labour would imply. Want to read more?

A second phase of development is now under way, and a third and final phase will be completed by 2018. Source: Boeing Cobham has been awarded a contract by Bell Boeing to develop a palletised aerial refuelling system to give the US Marine Corps' (USMC's) Bell Boeing MV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft in-flight aerial refuelling capability, the company announced on 25 October. The V-22 Aerial Refueling System (VARS) will use a modified version of Cobham's FR300 Hose Drum Unit. The roll-on/roll-off kit will allow the marines to use their Ospreys to refuel their combat aircraft. "We have been involved with the project since 2013," Asif Ahmed, business development manager at Cobham Mission Systems, told IHS Jane's on 27 October. The first phase of the work involved trade studies, which are now being used to implement a defined set of Marine Corps requirements through initial operational capability. A final phase of work will take the system to full operational capability sometime in 2018, Ahmed explained. The first version of the FR300 Hose Drum Unit was designed in the 1960s, and there are now about 450 units in use worldwide, according to Ahmed. The Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules is the platform in which the system is most used. Modifications needed for use in the V-22 include changes that will allow for the aircraft's ramp door to open and close while the hose is simultaneously extended and retracted in multiple positions, as well as unique electrical alterations that allow it to operate during both rotary- and fixed-wing modes. Still, Ahmed said "the bulk of system does not change", so the modification cost is expected to be low. Want to read more?

It was October 13, 2006. I was stuck in a coaching centre, waiting for inevitable doom as a math quiz was about to take place. Just a couple of minutes before the exam, one of the clerks came to the class room and called my name. “Apurba Jahangir, your father is here to pick you up.” As I was relieved to skip the exam, curiosity also rose within; I thought this must be a family emergency. Coming down the stairs, I saw my father, talking on his cell phone. He directed me to follow him. Walking through the chaos of Moghbazar, we reached our car. “What happened?” I curiously asked my mother, who was already seated inside. She answered, “Your Babuji (what we call our paternal uncle) just won the Nobel Peace Prize!” On December 10, the Nobel Committee was to give the prize to Dr Muhammad Yunus and we got to know that we all were invited to attend the ceremony. This was news we, especially us cousins, were not expecting! I mean sure, your uncle wining the Peace Prize is one thing, but to be able to witness it live was a completely different thing to experience.  On December 8— the day of our flight, we reached the airport around ten in the morning.The trip wasn't just in Oslo, Norway, but also included London and Paris. We were eighty people traveling, included the family of Dr Yunus, the Grameen Bank family and Nritayanchal, a dance troupe which was to perform at the ceremony. After waiting for two hours in the lounge, we were called to board the flight. Little did we know that the runway had in store yet another surprise – a Boeing 737 of Hamburg International Airline was sent for our services. This Boeing was our ride for the next couple of days of our trip and was also witness to the ultimate Bengali 'picnic' – half an hour after take off we could hear a Dhol like sound from the back of the plane alongside the words 'Sadher Lau'. My cousin Raad and I turned around and saw half of Nrityanchal and the Grameen team dancing to 'Lau dia banailam dug dugi'. A few minutes later, most of us joined in and after that, in came the captain! The weight of passengers had increased so much at the back of the plane that it was out of balance! We were soon given instructions to remain in our designated seats. We reached Oslo after fourteen hours and were escorted to our hotel, The Radisson Blu. It amazes me now to think how Raad and I were declared room mates for the entire trip. You can guess how two twelve year olds felt having a whole room to their selves. The next day, after a generous breakfast, we were given a city tour of Oslo. This included the Ski museum and the Vikings Ship Museum among other places. The areas of Oslo were covered with a shade of blue that winter, I noticed, as our bus drove for the mountains. It was soon December 10, the moment we had all been waiting for. The ceremony was held at the Oslo City Hall and as we arrived we saw journalists from all over the world, standing beside the red carpet. This was the first time the ceremony witnessed a delegation as big as ours. The hall was filled with people wearing Grameen Check panjabis and vests. We soon witnessed Dr Yunus and Taslima Begum (who received the prize on behalf of Grameen bank) arriving in a limousine. I still remember the speech Babuji gave that day; it was the first time the famous line “Bringing poverty to museums” was uttered.  Oslo also gave us the famous Nobel Peace Prize Concert. Artists such as Rihanna, Lionel Richie performed, while Sharon Stone and Angelica Huston mesmerised hosted the event, mesmerizing us all. On December 12, as we reached London, the second part of the trip began. London gave us a place to shop, eat and a city tour. The last stop was Paris, where an interesting event took place. We were supposed to be at the President's house for a photo session and schedule was pretty tight. Due to unavoidable circumstances, I missed the bus which left a few minutes before I got out of the hotel. As the bus was escorted by the police, there was no going back. Lamiya Morshed (our dear Lamiya apu) came to the rescue. She also missed the bus and we soon caught a taxi to go meet the president. Jacques Chirac, who was the then President of France, greeted us at the hall and unfortunately had to wait for us a couple of minutes—a kind of thing to boast about a little, don't you think? Ten years have passed since the Nobel Peace Prize, yet the memories are still fresh. Dancer Rachel Perris was in our office the other day who was also a member of the dance troupe. We started reminiscing about the dinner cruise in Seine River, the out-of-balance plane and all the fun we had. After all these years, we all have been busy with our lives, but those ten days in Oslo, London and Paris remain a special memory we can share forever.

It’s too early to conclude how the engine failed, senior investigator Lorenda Ward said Saturday at a news conference in Chicago. A disc in a high-pressure turbine failed, and a piece of it was found 2,920 feet (890 meters) away at a United Parcel Service Inc. warehouse, Ward said. The American Airlines jetliner at O’Hare International Airport on Oct. 28. Photographer: Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune via AP Twenty people were taken to hospitals for treatment of minor injuries ranging from bruises to hurt ankles, Juan Hernandez, district chief of emergency medical services for the Chicago Fire Department, said Friday at a news conference. American said seven travelers and one flight attendant were injured. Passengers escaped the plane on slides as the fire sent columns of thick black smoke into the air. The Boeing Co. 767 had an engine malfunction just before the fire, said Leslie Scott, a spokeswoman for American. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration initially said the fire occurred after a tire burst and later issued a statement saying it happened “after experiencing a problem during takeoff.” In an uncontained failure, debris escapes the hardened engine casing and can damage or penetrate the wings or fuselage, amplifying the risk to the aircraft far beyond the loss of thrust. A Southwest Airlines Co. jet was caught in a similar accident just two months ago in Florida. “There was a huge explosion on the right-hand side of the airplane,” passenger Hector Cardenas told the ABC television affiliate in Chicago. “Everyone was sort of panicking.” Charred Wing Cardenas said the plane was about to take off when the explosion occurred. The last ground speed was recorded at 115 knots, or 132 miles an hour, Flightradar24 posted on Twitter. The fire blackened one side of the plane, and pictures appeared to show the charred wing on that side drooping toward the ground. The plane was carrying about 43,000 pounds of fuel and there was “a substantial fuel leak,” Timothy Sampey, Chicago’s assistant deputy fire commissioner for airport operations, said at the news conference. “There was a heavy volume of fire on the engine and all the way to the wing tip.” “This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later,” Sampey said. Incident Investigation The pilots aborted the takeoff, said the FAA, which will investigate. Flight 383, headed for Miami, carried 161 passengers and nine crew members. One potential cause of jet engine explosions is a foreign object that gets sucked in, said Bill Waldock, a professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, comparing the power plant to a vacuum cleaner. Issues inside the engine have also led to explosions, said Waldock, who was speaking generally and didn’t have specific details about the Chicago incident. Explosions can send shrapnel across the plane and rupture fuel tanks and fuel lines, he said. In the case of a Boeing 767 or Boeing 777, much of the fuel actually is stored in the wing in what’s called an integral fuel tank, or “wet wing,” Waldock said.

American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren't replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it's like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung F 12,04 -0,02 (The Lincoln Navigator concept, unveiled in 2016.AP) Kumar Galhotra is what you might call the right man for the job, and the job happens to be one of the toughest in the entire auto industry. Galhotra runs Lincoln, Ford’s luxury brand. Since roughly 2013, the brand has been attempting to stage a comeback, with billions in funding from the mothership in Dearborn, Michigan. Born in India, Galhotra — who has a degree in engineering from the University of Michigan — came to Ford in 1988 and rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the vice president who oversaw how all Ford and Lincoln vehicles were screwed together. In 2014, Ford CEO Mark Fields tapped him to take on the Lincoln challenge, promoting him to president of the marque. Founded in 1917 by Henry Leland, one of the most successful automotive entrepreneurs of the early 20th century, Lincoln was a magnificent American brand for almost its entire history. Leland had also started Cadillac, selling it to General Motors in 1902 for the then vast sum of $4.5 million. Premium cars were Leland's specialty, along with a Roaring Twenties version of mergers and acquisitions: Lincoln went to Ford in 1922. In the mid-1950s, when the US auto industry was at its postwar apex, Lincoln created the iconic Continental. The 1961 Continental is one of the most famous cars ever designed, distinguished by its rear suicide doors and its sober avoidance of flash. It was as close a big four-door could come to being a perfectly tailored tuxedo. It announced itself with reserve. The ’61 Continental was powerful, but there was almost no point in driving it fast. It wanted to cruise along in an aura of serene self-confidence. Enter the Navigator (The mighty Navigator SUV.Lincoln) In the late '90s, Lincoln gave birth to its first large luxury SUV, the Navigator. That massive vehicle capitalized on the SUV boom of the 1990s and early 2000s, when gas prices fell in defiance of earlier predictions that Middle East oil supplies would dry up, spawning a permanent gas crisis that would make the crunches of the 1970s look tame by comparison. The Continental had been associated with the national well-being of the Kennedy years, and in many respects the Navigator was the Continental of the Clinton administration. It brought a new level of finish to the large yet utilitarian SUVs that Ford had considerable expertise in building. Customers who never would have looked twice at the Expedition snapped up Navigators, which were marketed using jazzy TV commercials and smoothly urbane imagery that profitably overrode any hesitation over the sheer size of the vehicle, one of the biggest on the road. Lincoln was selling a quarter of a million cars and SUVs annually in the late '90s, but that would turn out to be a peak for the brand, which then fell into a seemingly terminal decline. For one, gas prices began rising again in the mid-2000s, and the bottom fell out of the SUV market. A wave of hybrids took the US market by storm, led by the Toyota Prius. The Prius won the 2000s, while gas-guzzling hulks like the Navigator lost. By the time gas prices in California hit almost $5 a gallon in 2009, it was widely assumed that luxury SUVs like the Navigator and Cadillac’s Escalade were woolly mammoths headed for extinction. The market shift was a disaster for the Lincoln brand, which couldn’t compete with the German luxury triumvirate of Mercedes, BMW, and Audi. (Kumar Galhotra, the man with the plan.Ford) Lincoln wasn’t matching up against the Japanese, either: Lexus, Acura, and Infiniti were hanging with the Germans. Lexus was a first choice with many buyers, and seemed to have figured out how to beat the Germans at their own game. Acura and Infiniti were “second-tier” luxury brands, but even the seconds were stronger than Lincoln, which was barely on anyone’s radar. Cadillac, meanwhile, had set about reinventing itself with a new radically angular, Stealth-fighter-inspired art-and-science design vocabulary, which endeared the brand to customers who wanted something more aggressive than what BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus were selling. Caddy wasn’t moving a lot of product but its cars stood out. Identity crisis By the time the 2008 financial crisis hit, Lincoln had almost no brand identity left. The austerely sexy Continentals of the 1960s were a distant memory; the nameplate left the lineup in 2002, but by then the JFK associations had been replaced by the impression that Continentals were driven by livery-cab guys in New York City and hadn’t had a whiff of the country club in decades. A certain retro vibe had kept Lincoln afloat — barely. It was the brand of some aging hipsters and Hollywood coolios, making an appearance in the opening credits for the HBO bromantic series “Entourage” and oozing Rat Pack authenticity, particularly for the convertible versions. (A 1961 Lincoln Continental.Lincoln) But the reality of the brand was that its most important vehicle was out of favor and its sedans were both unexciting and beset with an aging customer base. The cars were perfectly competent, but unlike BMW’s or Mercedes’ sport sedans, Lincolns were throwback freeway cruisers, rebadged versions of Ford’s mass-market sedans. They came in various trim levels, to satisfy customers who might want a slightly peppier ride, but Lincoln had nothing like the high-performance M Sport or AMG divisions that amped up the cars sold by BMW and Mercedes, respectively. Even Cadillac had a “V” designation for its high-performance division and was taking its cars to the legendary Nürburgring racetrack in Germany to vindicate their speed and handling. For all practical purposes, Lincoln had been left behind by this league when the Navigator ceased to carry the weight of the brand. By 2010, Lincoln was seen as competing with Buick, GM’s “near luxury” marque. To top it all off, Ford was lagging behind GM, Toyota, VW, and the main German luxury brands in China, widely considered to be the world’s second most important market for autos, after the US. (Europe in the aggregate is larger than the US, but also fragmented, with some countries providing better customer bases than others; growth in Europe has also been relatively flat over the past decade and half, leading Ford and others to make ill-advised forays into the Russian market.) Bolstering the Ford brand in China was critical for the carmaker, but it couldn’t afford to be a bit player in the exceptionally profitable luxury space. Why Lincoln? In 2016, Mark Fields dropped by Business Insider for an interview and explained the luxury stakes for Lincoln. In the US alone, he said, luxury can make up 13% of the entire industry and upwards of 9% worldwide. “But is represents over a third of the profits,” he added. (Ford CEO Mark Fields.Reuters) That’s a datapoint that’s impossible to ignore. If Ford let Lincoln go, it would become the only major global carmaker without a luxury brand, because it had shed its premium portfolio as part of then-CEO Alan Mulally’s pre-financial crisis home-improvement plan. Some global automakers are of course luxury brands first — BMW, Mercedes — and some like Ferrari, after its 2015 IPO, are independent. But Ford’s competition — GM, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and even Hyundai and Kia — all maintain luxury marques in their stables. Lincoln was going through its roughest patch ever. But without it, Ford could be giving up billions in revenue and profits. By 2010, after the worst of the financial crisis had passed, Ford was stuck with a tough call: Fix Lincoln? Or let the brand go? The Mercury brand was rolled up in 2011, leaving Ford with nothing to take into battle against Buick. If Lincoln went away as well, the core Ford brand would be all that remained. Mulally wanted to put Lincoln out of its misery, and many auto-industry commentators leaned that way as well. He had already released Ford from the responsibility of managing its portfolio of foreign luxury brands: Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, and Aston Martin. In doing so he was following a playbook written by none other than Mark Fields, head of Ford’s North American business. Fields oversaw the all-important US market and had developed a plan to streamline Ford and force it into more reliable profitability. Fields titled his plan the “Way Forward,” and he thought it might get him the nod as CEO. But the Ford board of directors went for Mulally, leaving Fields in an awkward position: watch as someone else took over his master vision, or become a willing and loyal colonel in the new general’s army. Fields chose what was best for Ford, not Fields, and went on to become an executive who was ideally positioned to both vacuum up everything he could learn from Mulally and work on convincing the former Boeing man what he thought was really right for a global car company. (Mullaly had come to Ford in an unexpected move from the planemaker before the 2008 financial crisis hit.) Keeping Lincoln was one of those things that Fields thought was right. The brand has him to thank for its existence. Comeback And so there was Galhotra in March 2016, standing on a rotating dais at a cool event space in Manhattan’s West Chelsea art-gallery district to introduce Lincoln’s newest lineup. The cars drove out from behind a scrim, up a ramp, and onto the dais, accompanied by a few quick licks from a jazz combo. It was pure auto-industry theater, presented to journalists eating a three-course dinner — some of the same journalists who might have been calling for Lincoln’s demise a few years earlier. Galhotra was at ease in the role of Lincoln’s impresario, more so than he had been a year earlier, when at the 2015 New York Auto Show the carmaker had nabbed useful attention by revealing its Continental concept car. Galhotra seemed slightly less confident then in Lincoln’s new tagline, “quiet luxury,” and the brand’s capacity to embody the suave reserve of that message. He had come across as someone still practicing the message, although he certainly looked the part: trim, in tailored suits and a small Lincoln badge pin in his lapel, and speaking in impeccable, complete sentences. (The Continental concept in 2015.Newspress) But the 2015 Continental concept was, no question, something. It was blue — very blue — inside and out. It was also big. Lincoln had brought what was effectively a limo to New York, to fulfill the demand that the brand bring back its most famous nameplate and signal that it was ready to move aggressively into the China market, where affluent car owners don’t drive but are driven. For Galhotra, it must have been a difficult car to stand next to and talk up the virtues of quiet luxury. So far the new Continental — and the new Lincoln — had conveyed anything but quiet. For one thing, a group of television spots for Lincoln, meant to showcase the carmaker's compact crossover, the MKC, had gone massively viral. They starred Matthew McConaughey, fresh off his stint on HBO’s “True Detective” series and just before he won a best actor Oscar for his performance in "Dallas Buyers Club." Directed by the legendary indie-film auteur Gus Van Sant, the spots featured a trippy stream-of-consciousness voiceover by McConaughey, blending the gauzy existential musings of his “True Detective” character with borderline hallucinogenic meditations on the nature of moving forward and backward in time. Strange soliloquies of revival. It didn’t seem to matter whether or not, strictly speaking, they made sense. Parodies were swiftly created by Ellen DeGeneres and “Saturday Night Live,” massively intensifying the spot’s coolness credibility and almost overnight transforming McConaughey into one of the most influential celebrity pitchmen for a car company. These new Lincoln commercials had a subtle power in spite of their pretense. They demonstrated, almost subliminally, that quiet luxury was a preoccupation of the contemporary thinking person. And they memorably served up the idea that Lincoln was on the road to someplace different, even if initially, as Galhotra seemed to know, the destination wasn’t entirely certain. (Matthew McConaughey got behind the wheel of a Lincoln for some memorable ads.Lincoln Media) The actor and the role A year after the Continental debut, Galhotra was fully inhabiting his role, preparing to unveil Lincoln’s second show-stealing concept at the 2016 New York Auto Show: the new Navigator. The Continental had been spectacular, but the Navigator was over the top, with its pair of massive gullwing doors swung up, concertina steps unfolded, and an interior inspired by luxury yachts, complete with nautical teak details. The old Navigator was large and in charge, one of the most impressive vehicles on the road. But the fact was that the SUV had become somewhat undermined in its premium identity by its association with car services. It was the SUV you rode in to the airport, not the SUV you parked in front of your vacation house. The immense form of the Navigator was retained in the revised model, but this one was quite literally a land yacht. Galhotra was more than up to the task of standing next to it when its turn to roll up onto the dais arrived, right after the production version of the Continental had left the stage. I’d met with Galhotra earlier in the day, for a mellow preview of the Navigator. He was tie-less, sitting with his lead engineer and Lincoln’s designer, David Woodhouse. The wary executive I’d encountered a year earlier, clearly feeling the pressure of a job he’d been in for only a few months, had been transformed into an almost Zen-like raconteur, a man whose neat gray hair cast him as a distinguished leader who didn’t need to seek the spotlight. The spotlight sought him. In 2015, his chief competition had been Johan de Nysschen, the South Africa-born president of Cadillac, which had just moved its sales and marketing operations to New York City to merge GM’s own top brand with the world of global luxury. De Nysschen is a tall, booming guy, a lordly towering strategist who reminds one of the men who built the airline business in the '50s and '60s, like Pan Am’s Juan Trippe. He gives the impression that he’s always working, and with his two-tone Breitling watch and clipped mustache, it seems as though he was built to lead Cadillac into battle against BMW and Mercedes. I interviewed him at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show, in a massive Cadillac booth outfitted with an ersatz office suite that replicated his space in Manhattan. As I watched him stand up from behind his desk, rising from an ever-present sheaf of work, it reminded me that some executives need a gigantic office simply to suit the scale of their expectations. Galhotra is more low-key. He doesn’t exactly speak quietly, but he doesn’t raise his voice, either. Instead, he gradually increases the amplification, depending on the occasion, like a musician slowly upping the volume as a composition heads for its crescendo. De Nysschen is a robust-handshake type, but Galhotra is firm and lingering, drawing you in. He knows the trick of speaking just softly enough to compel you to stand closer, without ever losing a word. He’s like a diplomat, the ambassador from a country called “Lincoln.” He can loosen up a bit, lose the necktie — even though it doesn’t look entirely right — but it’s hard to picture him wearing anything besides a slim, European-cut suit that nevertheless evokes the Detroit of the 1960s. He specializes in sly smiles, while De Nysschen relies on hearty guffaws. If you worked for either man, you wouldn’t want them mad at you, but they’d express their displeasure in diametrically opposed ways. (An amazing follow-up to the Continental: the Navigator concept.Ford) Catching up with Cadillac By early 2016, Galhotra had no meaningful displeasure to express. The Lincoln revival was in full swing, and the automaker was picking up the pace in China. Sales lagged Cadillac by roughly seven to one, but as one of GM’s key China brands (along with Buick), Cadillac had a substantial head start. On balance, Lincoln was making up ground in a hurry, and it had an almost perfect mix of vehicles, unlike Caddy, which in the US was still trying to take it to BMW 3- and 5-Series sedans. In 2015, when Lincoln was breaking out the Continental “quiet luxury” concept, Cadillac had hosted a party of epic scale at a pier in Brooklyn to introduce its CT6 sedan. It was the most extravagant auto-show shindig I’d ever attended. The flower arrangements were as big as the car, and the attendees were representative of the art-and-fashion crowd that Cadillac wanted to associate with the brand. R&B artist Raphael Saadiq provided the entertainment. And there was a distinct absence of the usual bearded middle-aged auto-journalist set. Instead, chic scenesters ruled the bars and gourmet-food lines. It was more like an elite music festival in Monaco. (Cadillac's Johan de Nysschen.David McNew/Getty Images) The BMW fight was an old one — Cadillac had the Bavarians in its sights for decades, trying to prove to customers that Caddys weren’t grandpa cruisers and pimpmobiles. The brand worked hard to shake off its soft, chrome-laden aura of the 1970s for some bold 0-60 mph times and eye-watering engine specs. Cadillacs were even taking it to the racetrack, competing in a sports car class. But as De Nysschen said during our interview, the portfolio was off. He needed crossovers, and although the Cadillac XT5 arrived in 2016, Lincoln had more of these versatile vehicles to sell, at a time when sedan sales were tanking. This was a substantial positive for Lincoln in China, where the market was shaping up to look at lot like it did in the US — just bigger. In 2016, 17.5 million new cars and truck sales in the US was a record, but the China market was already doing 20 million by then, with some very bullish analysts predicted that it could climb as high as 40 million as the vast population began to mirror the rest of the world’s percentages for car ownership. So Galhotra's task was twofold: Revive the Lincoln brand in the US and establish it in China. By 2016, the objectives were in place and the execution phase was underway. The plan called for dozens of new dealerships and a clear canting of Continental and Navigator toward limo duty. The impressive thing about many of the interior features of both vehicles, at the concept stage, was that most would make it to the production versions. There is a difference between the way American and Chinese see large sedans and SUVs. Americans drive themselves. When it comes to big sedans, they want horsepower, comfort, and legroom, but they don’t much care if the back seat emulates their living rooms. On the SUV side, the want all the same, but more, with utility thrown in: room for pets and gear and the ability to facilitate an outdoorsy lifestyle. The Navigator concept may have looked like the sort of thing that Beyoncé would saunter out of in a music video, but Galhotra emphasized that the truck has impressive towing capacity, a land yacht that could tow one intended for the water. Chinese customers haven’t yet crossed that recreational Rubicon — the wealthy rural gentlemen who likes his Navigator because of its style and its ability to transport his horses to dressage competitions hasn’t yet found his counterpart in the Middle Kingdom. Galhotra had every reason to believe that he eventually would, however. That’s why he insisted on the Navigator’s ongoing importance for the brand. Strategically, Lincoln needs a big SUV to go along with the full-size Continental sedan to be fully competitive in the Chinese luxury market. (The Continental in production trim.Hollis Johnson) Getting it right in China Getting the product mix and features right in China is just part of the battle. Unlike GM with Buick, Lincoln is a new arrival in the Chinese market for Ford. There are advantages with this: Lincoln has a blank slate in the country. Luxury-car buyers don’t know the brand, and so Lincoln is free of its stodgy American associations. On the other hand, the Chinese luxury market has been treated as a gold rush by Western carmakers. Lincoln, a near-luxury brand in the US, is billing itself as a true luxury brand in China, taking on the most well-known and established marques in the world, all while lacking Buick’s history. As dowdy as Buick had seemed as a brand before the financial crisis, an “old person's’” car in reputation with a 65-plus ownership base to boot, this was still the car that China’s last emperor, Henry Pu Yi, had owned during his reign from the early 20th century until just before the end of World War I. The brand carries immense weight in China to this day; it punches well above its weight. So the challenge for Lincoln, which lacks Buick’s roots and BMW’s global name recognition, is daunting, but many aspects of Lincoln’s new brand makeup will allow it to ease more seamlessly into the Chinese market than carmakers that have organized their identities around high-performance. High-performance means big engines, for the most part, and big engines are a problem in China. There’s room for 500-plus-horsepower sport sedans, but the bulk of engines produced in the country must be smaller in displacement. Lincoln’s V6s fit better into this paradigm. Lincoln also isn’t marketing itself anywhere as the car for the demanding driver. The “theory,” so to speak, that supports the brand is about comfort, ease, and service — all values that Chinese buyers are looking for. Galhotra is always quick to point out that Lincoln’s customers have little to no interest in the technical specifications that thrill the gearhead readers of Motor Trend. For them, “performance” isn’t measured in 0-60 mph but rather in how smooth and powerful a car feels when accelerating up an on-ramp. And luxury isn’t necessarily measured in how glitzy their car is but rather in how the vehicle envelops driver and passengers and creates a respite from the stresses of everyday life. (Lincoln is playing catch-up in China.Ford) China is a Bizarro World for Western luxury brands in several other respects. For starters, the German carmakers — Mercedes, BMW, Audi — are considered the choice of older people and dreary business types. They’re cursed by decades of success in the luxury realm and serve as brands for younger Chinese buyers to react against. “Mercedes, BMW, even Audi, skew more towards businessmen,” a 26-year-old Chinese buyer, Ge Di, told Reuters in 2016. “The comfort level is a bit higher, but as a young person I care more about performance and design.” So if the luxury market is extremely codified and hierarchical in the US, with Mercedes, BMW, and Toyota’s Lexus at the top, Audi knocking at the door, and everyone else fighting for share in the tiers below, the Chinese luxury market is far more fluid and subject to the changing tastes of a younger population that wants to define itself against expectations. This all serves to give Lincoln plenty of hope in its newest competitive forum. You could easily say that Lincoln’s revival is undergirded by the considerations of the Chinese luxury market first and foremost. Not that it will be easy. Auto sales in China topped 21 million vehicles in 2015, but according to Bloomberg, only about 2 million of those sales are luxury cars and SUVs, versus 12% in the US. Most of the Chinese luxury market in 2016 was divvied up among the Germans, with Audi, BMW, and Mercedes accounting for 75% of annual sales, based on research from Bloomberg Intelligence. Cadillac and Volvo had a combined 4%, and Lincoln was beginning its ascent with a meager 1%. Of course it could be worse. Lincoln could have zero. Will it work? The story of Lincoln is one of the best to emerge in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It has everything: a rich and varied history, a certain amount of Frank and Dino cool mixed with a whiff of sexy Kennedy-era dissoluteness, a near-death experience, a tentative recovery that at first looked unpromising but that took off with the unexpected McConaughey commercials, and finally the suave, low-key sales pitch, a relaxing of muscles when everyone else is flexing. (Lincoln's new customer experience center in California.Lincoln) Ford has abundant confidence that this will work, but Lincoln has more than a mountain to climb. The luxury market in the US is crowded, and even though Lincoln has made admirable progress in reversing its fortunes, most consumers don’t consider it a true contemporary luxury brand, in the vein on its German and Japanese rivals. Lincoln benefits from nostalgia from a time in America before BMW and Mercedes arrived in force, when cars from Germany were considered “imports” and the Japanese hadn’t yet shown up with their small, plucky, fuel-efficient vehicles. Here and there, you had the odd Italian roadster and few Jaguars, Triumphs, MGs, and Aston Martins. Otherwise, as far as the eye could see, it was American iron laying claim to the new interstate highways and the fresh driveways of burgeoning suburban enclaves. A cupholder in 1965 was that space between your legs. More important were the Lincoln Continental’s legion of ashtrays. So the circle that Galhotra and Fields are struggling to square implies a daunting balancing act: preserve that peculiar Lincoln mystique without allowing the brand to be a throwback. The effort comes through every time Lincoln shows a new vehicle. The interior of the Navigator concept that landed in Detroit may resemble something from the sixties, but Lincoln’s designers and executives don’t want to hear you make that observation. They would prefer that the legacy of the brand be as quiet as its take on luxury. So far, so good It’s a fair bet that they’ll succeed. Having seen many leaders of automotive divisions at American car companies over the years, I’d be hard pressed to conjure up someone as ideally suited to his role as Galhotra. He sets a highly cosmopolitan tone for the brand, sacrificing just enough of the traditional car-guy vibe to win over the large number of buyers who find car guys exhausting, with their endless enthusing over the specs and stats and macho aspects of driving. Performance matters more in the luxury market, but not that much more. Galhotra's emphasis is on the Gestalt of his cars and trucks, they way they anticipate owner needs and create a welcoming and calming environment. The man is, by the way, an engineer’s engineer, so he can talk cylinder displacement and compression ratios and torque bands with the best of them. But in an echo of Cary Grant’s definition of a gentleman as someone who could play the bagpipes, but declined, Galhotra can do all that but chooses not to. The big question, of course, is whether Lincoln can achieve the most difficult feat in the auto industry: “conquesting” the loyal customers of less retro brands. As lovely as the Continental is, it doesn’t have an owner base (unless you count the hipsters who are still maintaining a vintage example). Lincoln is starting from scratch, pitching the big sedan at customers who might lean reflexively in the direction of Lexus. By early 2016, the process was moving along nicely. Lincoln’s sales were advancing at an impressive double-digit pace, propelled by the crossovers in the portfolio — the right cars at the right time. The executive team was clearly clicking, and Mark Fields took the occasion of the New York Auto Show to unleash a C-suite Lincoln-palooza, making the brand and its revival one of his central talking points, alongside Ford’s other major initiative, the transformation of the company from a maker of cars to a provider of mobility in all its forms. By the time the New York show rolled around in March 2016, Ford had become an automaker standing on four pillars. The core brand, symbolized by the full-size pickups and Mustang, was strong, a vindication of Mulally’s vision. Ford’s new performance division was taking its GT supercar racing, making sure that the halo car was proving itself on the track. (It would make history with an epic win in its class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a near-repeat of Ford's legendary 1-2-3 victory in 1966.) A host of transformational programs were also being inculcated, and Ford would boast in early 2016 of having the largest fleet of self-driving cars under testing in the industry. Finally, Lincoln was back in the game. As much as the recovery of the core Ford brand had shown that Mulally was a magician, the Lincoln comeback indicated that Fields could make calls that were risky but right. Perhaps the most important aspect of this complete reinvigoration of Ford and its brands was that the company could shift its rhetoric from that of a slightly shell-shocked but foresighted survivor to that of a proud automaker with more than a century of history under its belt. In 2009 Ford was suffering from being an American company; by 2016 it relished that title. (Lincoln had crossover SUVs to sell at exactly the right time.Bill Pugliano/Getty IMages) Timing is everything, and luck matters Fields also knew that some of the unlikely success that Lincoln was experiencing could be chalked up to timing and luck. When the call was made to keep the brand alive, no one could have foreseen that gas prices would plummet in 2015, boosting the balance sheets of any automaker that had SUVs and crossover to sell. When the first McConaughey ads hit, their druggy, meandering meditations and improvised art-film quality made sense, as a daring bet to kick-start the brand. Once their impact was felt, however, the marketing plan became more conservative. The moodiness was out, and there would be no more seemingly random encounters with wandering bulls on vacant Texas roads, as there had been with the first batch. Later spots that aired in 2015 concentrated on their vehicles and normalized the character McConaughey was playing. He didn’t just drive around aimlessly as a freestyle stoner-philosopher, a spacey specialist in the craft of unearthing deep thoughts that had a sideways relationship to Lincoln and its comeback. Instead, he got dressed for a late-night poker game or took his dogs out for sushi, or found sunwashed vistas in Los Angeles to scrutinize. Some of the evocative danger, the threat that can attach to empty Western landscapes, slipped away, replaced of necessity by a more straightforward sales pitch. In the end, however, the improved sales number and the respectable progress in China spoke for themselves. It could have been that Lincoln had located a sort of inadvertent sweet spot, a lacuna in the luxury market in the US that needed to be filled and an opportunity beckoning in China to introduce a fresh new brand with an identity that differed meaningfully from everyone else. The demographics are in Lincoln’s favor. The biggest challenge for a near-luxury brand, especially one suffering from the lingering hangover of its glory days in the mid-'60s, bigger than taking on the mighty Germans, bigger than overcoming a once-in-a-generation financial crisis, is finding younger customers. Long term, the amusing old observation goes, we’re all dead. This is fine for a brand if your customers are replaced as loyalists head for their final reward. But for Lincoln, the customer base had by the 2000s shifted to a familiar place for big American cars: They were aging fast. By the mid-2010s, however, Lincoln had improved that — dramatically. “Our fastest-growing group is 25 to 44,” Galhotra told me. He chalked this up to an important practical lifestyle change for younger buyers: “They just need more space.” After years of dire prognostications in and around the auto industry about millennials not buying cars — because they had no job, no credit, no families — it now appears that the youngest Americans, as soon as they have any economic power, are taking the car-buying plunge. Typical factors are driving this: They have access to better jobs and an improved credit outlook. As their financial picture improves they are getting busy with family formation and an inevitable move from crowded cities to roomier suburbs. And finally they are showing a rising enthusiasm for car culture. Ford, always a carmaker with a youthful streak – the Mustang was created explicitly for the young people of the '60s — is positioning itself to grab these buyers. And Lincoln is positioning itself to nab them if they think they need a bit more luxury than what the Ford marque has on offer, especially when it comes to crossovers and SUVs. It’s working better that anyone could have expected. By the 2016, Galhotra looked as though he'd hit his stride. And Lincoln, for the first time since the late '90s, looked like it was ready to run.

Photo: AP CHICAGO — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on a runway at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. Another video pic.twitter.com/jg58N8x3l8 — Jose Castillo 🎃 (@Kryptonlogic) October 28, 2016 “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door.” Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

"We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it's like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. © The Associated Press, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Latest Video Violent clashes in Athens greet Obama 0:35 Aleppo reeling from bombing campaign 1:40 Before & After: Aleppo's Old City 0:33 Explosions in Aleppo neighbourhoods 1:04 Most Viewed Militant Islamist groups believe Trump's rhetoric will help recruitment At least 2 dead, hundreds stranded in New Zealand town after severe quake Trump tones down polarizing campaign promises, rhetoric in 60 Minutes interview Taking aim at the establishment: Why some of Europe's top leaders are walking dead read comments Trump names Reince Priebus, controversial Steve Bannon to key White House posts read comments In change of tone, Obama praises president-elect Trump's strengths read comments Trump's team of rivals?

Boeing has been awarded a patent for a tilt rotor Vertical TakeOff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft capable of carrying up to 100 passengers. By combining vertical lift and hover capacity of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional airplane, it could one day turn small airports into passenger hubs. Boeing has had considerable experience with military VTOL aircraft, like the V-22 Osprey and its derivatives, but current tilt-rotor aircraft aren't suitable for civilian use and the few attempts, including the AugustWestland BA609, can only handle six to nine passengers. Part of the problem is the military tilt rotors include many features that make them impractical for civilian use. A quick glance at the V-22 shows where these problems lie. The Osprey and similar aircraft have a high-wing configuration that requires the aircraft to have a heavier construction with extra reinforcements to not only support the engines, but to protect the fuselage from being crushed in the event of a crash. Conventional tilt-rotors, such as the V-22 Osprey are not practical for civilian passenger use(Credit: US Navy) This configuration also makes maintenance and fueling more difficult, and it has safety issues because the plane cannot float in the event of a water landing. In addition, the undercarriage must be installed in the fuselage because the wings are too high for the wheels, and the wings can't be used to store fuel because of the danger of leakage into the fuselage and cabin. And then there's the problem of airports being built for low-winged craft, so taxiing, loading, and unloading aren't easy. Another problem is the engine mounting. Most tilt rotors have two engines – one in each wingtip nacelle right behind the rotors. These may be combined to share the lifting load through a drive shaft, but for safety reasons, each engine must be 50 percent larger than needed in case the other engine fails. If the engines aren't interconnected, they need to be even larger. This means the need for even stronger wing supports with heavier reinforcements to hold the larger engines. According to the patent, Boeing is looking at something more along the lines of a 100 passenger regional aircraft. In the description, the Boeing passenger tilt rotor has low wings set toward the bottom of the fuselage as in a conventional airplane, doesn't need special crash reinforcement, and can float in a water landing. In addition, it can carry fuel in wing tanks, can operate from conventional airfields, and can be equipped with mid-cabin exits without elaborate slides. One way in which Boeing aims to achieve this is by moving the engines away from the rotor nacelles at the tips of the wings to the middle of the wing. This way, each rotor can be powered by two or more engines through a common gearbox in various configurations. This means the individual engines can be less powerful and more compact, yet in combination can provide the necessary power for flight even is one should fail. In addition, the engines are fixed, which simplifies many of the systems and the weight of the wings, as well as improving ground clearance and payload capacity. Also, the wings can be configured so that their power trains are completely independent of one another. Since this is just a patent, there's no indication that this aircraft or any variant is slated for production, but if it were, it could act as a regional passenger aircraft capable of operating from small airfields, city airports that normally couldn't handle such a large passenger craft, and even remote heliports.

Smoke rises after an American Airlines jet (background) that caught fire at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on 28 October. Reuters No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred hours before an unrelated mishap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the landing gear of a FedEx Corp cargo plane collapsed on touchdown, sparking a fire that was quickly extinguished. The company later said the FedEx pilots were safe. American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down an O'Hare runway at about 2.30 pm CDT (1 am IST) when the right-side engine of the twin-engine jet burst into flames, authorities said. Footage from Chicago's ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed the idled plane on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from its right side and emergency slides deployed on the left side. Passengers milled about watching the blaze as fire trucks pumped water on the flames. Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner, said the mishap could have been much worse. The plane was fully loaded with 19,504 kg of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Sampey told a news conference later. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing," he said. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later." Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. The plane's CF6 engine, the "workhorse" of the commercial aviation industry, was built by General Electric Co, and GE dispatched investigators to the scene, the company said. The Federal Aviation Administration initially said the pilot aborted takeoff after reporting a blown-out tyre. But city fire spokesman Larry Langford said he saw no blown tires at the scene. Langford said 19 passengers and one flight attendant were taken to a hospital with minor injuries — such as bumps, bruises and sprained ankles — suffered in exiting the plane. There were no burns or cases of smoke inhalation. "The fire never got into the cabin," he said. "This happened so close to one of the airport fire stations that they were on it in a minute." He said the plane was 15 to 20 seconds away from being airborne when the fire erupted.

Reuters Inside the aircraft after it came to a stop, frantic passengers shouted at each other to hurry while making their way down the aisle to an emergency exit slide, as seen in a video posted on Facebook by passenger Hector Gustavo Cardenas. The incident forced the closure of at least three of the airport's eight runways, the city Aviation Department said. By about two hours after the incident, the airport had experienced 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. The Fort Lauderdale airport said 29 flights were diverted due to the FedEx plane incident, but the facility was later reopened to air traffic. As the Chicago mishap unfolded, O'Hare's tower controllers began ordering inbound planes to abort landing approaches and “go around,” initially closing all runways so emergency vehicles could reach the stricken aircraft, according to audio recordings of the main tower frequency posted by the website Liveatc.net. Operations later resumed on the north side of O'Hare airport, one of the world’s busiest, according to web tracking sites and a live feed of tower conversations from Liveatc.net.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (CNN) A FedEx cargo plane caught fire on the runway at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday afternoon, causing the airport to shut down for several hours, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Video shot by an onlooker at the airport showed a fireball exploding out of the damaged aircraft and recorded the startled cries of people watching. The pilot and copilot escaped harm using a rope ladder on the right side of the aircraft, according to Mike Jachles of Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue. No members of the ground crews were hurt, he added. The fire occurred after the plane's landing gear collapsed as it touched ground, the FAA said. The Boeing MD-10 was operating as Flight 910 from Memphis, Tennessee, where FedEx is based. Most of the fire damage occurred on the plane's exterior near the left wing and engine, Jachles said. The interior of the plane appeared to be undamaged The plane was carrying FedEx shipments and US Mail, he said. FedEx Services Senior Communications Specialist Davina Cole said the company was cooperating with authorities. Boeing has not yet responded to a request for comment. The Florida airport's south runway reopened for air traffic at 7 p.m., according to the airport's Twitter account. The north runway remains closed while the investigation of the FedEx plane fire continues. The accident came hours after an American Airlines Boeing 767 was forced to abort its takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport because of an engine-related malfunction.

McCann and Joan Lowy Associated Press   October 28, 2016 CHICAGO — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on a runway at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an ‘‘uncontained engine failure,’’ in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Advertisement Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. Get Breaking News in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here ‘‘People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,’’ Ahmed said. ‘‘Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.’’ FedEx plane catches fire at Florida airport; no injuries A FedEx plane caught fire Friday evening while landing at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, authorities said. The scene at O’Hare The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Advertisement Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene soon, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. ‘‘Planes are meant to fly with one engine,’’ said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. ‘‘We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time . . . and then still successfully take off and land.’’ One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken ‘‘very seriously’’ in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. ‘‘It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,’’ said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 r.p.m., he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

Three sources familiar with the unfolding investigation told CNN the General Electric engine suffered an apparent "uncontained" failure. The 161 terrified passengers and nine crew members scrambled to safety Friday afternoon after huge flames erupted on the right side of the plane. Airport fire Chief Timothy Sampey said crews responded to a report of a No. 2 engine on fire. The plane, which had stopped well before the end of the runway, had about 43,000 pounds of fuel. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later," he said. Read More About 20 people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries that occurred during the evacuation down the emergency slides, District Chief Juan Hernandez said. There were people with minor bruising or injured ankles, he said. None of the injuries were caused by the fire. Another video pic.twitter.com/jg58N8x3l8— Jose Castillo 🎃 (@Kryptonlogic) October 28, 2016 American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott said Flight 383 was bound for Miami when it aborted takeoff due to an engine-related issue. The rare, but extremely serious, engine failure sent debris from the engine spewing across the south side of the expansive airfield. Part of the engine's fan disc were found a half mile away on a building used by UPS, two sources said. A passenger who was sitting in the middle of row 31 said he heard a loud clunk, then saw a large ball of flame that he assumed came from the engine area. Gary Schiavone of DeMotte, Indiana, said the captain was able to stop the aircraft quickly, and then it was "coordinated chaos." There wasn't much yelling or screaming, he told reporters, except passengers who shouted at others who were trying to grab their bags from the overhead bins. Schiavone said about 30 seconds into the evacuation, smoke started to pour into the cabin. The difficulty in breathing was the scariest part, he said. Asked whether he was afraid he was going to die, Schiavone said, "Of course. I'm thinking the plane is going to blow up." Schiavone complimented the crew for getting everyone out in what he estimated was about a minute. Video tweeted by a witness on the ground showed an airliner with a large tower of smoke rising from the right side and flames billowing beneath the fuselage. The video showed passengers coming down two of the emergency slides on the 767's left side. A dog also evacuated, officials said. Josiah Ryan, senior producer for Social TV at CNN, was aboard a flight landing at O'Hare. Shortly after their American Airlines flight landed, their captain told passengers over the loudspeaker, "We're near our gate, but there has been an accident on one of the runways." Ryan said he saw emergency vehicles rush to the runway. Four of the airport's runways were closed still late afternoon Friday, but that was not affecting airport operations, said Ginger Evans, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Aviation.

More than a dozen emergency vehicles surrounded the jet for hours. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. Other Boeing jets have been involved in runway incidents in the past 13 months. A Boeing 777 taxiing for takeoff at Las Vegas International Airport in September 2015 aborted its takeoff roll to London when one of its two engines failed. The following month, passengers aboard a Dynamic Airways 767-200 were forced to evacuate because of a fuel leak that caused a fire while the aircraft was taxiing in Fort Lauderdale. Both incidents are still under investigation by the NTSB. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Braden Walker contributed to this report. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

(Reuters photo) 6/50 - + CHICAGO - The engine of an American Airlines Group Inc jet caught fire seconds from takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday, prompting the crew to abort its departure and evacuate passengers via emergency chutes, authorities said. No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred hours before an unrelated mishap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the landing gear of a FedEx Corp cargo plane collapsed on touchdown, sparking a fire that was quickly extinguished. The company later said the FedEx pilots were safe. American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down an O'Hare runway at about 2.30pm CDT (2.30am Sunday Bangkok time) when the right-side engine of the twin-engine jet burst into flames, authorities said. Footage from Chicago's ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed the idled plane on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from its right side and emergency slides deployed on the left side. Passengers milled about watching the blaze as fire trucks pumped water on the flames. Chicago Fire Department assistant deputy fire commissioner Timothy Sampey holds a news conference about an American Airlines jet that caught fire at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, on Friday. (Reuters photo) Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner, said the mishap could have been much worse. The plane was fully loaded with 19,504 kilogrammes of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Mr Sampey told a news conference later. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing," he said. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later." Mr Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. The plane's CF6 engine, the "workhorse" of the commercial aviation industry, was built by General Electric Co, and GE dispatched investigators to the scene, the company said. The Federal Aviation Administration initially said the pilot aborted takeoff after reporting a blown-out tire. But city fire spokesman Larry Langford said he saw no blown tires at the scene. Mr Langford said 19 passengers and one flight attendant were taken to a hospital with minor injuries -- such as bumps, bruises and sprained ankles -- suffered in exiting the plane. There were no burns or cases of smoke inhalation. "The fire never got into the cabin," he said. "This happened so close to one of the airport fire stations that they were on it in a minute." He said the plane was 15 to 20 seconds away from being airborne when the fire erupted. Inside the aircraft after it came to a stop, frantic passengers shouted at each other to hurry while making their way down the aisle to an emergency exit slide, as seen in a video posted on Facebook by passenger Hector Gustavo Cardenas. The incident forced the closure of at least three of the airport's eight runways, the city Aviation Department said. By about two hours after the incident, the airport had experienced 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. The Fort Lauderdale airport said 29 flights were diverted due to the FedEx plane incident, but the facility was later reopened to air traffic. As the Chicago mishap unfolded, O'Hare's tower controllers began ordering inbound planes to abort landing approaches and "go around," initially closing all runways so emergency vehicles could reach the stricken aircraft, according to audio recordings of the main tower frequency posted by the website liveatc.net. Operations later resumed on the north side of O'Hare airport, one of the world's busiest, according to web tracking sites and a live feed of tower conversations from liveatc.net.

American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured while evacuating the plane. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. “People are yelling: ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American confirmed that figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami on Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked in, and worn parts that aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989 when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It is mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it is like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles of takeoff and landing. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Society American Airlines plane catches fire on Chicago runway, at least 20 injured The fire started due to an engine-related issue, according to reports. Namrata Tripathi   October 29, 2016 09:56 IST The FAA had initially stated that the take-off was aborted by the pilot due to a tyre burst. Pictured: Smoke emanating from the American Airlines flightReuters An American Airlines plane caught fire at the O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Friday right before take-off. Although the pilot aborted the take-off immediately, at least 20 passengers are said to have sustained injuries as they were evacuated through the emergency chute. There were no serious injuries. The incident occurred at around 2:30am CDT on the American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing B767, which was scheduled to head to Miami, Elizabeth Cory, the spokesperson for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), said.

However, American Airlines in a statement said that the take-off of the flight was aborted "due to an engine-related mechanical issue." The airline said that there were around 161 passengers on board at the time of the incident and a crew of nine members. The Chicago department of aviation also issued a statement saying that the city fire department immediately attended the aircraft fire to douse the flames and that all the passengers were off the plane. The department also added that the fire did not occur because of a crash. The assistant deputy fire commissioner, Timothy Sampey, said in a press conference that the mishap could have been much worse considering the plane was fully loaded with 19,504 kg of jet fuel, which was leaking when the fire officials reached the plane. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing. This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later," Sampey said. He also confirmed that the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. City fire spokesperson Larry Langford said that he did not find any blown tyres at the scene of the incident. "The fire never got into the cabin.This happened so close to one of the airport fire stations that they were on it in a minute," Langford added. He also said that the plane was just 15  seconds away from take-off when the incident occurred.   Post Comment IBT TV Close Anti-Trump protester floored whilst speaking at Ohio rally Why advertise with us?

CHICAGO — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight Friday on a runway at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!'

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff.

Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured.

Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight Friday on a runway at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane - even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles - each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. AFP Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

REUTERS/Jim Young 5/5 By Timothy Mclaughlin | CHICAGO CHICAGO The engine of an American Airlines Group Inc jet caught fire seconds from takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday, prompting the crew to abort its departure and evacuate passengers via emergency chutes, authorities said. No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred hours before an unrelated mishap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the landing gear of a FedEx Corp cargo plane collapsed on touchdown, sparking a fire that was quickly extinguished. The company later said the FedEx pilots were safe. American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down an O'Hare runway at about 2:30 p.m. CDT (1930 GMT) when the right-side engine of the twin-engine jet burst into flames, authorities said. Footage from Chicago's ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed the idled plane on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from its right side and emergency slides deployed on the left side. Passengers milled about watching the blaze as fire trucks pumped water on the flames. Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner, said the mishap could have been much worse. The plane was fully loaded with 43,000 lbs (19,504 kg) of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Sampey told a news conference later. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing," he said. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later." Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. The plane's CF6 engine, the "workhorse" of the commercial aviation industry, was built by General Electric Co, and GE dispatched investigators to the scene, the company said. The Federal Aviation Administration initially said the pilot aborted takeoff after reporting a blown-out tyre. But city fire spokesman Larry Langford said he saw no blown tires at the scene. Langford said 19 passengers and one flight attendant were taken to a hospital with minor injuries - such as bumps, bruises and sprained ankles - suffered in exiting the plane. There were no burns or cases of smoke inhalation. "The fire never got into the cabin," he said. "This happened so close to one of the airport fire stations that they were on it in a minute." He said the plane was 15 to 20 seconds away from being airborne when the fire erupted. Inside the aircraft after it came to a stop, frantic passengers shouted at each other to hurry while making their way down the aisle to an emergency exit slide, as seen in a video posted on Facebook by passenger Hector Gustavo Cardenas. The incident forced the closure of at least three of the airport's eight runways, the city Aviation Department said. By about two hours after the incident, the airport had experienced 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. The Fort Lauderdale airport said 29 flights were diverted due to the FedEx plane incident, but the facility was later reopened to air traffic. As the Chicago mishap unfolded, O'Hare's tower controllers began ordering inbound planes to abort landing approaches and “go around,” initially closing all runways so emergency vehicles could reach the stricken aircraft, according to audio recordings of the main tower frequency posted by the website liveatc.net. Operations later resumed on the north side of O'Hare airport, one of the world’s busiest, according to web tracking sites and a live feed of tower conversations from liveatc.net.

The Fort Lauderdale airport said 29 flights were diverted due to the FedEx plane incident, but the facility was later reopened to air traffic. As the Chicago mishap unfolded, O'Hare's tower controllers began ordering inbound planes to abort landing approaches and “go around,” initially closing all runways so emergency vehicles could reach the stricken aircraft, according to audio recordings of the main tower frequency posted by the website liveatc.net. Operations later resumed on the north side of O'Hare airport, one of the world’s busiest, according to web tracking sites and a live feed of tower conversations from liveatc.net.

All 161 passengers and nine crew members were evacuated from the airplane. American Airlines Flight 383 was departing Chicago for Miami on Friday afternoon when an engine caught fire, prompting the crew to abort the takeoff and evacuate passengers via emergency chutes, authorities said.  Television images showed a large plume of black smoke coming from the Boeing which appeared to be damaged at the rear. The evacuation chutes extended from the plane. "There was substantial fire on the starboard [right] side of the aircraft," said Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner for airport operations. The plane was fully loaded with 43,000 pounds (19,504 kilograms) of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Sampey told a news conference later. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing," he said. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later." Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the left-side engine. There was no immediate explanation for the cause of the leak. The FAA said it was investigating the incident, and the National Transportation Safety Board had been notified. Minor injuries "We transported about 20 patients with minor injuries to several hospitals," Juan Hernandez of the Chicago Fire Department told a news conference. Seven passengers and one flight attendant were injured and taken to hospitals, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The flight aborted takeoff due to an "engine-related mechanical issue," Scott confirmed. "We are taking care of our customers and crew and are re-accommodating our passengers on another flight to Miami this evening," American Airlines said in a statement. At least three of the airport's eight runways were closed, and more than 300 flights in and out of the airport were delayed in the two hours after the fire. Normal operations have since resumed. FedEx Cargo Boeing catches fire   In a separate incident on Friday afternoon, a FedEx cargo plane caught fire on the runway at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood Airport, on the coast north of Miami in Florida. It caused the airport to shut down for several hours. The south runway reopened to air traffic on Friday evening.  The pilot and copilot escaped from the aircraft using a rope ladder. No members of the ground crew were hurt. Most of the fire damage was near the left wing and engine, according to Mike Jachles of Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue.  FedEx Services spokeswoman Davina Cole said the company was cooperating with authorities. jm/cmk (AP, AFP) DW recommends Pilot dies mid-flight on US airliner An American Airlines jet has made an emergency landing after the captain fell ill and died.

Official: Plane in Chicago had 'uncontained engine failure' Associated Press | CHICAGO (AP) — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight Friday on a runway at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren't replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it's like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C.

American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Firefighters extinguish flames from American Airlines Flight 383, flight bound for Miami, which caught fire on the runway at O'Hare International Airport, Friday, Oct. 28, 2016, as it was taking off. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune via AP) Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren't replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Plane in Chicago had 'uncontained engine failure' on takeoff Friday Oct 28, 2016 at 3:17 PM Oct 28, 2016 at 7:46 PM HERBERT G. McCANN, Associated PressJOAN LOWY, Associated Press CHICAGO (AP) — A federal official pointed to a rare and serious engine malfunction after pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight Friday on a runway at ChicagoO'Hare International Airport. The official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation, said American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine. The danger of such a failure is that pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday afternoon, and officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the planeand the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures, which the official cited as the cause of Friday's incident, are rare these days due to improvements in design and the metallurgy. They usually are caused by engines sucking in objects like runway debris or a bird, or maintenance crews failing to replace parts that wear out. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines reports the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C. Associated Press writers Michael Tarm and Caryn Rousseau in Chicago also contributed to this report.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Customer Service Newspaper in Education Submit an Ad Internships Contact Us Market Place Shop Cars Homes Free Classifieds Ad Classifieds Community Info Community Served About us Historic Headlines Peoria History Forms Anniversaries Births Engagements Weddings 100th Birthday Jobs in Peoria Pets Place a Classified Ad Real Estate Rentals Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Welcome back to America...yikes!! #fll #cnnireport A video posted by Jacob Barnes (@jpaulbarnes) on Oct 28, 2016 at 3:05pm PDT Video shot by an onlooker at the airport showed a fireball exploding out of the damaged aircraft and recorded the startled cries of people watching. The pilot and copilot escaped harm using a rope ladder on the right side of the aircraft, according to Mike Jachles of Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue. No members of the ground crews were hurt, he added. The fire occurred after the plane's landing gear collapsed as it touched ground, the FAA said. The Boeing MD-10 was operating as Flight 910 from Memphis, Tennessee, where FedEx is based. Most of the fire damage occurred on the plane's exterior near the left wing and engine, Jachles said. The interior of the plane appeared to be undamaged Read More The plane was carrying FedEx shipments and US Mail, he said. FedEx Services Senior Communications Specialist Davina Cole said the company was cooperating with authorities. Boeing has not yet responded to a request for comment. The Florida airport's south runway reopened for air traffic at 7 p.m., according to the airport's Twitter account. The north runway remains closed while the investigation of the FedEx plane fire continues. The accident came hours after an American Airlines Boeing 767 was forced to abort its takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport because of an engine-related malfunction.

The project, which is the next phase of United’s ongoing expansion of facilities at its Houston hub, will add approximately 200,000 square feet of additional hangar capacity for maintaining widebody aircraft, in addition to a new warehouse distribution center, technical services building and administrative offices. Once completed, the $162 million facility will accommodate widebody aircraft, including Boeing 767s, 777s, 787s and Airbus A350s, and provide an improved work environment with better ergonomics, safety and efficiency for United’s maintenance technicians and support personnel. “With flights from Houston to destinations around the globe, this new facility and the employees who work here will provide critical support to our worldwide operations,” said Greg Hart, United’s, executive vice president and chief operations officer. “This significant investment in our Houston facilities will enable us to support more aircraft than ever before in Houston and allow us to return them to serving our customers more quickly, while providing a workplace that our people can take pride in.” The new UTOC, which is expected to be completed in late 2018, will consolidate United’s Houston maintenance facilities, placing engineers in the hangars adjacent to technicians and aircraft for optimal efficiency. The expanded facilities will also generate approximately 200 new jobs. “Once again, our strong partnership with United Airlines brings us to the beginning of another important project here at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. From work to build not one, but two new terminals, to now this new facility, United and the City of Houston prove that public-private partnerships benefit everyone involved,” said Houston Mayor, Sylvester Turner. “United recognizes the fact that Houston is a tremendous place to do business and they understand that this community embraces them and wants to see them succeed.” See other recent news regarding: United Airlines, Houston Subscribe to our Latest Travel News Daily Email Free of Charge by simply entering your email address to the right.

There were no immediate reports of injuries. The incident involving American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing B767 bound for Miami, occurred at about 2:30 p.m. CDT, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Cory said. Footage from Chicago’s ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed an American Airlines jet on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from one side of the aircraft, which had its emergency slides deployed. Passengers milled about on the airfield watching the blaze as fire trucks poured water on the flames. Cory said the mishap was caused by a blown tire and that the flight crew aborted takeoff. But American Airlines said in a statement that takeoff of the jet was aborted “due to an engine-related mechanical issue.” The plane was carrying 161 passengers and a crew of nine at the time, the airline said. The Chicago Department of Aviation issued a statement saying the city fire department responded to an aircraft fire involving American Airlines Flight 383 and that the passengers were off the plane. The Aviation Department said there was no crash involved. The incident forced the closure of two of the airport’s runways. No further details about the circumstances of the mishap were immediately available. The FAA said it was investigating the incident.

Twenty people were taken to hospitals for treatment of minor injuries ranging from bruises to hurt ankles, Juan Hernandez, district chief of emergency medical services for the Chicago Fire Department, said at a news conference Friday. American set the number of injured at seven travelers and one flight attendant.  Twitter: chad mitchell on Twitter The Boeing Co. 767 had an engine malfunction just before the fire, said Leslie Scott, a spokeswoman for American. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration initially said the fire occurred after a tire burst and later issued a statement saying it happened “after experiencing a problem during takeoff.” “There was a huge explosion on the right-hand side of the airplane,” passenger Hector Cardenas told the ABC television affiliate in Chicago. “Everyone was sort of panicking.” Charred Wing Cardenas said the plane was about to take off when the explosion occurred. The last ground speed was recorded at 115 knots, or 132 miles an hour, Flightradar24 posted on Twitter. The fire blackened one side of the plane, and pictures appeared to show the charred wing on that side drooping toward the ground. Chicago Fire Department officials declined to comment on the cause of the blaze, which might not be determined for awhile, said Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner for airport operations. The plane was carrying about 43,000 pounds of fuel and there was “a substantial fuel leak,” he said at the news conference. “There was a heavy volume of fire on the engine and all the way to the wing tip.” “This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later,” Sampey said. Incident Investigation The pilots aborted the takeoff, said the FAA, which will investigate. Flight 383, headed for Miami, carried 161 passengers and nine crew members. The National Transportation Safety Board also is sending three investigators to the scene, the agency said on Twitter. One potential cause of jet engine explosions is a foreign object that gets sucked in, said Bill Waldock, a professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, comparing the powerplant to a vacuum cleaner. Issues inside the engine have also led to explosions, said Waldock, who was speaking generally and didn’t have specific details about the Chicago incident. Explosions can send shrapnel across the plane and rupture fuel tanks and fuel lines, he said. In the case of a Boeing 767 or Boeing 777, much of the fuel actually is stored in the wing in what’s called an integral fuel tank, or “wet wing,” Waldock said. Separately, a FedEx Corp. plane burst into flames at about 6 p.m. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after its landing gear collapsed following touchdown, the FAA said in an e-mailed statement. Both pilots escaped from the plane, according to the agency. A photograph posted on Twitter by someone waiting for a flight at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International showed a ball of flames rising to twice the height of the DC-10 wide-body’s tail.

Pilots on Flight 383 bound for Miami reported an engine-related mechanical issue, according to an airline spokeswoman. | Jose Castillo/Distributed by the Associated Press Frank Main, Tina Sfondeles, Andy Grimm Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter  Sign-Up Everything happened so quickly, there wasn’t even an announcement aboard the packed jet. Then, passengers saw the flames. And the panic set in. “People were just rushing out of the plane,” said Hector Cardenas, who’d been seated in the seventh row and captured the chaos on video. “People were just throwing themselves onto each other, pushing each other through the door and just throwing themselves out on the slides.” But as terrifying as Flight 383 was for Cardenas and the other 170 passengers and crew members, it could have been much worse. The Miami-bound American Airlines flight caught fire before takeoff Friday afternoon — spewing huge billows of black smoke across O’Hare Airport — but passengers and crew were able to escape the Boeing 767 on chutes, officials said. About 20 people were injured, with none of those injuries life-threatening. American Airlines said in a statement that Flight 383 aborted takeoff at 2:35 p.m. because of engine-related mechanical problems. A tire blew out, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which is investigating. Passenger Gary Schiavone of Demotte, Ind., said there was a thud and then an explosion on the right side of the plane about 20 seconds after the plane began taxiing, before the plane had begun to lift off. “First there was a clunk like the landing gear was going up, but a lot harder, then there was the explosion,” Schiavone said. “What was I thinking: Flying. Just, I hate flying and the worst thing happened that you can imagine,” Schiavone said. “Twenty seconds later, we’d all be dead.” Schiavone said he could see a “big, red ball of flames” on the left side of the plane, and a passenger with a window seat said he could see the glass cracking from the heat. Passengers and crew got off the plane by sliding down two emergency chutes. About 20 people were taken to area hospitals with injuries, mostly bruises and ankle sprains suffered when sliding down the inflatable ramp exiting the plane, Chicago Fire Department District Chief Juan Hernandez said. The plane was moments before taking off when the fire happened. The cabin began filling with smoke as passengers began getting off the plane. A few passengers tried to pull their luggage from the overhead compartments, the only hiccup in a largely orderly exit that took a little more than a minute, Schiavone said. “This could have been absolutely devastating if it had happened later, if it had been further” along in takeoff,” Fire District Chief Timothy Sampey said at a new conference at O’Hare. The plane did, however, have “ample room” to stop. Firefighters arrived at the burning plane about a minute after the flames were reported by the control tower, Sampey said. The fire was knocked out in seconds with a chemical foam and dry chemical, he said. Firefighters still were dealing with “hot spots” on the plane several hours after the flames had been extinguished. The fire was the most “significant” at O’Hare in about eight years, Sampey said, and could have been far worse. A fully-loaded 767 carries about 43,000 pounds of fuel, he said. Airport officials said four of the airport’s eight runways were open, enough to handle Friday evening traffic. The plane was manufactured in 2003 and has a capacity for 218 passengers plus crew, records show. Cardenas, a Chicago mortgage lender, posted an intense video featuring the inside of the plane, as passengers were about to escape via chutes. In the video, the engines are still roaring. Some passengers are screaming, “Let’s go!” Others grab their luggage in overhead bins. Some are panicking. One woman screams, “Please.” The passengers are headed to the chutes when someone says “Jump and slide.” The video captures the slide down the chute with the airplane still on fire. “Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my frickin’ God,” Cardenas says as he turns the video on himself. .Nightmare scenario, Hector Cardenas’ video shows panicked passengers escaping burning #Chicago plane! Language warning. Latest on @6abc: pic.twitter.com/iG6eSRCupz — Jessica Gonzalez (@HessicaGonzalez) October 28, 2016 //platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Cardenas was in the seventh row of the plane, looking at his phone when he heard the blast. Cardenas, 38, of River North, said he didn’t initially realize anything was wrong. “We were toward the end of the runway. It was a blast and then there was fire and smoke and you’re just trying to get off the plane,” Cardenas said. “So it’s not like you really realize that things are going wrong. It happened within a matter of a minute.” Cardenas said he could see the smoke and fire billowing from the right side of the plane, closest to passengers in the middle of the flight. Hector Cardenas posted this picture to Facebook after he and other passengers were evacuated from American Airlines Flight 383 at O’Hare International Airport. | Photo courtesy of Hector Cardenas Cardenas said he recorded the ordeal on video because he happened to be organizing photos on his phone and deleting messages when the blast happened. “I had the phone in my hand and I just clutched it and seconds later, I realized, Oh my God. What’s going on. And then three seconds later, it was just major panic and smoke coming in.” Cardenas, who opted not to take another flight to Miami Friday night, said the fire could have been far worse. He said he called his mother as soon as he got off the plane, to let her know he was alright. “Once I was on that tarmac, you realize that it was a matter of 10 seconds for that thing to really be in the air. It would have been a lot worse. Catastrophic, I think.” Passenger Sarah Ahmed, who said she was one of the last off the plane, told ABC7 that smoke came into the passenger compartment, and flames were up against the windows. Evacuating passengers panicked at that point. Hector Cardenas posted this picture to Facebook after he and other passengers were evacuated from American Airlines Flight 383 at O’Hare International Airport. | Photo courtesy of Hector Cardenas “It was chaos,” Ahmed said. “I thought it was the day I was going to die.” Ahmed described a “stampede” of people, some shouting “open the door, open the door.” “Everyone’s screaming and jumping over each other,” she said. Ahmed said her co-worker “took a tumble” while sliding down the escape chutes. Others banged into each other on the slides. Michelle Marsch, who was in a terminal about 100 yards from the plane, said people in the terminal were startled by an explosion. “It was just a big boom,” she told NBC5. Fire trucks rushed to the plane “almost instantaneously.” “It was quite seriously scary,” Marsch said. Jose Castillo Jr., of Orlando, said in an interview with the Sun-Times that his father, Jose Castillo Sr., escaped on a chute with other passengers. “He told me they were taking off, and the plane was at full throttle, and there was an explosion on the right side and then on the left side.” The younger Castillo said his father told him that engines on both wings appeared to be on fire. “He said a couple of seconds later, if they were in the air, it could have been a disaster,” Jose Castillo Jr. said. He said his father left his belongings on the plane — including his cell phone — but was able to call with a borrowed phone. Castillo Sr. took videos of the plane, too, and sent that to his son. One video shows passengers escaping from the front and back of the plane on chutes and running away from the plane while black smoke pours from the right side. Some of the passengers were screaming. Another video shows the right side of the plane on fire after passengers got off. Some passengers have their luggage and are staring at the spectacle while others are walking away in a grassy area near the runway. “We are grateful that he is safe,” Castillo Jr. said, adding that his father, who owns an export management company in Florida, was in Chicago on business and going home. Schiavone said he and his wife opted not to take a later flight to make their trip to visit their daughter in Miami, a three-day trip that would be more difficult since they lost their luggage.

In 2003, a Boeing 727 leased by the U.S. Marshals Service blew two tires while landing at O’Hare, forcing about 100 handcuffed prisoners and their guards to slide down emergency chutes to safety. In 1998, American Airlines Flight 1340 — 727 carrying 116 passengers and six crew members from Kansas City — landed short of a runway at O’Hare, tearing off the landing gear. Twenty-two passengers and crew reported minor injuries. The worst crash in U.S. aviation history occurred in 1979 when American Airlines Flight 191 crashed moments after takeoff at O’Hare, killing all 258 passengers and 13 members of the crew. That plane was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. # Transportation O'Hare Airport Previously from Chicago News Man shot on Eisenhower Expressway in critical condition | Chicago Sun-Times Madigan and Rauner meet, Republicans left scratching their heads | Chicago Sun-Times State unveils new design, will replace faulty license plates | Chicago Sun-Times Cops: Arrest made in murder, decapitation of Kyrian Knox | Chicago Sun-Times Currently Trending dear abby Dear Abby: For Thanksgiving, I'll come if she leaves | Chicago Sun-Times chicago State unveils new design, will replace faulty license plates | Chicago Sun-Times chicago Killings up because mayor let CPD wither: police union official | Chicago Sun-Times chicago Vrdolyak indicted on income tax evasion, impeding IRS | Chicago Sun-Times dear abby Dear Abby: Holiday invitation excludes one child | Chicago Sun-Times Post to Cancel

Passengers and crew flee burning American Airlines jet. (Photo courtesy Alan Lemery) Liam Ford, William Lee, Grace Wong American Airlines Flight 383 was rolling down the runway at O'Hare International Airport Friday afternoon, bound for Miami, when the plane skidded to a halt just as it was lifting off. The pilot got on the radio. "American 383 heavy," he said, referring to the Boeing 767's weight class. "Stopping on the runway." "Roger, roger. Fire," a traffic controller calmly replied, according to a recording of tower radio traffic. The pilot asked if the tower controller saw fire. "Yeah, fire off the right wing." Then seconds later, the pilot said, "American 383, we're evacuating." The plane's 161 passengers and nine crew members scrambled down emergency chutes on the left side of the plane while flames flared and thick black smoke billowed from the wing on the right side, according to the airline and video from the scene.  Twenty people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, mostly bruises and ankle problems, according to Fire Chief Juan Hernandez, the EMS chief at the airport.   The aircraft experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, a federal official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a rare and serious failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. "The smoke started coming in and the flames just started going along the windows on the right side," said one of the passengers, Alan Lemery, 62, from the River North neighborhood. "Everybody started panicking at that point."

"Then for some reason, everything happened very slowly and orderly," said his wife, Marta Lemery. Video of the scene shows passengers sliding down chutes. Many of the passengers can be seen running across a median of grass, some lugging their bags. Some passengers gather a distance away and watch as fire trucks circle the plane. "Crazy, man," one passenger is heard saying. "I'm never f------ flying again." People around him can be heard laughing. It took fire crews only a few minutes to bring the fire under control, officials said. As the smoke cleared, the blackened right wing could be seen sagging and touching the tarmac. The FAA said the problem started with a blown tire, but American said the takeoff was aborted "due to an engine-related mechanical issue." A large rounded piece of metal believed to have come from the plane smashed through the roof of a UPS facility on the airport grounds and bounced off the floor, according to an airport worker. "It looks like a piece of a turbine disk from a jet engine," the worker said, adding it was too hot to touch. When you get a little older, excitement is good. It wasn't our day to die. — Alan Lemery, passenger Few people were inside the building at the time and no injuries were reported. The facility is filled with workers at night. Police secured the scene and turned it over to the National Transportation Safety Board, which was investigating the incident. The plane had started to take off around 2:35 p.m. on Runway 28R, according to the FAA. Passengers said the plane was just lifting off when it slammed back to the tarmac. "It was a scary moment," Marta Lemery said.  Her husband said he saw flames on the right side of the plane as the plane skidded across the runway before finally stopping. The lights went off.   The initial panic quickly faded and "people were not really jumping or pushing" as they made their way down the aisle and the chutes, said Marta Lemery. The couple applauded the pilot for making sure everyone got out safely. "The way the pilot conducted the situation, he did an excellent job," Marta Lemery said.  Alan Lemery added, "When you get a little older, excitement is good. It wasn't our day to die." They are booked on a Saturday morning flight for Miami, where they plan to catch a cruise.

Twenty people were taken to hospitals for treatment of minor injuries ranging from bruises to hurt ankles, Juan Hernandez, district chief of emergency medical services for the Chicago Fire Department, said at a news conference Friday. American set the number of injured at seven travelers and one flight attendant.  Twitter: chad mitchell on Twitter The Boeing Co. 767 had an engine malfunction just before the fire, said Leslie Scott, a spokeswoman for American. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration initially said the fire occurred after a tire burst and later issued a statement saying it happened “after experiencing a problem during takeoff.” “There was a huge explosion on the right-hand side of the airplane,” passenger Hector Cardenas told the ABC television affiliate in Chicago. “Everyone was sort of panicking.” Charred Wing Cardenas said the plane was about to take off when the explosion occurred. The last ground speed was recorded at 115 knots, or 132 miles an hour, Flightradar24 posted on Twitter. The fire blackened one side of the plane, and pictures appeared to show the charred wing on that side drooping toward the ground. Chicago Fire Department officials declined to comment on the cause of the blaze, which might not be determined for awhile, said Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner for airport operations. The plane was carrying about 43,000 pounds of fuel and there was “a substantial fuel leak,” he said at the news conference. “There was a heavy volume of fire on the engine and all the way to the wing tip.” “This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later,” Sampey said. Incident Investigation The pilots aborted the takeoff, said the FAA, which will investigate. Flight 383, headed for Miami, carried 161 passengers and nine crew members. The National Transportation Safety Board also is sending three investigators to the scene, the agency said on Twitter. One potential cause of jet engine explosions is a foreign object that gets sucked in, said Bill Waldock, a professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, comparing the powerplant to a vacuum cleaner. Issues inside the engine have also led to explosions, said Waldock, who was speaking generally and didn’t have specific details about the Chicago incident. Explosions can send shrapnel across the plane and rupture fuel tanks and fuel lines, he said. In the case of a Boeing 767 or Boeing 777, much of the fuel actually is stored in the wing in what’s called an integral fuel tank, or “wet wing,” Waldock said. Separately, a FedEx Corp. plane burst into flames at about 6 p.m. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after its landing gear collapsed following touchdown, the FAA said in an e-mailed statement. Both pilots escaped from the plane, according to the agency. A photograph posted on Twitter by someone waiting for a flight at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International showed a ball of flames rising to twice the height of the DC-10 wide-body’s tail.

Related Stories Obama-Biden memes explode on social media Some Florida Dems want John Morgan for governor RECALL: Smart Ones frozen desserts DC Council approves 'Death with Dignity' bill CHICAGO (FOX 32 NEWS) - Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of an American Airlines jet that aborted takeoff and caught fire on the runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday, forcing 170 crew and passengers to evacuate and resulting in eight injuries, authorities said. Pilots on American Airlines Flight 383 bound for Miami reported an engine-related mechanical issue, according to airline spokeswoman Leslie Scott. She said seven passengers and a flight attendant with minor injuries were taken to a hospital to be evaluated. Footage from the scene showed the Boeing 767, which appeared to be damaged on its rear and along its right side, sitting on the runway with flames underneath and shooting from one side along with plumes of smoke. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. "The motors were spinning like they always do and it didn't take off yet, it almost felt like it was going to and then boom," said Gary Schiavone, who was a passenger on board. "I'm thinking the planes going to blow up because there's gas in the wings." CURRENT FLIGHT INFO: https://flightaware.com/live/ Passengers came down emergency slides, hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. "It cracked the window on the right side of the plane, pretty big flame, pretty big ball, first there was a clunk after the explosion," Schiavone said. He was on his way to Miami with his wife to visit their daughter.  On cell phone video shot on board the plane, you could hear a woman, believed to be a flight attendant, yelling "go, go, go, go" as passengers hurried out the emergency exits.  With the fire raging on the right side, the passengers and nine crew members all had to deplane off the left side. "We're all going like, 'oh my God, let's get out of here,' you know and like I said, it was organized chaos," Schiavone said. Twenty people were hurt, but none seriously. The fire department said they suffered ankle injuries and friction burns from sliding down the inflatable emergency exit ramps. "The smoke was the worst thing, about halfway through getting out the smoke started to get a little bit heavy so you get a deep breath to get some oxygen, and that was the scariest part of the whole thing," Schiavone said The Fire Department was on scene in less than two minutes attacking the fire, but there were major challenges. "Plane just taking off, going to Miami, it was fully loaded with fuel, 767. So roughly 43,000 pounds of fuel, so substantial amount of fuel on the aircraft and it was leaking so they had a heavy volume of fire," said Timothy Sampey, Assistant Deputy Fire Commissioner. "This could've been absolutely devastating if it happened later," Sampey said. "I feel pretty unlucky it happened, but I feel lucky I'm here. Twenty seconds later would've been up in the air, would've been done," Schiavone said. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, the airline said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is investigating, said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. The Chicago Fire Department tweeted that there was an extra-alarm emergency response at the airport. Fire officials couldn't immediately be reached for further comment. Passenger Sarah Ahmed says the plane was almost in the air when she heard a loud bang and saw a fire out the window. "The plane comes to a screeching stop," she told the TV station. "People are yelling, `Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door." The Sun-Times Media Wire and Associated Press contributed to this report.

Cathay Pacific lands first scheduled A350 service at Auckland Airport Nevil Gibson Friday October 28, 2016 Share The A350 Play NBR radio on aiaadd to my Stocks $ 100.000% Volume: The arrival of the world’s newest commercial airliner in Auckland marks another milestone in the rapid growth of air traffic between China and New Zealand. Cathay Pacific’s Airbus A350-900 is the first of this next-generation aircraft – similar to Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner – to be put on a scheduled service to this country. The Hong Kong-based airline has been in New Zealand for 33 years and the A350 will be flying daily until December when it will be joined by a Boeing 777-300ER for a double daily service during the peak holiday season. The company’s head of sales and marketing, Dane Cheng, says apart from bringing new levels of passenger comfort and service, the long-range A350s will open up new “long, thin” routes with its 280-seat capacity (38 in business, 28 premium economy and 214 economy). "With this aircraft you can operate to secondary destinations and lot of them will be new," he says, now the airline has five in service and by the end of next year will have taken delivery of 22. New route to Israel Cathay has just announced the latest of these new routes – Hong Kong to Tel Aviv direct. The airline has been planning a service to Israel for some years to meet increasing business ties between that country and Asia. It’s also been suggested Singapore Airlines will start flying directly to Tel Aviv in the near future. Cathay’s service will start on March 26 and will fly over central Asia and down through Turkey. The Israeli airline, El Al, has a route to Bangkok that flies around Saudi Arabia and across the Indian Ocean. "This will be a very good destination for us in completing our worldwide network," he says.  Boost for Chinese airlines Speaking at the arrival ceremony for the A350-900, Transport Minister Simon Bridges said having such a "state-of the-art" aircraft in New Zealand brings luxury within the reach of all travellers as well as the benefits of lower emissions and quieter engines. He also told NBR the air services agreement with China (which is separate from Hong Kong) has just been boosted from 42 agreed in 2014 to 49 services and is already at full capacity. He says that agreement will have to be renegotiated to cope with the growth of Chinese airlines wanting to fly to New Zealand. Two more airlines are due before the end of the year while Hong Kong Airlines starts its daily service to Auckland on November 10.

Airbus and Safran The same day as rival aerospace giant Boeing reported falls in its sales and profits in the third quarter, Airbus released a similarly underwhelming set of results. Group revenues remained more robust than Boeing's, falling just 0.9% from the same period in 2016 to EUR13.95 billion (USD15.23 billion). However, the company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of EUR507 million in the quarter was down by 29% year on year.

Accident was third airliner off a LaGuardia runway since 2013 Candidate’s jet hit by tailwinds while landing in rainstorm Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mail The out-of-control landing that sent Republican vice president candidate Mike Pence’s plane fishtailing off the runway Thursday at New York’s LaGuardia Airport is the latest in a series of runway mishaps at one of the U.S.’s tightest and busiest airports. The National Transportation Safety Board sent an 11-person team to investigate the accident. Since 2013, the agency has conducted two previous major accident investigations involving planes sliding off runways at LaGuardia. Pence’s chartered Boeing Co. 737-700 landed hard, slid sideways and came to rest in a grassy area during a rain storm at about 7:42 p.m., NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said at a briefing on Friday. There were no injuries, although the airport was briefly closed and emergency crews were called to the scene. “When we landed, it was obvious I think to everybody on the plane that the pilots were hitting the brakes very hard,” Pence said Friday on MSNBC. “It was about 10 seconds of uncertainty but we were all fine.” Data Recorder The plane’s crash-proof data recorder showed the plane touched down at 140 miles (225 kilometers) an hour, Sumwalt said. While landing speeds vary depending on weight and other factors, that seemed to be within a normal range, he said. Sumwalt flew the 737 as an airline pilot prior to joining the NTSB. The preliminary data released by the safety board may offer some clues hinting at why the plane didn’t stop. Devices known as spoilers, panels on the top of the wings that come up after touchdown to help slow a plane, were broken, requiring pilots to set them manually, Sumwalt said. They deployed four seconds after touchdown, which is several seconds later than if they had come up automatically, he said. The plane’s thrust reversers, devices on the engines that reverse airflow and also help slow the aircraft down, were engaged about seven seconds after touchdown, he said. Winds at the time of landing were gusty and from the side and rear, which also may have added a degree of complexity to the touchdown, said Steve Wallace, the former accident investigation chief at the Federal Aviation Administration. Strong Winds A government weather station reported 11 minutes after the accident that winds were 11.5 miles (18.5 kilometers) an hour, gusting to 17 miles (27 km), from the east. Optimally, pilots want to land directly into the wind, which allows a plane to land at a slower speed relative to the ground. While aircraft are allowed to land with moderate winds from the side or the rear, such conditions can make it trickier, Wallace said. “Those are just combined additional factors,” Wallace said. “That’s often what causes these type of accidents, a combination of factors.” The incident highlights the risks at some older U.S. airports hemmed in by development or their placement near bodies of water that have prevented them from lengthening runways. “There is no question that shorter runways present more challenges to pilots, particularly in New York,” said Peter Goelz, former managing director at the NTSB who is now senior vice president at O’Neill & Associates in Washington. Because LaGuardia runs at maximum capacity for most of the day, flight crews have to be on their toes and may face greater pressures not to break off an approach than at other airports, Goelz said. “There is no room for mistakes,” he said. “There is inherent pressure to make the landings.” Safety Zone Pence’s campaign plane was landing toward the southwest on a 7,001-foot runway that lacked the required 1,000-foot safety zone at the end. The jet was slowed by a pad of crushable concrete designed for airports without the safety runoff areas mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to tweets by the agency and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates LaGuardia. Aircraft that roll into the Engineered Material Arresting System sink into the pad, preventing them from going off the end. Past Incidents The NTSB earlier this year faulted Delta Air Lines Inc. pilots for using the wrong technique for trying to stop a Boeing MD-88 on a snow-covered runway at LaGuardia. The plane skidded and its nose came to rest on a seawall on March 5, 2015. “Make no mistake: This was a very close call,” NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said at the hearing in Washington on the accident. A Southwest Airlines Co. 737-700 suffered major damage on July 22, 2013, when it slammed down so hard on a runway at LaGuardia that its nose wheel collapsed. The NTSB found that the captain on the plane, who didn’t follow airline procedures, should have aborted the touchdown after taking control from the copilot. The incident with Pence’s plane also falls into a category of air-carrier accidents that is the most common across the world, and which have frustrated investigators for decades, Wallace said. It’s extremely rare for a plane to go off the runway if pilots adhere to basic procedures governing their speeds and angle of descent as they approach the runway, he said. “I kind of consider it the accident that never goes away, even though the ingredients that prevent it are so simple,” Wallace said.

While the systems they are here to test may be unmanned or autonomous, the various projects have brought together in Scotland several dozens of the world’s foremost experts in unmanned technology for the two-week exercise. They appeared to outnumber the local population when representatives from the U.S. Navy, led by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), joined colleagues from the Royal Navy and various industry and research organizations at Benbecula’s West Camp and Range Head to test unmanned aerial vehicles as part of the first-ever Unmanned Warrior exercise beginning Oct. 8. Unmanned Warrior is part of Joint Warrior, a semiannual United Kingdom-led training exercise designed to provide NATO and allied forces with a unique multi-warfare environment in which to prepare for global operations. BENBECULA, United Kingdom. Scott Wiltermood, INSITU demonstration team manager, and Bronson Ignacio, an INSITU demonstration team specialist, mount an MQ-27A Scan Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle to a launcher at Benbecula Rangehead. More than 40 international participants from other navies, industry, academia and research laboratories are in Scotland conducting the first-ever Unmanned Warrior, a research and training exercise designed to test and demonstrate the latest in autonomous naval technologies while simultaneously strengthening international interoperability. Unmanned Warrior is part of Joint Warrior, a semiannual United Kingdom-led training exercise designed to provide NATO and allied forces with a unique multi-warfare environment in which to prepare for global operations. (U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Darby Dillon/Released) Capt. Beth Creighton, the U.S. team lead and command element for the exercise, said the various participants are examining unmanned capabilities in five mission areas: geospatial intelligence collection; mine countermeasures; intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance; anti-submarine warfare; and command and control. “The exercise accelerates learning by providing an opportunity for world-class innovators from U.S. and allied navies to collaborate with the private sector and academia in a challenging real-world environment,” Creighton said. “Data products from the remote unmanned systems testing locations are fed into exercise Joint Warrior to enhance naval coalition training.” The ONR team is partnering with an international contingent of more than 40 participating groups to conduct a broad range of tests and demonstrations on the latest in autonomous and unmanned naval technologies. In so doing, they are simultaneously strengthening international interoperability and partnerships that amplify the efforts to design advanced warfare systems that began decades ago. “Unmanned Warrior directly supports our Navy’s Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority by leveraging this high-velocity learning environment to experiment and demonstrate autonomous capabilities side-by-side with the fleet,” said Rear Adm. Mat Winter, the U.S. Navy’s Chief of Naval Research. “Scientific collaboration with allied navies has historically expanded and strengthened partnerships foundational to future coalition operations. This is especially important in the new frontier of naval autonomy, which improves war fighting effectiveness and accelerates the delivery of breakthrough capabilities to our Sailors and Marines in the battle space.” Lt. Cmdr. Rollie Wicks, a member of the Secretary of the Navy’s Naval Innovation Advisory Council (NIAC), is in Benbecula working closely with the Royal Navy and demonstrating the Airborne Computer Vision (ACV), an ONR-funded semi-autonomous targeting system aboard a Scan Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Wicks said the systems he’s operating will “affect future naval operations significantly.” In just a few days after arriving in Benbecula, the U.S. and U.K. navies successfully enabled interoperability between coalition systems to share blue force tracking data and intelligence. The ACV system accurately detected and reported more than twice the number of vessels at sea than the human-only operated missions. “This capability, with its rapid processing of imagery on board, should increase the speed of warfare significantly,” Wicks said. “The image is processed in seconds, rather than minutes after collection, and we’re generating all the information that is required to target a potential enemy combatant at sea. That’s a real game changer for the U.S. Navy.” For Bronson Ignasio, of Boeing’s unmanned systems subsidiary, Insitu, the advances made during Unmanned Warrior are the result of years of learning the best practices for implementing unmanned and autonomous platforms on the battlefield, such as the Scan Eagle UAV. “It all started in 2003, after the invasion,” Ignasio said. “Scan Eagle deployed with the Marines to Fallujah, Iraq where it played a critical role providing air support for troops on the ground and giving ground commanders real-time intelligence to make calls at the same time.” “At first, Scan Eagle was a more tactical asset,” he said. “We were providing cover for squad-based elements going down the road knocking on doors and providing expanded situational awareness for the guys on the ground. Now, we’re looking for targets or conducting search and rescue operations, conducting simulated man overboard scenarios or looking for potential targets or threats to the battle group. For smaller companies, the exercise enables them to demonstrate technologies and capabilities in a larger setting alongside defense industry giants. AutoNaut Ltd. is a micro company with only 10 employees. Dan Aldis, currently demonstrating the AutoNaut unmanned surface vehicle (USV), said it is designed to deliver persistent offshore data capture in support of anti-submarine warfare using a unique wave propulsion system. “Participation in Unmanned Warrior gives us the opportunity to work alongside larger partners in industry such as Boeing and QinetiQ,” Aldis said. Unmanned Warrior is providing opportunities for collaboration across the board, which the exercise leads agree will strengthen coalition capability for future operations. Cmdr. Peter Pipkin, the Royal Navy’s fleet robotics officer and the UK’s driving force for planning and coordination of Unmanned Warrior, said the unique gathering of international naval warfighters with unmanned system experts has been an environment conducive to considerable synergy. “Where else can you harvest the diversity of technology and problem-solving approaches that each team brings to the maritime autonomy challenge?” Pipkin asked. “I witnessed the rapid evolution of unmanned systems in real-time as needs flowed from the fleet to scientists, to software engineers and back again, in days instead of months or even years. Our partnership with the U.S. Navy and ONR remains a cornerstone for the path ahead of us.” The Unmanned Warrior exercise concludes Oct. 20.

Traders are also digesting the latest batch of earnings news from several big-name companies. U.S. stocks went about a lackluster run yet again on Thursday before ending lower. The major averages opened higher but saw volatility in morning trading. After recovering in late morning trading, the Dow Industrials and the S&P 500 Index held mostly above the unchanged line before pulling back into the red going into the close. The Dow ended down 29.65 points or 0.16 percent at 18,170, and the S&P 500 Index closed 6.39 points or 0.30 percent lower at 2,133. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite spent the better part of the session below the unchanged line before ending down 34.29 points or 0.65 percent at 5,216. Eighteen of the thirty Dow components ended the session lower, while the remaining twelve stocks advanced. Chevron (CVX), Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) were among the worst performers of the session, but DuPont (DD), Verizon (VZ) and IBM (IBM) rose sharply. Among the sectors, real estate, networking, gold, housing, and steel stocks saw considerable weakness on the day, while notable strength was visible among telecom and trucking stocks. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims fell to 258,000 in the week ended October 22nd from an upwardly revised reading of 261,000 reading for the previous week. However, the four-week average rose to 253,000 from 252,000. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag fell by 15,000 to 2.039 million in the week ended October 15th. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent month-over-month in September. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent increase for the month. However, the previous month's flat reading was upwardly revised to 0.3 percent growth. Excluding transportation, orders climbed 0.2 percent, ahead of the 0.1 percent increase expected by economists. August's reading was revised to 0.1 percent growth from the 0.4 percent drop estimated earlier. Annually, orders climbed 1.6 percent. Core capital goods orders fell 1.2 percent month-over-month, although shipments of this category were up 0.3 percent, boding well for the third quarter GDP data. Pending home sales climbed 1.5 percent month-over-month in September, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors. Economists expected a 1 percent increase for the month. The previous month's drop was downwardly revised to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent. Geographically, the South and the West saw strong increases. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for December delivery are falling $0.45 to $49.27 a barrel after climbing $0.54 to $49.72 a barrel on Thursday, snapping a 3-session retreat. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,265 an ounce, up $4.50 from the previous session's close of $1,269.50 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rose $2.90. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 105.21 yen compared to the 105.29 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0917 compared to yesterday's $1.0897. Asia Asian stocks ended mixed once again, with a weaker yen, the listless trading on Wall Street overnight and wariness concerning the U.S. third quarter GDP data among the catalysts. The Japanese market advanced on the yen weakness. The Nikkei index 225 Index opened higher and moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session before ending up by 109.99 points or 0.63 percent at a 6-month high of 17,446. The gains came as the yen breached the 105 level and solid results from German bank Deutsche Bank as well as increases in U.S. and Japanese government bond yields lifted financials. The Australian market ended modestly lower after profit warnings from ANZ and insurer AMP. The All Ordinaries Index ended down 7.50 points or 0.14 percent at a more than 1-month low of 5,371, extending losses for the third straight session. China's Shanghai Composite index dropped 8.08 points or 0.26 percent to 3,104, as losses in the infrastructure sector overshadowed gains among financials in the wake of well-received earnings updates from banks and brokerages. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 177.54 points or 0.77 percent at 22,955. In major corporate news from the region, Samsung Electronics climbed 2.6 percent after its shareholders voted to appoint 48-year-old Lee Jae-yong, Chairman Lee Kun-hee's only son, to its board of directors. On the economic front, Japan reported inflation data showing that the country's core inflation rate hit a three-year low in September. Separate reports showed that the jobless rate fell to 3 percent from 3.1 percent in the previous month, while household spending slumped again in the month. Europe European stocks are also going about a lackluster run amid a sell-off in global bonds and reactions to mixed earnings reports. On the economic front, the European Commission showed that a gauge of Eurozone economic confidence hit a 10-month high in October. The headline index rose more than expected to 106.3 from 104.9 in September. Separately, French consumer spending unexpectedly dropped 0.2 percent in September after a 0.8 percent increase in August, preliminary data from statistical office INSEE revealed. French annual consumer price inflation remained stable at 0.4 percent in October, while producer prices edged up 0.1 percent month-over-month after remaining flat in the previous month. U.S. Economic Reports A report released by the Commerce Department showed that economic activity increased by more than expected in the third quarter. The report said real gross domestic product climbed by 2.9 percent in the third quarter after rising by 1.4 percent in the second quarter. Economists had expected 2.5 percent growth. The Commerce Department said the stronger than expected growth reflected positive contributions from consumer spending, exports, private inventory investment, federal government spending, and non-residential fixed investment. The University of Michigan is due to release its final U.S. consumer sentiment index for October at 10 am ET. Economists expect the index to come in at 88.5, up from the flash estimate of 87.9 but down from 91.2 in September. Stocks in Focus Energy giant Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported better than expected third quarter earnings but on revenues that came in below analyst estimates. Rival Chevron (CVX) reported third quarter results that exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported better than expected third quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenues. Aggregate paid clicks rose 33 percent, while cost per click fell 11 percent. Amazon's (AMZN) third quarter earnings per share trailed estimates, while its sales exceeded estimates. The company's fourth quarter revenue guidance was in line. Amgen (AMGN) reported forecasting-beating third quarter results and raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year. Baidu.com (BIDU) reported downbeat results for its third quarter and its fourth quarter revenue guidance was weak. LinkedIn (LNKD), which has inked a deal to be acquired by Microsoft (MSFT), reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenues that trailed estimates. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Vivendi Turns To Profit In Q3, Revenues Up; Maintains View K+S Group Posts Q3 Negative EBIT I; Cuts 2016 EBIT I View Frankfurt Airport Oct.

Bond yields climbed to their highest levels since May, which helped banks and hurt stocks that pay big dividends. Stocks started the day higher and were flat at midday, then gradually slid through the afternoon. Cable and TV companies and publishers sank, and industrial companies like Raytheon and L-3 Communications fell after reporting weak results. Bond prices fell and yields climbed. That helped banks, since they’ll earn more from lending as interest rates rise. It also sent high-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies lower as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Scott Kimball, co-portfolio manager of the BMO TCH Core Plus Bond Fund, said investors believe that central banks will cut back on bond buying. In recent days that’s sent prices lower and yields higher. “The largest bond buyers, the biggest bond managers in the market, have been these central banks,” he said. Kimball added that yields could rise further if economic growth picks up. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,169.68. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index sank 6.39 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,133.04. The Nasdaq composite lost 34.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,215.97. Comcast continued to fall as investors worried about competition it could face from a new online TV service like AT&T’s DirectTV Now, which was announced Tuesday. Comcast lost $1.08, or 1.7 percent, to $61.48 after falling 3 percent Wednesday. Competitor Charter Communications and TV networks like CBS and Twenty-First Century Fox also skidded. Automaker and auto parts retailers also fell, which contributed to the losses for consumer companies. Raytheon gave up $5, or 3.5 percent, to $136.28 as its outlook failed to impress investors. Communications and surveillance company L-3 Communications gave up $10.96, or 7.4 percent, to $137.75 after it posted weak sales. Aerospace giant Boeing slipped after a big surge Wednesday. U.S. government bond prices dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 1.85 percent from 1.79 percent a day earlier, its highest yield in almost five months. Bristol-Myers Squibb broke out of a slump after it raised its annual forecasts. The stock has fallen by about one-third since early August as investors worried about sales of its cancer treatment Opdivo. The stock rose $2.67, or 5.4 percent, to $51.96. Celgene also raised its forecasts as sales of its cancer drug maker Revlimid kept rising. The stock added $6.34, or 6.4 percent, to $104.75. Smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm said it will buy NXP for $38 billion, or $110 per share in cash. Qualcomm jumped $1.89, or 2.8 percent, to $70.09 and NXP rose 42 cents to $99.09. The deal has been rumored for about a month and investors were excited about the prospect. Qualcomm has climbed 10 percent and NXP is up 20 percent since it was first reported that the companies were in talks. Phone companies Level 3 Communications and CenturyLink surged after the Wall Street Journal said the two companies are in talks to combine. CenturyLink soared $2.75, or 9.7 percent, to $31 and Level 3 climbed $4.95, or 10.5 percent, to $51.87. AT&T, Verizon and Frontier Communications also rose. Newspaper publishers Gannett and Tronc, the company formerly known as Tribune Publishing, both slumped on reports they may not be able to combine. Bloomberg reported Thursday that banks financing the deal were not willing to help fund it. The report cited anonymous sources and said the companies were still talking. USA Today publisher Gannett dropped $1.69, or 17.1 percent, to $8.21 and Tronc fell $4.73, or 27.8 percent, to $8.21 in heavy trading. Earnings continued to pour in after the closing bell. Amazon fell 4 percent in aftermarket trading after its profit fell short of analysts’ estimates, and Alphabet, the corporate parent of Google, rose 1 percent after it surpassed expectations. Oil prices recovered after falling for three days in a row. U.S. benchmark crude rose 54 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.72 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, added 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $50.47 a barrel in London. ZTO Express, an express delivery company in China, went public in the largest IPO of the year so far. The company’s offering of 72.1 million U.S. shares raised $1.4 billion. The offering priced at $19.50, and shares lost $2.93, or 15 percent, to $16.57. The dollar rose to 105.30 yen from 104.54 yen. The euro dipped to $1.0896 from $1.0906. Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas added 3 cents to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold rose $2.90 to $1,269.50 an ounce. Silver rose 1 cent to $17.64 an ounce. Copper picked up 2 cents to $2.16 a pound. Germany’s DAX stock index picked up 0.1 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose 0.4 percent. The French CAC 40 was little changed. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.3 percent while South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 0.8 percent. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, after, companies, communications, investors, cents, Other stories from today: More changes await Twitter users as service tries to grow American and Southwest raises base fares by $5 each way Apple adds keyboard touch functions to Mac in refresh     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   In six months, the economy will be ...

REUTERS/Matt Mills McKnight/File Photo SHANGHAI Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] have signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the coastal city of Zhoushan. The deal, signed at a ceremony on Friday, follows an agreement between the two companies inked in September last year to open a center to install interiors, paint liveries and deliver 737 aircraft to Chinese customers. A Boeing spokesman confirmed the signing to Reuters, which was reported by CAAC News, a publication run by China's aviation regulator. The facility is Boeing's first 737 completion plant outside the United States and comes as the U.S. planemaker and its European rival Airbus fiercely compete for plane orders in China. Airbus already has two plants in China.

"A package of information was handed over to the Dutch authorities by the Russian public prosecution department,” Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur said Wednesday, as quoted by the Dutch News portal. In an interview with Sputnik, Eduard Popov, a senior researcher at the Institute of Russian Diasporas in Moscow, said that, judging from the initial response, the Dutch authorities have no interest whatsoever in any information provided by the Russian side. “This is a clear case of an anti-Russian bias on the part of the Dutch. Which is all the more surprising because it is in their best interest to ask Russia to provide all possible information [about the crash], like satellite photos, or seek assistance from Russian specialists. They never asked for any help from us and all this time they have been dragging their feet on examining our information,” Popov said. He added that even though the West had already “designated” the culprits, it didn’t mean that Russia should stop proving its innocence. “We must keep doing this no matter what. This situation reminds me of the August 2008 events in South Ossetia when the US and Europe outright rejected out point of view only to tacitly accept it afterwards. I think this is exactly what is going to happen in the case of the Malaysian Boeing and the West will grudgingly admit that we were right.” © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov Russia Transfers to Netherlands Data on MH17 Crash - Dutch Justice MinisterEduard Popov said that Russia has enough information to prove that it was in no way involved in the downing of the Malaysian airliner and enough proof of the Ukrainian military’s responsibility of that tragedy. “Apart from the JIT, there are many international aviation organizations out there which we can and should bring on board to prove our case,” Eduard Popov said. The transferred information contains radar data related to the crash. Ard van der Steur said, according to Dutch television channel NOS, that the international investigation commission conducting the inquiry into the disaster, would  evaluate the data and decide whether it could be used in the ongoing probe. Russian concern Almaz-Antey earlier said that it had primary radar data about the air situation in the area of the crash of Flight MH17. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) tasked with probing the crash announced in September that the Malaysian airliner was allegedly downed by a Buk missile system, which had been brought in from Russia and consequently returned there. © AP Photo/ Nicholas Garriga 'Relatives are Our Only Allies': MH17 Investigators Won't Accept Russian DataThe Russian Foreign Ministry cast doubt on the conclusions of the investigators because it was based solely on information provided by the Ukrainian side. Earlier experiments conducted by Almaz-Antey proved that the missile that shot down the Malaysian Boeing was fired from the territory controlled by the Ukrainian army. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down over eastern Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. All 298 people on board, including 80 children and 15 crew members, were killed. ...

ADVERTISING INQUIRIES HERITAGE TRAVEL DIRECTORY PRIVACY POLICY Close Jack Northrop’s “Flying Ram” facebook twitter linkedin pinterest print By Jon Guttman 10/28/2016 • Aviation History, Aviation History Magazine, Gear, Mag: Aviation History Aircraft Jack Northrop’s XP-79B jet fighter looked unusual, but its method of attack was even more bizarre. In the late stages of World War II, American bomber formations over Germany were occasionally attacked by a small, rocket-powered interceptor, the Messerschmitt Me-163 Komet. Fast as the Me-163s were, however, they were usually more spectacular than effective. Nevertheless, American aircrews must have marveled at the technology behind such an advanced-looking weapon–unaware that since 1942, something similar had been secretly under development in their own country. The fighter that eventually became the Northrop XP-79B had an astonishing parallel development to the Me-163. It began in 1942 as a rocket-powered flying wing, but, in contrast to the Me-163, the American design was later adapted for jet power. Another difference between the XP-79B and its distant German cousin lay in their methods of attack. The Me-163 was meant to defend a faltering Third Reich with wing-mounted 30mm cannons or unguided rockets. The XP-79B’s main means of downing its adversaries is best expressed in its nickname–Flying Ram. John K. (“Jack”) Northrop designed numerous advanced aircraft of conventional configuration, but he was fascinated by the flying-wing concept. He believed that such a pure airfoil surface would have the most efficient lifting capabilities. Also, the absence of a fuselage and tail unit would mean less drag to affect overall performance–as well as lower production costs. Shortly after designing Lockheed’s famed Vega series of monoplanes, Northrop formed a small company of his own, the Avion Corporation in Burbank, Calif. His first Flying Wing made a successful maiden flight from Burbank Airport in 1929. It was originally powered by a single tractor-mounted engine, and tail surfaces mounted on twin booms aft of the wing increased controllability. Northrop’s creation was modified to pusher-engine configuration before undergoing further flight testing at Muroc Dry Lake, Calif. Avion was renamed the Northrop Aircraft Corporation that same year and became part of United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, an early superconglomerate that also included Boeing. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Northrop temporarily shelved his flying-wing dream to create some solid moneymakers, like the record-breaking Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta series of high-speed mail planes, and military designs such as the BT-1 and A-17. Then in 1939, Northrop broke away from United to form a completely independent firm, Northrop Aircraft Inc., and relocated to Hawthorne, Calif. He obtained subcontracts to manufacture other companies’ aircraft before gaining his first new contract for a design of his own–an order from Norway for 24 N-3PB seaplane patrol bombers. Northrop felt confident enough to resume his flying-wing experiments in 1940. His next attempt, the N-1M, was the genuine article, dispensing with the boom-mounted tailplanes. It first took to the air on July 3 with Vance Breese at the controls. Breese reported that the N-1M handled well and seemed to require less horsepower than a conventional aircraft to achieve the performance he wrung out of it. The N-1M originally was powered by twin 65-hp Lycoming engines driving pusher propellers, but it underwent several changes in power plant and wingtip configuration in the course of more than 200 flights. Fortunately, the historic N-1M was preserved, and it is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum. Northrop continued to experiment with flying wings like the N-9M and JB-1 during World War II. He also produced a fighter, the XP-56 Black Bullet (see “Aerial Oddities” in the May 1991 issue). This was a pusher-engine canard design that was almost all wing. (There was a tailless fuselage of sorts, from which dorsal and ventral vertical control surfaces protruded.) The XP-56 proved to be a failure, but that was compensated for by the brilliant success of Northrop’s more conventional twin-engine, twin-boom night fighter, the P-61 Black Widow. Northrop’s flying-wing concept took a dramatic step forward in 1942, when he convinced the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) that he could build a fighter that could reach the speed of sound. Beneath the USAAF-classified wraps, “Project 12,” as the design was designated, was a rocket-powered flying wing with a wingspan of only 32 feet. The pilot was to fly it in a prone position, the rationale being that such a posture would make him less vulnerable to G-forces and raise his “blackout threshold” beyond normal human limits. The first experimental vehicle under Project 12 was the MX-324, a glider that was to be followed by a powered version called the MX-334. A simple steel tube and wood affair with faired, fixed landing gear, the MX-324 had a wire-braced vertical fin that looked as if it had been added as an afterthought–which, in fact, it had been, since it could be and later was removed. In one of the most undignified methods ever devised for getting into an airplane, the pilot had to clamber up on the trailing edge of the wing and slither on his stomach through a triangular hatch. After some unsuccessful attempts to use an automobile to tow the MX-324 skyward, it was towed into the air behind a Lockheed P-38 Lightning. During an early flight, the MX-324’s test pilot, prewar racing pilot Harry Crosby, encountered trouble when turbulence behind the P-38 towplane flipped the glider upside down. The MX-324 went into a spin. Even when it suddenly came out of the spin, it was still inverted and descending in ever-tightening circles. Crosby jettisoned the two-part hatch-canopy, climbed out on the wing and kicked free. After his parachute opened, however, he saw the runaway glider coming right at him. As luck would have it, the wayward wing narrowly missed Crosby and came down in the desert a short distance from where he came to earth. Little could Crosby have suspected that he would find himself in a similar situation in a similar airplane two years later…with a far less happy landing. The MX-334 took to the air in October 1943 for some unpowered testing while the Aerojet Corporation completed its XCAL-200 rocket engine, which was to be powered by monoethyaniline fuel, oxidized by red fuming nitric acid. The MX-334 made its first flight with the new engine on June 23, 1944, and fulfilled Northrop’s promise to the USAAF. Although capable of only 3.5 minutes of powered flight, it was the first American rocket-powered aircraft to fly. Despite the effort put into the secret project, the USAAF ultimately concluded that the rocket-powered MX-334 was a dead end. Much research data had been culled from it, however, and Northrop had a spinoff of Project 12 in the offing that the USAAF regarded as being militarily far more feasible–the XP-79. Essentially, the XP-79 was an interceptor that would bring down its opponents by ramming them in flight. During the early months of the German invasion of Russia in 1941 and 1942, Russian fighter pilots had frequently resorted to various taran, or midair ramming techniques. There was no real need for American fighter pilots to resort to such tactics, however, and the USAAF officer who came up with the idea for the ram fighter may be grateful that his identity is lost to history. In any case, in January 1943, Northrop was awarded a contract to build three XP-79 Flying Ram prototypes, each of which was to be powered by an Aerojet rocket engine with 2,000 pounds of thrust. A plague of developmental problems with the proposed Aerojet engine, and the unlikelihood of its being able to keep the plane airborne for more than 30 minutes, led the USAAF to cancel its order for the rockets and for two of the XP-79s that were to be powered by them. The Army did, however, consent to completion of the third prototype, which used two Westinghouse 19B axial-flow jet engines with 1,345 pounds of thrust each. The jet-engine revision, designated the XP-79B, weighed 5,840 pounds empty and 8,669 pounds with a full operational load. Like its rocket-powered precursor, the jet-powered XP-79B was essentially a wing, with the pilot lying on his stomach between the two jet engines. His head protruded into an acrylic-plastic windshield fitted with an armor glass section. An overhead hatch gave him entry to and, if necessary, a hasty exit from the cabin. As radical as the XP-79’s all-wing configuration looked, its structure was equally unusual. The airframe was made of heavy-gauge magnesium. The leading-edge skin was three-fourths of an inch thick; reinforcing steel armor plate of one-fourth-inch thickness was heliarc-welded at a 45-degree angle just inside the wing’s leading edge. The wingspan was 38 feet, with a wing area of 278 square feet. Overall, the XP-79 was 14 feet long and 7 feet high. Upon receiving reports of approaching enemy bombers, the XP-79B was intended to take off with the aid of JATO (jet-assisted takeoff) packs at an estimated rate of 25,000 feet in 4.7 minutes. Reaching an altitude of 40,000 feet, the Flying Ram would then dive into the formation of enemy aircraft at an estimated speed of up to 547 mph and clip their wing or tail surfaces with its own reinforced wings. Even among the USAAF brass, someone must have recognized the absurdity of that idea, because the XP-79B order also stipulated that the fighter should accommodate four .50-caliber Browning machine guns outboard of the jet engines. Neither the guns nor the cockpit pressurization system (allowing the pilot to function at 40,000 feet) were destined to be installed in the plane. Painted white overall, and given the serial number 43-32437, the prototype XP-79B was covered with canvas and trucked to the Muroc Dry Lake testing facility. Its first taxiing tests were conducted in June 1945–during which its tires burst on several occasions. Finally, on September 12, 1945, Harry Crosby prepared to take the XP-79B up for its maiden flight–and almost ran into disaster before he got off the ground. As the plane accelerated down the runway, an Army firetruck pulled out directly in its path. Crosby chopped the throttle but then applied power again as the truck got out of his way. Taking off without further incident, Crosby climbed to 10,000 feet. During the next 15 minutes, he flew back and forth over the field, testing the exotic plane’s ability to turn. Things suddenly went wrong during one such turn, and degenerated into a nose-down spin. After a brave but futile effort, Crosby finally judged it impossible to regain control of the plane. Jettisoning the escape hatch, he tried to leap clear–only to be struck by the wildly gyrating wing. Crosby fell to his death, his parachute unopened. The XP-79B slammed into the desert floor and exploded in a white-hot flare of magnesium that consumed the entire plane. Northrop’s engineers determined that the control problem that had cost Harry Crosby his life could be corrected, but the USAAF decided to abandon the XP-79B project. World War II was over, the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star was entering production, and other, more conventional jet designs were showing greater promise than the flying-ram concept. The techniques involved in the production of the XP-79B would later help in the development and mass production of the ultimate realization of Jack Northrop’s flying-wing dream–his giant B-35 and B-49 bombers. Judged on its own merits as a fighter, however, the Flying Ram was a preposterous idea from the outset–a waste of time, money and effort, as well as the life of one of America’s finest test pilots.

"Bond investors that were worried the UK and Europe were going off a cliff got a bit more relaxed."  Quotes in the article Ford Motor Co F ▼ 12.04 -0.02 -0.17% Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY ▲ 56.69 +0.13 +0.23% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 743.24 +24.17 +3.36% The Dow Jones industrial average gyrated between gains and losses before closing 29 points lower, with IBM contributing the most gains, offsetting losses in Boeing. The S&P 500 also held near the flatline for a large part of the session before closing 0.3 percent lower, with telecoms advancing 1.6 percent to lead advancers and real estate falling 2.4 percent to lead decliners. The Nasdaq composite lagged, dropping 0.65 percent. "I think you're seeing a tug of war between earnings ... and rising yields. I think the rise in yields is a bit of a correction," said Jim Davis, regional investment manager for The Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. U.S. Treasury yields rose broadly, with the two-year note yield trading around 0.88 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 1.84 percent, following other sovereign bond yields. Yields in other countries, such as Brazil, Italy and India also spiked. "Since the end of June, there has been a very high correlation between the Japanese yen and the U.S. 10-year note," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, adding that as the yen falls, so does the benchmark U.S. note. "This relationship is a trading relationship, so it's not long-term, but it's most evident at the long end of the curve." The U.S. dollar traded higher against a basked of currencies, with the euro near $1.09 and the yen falling to 105.3. "I do have a feeling that something has changed here today, and that this 1.83 level on 10s may be more sustainable than last week," LeBas said. The 10-year UK Gilt yield popped about 10 basis points after better-than-expected GDP data from the United Kingdom, while the British pound fell 0.56 percent to $1.217. "Traders were waiting for an upbeat number and they have got one. The number came better than expected. But manufacturing and industrial sector have performed badly and this is what we want to emphasize," Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said in a note. "It is certainly too early to call that Brexit effects are over or they will not have an impact on the UK's growth. The resilience picture may continue, but our chief concern is towards the investment and business investment and foreign investors are very hesitant in this space," he said. On the earnings front, Colgate-Palmolive, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Ford and UPS are just a few of the companies that posted quarterly results before the bell. Alphabet, Amazon.com, LinkedIn and Baidu are among companies set to report after the bell. Corporate earnings have done well relative to expectations. According to data from The Earnings Scout, 50 percent of S&P 500 components had posted results as of Thursday morning, with 73 percent beating earnings estimates and 61 percent topping sales expectations. "Portfolio managers will focus on earnings as we progress through the heart of the Q3 reporting season," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note. "Extremely sanguine profit forecasts for the next calendar year have stabilized thereby compressing multiples on a daily basis. The forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 currently resides 4.6% below its post-financial crisis peak to give shares the opportunity to enjoy a healthy Santa Claus rally after the dust settles around Washington." In economic news, initial jobless claims fell 3,000 to 258,000, while durable goods for September unexpectedly fell. Pending home sales, meanwhile, rose 1.5 percent in September. The advanced read on third-quarter U.S. GDP is due Friday morning. U.S. economic data have been of special importance to investors recently, as they gauge the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising rates later this year. The central bank is scheduled to meet next week and, while monetary policy is largely expected to remain unchanged, market participants expect a quarter-point rate increase after the Fed's December meeting. But despite the deluge of corporate results and economic data, U.S. stocks have largely stayed range-bound, with the S&P having fallen just 1.25 percent over the past three months, as of Wednesday's close.  "Overall, you have a market that has gone back and forth; I think we're just waiting for a catalyst," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "When you look at the tone of the market, you have fewer and fewer stocks leading it higher."   She also said there are still some concerns surrounding the outcome of the U.S. election on November 8. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump has slightly narrowed recently, according to data from RealClearPolitics. European equities erased earlier gains, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling 0.01 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mostly lower, with the Nikkei 225 slipping 0.32 percent and the Shanghai composite falling 0.13 percent. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded higher, near 14.9. U.S. crude for December delivery rose 1.1 percent to settle at $49.72 per barrel. Gold futures for December delivery rose $2.90 to settle at $1,269.50 per ounce.

(Lisa Dunlap Photo) The efforts by an environmental group to claim water rights along the middle Rio Grande are upsetting to some state legislators from the area. Rep. Candy Spence Ezzell, R-Roswell, called a claim by the WildEarth Guardians to obtain some water rights in the Rio Grande a concerning development on Thursday as she and other state legislators met in Roswell. “What’s to stop any other special interest group from making such a claim?” she asked. “The State Engineer,” responded Chris Lindeen, deputy general counsel with the Office of the State Engineer, which is the state agency administering state water resources. The discussion occurred as part of three days of public meetings held by the Interim Water and Natural Resources Committee of the state legislature, a bicameral group formed in May with 17 officers and regular members and 37 advisory members. Several other topics were addressed on Thursday. They included mixed energy development in the area by major utility companies, new groundwater regulations, groundwater clean-up efforts, the newly opened solar energy facilities and economic development efforts in Chaves County. Ezzell serves as chair of the committee, which was formed to consider matters regarding water, agriculture, land use, natural resources and game and fish in the state. Rep. Bob Wooley, R-Roswell, an advisory member, also sat as chair Thursday, following protocol in which committee members from the hosting area chair the meeting. The first day of presentations occurred Wednesday at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in [auth] Socorro. Thursday and Friday, the committee is meeting at the Roswell Convention and Civic Center, 912 N. Main St. Water topics are the focus of 12 of the 17 presentations by government officials and business interests. During a Thursday morning presentation, Chris Lindeen, deputy general counsel of the Office of the State Engineer, discussed in-stream flow rights, or in-stream flow usage. Increasingly, he said, the State Engineer’s Office is receiving applications for groups wanting to claim rights to water flowing in creeks, streams and rivers even if they are not diverted. The majority of times, water rights are determined only for water diverted off of natural water sources for “beneficial” purposes. But a relatively new area of water rights law is making claims for water as it flows in natural water sources, with interested groups making the argument that the water needs to be regulated and protected in its natural environs to maintain species and habitats that rely on the water source. Lindeen informed the legislators that WildEarth Guardians are seeking allocations of several thousand acre-feet of water in the lower Rio Grande and asking the State Engineer’s Office to monitor the water usage. Lindeen said that, to obtain rights to in-stream flows, groups have to meet standards showing that the water is measurable and that the group has “dominion and control” over the water from the point of origin to an end point. That’s a high standard that most groups cannot meet, he said. Nevertheless, the issue upset Ezzell and some others. “I have a problem with people who are trying to get water when they are not water right owners,” she said after the meeting. “Water rights are never abandoned. (Special interest groups) are saying that they are inactive rights and wanting to make claim to them.” Wooley agreed with her view. “They do not own the water rights but they are trying to control the water,” he said. Ezzell called such action “frivolous” and worried that they tie up staff time and manpower on unnecessary activities. Rep. Matthew McQueen, D-Santa Fe, did not agree with the environmental group’s action, but said he supported its right to make legal claims for its argument. “In my opinion, the WildEarth Guardians filing legal actions are a stretch, but they have a right to do that and the State of Engineer has to try its case as well,” McQueen said. On its website, the WildEarth Guardians indicates that it has been involved in a campaign for two decades that employs various strategies, including litigation, to protect Rio Grande flows as a way to preserve endangered and threatened fish and wildlife. In an afternoon presentation, John Mulcahy, president of the Roswell-Chaves County Economic Development Corp., discussed recent business progress in the area. While he talked about the success of the Roswell and Chaves County Solar Centers, owned by NextEra Energy and providing electrical power to Xcel Energy, he also talked about what is needed to help grow business at the Roswell International Air Center, what he called “a $2 billion” asset for the area. The airfield is asking the legislature for $3 million to repair the leaking roof of the prime hangar on the airfield, the facility used by Dean Baldwin Painting, a local employer of about 200 people that paints 175 to 200 commercial airplanes a year. “We do have challenges out here in Roswell,” said David Mantay, general manager of Dean Baldwin. He explained that Boeing has expressed interest in having Dean Baldwin handle the overflow work for painting its aircraft. But when they took a tour of the Roswell facility, it rained and Boeing personnel watched as water fell on a plane that was being painted. He added that when he showed Boeing staff some of the planes Dean Baldwin had finished painting, they were impressed with the high quality of work. He stressed that facility improvements at the airfield are needed and would have benefits to New Mexico. “One of those opportunities for us would be additional space to accommodate our customers,” Mantay said, explaining that the company has a two-year waiting list of customers. Mulcahy told legislators that the airfield is a unique asset in the nation because it offers large runways, existing aviation-related businesses, abundant acreage, aviation-related educational and training programs, few and low taxes, and good weather. But, he said, “We don’t have enough storage.” He said that the airfield needs not only additional facilities but larger ones able to house aircraft larger than 737s. For that reason, the airfield has also asked for $10 million in funds through the Local Economic Development Act to build and upgrade hangars and warehouses for aviation industries. “We could have another 200 jobs overnight if we could fix the leaking,” said Mulcahy, who has made previous presentations to the Legislative Finance and Economic and Rural Development committees and who had a city of Roswell project manager with him to tell legislators that a roof repair has been identified and is ready to be utilized. “Please consider Roswell and southeast New Mexico when you are considering LEDA funds,” Mulcahy said. Wooley and Ezzell expressed their support for funding. “We are working hard to get the money for you,” said Wooley. Ezzell added that Mayor Dennis Kintigh of Roswell made the request for the roof repair to legislators in 2015, “but we just could not do it” due to state finances. Friday presentations will cover water regulations and watershed restoration, agri-tourism, oil and gas industry outlook and the equine Herpes epidemic. The meeting is slated to begin at 9 a.m. and continue until at least 3:30 p.m. The committee is also scheduled to meet Nov. 21 in Santa Fe.

A senior Cathay executive says the competitive environment "will be tough for a while". Rival Hong Kong Airlines will launch daily services to Auckland for on November 11 and mainland carriers Hainan Airlines and Tianjin Airlines will each fly three times a week from the end of the year. Cathay's A350XWB aircraft will operate daily on the Auckland-Hong Kong route from now on until December when it will be joined by a Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to provide a double-daily Cathay Pacific service during the summer. Cathay Pacific's director of sales and marketing, Dane Cheng, said the mainland Chinese carriers had experienced rapid growth in the domestic market and were now growing aggressively internationally. Cathay was also facing increased competition from Middle Eastern airlines, Emirates, Etihad and Qatar which had expanded rapidly in the past decade. "Everyone is expanding. It will be tough for a while," he said. "We all do our best. We have been in this market for 33 years but that doesn't mean we are complacent." Falling fuel prices meant airlines operating old aircraft don't need to retire them so quickly and they had become more viable, said Cheng. Continued below.

Cathay had dropped some business class seats to less than $3500 return to Europe to promote the flight. The airline has 48 A350XWBs on order, with six delivered already. They are particularly well-suited to the narrow, thin routes such as Hong Kong to Auckland. "The fact that we're putting one of our most state-of-the-art aircraft on to the Auckland route is proof that we do want to make sure that our customers are happy." WATCH: Cathay Pacific's new airliner fly into Auckland: Video The A350XWB features a lower effective cabin altitude, which helps lessen passenger fatigue, and reduced noise levels, which combined with other innovations "takes our passenger experience to a whole new level." Cheng said New Zealand had to be wary of attracting too many visitors. "Putting on more aircraft and capacity is not the most difficult thing. The most important is to look at whether the local markets have the adequate investment in growing the infrastructure. New Zealand is a high-quality place and don't want anyone to bring too many visitors in and have a bad experience." Cathay Pacific's newest airliner, the A350, flying into Auckland. Photo / Peter Meecham The plane, which competes with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, first entered service last year with Qatar Airways. Cathay Pacific started using the aircraft from the middle of this year. It replaces ageing Airbus A340s Cathay has been using on the Hong Kong-Auckland route. It's the same size as a Dreamliner and has a similar look, but the A350 has a distinctive nose with a wraparound sunglasses-style windscreen. The XWB (extra wide body) is more than 10cm wider than the Dreamliner. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration) ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Manufacturing and efforts to support clean energy dominated talks between President Barack Obama and new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday (September 30). Obama noted that the U.S. and India are two of the world's largest democracies adding, "We have so much in common, it is important for us to continue to deepen and broaded the existing framework of partnership and friendship that already exists." This is Modi's first to the United States since taking office in May. The meeting in the Oval Office, which came on the heels of a White House dinner and New York meetings with power players including Bill and Hillary Clinton and chief executive officers from Boeing and GE. It is something of a reversal of fortune for the 64-year-old politician who nearly a decade earlier, was banned from coming to the U.S. In 2005, Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat was denied a U.S. visa over rioting in his home state that killed more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, three years before. Modi, who denies wrongdoing, has been exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court probe. During the meeting, Modi told reporters he sought Obama's support for continuing to create access to Indian service companies. In addition to trade issues, the two leaders also discussed efforts to promote clean energy. Security issues were also touched on including efforts to fights ISIL as well as regional security with Afghanistan and Pakistan. On Tuesday, Modi scheduled to meet with other U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner. Modi is also scheduled to visit a number of memorials in Washington devoted to former Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, President Abraham Lincoln and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Press CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code http://reut.rs/1wbMHfn <iframe class="reuters-vidembed" width="700" height="394" src="http://www.reuters.com/assets/iframe/yovideo?videoId=346381046"></iframe> Close Once banned from US, Modi meets Obama at White House Wednesday, October 01, 2014 - 01:15 Top News » NYC builds sticky notes wall in defiance of... 3:02am IST - (1:31) Breakingviews TV: A makeup upstart Tue, 15 Nov, 2016 - (2:27) India seeks to quell public anger by raising...

Indian embassies overseas are getting in touch with major aircraft manufacturers for detailed information on the aircraft they can offer as well as the quantum and mode of technology transfer, a top defence ministry source told this newspaper. “It is understood Indian embassies have been instructed to conduct information-gathering through military attaches posted there. This is not a Request for Information (RFI) proposal as of now. In a few cases, requests have already gone, in some they are about to be sent,” the source said. “There have been a few unsolicited offers from major aircraft makers (recently). But we will be looking at the offers from the ‘Make in India’ perspective,” he added. At present, the Indian Air Force, the world’s fourth largest, has 33 fighter squadrons, far short of its critical strength of 42 squadrons. While the source did not detail which companies are being approached, the likely list will include Dassault Aviation, Boeing (US), Lockheed Martin (US), Saab (Sweden) and BAE (UK). The aircraft in contention are expected to be Rafale, F-18, F-16, Grippen and the Eurofighter. A Reuters report claimed that the value of the deal may go up to $15 billion (around `1 lakh crore), making it one of the biggest military aircraft deals in the country’s history. In June, Saab proposed to set up a huge establishment in India that will make fighters and other defence products. In August, Lockheed Martin made an offer to move its sole production line of the latest version of F-16-Block 70 to India from Texas to meet Indian and global needs. But both proposals are subject to the IAF choosing its fighter aircraft for its fleet. The source also said the hunt is at a very initial stage. As Jan Widerstrom, chairman and managing director of Saab India Tecnologies, told this newspaper in an interview recently: “Any fighter aircraft acquisition programme is going to be very complex in nature, given the number of parameters to be taken into consideration. In addition, a new programme would involve the establishment of a large aerospace ecosystem in India.” Location: India, Delhi, New Delhi MOST POPULAR 1 Varun Dhawan is now a self-confessed 'nudist'! 2 Ranveer and Ranbir shoot for their Koffee with Karan episode 3 Can Dwayne Johnson pull a Donald Trump and become American President? 4 Man accidentally gets 7-inch chopstick stuck in penis 5 Did Parineeti just crush someone's debut dream? more Columnist Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr Note ban economic quackery by govt?

Bill Shuster of being “too cozy” with America’s airline industry, and with one of theindustry’s female lobbyists in particular. “I’ve addressed this months ago,” Shuster said recently. “We were straightforward. … I, a single male, dated a woman who is a government affairs person. I put in place in my office a policy that she can’t lobby me or my congressional staff and I didn’t have to do that under the ethics rule but I did it anyway because I wanted to make sure we protected the integrity of the office and protected my integrity and made sure the voters of the 9th District knew about it.” Shuster said “Art Halvorson people” keep bringing up the issue, but Shuster contends it’s more serious that Halvorson was cited by state police with harassment, for allegedly grabbing and holding the wrist of a Shuster female campaign worker at a booth at the Fayette County Fair on Aug. 6. Halvorson pleaded not guilty to the citation. “That, to me, seems like a bigger issue than if I date somebody or not,” Shuster said. “I’m not cozy with any industry,” Shuster continued. “If you look at my record, on the legislation I’ve passed through my committee, which passed Congress and become law, it passes by wide margins, bipartisan. It’s not one side or the other. It’s a broad piece of legislation that’s supported by Democrats, Republicans and all kinds of industries. I think my record speaks loud and clear for itself. I’ve played by the rules and I pass legislation that gets tremendous support.” One of Shuster’s campaign fliers states that for him, job No. 1 is protecting jobs. He said he’s been doing that in part by voting for policies that led to “lowering taxes, reducing regulations and, of course, under Obama, we’ve been fighting him every step of the way to stop him from continuing to expand on these regulations that don’t make it any safer out there for the environment or workers. They just add costs and they hurt jobs. “Also, passing legislation on the highway bill and other infrastructure legislation … to reduce regulation, to get these dollars flowing out there to rebuild our infrastructure,” he said. Shuster said his role as chairman of the Transportation Committee gives the 9th District “a louder voice in Washington.” “I have been able to successfully pass transportation infrastructure legislation which is not only good for the district but good for America, and have done it on a bipartisan basis with broad support … doing what’s right for America … and for the people of the 9th Congressional District.” He said more could be done to reinvigorate the natural gas industry. “In the last 7ﾽ years, this administration has had 19 permits — and they’ve only approved two, maybe three — to allow for the construction of a liquefied natural gas facility at our ports to get this stuff into the worldwide market,” Shuster said. “This administration has sat on those permits. One has been approved and is built and is now shipping gas to other parts of the world. But we should have been at breakneck speed, been getting these facilities built because, if you go to Europe, while we’re getting $2 or $3 per unit for gas in the United States, Europeans are paying $12, $13 or $14 a unit. So sending it over there helps us get our gas industry going, creates jobs for Americans, helps our economy and it helps us internationally by helping our friends in Europe and helping us cut the legs out from under Putin and Russia. They hold Europe hostage over their gas.” Shuster chaired an Armed Forces Committee panel looking at the challenges small- and medium-size businesses face when trying to get contracts with the Department of Defense. “There’s quite a number of them, several in Indiana County … that are trying to do business with DOD,” Shuster said. “The problem of doing business with the Department of Defense is it’s so complicated and we’ve got to reduce the complications. … They are treated like a Boeing or a Lockheed, a big corporation. And some of these only have 10 or 15 employees and are producing some of the things that … are really on the cutting edge to help our soldiers and our war fighters, to help keep America safe. Reducing that complexity and encouraging these businesses to continue to go after government business is important.” America’s national debt — approaching $20 trillion — has to be a priority for Congress, according to Shuster. “We’ve got to stop the debt from growing, and the way you do it is you control government spending. You can’t cut your way out of it, but you can control it. … You’ve got to get this economy growing at 3 and 4 and 5 percent. That will create the economic activity to create the jobs. … That helps bring dollars into the federal government, to help us balance the budget while we’re trying to control spending.” Shuster said America’s debt could become a national security risk if the nation can’t pay its bills and can’t continue to build a strong military. In the spring, Shuster expressed concern about terrorists entering America from foreign lands, and the situation has not improved, in his opinion. “No, America has become more dangerous, I believe, with the Obama administration allowing refugees from broken countries, failed states to come into this country,” he said. “We don’t know where they’re from. We should put a pause on that, to make sure we know where people are coming from and who they are. “Also what we have now is home-grown terrorism, people who were born here in this country and have become radicalized. … It’s not just the government that has to do it. It’s every citizen’s responsibility to make sure they’re paying attention to what’s going on in their neighborhood and their community. … We’ve got to make sure that as citizens we’re vigilant because the police, the FBI, our intelligence community can’t see all these people all over the place. It takes Americans to be vigilant.” Shuster said Congress needs to do more to stem the opioid epidemic. “The federal responsibility is, first and foremost, to stop these drugs from coming into the United States and into Pennsylvania,” Shuster said. “Indiana County has seen a tremendous increase (in drug overdose deaths), it’s the fourth worst in the state.” Congress needs to work with law enforcement at all levels and make sure needed resources are available to help stop the unintentional overdose deaths, he said. Shuster also offered some advice to 9th District voters on the presidential race. “These two presidential candidates are going to have vastly different appointments to the Supreme Court,” he said. “And I, for one, believe the 11 judges Donald Trump put forward are the kind of justices we need on the Supreme Court. You can disagree with Donald Trump on this, that or the other thing, but … the Supreme Court should be the No. 1 issue going into the voting booth. (The new president) will get an appointment on the first day … probably two more appointments and maybe a fourth appointment. It will change the makeup of the court for a generation, two generations.” Print Comments() Email Next Article Photos of the Week, Oct. 23 - 29, 2016 October 29, 2016 10:51 AM by TERI ENCISO by KAYLA GRUBE by KEVIN STIFFLER Each week, the Gazette presents the people and places of the Indiana County area through the eyes of Gazette photographers and our readers.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Society Defence India ready to buy over 200 combat jets, but they have to be 'Made in India' Indian Air Force needs to make for sharply declining combat squadron strength, from the sanctioned 45 to current 32. Aditya Bhat   October 29, 2016 20:34 IST 11 Shares 11 Shares SAAB is ready to make Gripen in India.Creative Commons/US Air Force photo by 1st Lt. Christopher Mesnard The Narendra Modi government is ready to buy single-engine combat jets that can give fillip to its fast depleting combat fleet strength, but they must toe the Prime Minister's pet project Make in India, where a foreign manufacturer will have to tie-up with a local partner and make the jets in India. India could buy as many as 200 jets, which could eventually rise to 300 if the foreign manufacturer makes it in India, Reuters quoted IAF officials as saying. The deal, one of the biggest for the country, could be worth $13-$15 billion. Why advertise with us? Related India to take time in accessing F-16 and F/A-18 production line; technology transfer and job creation a priority for them, says Pentagon official Pentagon gives nod to proposal by Boeing, Lockheed to make frontline fighter jets in India India faces trouble from two neighbours, China and Pakistan, though the sanctioned strength in case of two-pronged attack is 45 squadrons of fighters, its current combat squadron has come down to 32 squadrons of fighters, which is the lowest in a decade. The IAF is also dealing with the phasing out of Russia-made MiG 21 squadrons, which is expected to bring it down to 31 squadron strength. So, in order to give impetus to the fighter squadron, the Central government signed a deal with France in August to buy high-end Rafale twin-engine jets from Dassault, worth $8.8 billion. The Rafale deal also include weapons package Meteor radar-guided Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile and Scalp long-range air to ground missiles. But the 36 jets fall short of its required strength to counter any threat from two theatres. PM Modi is, however, looking to kick-start India's nascent defence manufacturing industry by making foreign companies build in India. Two companies have shown interest -- US aerospace major Lockheed Martin and Swedish aerospace major Saab. Lockheed Martin has said that it is ready to set up production line for its single-engine F-16 fighter jets in India. The US giant has also said that it is also ready to export the jets that are made in India. Similarly, Saab has said that it is also ready to set up production line for single-engine Gripen fighter jets. "The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at," an officer was quoted as saying by Reuters. Building in India also implies transfer of technology, something that many have detested from. Defence Ministry Manohar Parrikar has written to companies asking them if they are ready to set up shop and the extent of transfer of technology, said a government source. The Modi government had to cancel the previous government's MMRCA deal, known as the mother of the deals for 126 Rafale fighters being made in India after the two sides could not agree on the terms for producing them in India. The government instead had to go in for only 36 of them, which will be arriving in fly-away conditions. Moreover, the indigenously made LCA Tejas, is further being delayed with only two aircraft being handed over to Indian Air Force and its maker, HAL, still conducting tests on several prototypes. Saab's Gripen offer Saab on the other hand is not only ready to set up Gripen fighter jet production line but is also ready to help build the local aviation industry. "We are very experienced in transfer of technology – our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line," said Jan Widerstrom, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. Widerstrom also confirmed of receiving a letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. The facility needs to produce at least 100 planes, said a source close to company. Lockheed Martin's F-16 offer Lockheed Martin too confirmed of getting a letter from defence ministry and said that it offered F-16 fighter jets. It also said that it offered to transfer the entire production line of F-16 to India. "Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world's only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world's largest fighter aircraft supply chain," said Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India. Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet offer Earlier this year in March, reports emerged that Boeing has offered twin-engine F/A-18 Super Hornets under the "Make in India" framework of the Indian government. The F/A-18 jets were also competitors at the previously cancelled MMRCA deal. US defence cooperation US dislodged India's traditional military supplier, Russia as the top arms supplier in recent years. India and US are also fast expanding their military ties with India ordering military hardware like Apache and Chinook helicopters. India is also looking to buy BAE Systems' M777 Howitzers. "We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development," said M Matheswaran, a retired Indian air marshal and former adviser at HAL to Reuters.

A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India — which the Air Force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out ageing Soviet-era aircraft — could be worth anything from $13-$15 billion, experts say, potentially one of the country's biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France's Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is desperately trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kickstart a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports. Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. And Sweden's Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. "The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at," said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. India's defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. "We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms' willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations," the person said. Operational Gaps India's air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engine fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fly-away condition. Adding to the military's problems is India's three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B S Dhanoa told parliament's defence committee that it didn't have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. Jet Makers Respond Saab said it was ready to not only produce its frontline Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. "We are very experienced in transfer of technology - our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line," said Jan Widerström, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry's letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. "Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world's only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world's largest fighter aircraft supply chain," Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. US Top Supplier Lockheed's offer comes on the back of expanding US-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India's top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engine F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. "We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development," said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL. He said the Indian government would be looking at producing at least 200 fighters, and then probably some more, to make up for the decades of delay in modernising the air force.

ALSO READ Gripen & F-16 compete in MMRCA re-run IAF kicks off contest to make single-engine fighters Ready to manufacture Rafale in India: Dassault CEO Saab links Gripen bid with Tejas to counter F-16 production numbers Ajai Shukla: Not another MMRCA fiasco, please Government is offering to buy hundreds of fighter planes from foreign manufacturers — as long as the jets are made in India and with a local partner, air force officials say. A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India — which the Air Force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out ageing Soviet-era aircraft — could be worth anything from $13-$15 billion, experts say, potentially one of the country's biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France's Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is desperately trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kickstart a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports. Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. And Sweden's Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. "The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at," said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. India's defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. "We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms' willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations," the person said. Operational Gaps India's air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engine fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fly-away condition. Adding to the military's problems is India's three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B S Dhanoa told parliament's defence committee that it didn't have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. Jet Makers Respond Saab said it was ready to not only produce its frontline Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. "We are very experienced in transfer of technology - our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line," said Jan Widerström, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry's letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. "Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world's only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world's largest fighter aircraft supply chain," Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. US Top Supplier Lockheed's offer comes on the back of expanding US-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India's top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engine F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. "We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development," said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL. He said the Indian government would be looking at producing at least 200 fighters, and then probably some more, to make up for the decades of delay in modernising the air force.

The injuries were 'non-critical' and those injured were shifted to Chicago-area hospitals for further evaluation, the American Airlines said in a statement on the company website. Pilots aborted take-off after the right-side engine of the Boeing-767 American Airlines Flight 383 caught fire on the runway, which the airline company attributed to an engine-related issue. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration blamed the problem on a blown tire. Following the incident at 2.35 pm local time, an emergency rescue operation took place and the 161 passengers and 9 crew members were evacuated safely using a chute within a few minutes. The fire was also brought under control swiftly. The FAA is investigating the incident.

Cascadia Advocate Offering daily news and analysis from the majestic Evergreen State and beyond, The Advocate is the Northwest Progressive Institute's unconventional perspective on world, national, and local politics. « Liveblogging the 2016 vice presidential debate from the great Pacific Northwest Frankie’s Pizza and Pasta closing after over two decades in Redmond: An appreciation » Friday, October 7th, 2016 Poll Watch: Tina Podlodowski narrowly ahead of Kim Wyman; I-732 well under fifty percent With November 8th only a month away, we’re starting to see new polling released on a near-daily basis. Today, KOMO TV and Strategies 360 released a new set of results from a recent poll they collaborated on, while Tina Podlodowski’s campaign distributed findings from a poll showing Podlodowski narrowly ahead of incumbent Republican Kim Wyman in the contest for Washington Secretary of State. With Governor Jay Inslee and U.S. Senator Patty Murray widely expected to cruise to new terms, and Attorney General Bob Ferguson without a Republican opponent this year, the marquee matchups are further downballot. Perhaps no contest is considered to be as close as that for Secretary of State. Incumbent Kim Wyman is the only Republican currently serving in the executive department, and faces an incredibly strong Democratic challenger in former Seattle City Councilmember and experienced business leader Tina Podlodowski. In the August Top Two election, Wyman garnered 47.9%. Podlodowski finished only 23,882 votes behind, capturing 46.13% of the vote. Democrats are fired up about Podlodowski’s chances, while Republicans are increasingly nervous about Wyman’s. Podlodowski’s campaign has just given them another reason to be concerned by releasing fresh polling that shows Podlodowski ahead. Normington Petts — which also counts Hillary Clinton, Jason Kander, and Tammy Duckworth as clients — reports that in a survey conducted from September 27th-29th of six hundred likely November voters, 35% of respondents said they planned to vote for Podlodowski, while only 31% planned to vote for Wyman. “Podlodowski leads despite the fact that nearly twice as many voters know Wyman,” noted NP’s Jill Normington in a memo prepared for public distribution. “Not only is Podlodowski already ahead of Wyman, the majority of undecided voters are Democrats. Of the 34% who are currently undecided, 53% are Democrats, while 25% are Independents and 22% are Republicans. Moreover, the undecided voters at the Secretary of State level are voting for Governor Jay Inslee for reelection 51%-21%. If Podlodowski has the necessary resources to persuade these undecided voters, she will be in a strong position to win in November.” The Normington Petts survey has a margin of error of ±4.0% Meanwhile, Strategies 360 and KOMO TV have released results that show U.S. Senator Patty Murray with a comfy lead over Republican challenger Chris Vance. “In this poll of 500 likely voters interviewed statewide, 57% said they would vote for Murray, as opposed to 36% for Vance,” reported KOMO’s Robert Mak. “Murray, first elected to the Senate in 1992, maintains a high approval rating with 57% viewing her favorably, and 30% having an unfavorable impression.” KOMO/Strategies 360 also released results for three of the six initiatives that are appearing on Washington’s ballot. They found: 62% support for Initiative 1433 (minimum wage and paid leave); 79% support for Initiative 1491 (extreme risk protection orders); 42% support for Initiative 732 (CarbonWA’s tax swap scheme). Back in June, NPI and Public Policy Polling asked a sample of likely voters about these same initiatives, and found the following: 58% support for Initiative 1433 (minimum wage and paid leave); 73% support for Initiative 1491 (extreme risk protection orders); 52% support for Initiative 732 (CarbonWA’s tax swap scheme). I-1433 and I-1491 polled 4% and 6% higher, respectively, in the KOMO/Strategies 360 poll than in our poll, which suggests that voters are actually becoming more enthused about these progressive ideas, not less. That’s encouraging. The same cannot be said about CarbonWA’s I-732, a proposal to levy a tax on pollutants and use the revenue to cancel out sales and B&O taxes — including much of what’s left of Boeing’s already-reduced tax obligations. With a month left to go, I-732 is under water. Only 42% of respondents surveyed by KOMO/Strategies 360 indicated support for I-732. 37% indicated opposition, and 21% reported that they are undecided. Undecided voters can swing yes or no, as CarbonWA pointed out several weeks ago after Stuart Elway published research showing lackluster support for I-732 and a high number of undecided voters. However, it is more common for undecided voters to break no than yes when a strong opposition campaign is in place to effectively make the arguments against. When in doubt, people tend to vote no. I-732 arguably faces stronger opposition than any of the other initiatives on the ballot this year. Though NPI would very much like to put a price on pollution, we oppose I-732 because we believe it is fatally flawed. So does the labor community and progressive organizations like OneAmerica. KOMO/Strategies 360 appear not to have polled on I-1501, I-1464, or I-735, which are also on Washington’s November 2016 statewide ballot. Like what you just read? Or found it thought-provoking?

Much of what you say is demonstrably inaccurate. Polling is increasingly favorable for I 732 In August it was 34% for, 37% against, 30% undecided The last poll is 42% for, 37% no, 21% undecided I 732 is now ahead and undecideds are moving towards it as they learn more about it. I 732 is the most progressive, pro-environment measure in decades and it is stunning you folks are not supporting it. A carbon tax is supported widely as the most effective way to reduce carbon usage. The funds are used to make our state tax system less regressive, something all progressives support. The revenue-negative estimates have been proven to be in error (check Sightline) and I732 is very, very close to neutrality. You can’t do any better. Do you folks want to end up like the Nader supporters who helped elect Bush? Do you want to have the responsibility of defeating the most progressive, effective means of reducing carbon usage available? You are working against facts and your own interests. Can you reconsider?…cliff mass Andrew Posted October 8th, 2016 at 12:38 PM | Permalink Cliff, it’s October. Ballots are about to drop. An initiative that’s well under fifty percent is in bad shape — period. Below fifty percent is a place that a Yes campaign does not want to be. Are the numbers for I-732 in the Strategies 360 poll better than the August Elway poll? Sure… but they’re also worse than NPI’s own poll back in June, which I referenced above and which you omitted in your comment. Add in our research, and you can’t say “polling is increasingly favorable for I-732”. We found I-732 with 52% support statewide in June. Best showing we’ve seen for it. KOMO/Strategies 360’s research puts I-732 at 42% support. And keep in mind that on the other initiatives they tested (I-1433, I-1491), they found higher support than we did. Those campaigns are clearly in a position to win. How the undecided voters break will certainly matter. But as I said above, when in doubt, people tend to vote no. We disagree with your characterization of I-732. There is very little about it we find progressive. Yoram Bauman has admitted that CarbonWA crafted I-732 in order to go chasing after Republican voters, who polling consistently shows are simply not interested in putting a price on pollution. As he said: I am increasingly convinced that the path to climate action is through the Republican Party. Yes, there are challenges on the right — skepticism about climate science and about tax reform — but those are surmountable with time and effort. The same cannot be said of the challenges on the left: an unyielding desire to tie everything to bigger government, and a willingness to use race and class as political weapons in order to pursue that desire. We can do so much better than I-732. I-732 dedicates no money to tackle our massive infrastructure deficit and ease our transition to a clean energy economy. Instead, revenue would be used to cancel out other taxes, including much of what is left of Boeing’s tax obligations. I advise you to stop trying to shame people into supporting I-732 by telling them that if they don’t vote for I-732, they will be akin to Nader supporters/Bush enablers. You’ve been saying this a lot, Cliff, and it’s not helping your cause. We’ve been discussing I-732’s flaws here on the Cascadia Advocate periodically for over a year. Our assessment is that I-732 is bad policy. NPI therefore recommends a NO vote on I-732. The real climate action plan on the ballot this year is Sound Transit 3, which we strongly support. In the words of Michael Brune: Sound Transit estimates that if Proposition 1 passes, the entire Sound Transit system by 2040 would reduce an estimated 793,000 tons of greenhouse-gas emissions annually and cut vehicle miles traveled by nearly 300 million to 400 million miles as people switch from sitting in traffic to riding on transit. If Washington state is going to do its part to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to the levels called for in the recently ratified Paris climate agreement, it needs an ambitious investment in rapid-transit like Sound Transit 3. We agree and we urge a yes vote on Regional Proposition 1. Christopher E Greacen Posted October 15th, 2016 at 5:29 PM | Permalink Andrew writes that Sound Transit Proposition 1 would reduce an estimated 793,000 tonnes of GHG annually. I-732, if approved, is expected to lead to a 10% reduction in WA’s annual emissions of 83 million tonnes of GHG. Do the math… that’s 8.3 million tonnes annually, or more than 10X what Proposition 1 hopes for. https://yeson732.org/plain-language/ While I think that Proposition 1 is worthy to vote for, it’s no substitute for a carbon tax. While I would also vote for a carbon tax that provides lots of revenues for crumbling infrastructure and green jobs, the fact is that a) tax increases are a tough sell in our state; and a) no such alternative initiative exists on the ballot — nobody but CarbonWA i732 managed to get off their butts to write one. We can’t afford to wait another 4 years. I urge a “yes” vote on i732. Drew Mahedy Posted October 17th, 2016 at 12:51 PM | Permalink I have to agree with Cliff on your opposition to I-732. It doesn’t make sense. I recently just registered in Clark County after living in Clackamas County, OR specifically to vote ‘YES’ on this proposition. As a former Oregonian (no sales tax) and someone who is currently unemployed, I can tell you how shameful it is for organizations purporting to be concerned about climate change AND low-income/minority communities to be actively telling Washingtonians to vote against this measure in the hopes that, someday in the future, we will have a ‘divine’ carbon tax scheme that exacerbates this state’s already horribly regressive tax system. It’s a sleight of hand and nakedly political agenda. British Columbia passed a revenue neutral carbon tax in 2008 or 2009 and it has been successful. The entire country of Canada will now have carbon tax as well. Washington State now has that opportunity and you’re telling us ‘NO’ because it would cost the state of Washington $800 million over 3 bienniums? Did you forget to tell voters what Washington’s annual revenue generation is and what percent that new shortfall would be? Did you forget to tell voters that fixing the budget shortfall prior to putting it on the ballot was not politically feasible and that any changes to the tax system, including what Boeing pays, can be made after it passes? Did you forget to tell voters that if it wasn’t revenue neutral or close to revenue neutral, as you have proposed, than you would be adding an additional sales tax to a state that has no income tax, thereby hurting low income communities not helping them? Did you forget to tell voters that Washington’s true budget shortfall is the result of relying predominantly on a sales tax in the age of the Internet and that this new tax shift was never designed to fix that problem? Did you forget to tell voters that Washington’s initiative process is governed by the single-subject rule and any alternative proposal including spending collected tax from a carbon tax on a host of environmental group’s wish list items could be open to legal challenge? Did you forget to tell voters that Republicans and conservatives are also people, that their voices matter, that they vote, and that your Yoram Bauman quote is ironically apt? Did you forget to tell voters that if they pass this measure now, it becomes more politically feasible for other states including Oregon and California, should its cap and trade system be deemed a tax and scrapped, to implement their own carbon tax schemes thus snowballing the movement to mitigate increasing global temperatures in a country with the technology and GDP to do it? Did you forget to tell voters what the current costs and trends are for the price of renewable energy and that further subsidizing those industries runs the risk of entrenching corporate interests and idiosyncratic lobbying efforts for decades to come as was the case for fossil fuels? Did you forget to tell voters that Washington’s energy production portfolio is already majority renewable when including hydroelectricity and that a carbon tax in this state is designed to mitigate transportation sector carbon emissions not energy production unless you think EV’s and vehicle automation are already mature and fully adopted technologies? …And who in their right mind (out of all the things written in this post) thinks that Sound Transit 3 is the ‘REAL’ climate action plan compared to I-732? Every transportation engineer would find that claim laughable. You want to wait until 2040 with all the known issues and uncertainties surrounding large transportation projects projected decades in advance to see which one reduced CO2 emissions more up to that point in time? Bye bye coastal Florida. For the record, Seattle is not the entire state of Washington. Just, you know, FYI. You aren’t telling voters these things because, like the lobbying groups, you have a narrow focus and mindset on what is right and what isn’t. Frankly, I’m glad economists at UW and not environmental and labor groups wrote this proposition because they’re not up to the task. They miss the forest for the trees on issues of the gravest importance. If you’re going to wait around to mitigate fossil fuel use by not compromising when the opportunity presents itself, your shooting yourself (and everyone else including Earth) in the foot (read: face). Get your act together. This is editorialized nonsense! Jason Hodin Posted October 17th, 2016 at 7:17 PM | Permalink Dear Andrew and all My personal and professional opinion is that some progressive groups like NPI who are opposed to I-732 are clearly making perfect the enemy of good. Andrew, I respect your opinion about I-732 not putting the taxes towards infrastructure and other climate mitigation (or climate reduction) strategies, but I respectfully disagree that it is “fatally lawed”.. Just look at what you said about ST3 (which I also support): “…the entire Sound Transit system by 2040 would reduce an estimated 793,000 tons of greenhouse-gas emissions annually…” The operative part of that sentence is 2040! That’s 25 years from now, a time when scientists tell us that we will have already blown past the ability to keep warming to 2°C and ocean acidification will by some estimates have already doomed most of the world’s coral reefs. That is unless we drastically reduce carbon pollution now, something which many economists and scientists alike agree that a carbon tax has the best chance of accomplishing. Just as many of us in WA state voted for I-502 despite its flaws, I would likewise suggest a vote on I-732 even if you think it doesn’t go far enough. You all know full well that taxes are VERY difficult to pass in this state, hence the revenue neutrality of this initiative. This is the same approach currently working well in British Columbia for the past seven years, and it is the strategy advocated by one of the leading (and original) voices in the USA arguing for urgent action on climate change: Dr. James Hansen. As for the B&O tax credit, this is a drop in the bucket compared to the tax breaks that Boeing already gets, so I think this is a distraction from the real issue at hand. The bigger issue is this tax credit addresses a very valid concern with raising a statewide carbon tax: manufacturers may decide to relocate. The key is this: polluters will pay more, thus incentivizing lower carbon manufacturing and other lifestyle choices throughout the state. On such an urgent issue like climate change, we do not have the luxury to wait when we are so clearly long overdue addressing it. We need to act now and act boldly. Any slight variations from revenue neutrality in I-732 can be fixed legislatively, but extinct animals and flooded islands can’t. Please vote YES on I-732. Sincerely Jason Hodin, Ph.D. Senior Research Scientist UW Friday Harbor Marine Laboratory Friday Harbor, WA Andrew Posted October 28th, 2016 at 9:29 PM | Permalink Drew, Jason, thanks for stopping by and sharing your thoughts. I’m disappointed to hear proponents of CarbonWA’s I-732 continue to hold up British Columbia’s experience as some kind of a success story, when it’s nothing of the sort. Drew, you wrote: British Columbia passed a revenue neutral carbon tax in 2008 or 2009 and it has been successful. The entire country of Canada will now have carbon tax as well. And Jason, you wrote: You all know full well that taxes are VERY difficult to pass in this state, hence the revenue neutrality of this initiative. This is the same approach currently working well in British Columbia for the past seven years, and it is the strategy advocated by one of the leading (and original) voices in the USA arguing for urgent action on climate change: Dr. James Hansen. Your comments lead me to wonder just how familiar you both are with the politics of British Columbia. I have been up there to cover their elections for NPI. I’ve met with activists and candidates; I’ve attended campaign events held by both of the main political parties (the BCNDP and the B.C. Liberals). The reality is that B.C.’s emissions have been going up, not down. The province is simply not the climate action leader it claims to be, as the B.C. Sierra Club will tell you. The carbon tax they have is not keeping emissions in check. On Monday of this week, Food & Water Watch released a report examining B.C.’s carbon tax, concluding it has been a failure. They note: The Canadian province of British Columbia implemented a carbon tax on certain fossil fuels in July of 2008. Some experts and pricing proponents are using the British Columbia carbon tax example to promote carbon taxes and other market mechanisms as a way to purportedly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address our climate problem. Unfortunately for these free-market proponents, the real-world record fails to demonstrate that British Columbia’s carbon tax reduced carbon emissions, fossil fuel consumption or vehicle travel. Most of the modest and short-term reductions in emissions seem to be related primarily to the 2008 global recession, not to the carbon tax. More recently, British Columbia’s emissions have resumed their rise. This report examines the British Columbia program and finds that this type of pricing approach is not going to save the planet or safeguard our communities. A more straightforward approach of regulating emissions would be significantly more effective at curbing climate change. The full report is here. When I was up in B.C. in 2013 for the provincial election, Christy Clark (who’s still in charge of the province) was boasting about how liquefied natural gas (LNG) was the future — and the key to financing B.C.’s schools. I was horrified. She and her party pay lip service to the idea of climate action, but they seemingly haven’t met a pipeline or export terminal project they don’t like. The B.C. Liberals are gophers for the fossil fuels industry north of the border. In NPI’s view, they are one of the biggest groups of greenwashers in history. To slow down our planet’s fever, we MUST abandon fossil fuels. We have to ban fracking (a position Bernie Sanders spoke to during his campaign and thankfully pressed Hillary Clinton to adopt), we need a moratorium on oil/coal trains, we need to put the kibosh on all proposed coal/oil/LNG export terminals — we need to take aggressive action to stop perpetuating our dependence on fossil fuels. We can’t wait to do this. Under Christy Clark and the not-liberal B.C. Liberals, British Columbia is going in the WRONG DIRECTION. (Canada as a whole is having problems ending its fossil fuel dependency too.) Yet, merely because B.C. has a carbon tax it imposed years ago under a different government, it’s misleadingly being held up as this shining role model, again and again, by CarbonWA representatives in presentations they’ve given across this state, as a validation of the approach they’ve chosen. The Yes on 732 camp is not telling people the whole story about what’s going in British Columbia. That upsets me. The team at NPI stands in solidarity with the tribes and progressive activists in B.C. who are fighting every day to stop bad projects like the Kinder Morgan pipeline. We do not want to follow B.C.’s lead on energy and pollution pricing — they are the poster child for what NOT to do! If we’re going to implement a pollution tax here in Washington State, then let’s do it thoughtfully and let’s raise some revenue to address our infrastructure deficit. Instead of I-732, NPI would like to see us come together as a state to craft a policy that has near unanimous support from progressives and also earns the support of biconceptuals and reasonable, environmentally-conscious conservatives. We reject as totally false the contention that it’s 732 or nothing.

Three sources familiar with the unfolding investigation told CNN the General Electric engine suffered an apparent "uncontained" failure. The 161 terrified passengers and nine crew members scrambled to safety Friday afternoon after huge flames erupted on the right side of the plane. Airport fire Chief Timothy Sampey said crews responded to a report of a No. 2 engine on fire. The plane, which had stopped well before the end of the runway, had about 43,000 pounds of fuel. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later," he said. Read More About 20 people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries that occurred during the evacuation down the emergency slides, District Chief Juan Hernandez said. There were people with minor bruising or injured ankles, he said. None of the injuries were caused by the fire. Another video pic.twitter.com/jg58N8x3l8— Jose Castillo 🎃 (@Kryptonlogic) October 28, 2016 American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott said Flight 383 was bound for Miami when it aborted takeoff due to an engine-related issue. The rare, but extremely serious, engine failure sent debris from the engine spewing across the south side of the expansive airfield. Part of the engine's fan disc were found a half mile away on a building used by UPS, two sources said. A passenger who was sitting in the middle of row 31 said he heard a loud clunk, then saw a large ball of flame that he assumed came from the engine area. Gary Schiavone of DeMotte, Indiana, said the captain was able to stop the aircraft quickly, and then it was "coordinated chaos." There wasn't much yelling or screaming, he told reporters, except passengers who shouted at others who were trying to grab their bags from the overhead bins. Schiavone said about 30 seconds into the evacuation, smoke started to pour into the cabin. The difficulty in breathing was the scariest part, he said. Asked whether he was afraid he was going to die, Schiavone said, "Of course. I'm thinking the plane is going to blow up." Schiavone complimented the crew for getting everyone out in what he estimated was about a minute. Video tweeted by a witness on the ground showed an airliner with a large tower of smoke rising from the right side and flames billowing beneath the fuselage. The video showed passengers coming down two of the emergency slides on the 767's left side. A dog also evacuated, officials said. Josiah Ryan, senior producer for Social TV at CNN, was aboard a flight landing at O'Hare. Shortly after their American Airlines flight landed, their captain told passengers over the loudspeaker, "We're near our gate, but there has been an accident on one of the runways." Ryan said he saw emergency vehicles rush to the runway. Four of the airport's runways were closed still late afternoon Friday, but that was not affecting airport operations, said Ginger Evans, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Aviation.

More than a dozen emergency vehicles surrounded the jet for hours. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. Other Boeing jets have been involved in runway incidents in the past 13 months. A Boeing 777 taxiing for takeoff at Las Vegas International Airport in September 2015 aborted its takeoff roll to London when one of its two engines failed. The following month, passengers aboard a Dynamic Airways 767-200 were forced to evacuate because of a fuel leak that caused a fire while the aircraft was taxiing in Fort Lauderdale. Both incidents are still under investigation by the NTSB. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Braden Walker contributed to this report. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of an American Airlines jet that aborted takeoff and caught fire on the runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday, forcing 170 crew and passengers to evacuate and resulting in eight injuries, authorities said. Pilots on American Airlines Flight 383 bound for Miami reported an engine-related mechanical issue, according to airline spokeswoman Leslie Scott. She said seven passengers and a flight attendant with minor injuries were taken to a hospital to be evaluated. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV (http://abc7.ws/2eNEQSe ) the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." Footage from the scene showed the Boeing 767, which appeared to be damaged on its rear and along its right side, sitting on the runway with flames underneath and shooting from one side along with plumes of smoke. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passengers came down emergency slides, hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, the airline said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. The aircraft was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. © Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Three sources familiar with the unfolding investigation told CNN the General Electric engine suffered an apparent "uncontained" failure. The 161 terrified passengers and nine crew members scrambled to safety Friday afternoon after huge flames erupted on the right side of the plane. Airport fire Chief Timothy Sampey said crews responded to a report of a No. 2 engine on fire. The plane, which had stopped well before the end of the runway, had about 43,000 pounds of fuel. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later," he said. Read More About 20 people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries that occurred during the evacuation down the emergency slides, District Chief Juan Hernandez said. There were people with minor bruising or injured ankles, he said. None of the injuries were caused by the fire. Another video pic.twitter.com/jg58N8x3l8— Jose Castillo 🎃 (@Kryptonlogic) October 28, 2016 American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott said Flight 383 was bound for Miami when it aborted takeoff due to an engine-related issue. The rare, but extremely serious, engine failure sent debris from the engine spewing across the south side of the expansive airfield. Part of the engine's fan disc were found a half mile away on a building used by UPS, two sources said. A passenger who was sitting in the middle of row 31 said he heard a loud clunk, then saw a large ball of flame that he assumed came from the engine area. Gary Schiavone of DeMotte, Indiana, said the captain was able to stop the aircraft quickly, and then it was "coordinated chaos." There wasn't much yelling or screaming, he told reporters, except passengers who shouted at others who were trying to grab their bags from the overhead bins. Schiavone said about 30 seconds into the evacuation, smoke started to pour into the cabin. The difficulty in breathing was the scariest part, he said. Asked whether he was afraid he was going to die, Schiavone said, "Of course. I'm thinking the plane is going to blow up." Schiavone complimented the crew for getting everyone out in what he estimated was about a minute. Video tweeted by a witness on the ground showed an airliner with a large tower of smoke rising from the right side and flames billowing beneath the fuselage. The video showed passengers coming down two of the emergency slides on the 767's left side. A dog also evacuated, officials said. Josiah Ryan, senior producer for Social TV at CNN, was aboard a flight landing at O'Hare. Shortly after their American Airlines flight landed, their captain told passengers over the loudspeaker, "We're near our gate, but there has been an accident on one of the runways." Ryan said he saw emergency vehicles rush to the runway. Four of the airport's runways were closed still late afternoon Friday, but that was not affecting airport operations, said Ginger Evans, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Aviation.

More than a dozen emergency vehicles surrounded the jet for hours. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. Other Boeing jets have been involved in runway incidents in the past 13 months. A Boeing 777 taxiing for takeoff at Las Vegas International Airport in September 2015 aborted its takeoff roll to London when one of its two engines failed. The following month, passengers aboard a Dynamic Airways 767-200 were forced to evacuate because of a fuel leak that caused a fire while the aircraft was taxiing in Fort Lauderdale. Both incidents are still under investigation by the NTSB. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Braden Walker contributed to this report. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Eat Drink Play Things to do Events About Contributors Partners Sponsored Eat Drink Play Things to do Events Facebook Twitter Pinterest Instagram Youtube (Joanne Sato) Things to do Got 48 Hours? Hop a Plane to Seattle for a Weekend Getaway Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Plus Email SMS WhatsApp Share By Joanne Sato No Comments Posted on Oct 28, 2016Oct 31, 2016 Sometimes you just have to pack up and take a trip out of the Bay Area. It’s time for a weekend getaway Seattle – style. Bay Area, hasn’t the rain been a nice change of pace? I have always loved rain and, because of California’s water shortage, I have grown to appreciate it so much more. Maybe I’m just tired of seeing dead grass everywhere I turn, and dried out city fountains replaced with signs that read,  “turned off due to drought.” That said, I can’t help but yearn for destinations where mother nature’s tears are plentiful. Let’s be honest, any excuse I get to dust off my ol’ rain boots and chunky sweaters, I’m all over it like gum on a wall. Which, incidentally, brings me to one of my favorite weekend destinations: Seattle, Washington. Despite the fact that the Emerald City is home to the Seattle Seahawks football team, it’s an otherwise perfect place to travel to and from the Bay Area for the weekend. Forty-eight hours is a perfect amount of time for a quick getaway. Here’s what you can do to enjoy this lovely city in the Pacific Northwest. Friday: 8:00 p.m. – Dinner and Drinks Touchdown to Seattle after a long work week, check into your hotel or Airbnb, and get into your Uber to find a late night dinner. Ask the hotel staff or your driver where they like to eat, and chances are that whatever they say is going to be good. Locals told me about a fun restaurant called Trove where you can choose to cook your own Korean barbecue on a hot tabletop stove or order their scrumptious noodles with a side of kimchi pork dumplings. And if you have room for dessert, try their signature parfaits in souvenir mason jars, which you can also order from their sweet to-go “car” window out front. (Joanne Sato) Still awake? Stay at the bar at Trove for some delicious concoctions, like the Smoked Brown Cow with mezcal and root beer syrup. Yum! (Joanne Sato) Saturday: 9:00 a.m. – To Market, To Market… Get up and get going! Head out early to Pike’s Place Market for your touristy travel photos of the stunning flowers, the literal “catch of the day” at the famous flying fishes, the (ew!) gum wall, cheese making and tasting at Beecher’s, and the nostalgic “First Starbucks” nearby. Go ahead and get your coffee fix here, but for breakfast, I’d suggest a creamy Ellenos yogurt that’s to die for — probably the best Greek yogurt you’ll ever have. You’ll find yourself licking the bowl clean. (Joanne Sato) Keep walking, and you’ll find yourself engaging in conversations with the many art and craft vendors. Then you’ll be enticed by the wonderful smell of bread — and not just bread: piroshki. You’ll probably find a line out-the-door with other travelers mixed in with some locals because Piroshky, Piroshky is one of the best. These amazing Russian baked goods are a perfect treat to take with you and eat while enjoying the view of the beautiful city. You can choose from the savory ones, like the smoked salmon pâté, and the sweet ones, like the apple cinnamon roll. And, if you don’t want to wait, order ahead online. (Joanne Sato) 12:00 pm – Tourist Attractions After you’ve stuffed your face with as many treats as you can, walk over to the Seattle Center Monorail to the iconic Space Needle. As cliche as it sounds, you should go up at least once to say you did it — and the sights up top ain’t so bad either. There’s a bar at the top and remember that Piroshsky, Piroshsky that you picked up? Well, this is a perfect place to munch on yours for a light lunch with the best view in town. (Joanne Sato) I suggest buying tickets online for the Space Needle because lines can get pretty long, especially on the weekend. Consider buying the combo pack for the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum next door — a must for lovers of art all things rad. Chihuly is a wildly popular glass artist, and his art is displayed all over the world. The museum is like a Willy Wonka-like haven for glass sculptures. 3:00 p.m. – Need Coffee with Pie Siesta, anyone? Well, it may be that sleepy part of the day, but you gotta stay up! Head over to the Starbucks Reserve Roastery for a coffee tasting that’ll surely jump start your engines. Learn about all things coffee (and tea if you’re not a coffee-drinker), and enjoy some delightful pastries to soak it all up while you shop to get the latest home gadgets or mug memorabilia. (Joanne Sato) Then, within the same building, head over to Serious Pie for some serious pizza pie as a snack or late lunch. I suggest you try any one of the fresh salads, the prosciutto pie with arugula, and enjoy some tasty local beer as well. This is a fun dining experience where you get to watch the coffee connoisseurs go to town on their $13 cups of Joe. (Joanne Sato) 6:00 p.m. – Get Down Underground Next, head over to Pioneer Square to Bill Speidel’s “Adult Only” Underground Tour (they also have daytime tours for all ages). You’ll learn so much about Seattle’s history and even enjoy a cocktail at the bar where the tour begins. Your tour guide will be sure to entertain you as you learn about purple solar panels, poor city planning of the past, and gnarly toilets. (Joanne Sato) During the tour, you will more than likely be checking out the next destination, as the tour is surrounded by many bars and restaurants like Kraken Congee (as seen on the CNBC show Restaurant Startup). Be sure to check them out for a delicious bowl of congee (a popular Asian rice porridge dish) with a twist. This fun restaurant serves many other dishes, has a full bar, and makes delectable desserts as well. (Joanne Sato) 10:00 p.m. – Bar Hopping After your dinner, head out to the bar scene in Pioneer Park for some drinks and mini-golf fun at Flatstick Pub, which only serves local drinks. They have a nine-hole mini-golf course, along with other unique games, which makes for a fun evening out. Don’t drink too much or the giant murals inside will trip you out. And even if mini-golf isn’t your thing, Seattle is home to many, many bars, so you’ll be sure to find something for everyone. Drinking not your thing? In Pioneer Square and within a UPS (United Postal Service) building is Waterfall Garden Park where, yes, a 22-foot waterfall lies as a commemorative gift to celebrate 100 years of UPS. Such a serene little spot to check out in an urban area! Sunday: 10:00 a.m, – Game Day Okay, so you can sleep in a bit, but depending on which sport’s season it is, you can always check out a game in Seattle — whether it’s the Seahawks, the Sounders or the Mariners. Even if there isn’t a game, the stadiums are worth taking a look at anyway. Whether you’re there to support the home team or the visitors, Centurylink Field (the football and soccer stadium) and Safeco Field (the baseball stadium) are sights to see … and all are surrounded by bars –go figure!  Bloody Mary, anyone? And if sports don’t interest you, be sure to check out the Museum of Flight, as Seattle is home to well-known aircraft company, Boeing. Here at the museum you’ll find all sorts of aircrafts new and old — even a NASA space shuttle and the inside of an old Presidential Air Force One. 1:00 pm – Food Tour By now you’re probably hungry so make sure you plan a food tour with Savor Seattle Food Tours. They have a variety of tours to choose from so pick wisely. If you’re a big foodie, choose the three-hour gourmet tour where you’ll taste food from an Iron Chef Winner and James Beard Nominees or take a two-hour Hip on the Hill Tour for Seattle’s best bites and drinks from people who think outside the box in the Capitol Hill area, which is a melting pot of delicious ideas. 4:00 p.m. – The Great Outdoors On a lovely Sunday afternoon, there is no better way to spend your time than outdoors enjoying the crisp fresh air of the Emerald City. Choose from a variety of parks to fit your outdoor needs from walking to running, biking, or even kayaking. For travelers and camera enthusiasts, I recommend going to Kerry Park, where the skyline of the city and the Space Needle are in sight. Stay for the sun setting, and you’ll be sure to make all your Instagram friends jealous of beauty you’ve just captured. 6:00 p.m. – Dinner on the Run You don’t have much time before your flight, so a creamy bowl of chowder it is. It wouldn’t be a complete trip to Seattle without mentioning Pike Place Chowder. This extremely popular spot has some of the best and meatiest clam chowder out there (though we know the San Francisco bread bowl could give it a run for their money). Head to their second location in the Pacific Place Shopping Center next to the flagship Nordstrom store for shorter lines and more options on their menu. 8:00 p.m. – Homeward Bound Check out of your temporary digs and say goodbye to all the locals you’ve met along the way. You’ve got your new Starbucks mug in your bag, and you’ve left your mark on the gum wall (ew, again!) in this lovely city. Touchdown back to the Bay and sleep well, my friend. You’ll have so much to tell your co-workers in the morning, so don’t forget to show off that new coffee cup.

Oct. 28, 2016. (Video by Jose Castillo)  Passengers evacuate a burning plane on the runway at O'Hare International Airport. Oct. 28, 2016. (Video by Jose Castillo)  Liam Ford, William Lee and Grace WongContact ReportersChicago Tribune Privacy Policy American Airlines Flight 383 was rolling down the runway at O'Hare International Airport on Friday afternoon, bound for Miami, when the plane skidded to a halt just as it was lifting off. The pilot got on the radio. "American 383 heavy," he said, referring to the Boeing 767's weight class. "Stopping on the runway." "Roger, roger. Fire," a traffic controller calmly replied, according to a recording of tower radio traffic. The pilot asked if the tower controller saw fire. "Yeah, fire off the right wing." Then seconds later, the pilot said, "American 383, we're evacuating." The plane's 161 passengers and nine crew members scrambled down emergency chutes on the left side of the plane while flames flared and thick black smoke billowed from the wing on the right side, according to the airline and video from the scene. Twenty people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, mostly bruises and ankle problems, according to fire Chief Juan Hernandez, head of emergency medical services at the airport. The aircraft experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, a federal official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a rare and serious failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. "The smoke started coming in and the flames just started going along the windows on the right side," said one of the passengers, Alan Lemery, 62, from Chicago's River North neighborhood. "Everybody started panicking at that point." People rushed toward the exits. "Then for some reason, everything happened very slowly and orderly," said his wife, Marta Lemery. Video of the scene shows passengers sliding down chutes. Many of the passengers can be seen running across a median of grass, some lugging their bags. Some passengers gather a distance away and watch as fire trucks circle the plane. "Crazy, man," one passenger is heard saying. "I'm never f------ flying again." People around him can be heard laughing. It took fire crews only a few minutes to bring the fire under control, officials said. As the smoke cleared, the blackened right wing could be seen sagging and touching the tarmac. The FAA said the problem started with a blown tire, but American said the takeoff was aborted "due to an engine-related mechanical issue." A large rounded piece of metal believed to have come from the plane smashed through the roof of a UPS facility on the airport grounds and bounced off the floor, according to an airport worker. "It looks like a piece of a turbine disk from a jet engine," the worker said, adding it was too hot to touch. Few people were inside the building at the time and no injuries were reported. The facility is filled with workers at night. Police secured the scene and turned it over to the National Transportation Safety Board, which was investigating the incident.

(Photo courtesy of Alan Lemery) The plane had started to take off around 2:35 p.m. on Runway 28R, according to the FAA. Passengers said the plane was just lifting off when it slammed back to the tarmac. "It was a scary moment," Marta Lemery said. Her husband said he saw flames on the right side of the plane as the plane skidded across the runway before finally stopping. The lights went off.   The initial panic quickly faded and "people were not really jumping or pushing" as they made their way down the aisle and the chutes, said Marta Lemery. The couple applauded the pilot for making sure everyone got out safely. "The way the pilot conducted the situation, he did an excellent job," Marta Lemery said. Alan Lemery added, "When you get a little older, excitement is good. It wasn't our day to die." They are booked on a Saturday morning flight for Miami, where they plan to catch a cruise. Earlier versions of this story reversed attribution of some air traffic control radio traffic, attributing some of what the pilot said to a traffic controller, and vice versa.

(Thomas Boyd/The Oregonian) Print Email Guest Columnist By Guest Columnist The Oregonian Follow on Twitter on October 28, 2016 at 11:42 AM, updated October 28, 2016 at 1:25 PM comments Immigrants in Oregon contribute significantly to key industries, such as crop production, fruit and vegetable preserving, animal production and manufacturing. They make up 11 percent of Oregon's entrepreneurs. Michael Dembrow The national election will soon be over, fortunately. But we will still be left with the residue of a huge amount of misinformation. This is particularly true of immigration, where so many myths and false allegations have been propounded. I sit on the National Conference of State Legislature's Task Force on Immigration and the States, made up of 30 members from around the country — half Republicans, half Democrats. We advise the National Conference and the federal government on state efforts to address immigration challenges. We meet with national and international experts and go to the borders, witnessing firsthand the facts across the country. As a task force member, I've learned that many of the "facts" presented about immigrants and refugees are simply wrong. Contrary to the mythology about immigrants coming here to game the system and live off the benefits of our national wealth, consider the recent peer-reviewed report from the National Academy of Sciences, "The Integration of Immigrants into American Society": • The employment rate for immigrants is far higher than the general population. They're here to work, and they work hard. • Immigrants are generally healthier — less likely to die from heart disease and cancer and with lower rates of obesity, depression, and alcohol abuse — than the U.S. native-born population. • Immigrants have lower crime, arrest and incarceration rates than the U.S. native-born population. • Today's immigrants are learning English at the same rate or faster than earlier waves of immigrants. • The refugee resettlement process is long, arduous, and rigorous. It takes years of careful scrutiny before a person is cleared for resettlement. • Immigrants and refugees are not taking jobs from U.S. born Americans. They are doing jobs that U.S. born Americans either will not or cannot do. • Without their labor, agricultural areas all over the U.S. would be in serious distress. • The immigrant workforce is much younger than the aging U.S.-born workforce. We need them to replace and support our aging population. A recent report from the Partnership for a New American Economy shows how this is playing out in Oregon. In 2014, documented and undocumented immigrants made up 10 percent of the population and earned $9.9 billion. They contributed $2.4 billion, or 9 percent of our state's earnings. Immigrants in Oregon contribute significantly to key industries, such as crop production, fruit and vegetable preserving, animal production and manufacturing. They make up 11 percent of Oregon's entrepreneurs. I encourage Oregonian/OregonLive readers to check out the full report. The Partnership for a New American Economy is not a group of left-leaning, fuzzy thinkers. Its seven co-chairs include Rupert Murdoch; the former mayors of San Antonio, Philadelphia and New York City, and the chief executives of Marriott, Disney and Boeing. "This study," observed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Randel K. Johnson, "will complement in new ways the already overwhelming amount of data that demonstrates that immigration is a net benefit to the United States, underpinning arguments for reform as we move into 2017." Doing the right thing on a human level is also doing the right thing on an economic level. There are things that we are doing as a state to help our immigrants and refugees to better integrate into the workforce. But we face bigger and more fundamental challenges beyond the capacity of state and local leaders. There are many who are in desperate, difficult and dangerous situations who want to come here to work, contribute, prove themselves and stay, but they cannot. In the end, this is a national problem and requires a bipartisan solution with support and input from business, industry and advocacy groups. We need real, sensible and long-awaited reform at the national level. Let's hope that a serious effort to create this reform begins as soon as this election is behind us.

The space agency has contracted with six different firms to develop potential deep-space habitats as part of the NextSTEP program, which is essentially a bridge to an eventual deep-space craft. The goal will be to put one of these habitats in space near the moon, and let it serve as a destination for astronauts to visit while NASA tests out all the tech they want to use to get to Mars (and beyond). If the final design works out, NASA could use it as a framework for a habitat on its eventual deep-space craft. The six companies developing the habitats include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Bigelow Aerospace, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation and NanoRacks. According to Ars Technica, the companies will get $65 million to refine their designs and build a ground-based prototype for testing. Construction on flight hardware for the winning design is slated to kick off in 2018. The goal would be to actually launch it by the mid-2020s, where it could be used to help train future astronauts and test out equipment for deeper missions. The NextSTEP program is just that, a next step, as NASA tries to figure out how it will actually get humans to Mars. If all goes as planned it could be a very big step, too.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Apply Now For Southwest Airlines’ Heart Of The Community Grant An evaluation focusing on five initial projects is demonstrating that on average a Southwest Airlines Heart of the Community grant leverages four times its amount in additional funding from other sources. Not only does this boost the valuable work of grant recipients, but it also shows how initial investments in public spaces can result in a number of other positive outcomes for cities. There has also been a marked increase in visitation to grantee sites.  From 2013 through 2015, grant recipient locations in Detroit; San Antonio; Providence, R.I.; San Diego; and Baltimore welcomed more than 2.5 million visitors, and 1.4 million people have attended additional events at these places. For example, the reading room in Providence has brought hundreds of families to Burnside Park—softening the image of the park where people once felt unsafe—by giving kids and their parents a reason to take back the public space, creating a welcoming environment for the entire community. Placemaking improvements to these public spaces have also helped create new jobs, 147 across the five sites, to be exact, and generated $7.7 million in visitor spending. Food trucks and other vendors have shown up in full force at the Plaza de Panama after the Southwest Airlines Heart of the Community grant encouraged adjacent museums to spill out onto the plaza and engage passersby in San Diego. Local business owners also are benefiting with increases in patronage, as in the case of Josh Cowan of Dizzy Cow Pizzeria in Baltimore, which serves lunch to hundreds every Thursday during the weekly farmers market at Pratt and Light Plaza. “Everyone has the right to quality public spaces, and we all have a role to play in shaping them,” explains Fred Kent, Founder and President of Project for Public Spaces. “By collectively reimagining public spaces at the heart of every community, we can strengthen the connection between people and the places they share and maximize their shared value, resulting in positive social, economic, and environmental benefits.” The 2017 Southwest Airlines Heart of the Community grant application is open now through December 5. To learn more about these impactful past projects, view the Southwest: The Magazine articles, A Piece of the Pie; Better Together; New Life at Lindbergh Forum; and Sharing the Love in Albuquerque. For application details, to sign-up for our informational webinar, and to learn more about past projects visit www.pps.org/heart-of-the-community and the Southwest Airlines Community. ABOUT PROJECT FOR PUBLIC SPACES Project for Public Spaces is a nonprofit planning, design and educational organization dedicated to helping people create and sustain public spaces that build stronger communities. Its pioneering Placemaking approach helps citizens transform their public spaces into vital places that highlight local assets, spur rejuvenation and serve common needs. PPS was founded in 1975 to apply and expand on the work of William (Holly) Whyte, the author of The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces. Since then, the organization has completed projects in over 3000 communities in 43 countries and all 50 US states and are the premier center for best practices, information and resources on Placemaking. ABOUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. In its 46th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co.

The airline proudly unveiled a bold new look:  Heart.  A new logo, aircraft livery, interior design featuring a new seat and Flight Attendant galley, Employee-designed uniforms, and an updated airport experience all showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees who connect Customers with what’s important in their lives. From its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as “The Southwest Effect,” a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets.  With 43 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier’s performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.

Global Business Brief: Trump looks good for defense business; New faces at the Pentagon Sponsor Content How Cloud Will Affect the Future of Policing Defense One Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email → News Threats Politics Business Tech Ideas Counter-siege in Aleppo; ISIS gathers human shields in Mosul; Marines want radio-hunting mini-missiles; Refueling F-35s from V-22; and a bit more… By Ben Watson Read bio Bradley Peniston Read bio October 28, 2016 Topics The D Brief AA Font size + Print Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Ben Watson Read bio Bradley Peniston Read bio October 28, 2016 ISIS is rounding up “tens of thousands” of Iraqi civilians for use as human shields inside the city of Mosul, the UN says. What’s worse, “Many of those who refused to comply were shot on the spot, and even among those who did comply, many of them — including 190 former ISF officers and 42 other civilians — were shot dead,” spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani of the United Nations’ human rights office said this morning in Geneva. AP: “The officers, who had been brought from a district south of the city, were killed at a military base in Mosul while the civilians were shot in the Hamam al-Alil district for refusing to join IS.” More on that, here. The U.S. military says Iraq’s troops have clawed back 40 villages in the vicinity of Mosul, AP reports this morning, bucking previous figures from Iraqi army officials which put that number closer to 90 on Tuesday.   Baghdad’s new brother to their elite Counterterrorism Police, the Rapid Response Division (also trained by U.S. special forces), “is now at the forefront of the southern advance on Mosul,” AFP reports from Q-West, Iraq. “Backed by artillery and trained in a programme influenced by American special forces, the interior ministry unit has played a major role in other battles against the Islamic State (IS) group, including in Fallujah. It is the culmination of a major transformation for the force, which was originally made up of ‘small groups from the provinces’ tasked with arresting criminals and fighting terrorism,” its commander, Maj. Gen. Thamer Mohammed Ismail, told AFP. “Rapid Response is now armed with new Croatian assault rifles, advances in matte green armoured Humvees mounted with machineguns, and is backed by its own artillery and rocket units.” More on the unit here. Watch some hairy combat footage from embedding with the Counterterrorism Police: BBC’s Ayman Oghanna “captured the moment when Iraqi Special Forces came under fire from so-called Islamic State” as they moved on Mosul. Oghanna also captured some incredible scenes of civilians greeting Iraqi soldiers. Things start getting messy at about the 0:54 mark; see for yourself here.

Syrian rebels and al-Qaeda-linked groups in eastern Aleppo have launched a new offensive to break the Assad regime’s siege, Reuters reports. “The assault, employing heavy shelling and suicide car bombs, was mainly focused on the city’s western edge by rebels based outside Aleppo. It included Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a former affiliate of al Qaeda previously known as the Nusra Front, and groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner.” The offensive kicked off when it did thanks to heavy clouds, providing relative cover from air strikes, the Middle East Institute’s Charles Lister says. Lister goes on to provide a list of at least 20 rebel groups involved in an operation he says has been in the works for at least six weeks. Reuters: “Heavy rebel bombardment, with more than 150 rockets and shells, struck southwestern districts… Photographs showed insurgents approaching Aleppo in tanks, armored vehicles, bulldozers, make-shift mine sweepers, pick-up trucks and on motorcycles, and showed a large column of smoke rising in the distance after an explosion.” The offensive has already claimed the lives of more than 15 civilians and wounded another 100 in government-held western Aleppo, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Not to be left out, ISIS fighters also clashed “with the Syrian army on Friday at a government-held airbase 37km (23 miles) east of Aleppo, next to territory the jihadist group already controls, the Observatory reported.” As well, “Grad rockets were launched at Aleppo’s Nairab air base before the assault began said Zakaria Malahifji, head of the political office of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim rebel group, adding that it was going to be ‘a big battle.’” More on that front, here.

The Marines Want Mini-Missiles That Hunt for Specific Radio Signals // Tech Editor Patrick Tucker: Signals-intelligence collection and drones are coming together in new packages for forward-deployed troops. Global Business Brief: October 27 // Marcus Weisgerber: What a redacted protest decision says about the future; Pentagon competition declines; Bonjour, Silicon Valley. Welcome to Friday’s edition of The D Brief by Ben Watson and Bradley Peniston. On this day in 1882, Lt. Cmdr. French E. Chadwick was ordered to London as the first naval attaché. (Send your friends this link: http://get.defenseone.com/d-brief/. And let us know your news: the-d-brief@defenseone.com.) A nuclear vote at the UN: The resolution to begin talks on a new nuclear weapons ban passed a committee by a vote of 123 to 38 (with 38 abstentions). But the idea, now headed for a full General Assembly vote in December, seems destined for a quick death: not one member of the UN Security Council supported it, Agence France-Presse reported. Among the “no” votes: Britain, France, Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea. China, India and Pakistan abstained. The Guardian has their take, here. Or check out the resolution for yourself, here. Security review at Booz Allen Hamilton. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller has been hired “to conduct a review of the firm’s security processes after one of its employees was charged with stealing huge amounts of classified data from the National Security Agency,” the Washington Post reports. For a quick review of what’s at stake: “In a complaint that was unsealed this month, Harold T. Martin was charged in what is alleged to be one of the largest thefts of classified material in U.S. history…Prosecutors have said that Martin took at least 50 terabytes of digital data, or as much as 500 million pages of information. He also had six boxes of files, many of which were left open in his house or car, prosecutors said.” According to a federal legal filing (PDF), Martin’s homeward haul included “numerous names of intelligence officers of the United States. These officers operate under cover outside the United States,” risking “exposure of American intelligence operations,” Politico reported Thursday. Martin’s defense lawyer says he is a hoarder whose “behavior escalated into a compulsion and, eventually, a form of mental illness.” More here. Two pilots from the east African nation of Eritrea reportedly defected—with their jets—to Ethiopia, AP reported Thursday: “The two pilots flew their small-sized fighter jets to Mekelle on Wednesday morning,” Nasredin Ahmed Ali, spokesman for the Ethiopia-based Red Sea Afar Democratic Organization, told The Associated Press. The spokesman identified the pilots as Afeworki Fisehaye and Mebrahtu Tesfamariam and described them as being very experienced with Eritrea’s air force. He said Ethiopian fighter jets accompanied them upon their entry into the country’s air space.” For the record: Something similar occurred four years ago when two Eritrean pilots flew their jet to Saudi Arabia to defect. Their home nation then sent a female pilot to Jizan, Saudi Arabia, to recover the plane—but she defected, too. And here’s Task & Purpose from June 2015 with a little extra info on why “Eritrea Is The Worst Place In The World To Serve In The Military.” A British company was awarded a contract to help the V-22 Osprey refuel F-35s, DoDBuzz writes. Cobham “announced Tuesday it had been awarded a contract from the Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office to develop a ‘roll-on/roll-off’ palletized refueling system, know as the V-22 Aerial Refueling System, or VARS. VARS will be based on Cobham’s existing FR-300 hose drum unit, used by the KC-130 for in-air refueling of other aircraft. With the system, according to a news release, the Osprey can conduct mid-air refuelings of the F-35 and the F/A-18 Hornet, from land or from off an aircraft carrier.” More here. “Total dysfunction preceded Marines’ deadliest crash this year,” Marine Corps Times’ Jeff Schogol reported Thursday after officials investigated a January 14 incident when two of its CH-53 Super Stallions crashed off the coast of Hawaii. “The immediate cause of the mid-air collision between the two helicopters with Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463 was ‘pilot error,’ an official said, in the crash that took the lives of all 12 Marines aboard both aircraft.” But “the underlying causes of the crash reveal the squadron suffered from severe readiness problems,” including the fact that “the squadron did not have enough helicopters that could fly; crews were not getting enough flying hours; morale was low and crews were battling fatigue.” More here.   A former member of the Virginia National Guard pled guilty Thursday to “charges of attempting to provide material support” to ISIS, the Justice Department announced. What’s notable about this indictment? It involves actual contact with a member of ISIS, a trip to Nigeria to meet an ISIS “facilitator,” as well as inspiration from U.S.-born (and now deceased) cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. The accused, 27-year-old Mohamed Bailor Jalloh, “claimed he knew how to shoot guns and praised the gunman who killed five U.S. military members in a terrorist attack in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 2015. Jalloh also stated that he had been thinking about conducting an attack similar to the November 2009, attack at Ft. Hood, Texas, which killed 13 people and wounded 32 others.” More here. Duterte talked to God, and God said, “Stop swearing so much.” That’s Rody D’s side of the story, according to Philippine ABS-CBN news. Watch him explain, here. Meantime, Duturte’s troops just killed Samsudin Dimaukom, the mayor of a small town, when just this morning “he and nine other men were shot dead at a highway police checkpoint, in what the police described as an antidrug operation,” The New York Times reports from Manila. “According to the police, a checkpoint was set up along his expected route in the town of Makilala, about 70 miles east of Datu Saudi-Ampatuan by road. The mayor and his party approached around 4 a.m…. Photographs taken at the scene showed various weapons and what appeared to be sachets of shabu near an S.U.V. with bullet holes in the front windshield. No police officers were harmed, the police said.” More here. And now for something completely different: An American abroad just rediscovered an old WWI field typewriter—as well as a German cipher machine—amid an amazing trove in Spain yesterday. It’s a pretty incredible story, so we’ll let Marcin Wichary tell the tale, here. Ben Watson is news editor for Defense One.

When the plane came to a stop, U.S. Secret Service agents rushed from the back of the plane to the front, where Pence was seated, to check on the candidate. He said he was fine, though, and no one had been injured. “We can see mud on the front windows,” a calm Pence said in the press cabin about a minute after the plane came to rest.

(AP Photo/Will Weissert) Later, the Indiana governor tweeted: “So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!” In Geneva, Ohio, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump told his supporters that Pence had come “pretty close to grave, grave danger.” But, he added: “I just spoke to Mike Pence and he’s fine. Everybody’s fine.” Democrat Hillary Clinton tweeted: “Glad to hear @mike_pence, his staff, Secret Service, and the crew are all safe.” The plane was coming to New York from Fort Dodge, Iowa, where it had made a hard landing but stayed on the runway earlier Thursday afternoon. After a rally in Fort Dodge, Pence’s flight to New York was delayed because of weather. The Indiana governor spent about 20 minutes tossing a football with his staff, journalists and Secret Service agents near the Iowa runway. Upon arriving at LaGuardia, after a bumpy approach, the Boeing 737 Eastern Airlines charter landed roughly, making first contact with the runway concrete. The pilot slammed on the brakes and the plane began to slide sideways. When it stopped, passengers could smell burning rubber. The Federal Aviation Administration said, “A crushable concrete runway safety technology called an Engineered Material Arresting System stopped the plane.” The FAA website says the material is “designed to safely stop airplanes that overshoot runways.” The 37 passengers, including Pence, and 11 crew members were evacuated through the back of the plane. In a series of televised interviews on Friday, Pence said he was grateful that the crushable concrete runway worked as designed and for the “quick action” by pilots and first responders. “Just for a few seconds, you could feel us bouncing off,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” ”And with mud splattered up on the windows, we figured we were off the runway.” Pence added: “I’m just really grateful, really grateful, for some quick action, not only by the pilots, but also by first responders” who were quickly on the scene. The Port Authority shut down the runway following the incident, but later reopened it. In a statement, the agency confirmed that the plane had “overshot” the runway and said there were no injuries and no fire. Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye said the National Transportation Safety Board “will take control of the investigation. The aircraft will remain where it is until the NTSB releases it.” Foye added, “Per the request of the NTSB, we are not going to speculate on the cause of the incident tonight.” Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said Pence spoke with Trump shortly after the landing. The vice presidential candidate also called into the $1 million fundraiser at Trump Tower that he had been expected to attend, Lotter said. The campaign said it was preparing a new, similar aircraft that would be ready soon. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India — which the air force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out ageing Soviet-era aircraft — could be worth anything from $13- $15 billion, experts say, potentially one of the country’s biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France’s Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is desperately trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kickstart a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports. Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. Offered Sweden’s Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. “The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at,” said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. India’s defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. “We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms’ willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations,” the person said. India’s air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engine fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fl y-away condition. Adding to the military’s problems is India’s three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B.S. Dhanoa told parliament’s defence committee that it didn’t have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. Saab said it was ready to not only produce its frontline Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. “We are very experienced in transfer of technology — our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line,” said Jan Widerstrm, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry’s letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. “Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world’s only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world’s largest fighter aircraft supply chain,” Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. Expanding Lockheed’s offer comes on the back of expanding U.S.-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India’s top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engine F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. “We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development,” said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL. He said the Indian government would be looking at producing at least 200 fighters, and then probably some more, to make up for the decades of delay in modernising the air force.
