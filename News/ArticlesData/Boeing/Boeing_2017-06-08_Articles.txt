Strear’s inflammatory, factually errant missive claims the Brandeis-Bardin camp community is “under assault” by community members and organizations who support the full cleanup of nuclear and chemical contamination at the Santa Susana Field Lab located directly above the camp. The cleanup to which Strear objects is required by agreements voluntarily signed by the state Department of Toxic Substances Control, NASA and the Department of Energy. In fact, the community is under assault by those agencies, Boeing Co. and AJU, who are now working together to break the cleanup agreements. If they prevail, they will sentence the community to perpetual risk from hazardous SSFL contaminants that migrate off site. Strear parrots SSFL polluters’ claims that there is no off-site migration, when in fact off-site contamination is documented in numerous reports (except those referenced by Strear, which were mostly produced by Boeing). Strear grossly mischaracterizes the multi-year, independent, federally funded study conducted by UCLA’s Yoram Cohen, claiming it differs from a 1999 “study” by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. In fact, what ATSDR produced in 1999 was only a brief overview to determine if more detailed study was needed. It concluded affirmatively, and ATSDR subsequently paid Cohen and his team to conduct that comprehensive study. Strear also repeats Boeing’s absurd claims that the SSFL cleanup is somehow worse than the contamination. In fact, most of the cleanup will occur in areas previously defiled by decades of sloppy environmental practices, and cultural resources are explicitly protected by the cleanup agreements. Strear’s outrageous attacks on scientists and cleanup advocates indicate frustration that AJU’s considerable efforts to deny off-site SSFL contamination haven’t made its problems go away. If AJU truly wants to assure the public that its property is safe, it should support, not attack, a full cleanup of SSFL. Only then can we be certain that contamination will not migrate further. Communities near SSFL, as well as Brandeis-Bardin workers and visitors—mostly children—deserve better.

REUTERS/Craig Larsen-Boeing Handout Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. © REUTERS/Alwyn Scott Kevin McAllister chief executive of Boeing's jetliner business is seen at a briefing in Renton Washington Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and "fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make", he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes. "I have no idea how we're going to do that," Sinnett said. "But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the "Miracle on the Hudson," Sinnett said. "If it can't, then we can't go there." A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. "This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors'" he said, referring to rival Airbus. "It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?"

According to The Tide source, the agreement was signed on Monday, in Lagos, by Mrs Tokunbor Fagbemi, Managing Director, Springfountain and Mr Larry Tolliver, Head of Sales, West and Central Africa, the Boeing Company. Speaking at the ceremony, Fagbemi said the proposed investment would be carried out through the African Aircraft Leasing Company (AALC), OEM Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Centre, African Aircraft Spare Parts Company (AASC) and Aggregated Services Solutions. Fagbemi said it would cover aircraft leasing, maintenance, repair and overhaul, spares logistics and supply, as well as aggregated services solutions. She noted that the absence of such facilities and services in Africa were some of the major challenges faced by the Nigerian airlines and the aviation sector. Fagbemi said : “We, as dynamic Nigerians and as patriotic citizens of this great nation have made Nigeria our first port of call to situate, subject to provision of all the necessary enabling environment, free of the risk of expropriation. “We believe that through this venture, we would have added our quota to ensure that Nigeria does not lose out, as African aviation is gathering momentum and countries within Africa are repositioning, developing culture, business, economy etc, around aviation and increased intra-continental air connectivity.’’ According to her, the facilities and services will require the local skills in diverse fields ranging from piloting, aviation engineering, aviation economics and aviation law, thereby creating employment opportunities for Nigerians. She, however, appealed to the Nigerian government to make travelling affordable and convenient for the Nigerian masses, noting that the country only had 15 million domestic and foreign travellers, out of a population of 180 million. “We want to work with government and the aviation industry to bring brand new aircraft which hopefully will bring down the cost of operations for operators and bring down the cost of airfare for passengers in Africa. “We, therefore, call on government to facilitate the implementation of the Yamoussoukro Declaration (YD) and the African Union Declaration 2063,’’ Fagbemi said. She also urged the government to create an enabling environment for the projects to take off by way of policies and waivers, as well as investment in aviation education, skill building and skill development. Also speaking, Tolliver said the partnership was aimed at improving Boeing’s services to its clients, adding that Springfountain had demonstrated sufficient commitment towards making it a success. On his part, Minister of State, Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, congratulated Springfountain on the attainment of the strategic relationship with Boeing. Sirika, represented by  Director of Operations, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Capt. Sidi Abdullahi,  said the partnership was expected to bring in innovative solutions that would assist in solving major issues bedeviling the Nigerian aviation industry.

For illustration only. Boeing in tie-up for unmanned undersea vehicles WASHINGTON, 5 hours, 53 minutes ago Boeing and Huntington Ingalls Industries are teaming on the design and production of Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in support of the US Navy’s Extra Large UUV programme. “This partnership provides the Navy a cost-effective, low-risk path to meet the emergent needs that prompted the Navy’s Advanced Undersea Prototyping program,” said Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works. “We are combining Boeing’s preeminent UUV maritime engineering team with our nation’s leading shipbuilder and Navy technical services company to get operational vehicles to the Navy years ahead of the standard acquisition process.” Boeing is currently testing its newest and largest UUV, Echo Voyager, off the Southern California coast. The vehicle is designed for multiple missions and could include a modular payload bay of up to 34 feet, offering enhanced endurance and increased payload capacity over traditional UUVs. Echo Voyager is fully autonomous, requiring no support vessel for launch or recovery, enabling operation at sea for months before returning to port. “We look forward to a long relationship with Boeing as we embark together to field this unmanned force-multiplier for the Navy,” said Andy Green, executive vice president of Huntington Ingalls Industries and president of the company’s Technical Solutions division. “I am confident this team will continue redefining the autonomy paradigm for UUVs.” – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | More Industry, Logistics & Shipping Stories DP World unit buys Spanish maritime services operator Sadara starts BGE production at Saudi plant FGB picks Durapipe for new Abu Dhabi HQ Etihad Cargo, Royal Air Maroc to increase cooperation APM Terminals Bahrain welcomes largest vessel Alba sees solid jump in N America exports Cardtek, NXP in UAE mobile wallet partnership Batelco unveils special Ramadan offers US mulls expansion of electronics ban to 71 airports Electric vehicles hit record 2m cars in 2016 Dubai group joins IFS channel network EK Kanoo unit launches calibration service Clarksons Platou opens its fourth largest office in Dubai Signtrade to showcase key solutions at SGI Dubai Siemon launches bulk packaging options for optics Luxury brands ‘continue growth in ME markets’ Global superyachts market set for 7pc growth Empower in new payment deal with ENBD SR Technics, VAS Aero Services ink repair deal UAE ministry, Jafza to develop pharma sector Siemens wins Jordan power plant order Workz ranked world's largest scratch card producer Bosch Middle East sales hit $490m in 2016 Top ME ports ban chokes Qatar's commodity trade Iran growth to slow to 4pc in 2017: World Bank ArcelorMittal JV buys Italy's largest steel company EGA opens new head office complex in Abu Dhabi Tawuniya rolls out insurance programme for SMEs RAK Ceramics partners with American University in Dubai Siemens lands $462m Dewa maintenance contract Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Would You Fly on an AI-Backed Plane Without a Pilot? By Tom Brant June 8, 2017 06:45pm EST 10 Comments Autopilots already fly commercial jetliners by themselves, but pilots still have to make decisions about how to program them. Boeing wants to change that. You probably learned in grade school that all you really need to fly is more drag than lift. But by now you know that to start an airline, what you mostly need is money—billions of dollars worth—for airplanes, crew, and fuel. Except that Boeing envisions a future in which you can remove the crew part from your shopping list. The aerospace giant is currently studying ways to make already-existing autopilot technology safe enough to fly an aircraft by itself, Reuters reports. The most important ingredient for making autopilots safer, according to Boeing Vice President Mike Sinnett, is artificial intelligence. Autopilots already fly today's commercial jets from a few minutes after takeoff to a few minutes before landing, but they have to be programmed beforehand by human pilots, and reprogrammed every time weather or traffic gets in the way of the flight path. But infused with AI, the autopilots could potentially do that reprogramming themselves. Sinnett tells Reuters that Boeing will "fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make."

Even if the technology works, the flying public and government regulators still have to accept it, a dilemma that parallels a key challenge for companies working on self-driving cars. How to convince them is still a mystery to Boeing, though. "I have no idea how we're going to do that," Sinnett told Reuters. "But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." Meanwhile, Boeing's chief rival Airbus is working on a fleet of autonomous flying taxis. It's planning to have a full-size prototype before the end of the year and have a marketable design by 2020.

As predicted, the service’s latest tanker will miss its projected September deadline, said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Emily Grabowski. “The top issues slowing progress are achieving the [Federal Aviation Administration] airworthiness certifications and completing the flight test program,” she said in an email. “Once Boeing receives the remaining design approvals from the FAA, they expect testing to proceed on a faster pace.” Grabowski said Boeing believes it can deliver an aircraft by December and establish a set of equipment and procedures for airmen by October 2018, as planned.

Military.com Equipment Guide: Aircraft The Air Force “will continue to support Boeing’s efforts to execute the program” but believes the  first delivery will be “beyond” those dates: late spring of 2018, Grabowski said. The delivery push comes as no surprise after the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, issued a report in March disclosing that testing on the tanker might further delay the program. “GAO’s analysis shows there is risk to the current delivery schedule due to potential delays in Federal Aviation Administration certifications and key test events,” the report’s analysis reads. “Boeing must also complete over 1,700 test points on average for each month from February to September 2017, a level that is more than double what it completed in the last 11 months,” it said. Boeing was supposed to deliver the initial 18 aerial-refueling planes by August 2017. With ongoing snafus throughout the program — which began in 2013 — such as initial design problems with its refueling boom, Boeing and Air Force officials earlier said the first delivery could be delayed to February 2018. The GAO noted it was more likely to be October 2018 — if that. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, the Air Force’s military deputy for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Acquisition at the Pentagon, told reporters Wednesday that he isn’t frustrated with the setback. “Well, I don’t like delays,” he said after a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. “Boeing is throwing resources and doing everything they can to pull it back; they’re doing everything they can to try to execute. That’s the part I’m very upbeat about. “We’re all for that. We would welcome that, and we will provide them the resources we can to make that happen,” Bunch said. The Air Force awarded Boeing a fixed-price $4.9 billion contract in 2011. The company is responsible for any cost overruns.

The roster of potential buyers of the largest-ever 737, which is expected to launch this month, spans the globe. Initial sales prospects include Indonesia’s Lion Mentari Airlines, the aircraft-leasing arm of China’s development bank, Jet Airways India, SpiceJet and Copa Holdings, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The U.S. manufacturer is seeking a groundswell of orders to demonstrate the Max 10’s market appeal and strike back at the A321neo, Airbus’s largest narrow-body jet, which is capturing trans-continental routes once dominated by Boeing’s out-of-production 757. The Max 10 talks aren’t final and Airbus could still try to thwart the sales ahead of the Paris Air Show later this month. A spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing declined to comment on the talks. Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, declined to comment on a potential order, as did CDB Aviation Lease Finance, the Chinese aircraft lessor, Jet Airways and SpiceJet. Lion and Panama City-based Copa didn’t immediately comment. The newest 737 Max would seat about 220 passengers in a single-cabin layout popular with budget carriers while burning about 5 percent less fuel than its similarly sized Airbus rival, according to the U.S. company. The Boeing jet isn’t slated to enter the commercial market until 2020. Airbus delivered the first A321neo earlier this year and has garnered 1,416 total orders, according to the company’s website. “We aren’t looking to simply build something on par with the A321neo,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing. “We’re bringing a better airplane to the market — and that’s our focus.” Airbus sales chief John Leahy dismissed the competitive threat in comments to reporters this week, saying the U.S. plane maker was responding to the A321neo only because the Airbus plane outsold the Max 9 by a four-to-one ratio. The Max 10’s frame would be five feet longer than that of the Max 9. Boeing doesn’t break out its Max sales by variant. Boeing is “flailing about, trying to come up with some answer to it that doesn’t cost them a fortune,” Leahy said. “Usually those things in aviation don’t work successfully.” United Continental Holdings is studying whether to convert 61 orders for the 737 Max to the 10 version, while taking a handful of Boeing 777-300ERs, the largest twin-engine jetliner currently flying, some of the people said. The carrier gained the production slots last year after it converted an earlier order for the Boeing 737-700 to the Max. The Chicago-based airline is also considering an A321neo order, the people said.

Responsibility for the success or failure of the new initiatives falls to a relative newcomer: Kevin McAllister, a 27-year General Electric veteran. On the job a little more than six months, he's the first outsider to run Boeing's US$65 billion commercial airplanes division. The multibillion-dollar bets he's guiding represent Boeing's response to the sales boom Airbus has enjoyed by inexpensively updating older jet programs. One Boeing project is for an all-new aircraft family to cover the market between the biggest narrow-body planes and smallest wide-bodies. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Another is for a larger 737 Max, expected to launch later this month, to take on Airbus's hot-selling A321neo. Both members of the global jetliner duopoly also have to contend with development programs in Russia and China. That takes McAllister back to the painting in his office depicting the heyday of the steel works in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, his hometown. The memory of the now-shuttered mills helps provide perspective, he said, that success isn't guaranteed for the titans of US industry -- not even for Boeing, the country's largest exporter. "It's a reminder that as a company we have to reinvent ourselves every day," McAllister, who now works out of a Seattle-area office park, said during his first meeting with reporters June 2. The first of the new planes likely to hit the market is the 737 Max 10, which would be the largest version of Boeing's workhorse single-aisle plane. The company is in discussions with about a dozen potential buyers of the Max 10, which is aimed at curbing the A321's appeal, said Ihssane Mounir, Boeing's chief airplane salesman. Development costs for Boeing will probably be less than $1 billion for the plane, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. The aircraft will be five feet longer than the Max 9, and feature a taller, semi-levered landing gear borrowed largely from Boeing's 777 wide-body jetliner. "It's a relatively minor development program for us to do," McAllister said. While the Boeing plane is comparable in terms of seating, it's expected to burn about 5 percent less fuel than the heavier Airbus rival. As McAllister learns Boeing's culture and walks the floors of its factories, he and his team are also meeting weekly on a more ambitious project Boeing has long been studying: its first all-new jetliner family since the 787 Dreamliner a decade ago. It won't be cheap. Development could cost $10 billion to $15 billion based on past programs, Aboulafia said. And that's if the process goes smoothly. The Dreamliner's engineering changes, cost overruns and supplier stumbles saddled the company with nearly $30 billion in deferred production costs. The goal of the new airplane concept -- dubbed the 797 by aircraft-leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy -- is to generate new travel markets. The twin-aisle, oval-shaped jets would link cities that can't be efficiently served by current aircraft models on medium-length flights, said Mike Delaney, a Boeing vice president and general manager for airplane development. The planes would debut in the mid-2020s. They would seat between 220 and 270 passengers. They would fly 4,800 to 5,000 nautical miles, connecting Chinese cities to Southeast Asia, crossing the Atlantic or joining the US to destinations deeper into Latin America. "We're going to do exactly in that market what we did with the 787," Delaney said. "Put in an airplane that's able to fly about 30 per cent more city pairs." While the strategy mirrors the more than 140 new routes pioneered by the Dreamliner, Boeing has studied and changed its engineering and development process after the first carbon-fibre jetliner fell years behind schedule. Boeing is using a processing capability, called the "digital twin," to design parts and configure the production system around the new aircraft's architecture, from automation to tooling. Following a process that has been honed with the 737 Max and 777X should lessen engineering error and disruption in the factory, Delaney said. The proposed jets would also replace the Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft that dominated the market spanning the largest narrow-bodies and smallest twin-aisle planes. Airbus has been chipping away at that by adding new engines to the A321 narrow-body and smallest twin-aisle A330neo model. The European planemaker is looking at expanding the A321neo, chief salesman John Leahy told reporters this week. "It's not just the threat itself," he said in reference to Boeing's new plane. "We listen to our customers." Delaney insists Boeing's twin-aisle jet would be superior to an even longer Airbus single-aisle plane. "I certainly wouldn't want to be in row 65E, waiting to get off." Boeing is working with 57 potential customers as it hones designs, range and potential fuel savings, McAllister said. It's not sufficient to identify a market opportunity. The real challenge lies in developing a business case that will win the approval of Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and company directors. "We have to bring Dennis and the board a dog that hunts," he said.

Businesses Dislike Competition: Boeing vs. Bombardier Edition Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Veronique de Rugy June 8, 2017 5:33 PM I have said it before but I will say it again: Cronyism is the greatest threat to capitalism. Beyond the unfair government handouts that private companies receive to boost their profits, there is something unseemly about a business model built on the expectation that the government will help you against competition. A blatant example of this sad reality can be found in the battle waged by Boeing against the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier. At the heart of the dispute before the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission is Boeing’s claim that the Canadian company was harming Boeing with its dumping practices — i.e., Boeing claims that Bombardier is distorting trade with the sale of a new series of passenger planes to Delta at a price — $19.6 million — that Boeing alleges is well below the $33 million that the planes should have cost. Boeing also complains that it is unfair since Bombardier is getting help from Canadian taxpayers and, hence, getting an edge over the competition in that market. The Canadian paper The Star reports: Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. Boeing is calling for countervailing duties of 79.41 per cent and anti-dumping charges of 79.82 per cent. Before I proceed, let me state the obvious. First, LOL. It’s rich that Boeing, the Mother of All Trade-Subsidy Receivers and the No. 1 beneficiary of the Ex-Im Bank and other government’s handouts, is complaining about “unfair” trade practices. Remember, Boeing is one of the leading companies lobbying to see a tax provision implemented (the Border Adjustment Tax) that would exempt its export income from taxes. LOL 2.0: What are we to think of Boeing crying about a company seeking unfair advantage when it is still taking out full-page newspaper ads praising President Trump based, I assume, on the president bringing the Ex-Im Bank back from the dead! Third, it tells you how distorted the mindset of companies such as Boeing are when they complain about being harmed simply based on the fact that a competitor sells its products at a lower price. As if the only way Bombardier could be selling its plane at a lower price is by the use of dumping practices. Indeed, Delta has said (more on this below) that it chose Bombardier planes to “reduce cost per seat as consumers continue to seek low fares” and because the aircraft offered “next-generation” efficiency, maintenance, and “compelling . . . passenger amenities.” Selling goods and services at a lower price than one’s competitor is what competition in the marketplace is all about! Companies are competing for consumers by offering better products and services at lower prices. The company that is better and cheaper gets the consumers and, as a result, harms the other company. However, in a free marketplace, the loser doesn’t get to complain to the government or demand that the winner be punished, especially not in the same week the White House dedicated an entire event to lamenting consumers’ poor air-travel experiences. Well, that is unless you are Boeing apparently. According to Seeking Alpha: Boeing’s claims seem to be based on the proposition that if the Bombardier deal with Delta Air Lines . . . is allowed to continue as is, Boeing 737 business is materially threatened. The Canadian government, Bombardier, and Delta have all now submitted their initial briefs in the inquiry. Interestingly, they don’t touch on the question of subsidies but instead focus on Boeing’s claim that to have suffered actual harm from Bombardier. The Delta brief is a must read. It shows that Boeing is complaining about Bombardier’s sale to Delta in a market in which Boeing does not even compete (it doesn’t produce any aircraft in the 100–125-seat range, which is what Delta was seeking to buy). Also, Boeing’s complaint is over hypothetical harms that it admits won’t materialize for years, if at all. Here are some relevant sections from the Delta and Canadian briefs. Delta on how Boeing “has not lost a single sale” in this market, because it doesn’t offer a product in this market: Boeing has not lost a single sale. . . . In fact, as the following illustration shows, Boeing does not produce a single aircraft in the 100-to 125-seat range. On why buying Boeing’s larger aircraft wouldn’t make sense: If an airline’s aircraft are too big for a particular flight or route, the airline risks flying with empty seats. Flying with empty seats means a higher per-seat cost, which means a poorer return for the airlines’ shareholders or an increased ticket price for their customers. On how, even if Delta opted for Boeing’s inferior product, Boeing couldn’t deliver for years: As a result of Boeing’s remarkable order backlog, Boeing told Delta that Boeing was effectively sold out until 2020 . . . Fundamentally, Boeing was not competing for new orders when Delta was negotiating with Bombardier. Boeing had no viable competitive alternative to the CS100 and no ability to timely deliver aircraft to Delta. Delta concludes that instead of offering a competitive product of its own, “Boeing instead attempted solely to block Bombardier.” US trade remedy laws are not intended to create a choice for airlines like Delta between a domestic product that is too big and uneconomical to fly the intended missions and, at the time of the CS 100 purchase, was not even available until 2020 . . . Delta’s fleet contains numerous Boeing planes that are the right size for their mission. Delta was not looking for a non-Boeing aircraft at any price. Delta was looking for the right sized aircraft . . .  Boeing has not demonstrated a reasonable indication of an imminent threat of material injury to the domestic industry. Instead, Boeing has built its case around a single sale it did not lose, for an aircraft it does not produce, in a market segment it ceased serving in 2006. And here’s the key piece from the Canadian brief, noting that Boeing’s entire complaint is based on hypothetical harm at some future date: Canada notes this highly unusual petition alleges no present injury and instead speculates largely on future events. . . . The Commission has never before addressed such a case, with (1) zero subject imports during the period of investigation, (2) no domestic shipments during the period of investigation, and (3) no near term subject import or domestic shipments expected. Every major power with an aerospace industry subsidizes it, and to that I say: Shame on you all! Build planes on your own without production or loan subsidies. But considering that Boeing’s sales were $94.6 billion last year and Bombardier’s aerospace revenues were $9.9 billion, it seems safe to say Boeing’s Goliath isn’t facing any imminent threat from Bombardier’s David. David Williams has a good article on all this. I like his conclusion: “Boeing is claiming it simply wants fair trade. In fact, Boeing wants to be able to trade just as unfairly as other countries do — and then some.” The Corner The one and only.

By Julie Johnsson, Anurag Kotoky and Fabiola Moura, Bloomberg Boeing is in talks with United Airlines and at least five other companies as the U.S. planemaker tries to line up initial customers for its 737 Max 10 jetliner and gain ground on a fast-selling Airbus model, people familiar with the matter said. The roster of potential buyers of the largest-ever 737, which is expected to launch this month, spans the globe. Initial sales prospects include Indonesia’s Lion Mentari Airlines, the aircraft-leasing arm of China’s development bank, Jet Airways India, SpiceJet and Copa Holdings, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. The U.S. manufacturer is seeking a groundswell of orders to demonstrate the Max 10’s market appeal and strike back at the A321neo, Airbus’s largest narrow-body jet, which is capturing trans-continental routes once dominated by Boeing’s out-of-production 757. The Max 10 talks aren’t final and Airbus could still try to thwart the sales ahead of the Paris Air Show later this month. A spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing declined to comment on the talks. Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, declined to comment on a potential order, as did CDB Aviation Lease Finance, the Chinese aircraft lessor, Jet Airways and SpiceJet. Lion and Panama City-based Copa didn’t immediately comment. The newest 737 Max would seat about 220 passengers in a single-cabin layout popular with budget carriers while burning about 5 percent less fuel than its similarly sized Airbus rival, according to the U.S. company. The Boeing jet isn’t slated to enter the commercial market until 2020. Airbus delivered the first A321neo earlier this year and has garnered 1,416 total orders, according to the company’s website. “We aren’t looking to simply build something on par with the A321neo,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing. “We’re bringing a better airplane to the market — and that’s our focus.” Airbus sales chief John Leahy dismissed the competitive threat in comments this week, saying the U.S. planemaker was responding to the A321neo only because the Airbus plane outsold the Max 9 by a four-to-one ratio. The Max 10’s frame would be five feet longer than that of the Max 9. Boeing doesn’t break out its Max sales by variant. Boeing is “flailing about, trying to come up with some answer to it that doesn’t cost them a fortune,” Leahy said. “Usually those things in aviation don’t work successfully.” United Continental Holdings is studying whether to convert 61 orders for the 737 Max to the -10 version, while taking a handful of Boeing 777-300ERs, the largest twin-engine jetliner currently flying, some of the people said. The carrier gained the production slots last year after it converted an earlier order for the Boeing 737-700 to the Max. The Chicago-based airline is also considering an A321neo order, the people said. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz said United, the third-largest U.S. carrier, was “interested” in the Max 10, during a brief interview on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association meeting in Cancun, Mexico, this week. Jet Airways, India’s biggest full-service airline, is preparing to order 50 single-aisle jets, Bloomberg reported June 5. The airline, which operates an all-Boeing narrow-body fleet, is evaluating the Max 10, the high-density Max 200 as well as the Airbus A321neo.   Most Read Vote for the high school athletes of the year Here are the seniors nominated for Boys Athlete of the Year and… Jun 8th, 2017 by Herald Staff Appointed county councilman’s youth, connections criticized MARYSVILLE — Nate Nehring’s youth and political ties were objects of curiosity… Jun 7th, 2017 by Noah Haglund DUI suspected in Lake Stevens head-on collision; 2 injured LAKE STEVENS — Deputies with the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office investigated an… Jun 7th, 2017 by Herald Staff Ribbon-cutting ceremony set for WSU building in north Everett EVERETT — An open house is planned for Aug. 15 for the… Jun 7th, 2017 by Jim Davis Woman uses app to track man suspected of stealing from her LAKE STEVENS — A 26-year-old woman discovered her Jeep had been broken… Jun 7th, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

New Delhi (Sputnik) – Boeing had chosen to procure components from the Indian company through a joint venture against mandatory requirement to offset 30 per cent of the price tag for the helicopter. But this JV did not provide the much needed technological know-how to India's TASL. Nevertheless, Boeing termed this development a significant step to increase defense capability and manufacturing capacity out of India with strategic partners. "Tata Advanced Systems has demonstrated its ability to deliver high-quality components to the CH-47 Chinook program on schedule, which in turn helps Boeing meet commitments to our customers. We are clearly invested in leveraging the full potential of capability that exists in India to continue delivering greater value for less cost to our US and international customers," Pratyush Kumar, President, Boeing India, said. India's Defense Ministry had finalized an order of 15 CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters with Boeing in 2015 at $1.1 billion. Delivery of the choppers will start from 2019. "Obviously, technology transfer would have been a better option for Indian company. Nevertheless, producing components and delivering to OEMs will definitely boost export business. And with experience, in the long run, companies can themselves develop indigenous technology to manufacture such parts," Amit Cowshish, former financial advisor to India's Defense Ministry, said. TASL is already delivering crown and tailcones for CH-47 Chinook helicopters for the US Army and international customers. "Undertaking the responsibility of complete manufacture and assembly for Boeing gives us an excellent opportunity to display our capability of development and assembly projects in high technology areas to global quality standards," Sukaran Singh, CMD, TASL, said. The American Chinook choppers will supplement the Russian Mi-26 of the Indian Air Force. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Boeing Co Vice President of Product Development Mike Sinnett revealed the news during an interview. He says that he will start testing the self-flying planes out via a simulator this year. According to Sinnett, Boeing Co will likely be ready to test its self-flying planes in the real world sometime in 2018. He says that these planes will have artificial intelligence that can handle some decisions that are normally made by pilots. The move toward self-flying planes may not be a large one to make. Modern planes are already capable of handling take off, landing and cruising through the air on their own. There are also already self-flying drones on the market. While the jump to self-flying planes may not be a far one, Sinnett says that there are some major concerns. This includes making an artificial intelligence that can handle emergency situations. He specifically mentioned Captain Chesley Sullenberger making the safe landing on the Hudson and says that AI needs to be capable of that before it can be trusted to fly planes on its own, reports CNBC. “I would be perfectly happy if what came out of this whole study is that we need more pilots, and we’re going to commit to training and ensuring that we have the right levels of experience and competence,” Sinnett  told GeekWire. “This isn’t a quest to go take pilots out of the cockpit. This is a quest to ensure that the system maintains the same level of safety that we have today.” BA stock was up 1% as of Thursday afternoon and is up 22% year-to-date.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

(GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle) EVERETT, Wash. – Some manufacturing workers may worry that robots will be stealing their jobs, but not Boeing’s Jordan Northrup. He’s glad to work with Robot 1 and Robot 2, the industrial-strength machines that drill holes and hook up fasteners in the metal panels of a Boeing 777 jet’s fuselage. “Instead of blowing my shoulder out, shooting 300 fasteners a day or countersinking 300 holes a day, I get to learn a new skill. … I get to run a robot,” said Northrup, structures team lead for midbody at the Fuselage Automated Upright Build facility in Boeing’s Everett plant. The facility, known as the FAUB, is just one of the places where Boeing is upping the ante for automation in the airplane industry. Boeing showed off the FAUB and other robotic hot spots at its Everett plant as a preview for this month’s Paris Air Show. As Boeing gears up to start building 777X airplanes, the company is building on its experience with robot-assisted assembly for the widebody 787 Dreamliner and single-aisle 737 MAX as well as the 777. “The 777X actually is designed for automation from the base,” said Jason Clark, vice president of operations for the 777 and the 777X. “It isn’t our first one, but it’s the next generation.” Workers at Boeing’s 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett get a robot ready for “drill and fill” tasks.

(GeekWire Photo / Chelsey Ballarte) A worker keeps watch on a riveting robot inside the mid-body fuselage of a 777 jet. (Boeing Photo) Robots will lay down precisely placed strips of carbon fiber tape to build up the elements of the 777X’s composite wings, drill and fill the attachment points for the wing panels, and position those panels for assembly. The machines don’t come cheap: Boeing invested $1 billion in its 777X Composite Wing Center, which was built in Everett thanks in part to $8.7 billion in tax incentives that Washington state will be providing through 2040. Kevin McAllister, the president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, says the billion dollars is the “right investment” for the company, considering how much is riding on the 777X. “Automation is as much about safety and ergonomics and a better work environment as it is about cost and productivity,” he told reporters last week. “I think the focus we have on the production system, on optimization, is important.” The metrics from the FAUB operation bear out what McAllister, and Northrup, say about improving the work environment, according to Brad Zaback, vice president and deputy general manager of the 777 program. His group is keeping an eye on the tally of significant job-related injuries, also known as recordables. “We’ve had a 40 percent reduction when we started looking at this, from November to today,” Zaback said. Zaback said there’s also evidence that robotically machined parts fit together better, and suffer fewer defects from scratching steel rivets against the 777 fuselage’s aluminum skin. “Our big driver [for automation] was riveting, going into it from a safety and quality perspective,” Zaback said. Clark said adding automation to the assembly process can pose a huge hurdle at first. Last year, several mechanics complained to The Seattle Times that the FAUB was turning out incomplete work, and blamed the robots. At the time, Clark acknowledged that the system was “a little tough in the teething,” but said much of the disruption was due to problems with suppliers. The hurdles can loom higher when new twists in automation are combined with the other challenges involved in starting up 777X production. Previously: An inside look at Boeing’s 737 MAX tech “When we put a new product on an existing line, it’s like riding a bicycle on the freeway,” Clark said. To make for a smoother ramp-up, Boeing plans to start by alternating 777 and 777X airframes on the assembly line for low-rate initial production, a term that’s abbreviated as LRIP. Eric Lindblad, vice president and general manager for the 777X program, said the timetable calls for the first flightworthy airplane to be assembled in 2018 and undergo testing in 2019. “Our plan is to deliver the airplane, as promised, in 2020,” Lindblad told reporters. “We’re working with customers right now as to the opportunity, maybe, to deliver a little bit early.” If the 777X project turns out to be as successful as Boeing hopes, robots will have played a role – but Perry Moore, 777X wing integrated product team leader, says the humans deserve most of the credit. In fact, Boeing’s experience suggests that it’s impossible to take humans out of the loop — which will surely come as a disappointment to Terminator robots from the future. “There’s lots of robotic-human interaction on this,” Moore said. “There’s a significant amount of manual work left in this process.” More from Boeing’s Paris Air Show preview: Boeing is testing technologies for self-flying airplanes Commercial Airplanes CEO on jobs, the ‘797’ and steel-town lessons GeekWire aerospace and science editor Alan Boyle is an award-winning science writer and veteran space reporter.

Kevin McAllister, the president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, conducts his first solo news conference at Boeing’s Longacres facility. (GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle) RENTON, Wash. – Six and a half months into his tenure as Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ president and CEO, Kevin McAllister is mindful of the challenges that lie ahead for one of America’s top manufacturers – and draws upon a cautionary tale from his childhood in America’s industrial heartland. McAllister grew up in Bethlehem, Pa., and remembers well what happened to Bethlehem Steel. The company was once America’s second-largest steel producer, but it went bankrupt in 2001 and faded away, along with much of the nation’s steel industry. Today, the site of Bethlehem’s shut-down plant is a city park. But in his office, McAllister keeps a painting of the mill as it looked in its heyday. “It’s kind of corny,” the 53-year-old admitted last week at Boeing’s offices in Longacres Industrial Park, during his first extended “meet the press” session as a Boeing executive. “It’s just a reminder that as a company we’ve got to reinvent ourselves every day.” McAllister says Boeing Commercial Airplanes is doing that, thanks in part to the legacy of his predecessor, Ray Conner, who handed over the reins last November. “I’m blessed to follow in his footsteps … but I think we’ve got to continue to find ways to grow our competitiveness,” McAllister said. Competitiveness. That’s the key challenge for McAllister and other Boeing executives, going all the way up to Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s overall chairman, president and CEO.     When Muilenburg announced that McAllister was coming over to Boeing after spending 27 years at GE Aviation, he said “we still see commercial airplanes as a growth business … but as I think you’re aware, today we enjoy a 50 percent market share in that business.” Today Boeing is neck-and-neck with Airbus, its European archrival in the commercial airplane market. To keep the price of its planes competitive with Airbus, Boeing is in the midst of a grueling campaign to cut costs – which means reducing headcount. Even before McAllister joined the company, Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ 80,000-strong workforce was in the throes of what worked out to a reduction of more than 8 percent for 2016. And the workforce is continuing to shrink, by 3 percent so far this year. McAllister addressed the job reductions and the outlook for airplane sales, among many other topics, during his hourlong encounter with reporters last Friday. Boeing organized the meeting as part of a two-day press tour in advance of this month’s Paris Air Show, on the condition that the information would be held for release today. Here are 10 sound bites from our meet-up with McAllister: What’s the market outlook: McAllister says he’s encouraged by the balance between air traffic growth and growth in airline capacity for the first quarter of 2017. “To see traffic growth at 7 percent and capacity growth at 5.5 percent is a good indicator of the supply-demand balance in the industry,” he said. North America is showing relatively slow but balanced growth, the Middle East is a hotter market, and “the pacesetters so far this year” are Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. How’s the long-term sales outlook? A “pretty big replacement cycle” should start in about 2021, when Airbus’ A330 jets and Boeing’s 777-200ER’s and 777-300ER’s reach retirement age. That’s just about when Boeing’s 777X deliveries should be hitting their stride. “This is a very healthy industry for us in the long run to look at,” McAllister said. Kevin McAllister, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, has a photo op at Seattle’s Museum of Flight with Adam Tan Xiangdong, CEO of HNA Group, in May. (GeekWire Photo / Chelsey Ballarte) What’s the next plane on the horizon? There’s been lots of talk about creating a new breed of twin-aisle jets with roughly 220 to 270 passenger seats to replace aging 757s and 767s. It’s variously known as the middle-of-the-market airplane, or MOM; the new market airplane, a.k.a. NMA; or just the 797. Whatever you call it, McAllister sounds bullish about building it. “Now the work is around how do we do it, and how do you do it in a way that fits the business plan. We’re putting a lot of work as a team in a weekly rhythm to go figure out how we get there.” Eventually, the plan will have to be presented to Muilenburg and Boeing’s board for their approval. If they give the go-ahead, the plane would enter service in the mid-2020s. How is Boeing improving efficiency? McAllister touted “champion time,” a program in which teams of workers compete to see who can get a designated job done more quickly. “Why do we do it faster 25 percent of the time? … I think analytics and digital is a big piece of my background in the services business at GE. I think it’s a big opportunity here to learn faster about what gives us more speed, what gives us higher quality, what drives productivity in the organization.” More from the Boeing tour: How robots and humans will join forces for 777X What are digital sprints? McAllister said Boeing recently held a hackathon to come up with better solutions to engineering problems, and is encouraging its data analysts to take on digital sprints. “The idea of a digital sprint is to take a data scientist and get them plugged right into a real problem – not a big problem, but a simple problem on the floor in our engineering community – and launch a digital app, an application that solves that issue or puts the right data in the hands of the operators in 30 days or less. … It’s driven a lot of energy into the business.” What about those job reductions? “I certainly don’t enjoy reducing headcount. It’s not something I wake up in the morning feeling good about. But the reality is, when we took the 777 production rate down, we had to make a reduction in headcount. I think we’ve done it in the right way … the vast majority we’ve done voluntarily, with a very small amount of reduction of force involuntarily.” McAllister suggested that the cutbacks may not be finished: He said has a cost-reduction target to shoot for, but “I don’t have a headcount number at the top of my head.” Will suppliers feel the pinch, too? “We have to have the same accountability in the supply chain as we have in our business for productivity, for cost competitiveness. We have some suppliers that are doing a terrific job, that are very focused on building capability for the future, and others that are less so. … Look, there’s choice in the market.” Read more: Boeing looks into self-flying planes Will Boeing stay in the Puget Sound region? “I’ll tell you, having the chance to walk the floor of Renton, of Everett, of Auburn, I see some tremendous people that want to win. I think we’ve made big investments here. We’ve got great capability here, and we’re just going to continue to make it better. I found an energized workforce that wants us to make things simpler, that wants to make things faster, and that is pretty committed to winning in the marketplace.” Has McAllister run into negative feedback from employees? “I’ve been bathed in it. I’ve been bathed in very positive feedback, and not-so-positive feedback, but all constructive. Look, I’ve given feedback back, too. … I may not like their view, but I owe them honest feedback back, and I owe it to them to find a nugget of truth and get someone to follow up on it. … I’ve found accountability is a great energizer.” What’s McAllister’s focus going forward? “Continuing to improve the competitiveness for the company as a means to fund our future. It’s not lost on me. I tell you, it is not lost on the 100-year legacy of this company, and the responsibilities that all of us have to drive the next 100. I think the way we do that is … we connect the dots, we connect our people, we simplify our business, we drive faster decisions, and we ride on that great technology path that we have in the company.” GeekWire aerospace and science editor Alan Boyle is an award-winning science writer and veteran space reporter.

Following an annual Air Force schedule risk assessment on the tanker, the service said that the originally planned September delivery will likely be pushed back at least several months. Progress is slowed mainly due to the tanker not yet achieving airworthiness certifications from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and not yet completing the flight test program, the Air Force said in a written statement. “Once Boeing receives the remaining design approvals from the FAA, they expect testing to proceed on a faster pace,” according to the statement. “[T]he Air Force assessment predicts first aircraft delivery beyond Boeing's forecast into late Spring of 2018.” The statement adds that the delays “will not result in additional cost to the taxpayer.” Boeing, though, insists it can deliver the first aircraft by the end of the year, December 2017, as currently planned. The KC-46 tanker, also called the Pegasus, is meant to replace the Air Force’s aging KC-135 tanker fleet. The program has been plagued, however, with numerous cost overruns and schedule delays. The Air Force has made no secret of possible additional delays with the KC-46, and hinted this week that Boeing would need more time to complete several milestones. The service’s top uniformed acquisition official, Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, said that the Air Force was telling lawmakers that the September 2017 delivery goal would not be met, and it was also likely that Boeing would not deliver the first KC-46 by the end of the year, according to Defense News. “Boeing is still committed. They're putting resources [into it] and their drive is to get it done faster than what we believe they can,” he told reporters. “We're all for that. We would welcome that, and we will provide them the resources we can to make that happen.” He also said that the Air Force is looking into options with Boeing to accelerate the delivery pace. Boeing spokesman Charles Ramey told The Hill that the company agrees with the Air Force assessment that there are risks but is still planning to deliver the first KC-46 by late 2017. “Nothing has changed in that regard and that’s what we’ve said for some time now,” Ramey said in a statement. “We are working closely with the Air Force to ensure we have a good plan in place to execute aircraft build, test and delivery.” He added that Boeing expects the next phase of testing to be much faster “now that the design has stabilized. The majority of developmental testing is complete, which reduces risk to the certification and verification testing. ... We are not discovering any new technical risk.” The service still expects to receive 18 tankers and nine refueling pods by an October 2018 deadline.   View the discussion thread.

The Deployable Mission Readiness Trainers, ordered under a recent contract, are to be delivered beginning in 2019, Boeing said. "Training ensures the Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance community is proficient in anti-submarine warfare," CDR. John Thoe, P-8A training systems integrated product team lead, said in a press release. "By using these trainers, crews are trained without adding flight hours to the aircraft. "DMRTs will fulfill these important requirements by providing high-fidelity, crew-based training to deployed squadrons." The P-8A Poseidon is based on Boeing's 737-800ERX. It is used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and shipping interdiction. Being said its DMRT includes its Weapons Tactics Trainer system, incorporating sonobuoy and ocean acoustics modeling. The trainers will allow Navy crews to continue simulator training while deployed abroad.

jalopnik Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Jalopnik Reviews Foxtrot Alpha Black Flag Truck Yeah Lanesplitter The Garage You People Won't Stop Buying Crossovers And Now It's Ruining Vacations Michael BallabanYesterday 10:45am Filed to: The Morning Shift TMS Ford Boeing 297 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo credit: Ford Good morning! Welcome to The Morning Shift, your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Ultimately nothing matters because we’ll all be dead eventually, but until then, stave off the inevitable with the most important auto-related stories of the day. 1st Gear: Ford’s Shortening Its Traditional Two-Week Break At Crossover Plant The two-week summer break is A Thing at a lot of American car factories, and it goes back decades. It helps ease up some overdone supply, and it gives the workers a little bit of vacation. But y’all want crossovers like the Ford Escape and the Lincoln MKC so badly that Ford is shortening the break at its Louisville plant to only one week, Automotive News reports: Advertisement “The record sales for Ford Escape through May are being driven by strong demand from our retail customers,” Raj Nair, Ford’s president of North America, said in a statement. “This is our strongest ever retail start for Escape, with retail sales up more than 6 percent versus this time last year.” Through the first five months of the year, Escape sales are up nearly 3 percent to 129,805 and MKC sales are up 10 percent to 11,161 through May.﻿ All that being said, everyone who gets paid hourly at the plant will be making a bunch more money. People like money. Good for them. 2nd Gear: Nissan’s Going To Put Emergency Automatic Braking On Almost All Its Cars Sponsored Nissan’s going to be the second company to put automatic emergency braking, which uses radar to stop you from driving straight into a wall, into the majority of its cars. Nissan says in a press release: Nissan today announced that it is making Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) standard on a projected one million vehicles sold in the United States for model year 2018, including seven of the company’s most popular models – Rogue/Rogue Sport, Altima, Murano, LEAF, Pathfinder, Maxima and Sentra (except manual transmission-equipped and all NISMO versions).﻿ Toyota was the first company to pledge this for the American market, and Nissan will be the second, which is cool I suppose, because safety IS cool, my friends. 3rd Gear: Boeing Going For Pilotless Jets Boeing, the airplane company which makes the airplanes, notes that a lot of airplanes can already fly themselves, so why not the plane that also has you in it? Maybe the plane that has you in it should also have no pilot at all, according to Reuters: Advertisement Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world’s biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,” said Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years.﻿ I may be mistaken here, but “take off, cruise, and land” already constitutes a large majority of What Most Planes Do. Plus a lot of plane crashes in the past decade have been a result of pilot error, so if you take the pilot out of the equation, that should mean fewer errors. Advertisement But our infrastructure probably isn’t quite up to the task yet. Maybe soon. 4th Gear: Honda Wants Self-Driving Cars By 2025 Honda wants level 4 autonomy in its self-driving cars by 2025, the Detroit Free Press says: Advertisement Honda said Thursday that it expects to deliver self-driving vehicles by 2025, potentially putting the Japanese automaker several years behind its rivals in the furious race to reshape personal transportation. The company said its goal is to introduce “highly-automated” vehicles by then, featuring the ability to handle nearly all situations on the road without driver intervention. “This is our timeline, and we can’t really speak to where others are in their process,” Honda spokesman Sage Marie said in an email. “Honda isn’t always the first to the party, but we’re usually the best dressed!”﻿ From this statement, I think it is fair to say that Honda will be behind Tesla, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Volvo, and probably a bunch of others, but the next generation of Civic will look fab. Advertisement 5th Gear: The French Self-Driving Taxi Revolution Has Begun Self-driving taxi tests are beginning in France, Automotive News says: Advertisement Delphi Automotive plans to introduce a fleet of self-driving vehicles that will provide commercial taxi service in Normandy and suburban Paris. The company, in a statement Wednesday, said it formed a partnership with Transdev, a French provider of commercial mobility services. Transdev will supply vehicle-routing software, while Delphi will equip electric vehicles with radar, lidar and Mobileye cameras. Delphi said its autonomous vehicles will operate in Saclay, a suburb of Paris, along a fixed route from a railway station to the campus of the University of Paris-Saclay.﻿ This is, as the French say, horse hockey. I don’t want a self-driving taxi to tootle around a banlieue. I want it to drive for hours around the Arc de Triomphe. ACCEPT NOTHING LESS THAN THE BEST, FRANCE. Advertisement Reverse: New Automotive Startup Created On this day in 1948, a hand-built aluminum prototype labeled “No. 1″ becomes the first vehicle to bear the name of one of the world’s leading luxury car manufacturers: Porsche.﻿ Neutral: Would You Feel Comfortable Getting On A Self-Flying Plane? Advertisement I think I’d be cool with it. Michael Ballaban ballaban@jalopnik.com @ballaban Deputy Editor, Jalopnik. 1991 Yugo.

The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for under US$1,000, “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,” said Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and “fly on an airplane next year with artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make”, he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, said the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don’t yet know how to certify such planes. “I have no idea how we’re going to do that,” Sinnett said. “But we’re studying it right now and we’re developing those algorithms.” Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the “Miracle on the Hudson,” Sinnett said. “If it can’t, then we can’t go there.” A US Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger glided the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister said separately.

New Delhi (Sputnik) — Boeing had chosen to procure components from the Indian company through a joint venture against mandatory requirement to offset 30 per cent of the price tag for the helicopter. But this JV did not provide the much needed technological know-how to India’s TASL. Nevertheless, Boeing termed this development a significant step to increase defense capability and manufacturing capacity out of India with strategic partners. “Tata Advanced Systems has demonstrated its ability to deliver high-quality components to the CH-47 Chinook program on schedule, which in turn helps Boeing meet commitments to our customers. We are clearly invested in leveraging the full potential of capability that exists in India to continue delivering greater value for less cost to our US and international customers,” Pratyush Kumar, President, Boeing India, said. India’s Defense Ministry had finalized an order of 15 CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters with Boeing in 2015 at $1.1 billion. Delivery of the choppers will start from 2019. “Obviously, technology transfer would have been a better option for Indian company. Nevertheless, producing components and delivering to OEMs will definitely boost export business. And with experience, in the long run, companies can themselves develop indigenous technology to manufacture such parts,” Amit Cowshish, former financial advisor to India’s Defense Ministry, said. © Flickr/ DVIDSHUB India to Purchase Sole C-17 Transporters in Boeing's InventoryTASL is already delivering crown and tailcones for CH-47 Chinook helicopters for the US Army and international customers. “Undertaking the responsibility of complete manufacture and assembly for Boeing gives us an excellent opportunity to display our capability of development and assembly projects in high technology areas to global quality standards,” Sukaran Singh, CMD, TASL, said. The American Chinook choppers will supplement the Russian Mi-26 of the Indian Air Force. ...

On the job a little more than six months, he’s the first outsider to run Boeing’s $65 billion commercial airplanes division. Advertisement Boeing Co. is about to go on the offensive after watching Airbus SE creep into a market segment the U.S. planemaker had dominated since the 1980s. Responsibility for the success or failure of the new initiatives falls to a relative newcomer: Kevin McAllister, a 27-year General Electric Co. veteran. On the job a little more than six months, he’s the first outsider to run Boeing’s $65 billion commercial airplanes division. The multibillion-dollar bets he’s guiding represent Boeing’s response to the sales boom Airbus has enjoyed by inexpensively updating older jet programs. One Boeing project is for an all-new aircraft family to cover the market between the biggest narrow-body planes and smallest wide-bodies. Another is for a larger 737 Max, expected to launch later this month, to take on Airbus’s hot-selling A321neo. Both members of the global jetliner duopoly also have to contend with aircraft development programs in Russia and China. That takes McAllister back to the painting in his office depicting the heyday of the steel works in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, his hometown. The memory of the now-shuttered mills helps provide perspective, he said, that success isn’t guaranteed for the titans of U.S. industry -- not even for Boeing, the country’s largest exporter. “It’s a reminder that as a company we have to reinvent ourselves every day,” McAllister, who now works out of a Seattle-area office park, said during his first meeting with reporters June 2. Popular Now The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter Five Steps to Improved Manufacturing Quality AI ‘Good for the World’... Says Robot Max 10 The first of the new planes likely to hit the market is the 737 Max 10, which would be the largest version of Boeing’s workhorse single-aisle plane. The company is in discussions with about a dozen potential buyers of the Max 10, which is aimed at curbing the A321’s appeal, said Ihssane Mounir, Boeing’s chief airplane salesman. Development costs for Boeing will probably be less than $1 billion for the plane, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. The aircraft will be five feet longer than the Max 9, and feature a taller, semi-levered landing gear borrowed largely from Boeing’s 777 wide-body jetliner. For a look at customers said to be looking at the 737 Max 10, click here “It’s a relatively minor development program for us to do,” McAllister said. While the Boeing plane is comparable in terms of seating, it’s expected to burn about 5 percent less fuel than the heavier Airbus rival. As McAllister learns Boeing’s culture and walks the floors of its factories, he and his team are also meeting weekly on a more ambitious project Boeing has long been studying: its first all-new jetliner family since the 787 Dreamliner a decade ago. It won’t be cheap. Development could cost $10 billion to $15 billion based on past programs, Aboulafia said. And that’s if the process goes smoothly. The Dreamliner’s engineering changes, cost overruns and supplier stumbles saddled the company with nearly $30 billion in deferred production costs. New Markets The goal of the new airplane concept -- dubbed the 797 by aircraft-leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy -- is to generate new travel markets. The twin-aisle, oval-shaped jets would link cities that can’t be efficiently served by current aircraft models on medium-length flights, said Mike Delaney, a Boeing vice president and general manager for airplane development. The planes would debut in the mid-2020s. They would seat between 220 and 270 passengers. They would fly 4,800 to 5,000 nautical miles, connecting Chinese cities to Southeast Asia, crossing the Atlantic or joining the U.S. to destinations deeper into Latin America. “We’re going to do exactly in that market what we did with the 787,” Delaney said. “Put in an airplane that’s able to fly about 30 percent more city pairs.” While the strategy mirrors the more than 140 new routes pioneered by the Dreamliner, Boeing has studied and changed its engineering and development process after the first carbon-fiber jetliner fell years behind schedule. Boeing is using a processing capability, called the “digital twin,” to design parts and configure the production system around the new aircraft’s architecture, from automation to tooling. Following a process that has been honed with the 737 Max and 777X should lessen engineering error and disruption in the factory, Delaney said. Airbus Plan The proposed jets would also replace the Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft that dominated the market spanning the largest narrow-bodies and smallest twin-aisle planes. Airbus has been chipping away at that by adding new engines to the A321 narrow-body and smallest twin-aisle A330neo model. The European planemaker is looking at expanding the A321neo, chief salesman John Leahy said this week. “It’s not just the threat itself,” he said in reference to Boeing’s new plane. “We listen to our customers.” Delaney insists Boeing’s twin-aisle jet would be superior to an even longer Airbus single-aisle plane. ‘Row 65E’ “I certainly wouldn’t want to be in row 65E, waiting to get off,” he said. Boeing is working with 57 potential customers as it hones designs, range and potential fuel savings, McAllister said. It’s not sufficient to identify a market opportunity. The real challenge lies in developing a business case that will win the approval of Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and company directors. “We have to bring Dennis and the board a dog that hunts,” he said.

A statement issued in Accra by Mrs Hanna Atnafu, Manager, Corporate Communications, Ethiopian Airlines, said the Airline also took the opportunity to take delivery of yet another B787 aircraft from Boeing. It said Ethiopian and Boeing have synergized with Conscience International (CI), Horn of Africa Neonatal Development Services and Seattle Alliance Outreach (SAO) organisations for the deliveries. Mr Tewolde GebreMariam, Group CEO, Ethiopian Airlines, said: 'For us, fulfilling our corporate social responsibilities is as important as our focus on pure business performance.' He said this round of their humanitarian delivery was a continuation of their commendable collaboration with Boeing that has served as a source of vital service for our community and neighbouring countries as well. 'Moreover, we are pleased to name our 18th B787 after Mother Teresa, who is always remembered as an icon of philanthropy. As a responsible corporate citizen, Ethiopian will continue to contribute to the socio-economic development of the country by relentlessly delivering on its corporate social responsibilities,' he added. He said: 'On the other hand, pursuant to our fleet modernisation plan and to further meet the ever growing demand of our customers, we are in bold move of modernising and expanding our fleet, networks and facilities.' He said this move would further ensure unmatched combination of operational flexibility, efficiency and passenger comfort that would allow Ethiopian to achieve its goal to be the leading Aviation Group in Africa and a leading global airline. Currently, Ethiopian has 18 B787 in operation, deployed on its long haul passenger routes, and will receive the 19th by the end of this month, ferrying medical equipment and supplies for St. Paul's Hospital.

The roster of potential buyers of the largest-ever 737, which is expected to launch this month, includes Indonesia’s Lion Air, Jet Airways, Spice Jet and Copa Holdings, said a report in Bloomberg. Boeing is looking to gain ground on a fast-selling A321neo, which is capturing trans-continental routes once dominated by Boeing’s out-of-production 757. The Max 10 talks aren’t final. A spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing declined to comment on the talks, the report said. The newest 737 Max would seat around 230 passengers in a single-cabin layout common among LCCs or 189 passengers in two-class capacity. At a length of 43.8 meters (only a modest 1.68 m or two rows longer than the MAX 9), the new variant does not require a thorough re-design, the only major change being the trailinig-link landing gear modification. This means that the model can be fitted with same wing and CFM LEAP 1B engines as the MAX 9. “We aren’t looking to simply build something on par with the A321neo,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing. “We’re bringing a better airplane to the market -- and that’s our focus.” United Continental Holdings Inc. is studying whether to convert 61 orders for the 737 Max to the -10 version, while taking a handful of Boeing 777-300ERs, the largest twin-engine jetliner currently flying, persons close to the matter said. Chief executive officer Oscar Munoz said United, the third-largest US carrier, was “interested” in the Max 10, during a brief interview on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association meeting in Cancun, Mexico, this week.

This was to become the B-17 Flying Fortress, the most iconic bomber of the second world war. Here are some amazing facts you probably won’t know about this mighty bomber! The prototype B-17 Bomber was built at the company’s own expense and was a fusion of the features of Boeing XB-15 and Boeing 247 Transport Aircraft. Initially, it could carry a payload of 2200 kg along with (5) .30-cal. machine guns. The prototype crashed, and it could not complete the evaluation, and the future of the B-17 seemed very bleak. Through a loophole in the law, Boeing managed to sell 13 improved prototypes to the US Army, and they proved very successful. The name Flying Fortress was coined by a reporter of the Seattle Times and from there on became the trademark for Boeing. Although various models of the B-17 Flying Fortress were produced, the B-17G was the one that was liked the most. A B-17G weighed 65,000 pounds and could cruise at a speed of 150 mph, peaking at 287 mph. It could attain a service ceiling of 35,600 feet, and carry a 9600 pounds payload. The (4) Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines could produce 1200 HP each. The B-17 Flying Fortress was used in every single World War II combat zone. The US 8th Air Force arrived in England in 1942 with the sole mission of destroying Germany’s ability to wage war by any means necessary, be it carpet bombing or precision bombing. On August 17th, 1942 eighteen B-17s went into wartime service on a bombing raid over Nazi-held territory in Europe, hitting railway networks and strategic points. Subsequently, Operation Aphrodite was launched, during which the US Air Force carried out precision bombing against bunkers and hardened enemy targets. Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., the brother of future US President John F. Kennedy, died during the raid. During the month of January 1943, the Allies carried out the Combined Bomber Offensive against the Germans. The B-17 was chosen by the Americans while the British primarily chose the Wellington or Lancaster bomber. The US would attack during the day while the British would carry out operations during the night. The result was severe damage to Nazi morale as well as to the capability to fight back. The three most costly raids saw the loss of dozens of B-17s and hundreds of lives. August 17th, 1943, 376 bombers were sent out to attack a ball-bearing plant in Schweinfurt and Regensburg, 60 were lost. October 14th,1944, 291 B-17s sent to the same location, 77 were lost. January 11th, 1944, 663 B-17s sent to bomb various industries in Germany. Bad weather brought down this number to 238 out of which 60 were lost. After the war ended, many B-17s were converted into commercial aircraft and purchased for VIP transport and rescue missions. Still, B-17s were used during the Korean War and for analyzing nuclear mushroom clouds for experimental purposes. By the time production ended in 1945, Boeing along with Douglas & Vega had built 12,731 bombers. The B-17 was operated by almost all countries either militarily or commercially in Asia, North America, South America and Europe due to their versatility. The last airworthy B-17 left is in Europe and is known as The Sally B. It is now based in Imperial War Museum in Duxford, England, and still flies at air shows across the UK and Europe.

But, that’s exactly what happened with the end-of-school-year trend of paying off the lunch debt of school kids. “We made a New Year’s resolution that we were going to make a difference this year,” retired Boeing employee Tom Lee said Wednesday. ARMY-BOUND HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR STOLE AT GRADUATION It was around tax time that Tom and his wife, Christy, who also worked for Boeing for more than 30 years, realized they weren’t giving to charities as much as they used to. “I looked at the stuff we had donated to last year, like Stand Up to Cancer, Meals on Wheels. And boy, this isn’t anything like when we used to when we used to work at Boeing.” They're a couple of modest means in a modest two-story Marysville home, but they're ramping up giving generously again -- and then some. This is an important year for Tom. His kidneys are failing, and for four hours every other day he's hooked up to a dialysis machine, which acts an artificial kidney to clean his blood of unwanted waste. In early May, he got the news that his heart is not healthy enough for a transplant. "That probably pushed me out over the edge, too, to do this now." For a combined 60 years, the Marysville couple says they used to donate to the Boeing's Employee Community Fund, which matches employee charitable contributions. In 2016 alone, the fund donated $163 million to communities around the world. But for Tom, the seeds of his generosity were planted well before he started in IT at the Boeing plant in Everett. UTAH BOY PLEDGES ALLEGIANCE TO FLAG WHEN NO ONE'S LOOKING He credits his grandfather, a preacher. "That giving," says Tom. "I watched it with my grandfather. Of course, I grew up with my mom, who was a preacher's daughter, but that kind of giving goes back to that side of the family." Tom and Christy wanted to give back to the school district that helped their now-grown son become the man he is today. So, hearing about school lunch debt, they came down in mid-May to their neighborhood elementary school where their son attended in the 1990s. They asked to pay the entire lunch debt for the whole school. They were expecting a price tag in the thousands, but it only came down to $259. So, then they asked what it would cost them to erase the lunch debt at all 10 elementary schools in the Marysville School District -- something that district officials said no one has ever done before. "It was a total of $5,495," said Tom. "I think the [district clerk] was surprised I didn't have a shocked look on my face." Read more at Q13Fox.

 Boeing wants to build a futuristic plane that can fly without a pilot Alwyn Scott, Reuters Jun. 8, 2017, 9:31 AM 1,071 facebook linkedin twitter email print Kevin McAllister chief executive of Boeing's jetliner business is seen at a briefing in Renton WashingtonThomson Reuters SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and "fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make", he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes. "I have no idea how we're going to do that," Sinnett said. "But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the "Miracle on the Hudson," Sinnett said. "If it can't, then we can't go there." A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. "This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors'" he said, referring to rival Airbus. "It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?" (Editing by David Clarke) Get the latest Boeing stock price here.

A State Department official said the diplomatic battle and President Donald Trump’s criticism of Qatar, which is under fire for allegedly supporting terrorist groups, has not affected the pending deal to deliver 72 F-15QA multirole fighters, according to Fox News. In a statement, Boeing said it’s “closely following recent developments.” “We have been working closely with the U.S. and Qatari governments on this proposed sale. We continue to expect that an agreement will be signed,” Boeing added. Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations have severed their ties with Qatar, accusing the small oil-rich country of funding terrorism. The disagreement also stems from Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood. “So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding…extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!” Trump wrote in messages posted to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The Obama administration approved the F-15 sale in November. The agreement, which has yet to be finalized, aimed to improve Qatar’s defense capabilities. Boeing would be the primary defense contractor involved in the sale. Other contractors including Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Elbit Systems (NASDAQ:ESLT) and BAE Systems (OTC:BAESY) would support production of the F-15 Eagle. Qatar is home to the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East. The military launches operations against ISIS from Al Udeid Air Base, where an estimated 10,000 Americans are deployed. Military officials have said the diplomatic fight won’t impact U.S. missions. Boeing shares rose 0.8% to $188.30 in recent trading.

After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. “This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies — not by ours or our competitors’” he said, referring to rival Airbus. “It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Responsibility for the success or failure of the new initiatives falls to a relative newcomer: Kevin McAllister, a 27-year General Electric Co. veteran. On the job a little more than six months, he’s the first outsider to run Boeing’s $65 billion commercial airplanes division. The multibillion-dollar bets he’s guiding represent Boeing’s response to the sales boom Airbus has enjoyed by inexpensively updating older jet programs. The riskiest gamble is on an all-new Boeing aircraft family to cover the gap between the biggest narrow-body planes and smallest wide-bodies. Another is for a larger 737 Max, expected to launch later this month, to take on Airbus’s hot-selling A321neo. Both members of the global jetliner duopoly also have to contend with aircraft-development programs in Russia and China. That takes McAllister back to the painting in his office depicting the heyday of the steel works in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, his hometown. The memory of the now-shuttered mills helps provide perspective, he said, that success isn’t assured for the titans of U.S. industry -- not even for Boeing, the country’s largest exporter. “It’s a reminder that as a company we have to reinvent ourselves every day,” McAllister, who now works out of a Seattle-area office park, said during his first meeting with reporters June 2. Max 10 The first of the new planes likely to hit the market is the 737 Max 10, which would be the largest version of Boeing’s workhorse single-aisle plane. The company is in discussions with about a dozen potential buyers of the Max 10, which is aimed at curbing the A321’s appeal, said Ihssane Mounir, Boeing’s chief airplane salesman. Development Costs Development costs for Boeing will probably be less than $1 billion for the plane, with other suppliers footing more of the bill, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. The aircraft will be five feet longer than the Max 9, and feature a taller, semi-levered landing gear borrowed largely from Boeing’s 777 wide-body jetliner. Read more: United and others looking at 737 Max 10 “It’s a relatively minor development program for us to do,” McAllister said. While the Boeing plane is comparable in terms of seating, it’s expected to burn about 5 percent less fuel than the heavier Airbus rival. As McAllister learns Boeing’s culture and walks the floors of its factories, he and his team are also meeting weekly on a more ambitious project Boeing has long been studying: its first all-new jetliner family since the 787 Dreamliner a decade ago. It won’t be cheap. Development could cost $10 billion to $15 billion based on past programs, Aboulafia said. And that’s if the process goes smoothly. The Dreamliner’s engineering changes, cost overruns and supplier stumbles saddled the company with nearly $30 billion in deferred production costs following a soaring investment in development. New Markets Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The goal of the new airplane concept -- dubbed the 797 by aircraft-leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy -- is to generate new travel markets when the planes debut in the mid-2020s. The twin-aisle, oval-shaped jets would link cities that can’t be efficiently served by current aircraft models on medium-length flights, said Mike Delaney, a Boeing vice president and general manager for airplane development. Boeing sees an underserved market for planes seating between 220 and 270 passengers. They would fly about 5,000 nautical miles, connecting Chinese cities to Southeast Asia, crossing the Atlantic or joining the U.S. to destinations deeper into Latin America. “We’re going to do exactly in that market what we did with the 787,” Delaney said. “Put in an airplane that’s able to fly about 30 percent more city pairs.” The strategy aims to mirror the more than 140 new routes pioneered by the Dreamliner, without the 787’s troubled start. Boeing has studied and changed its engineering and development process after the first carbon-fiber jetliner fell years behind schedule. Boeing is using a processing capability, called the “digital twin,” to design parts and configure the production system around the new aircraft’s architecture, from automation to tooling. Following a process that has been honed with the 737 Max and 777X should lessen engineering error and disruption in the factory, Delaney said. Airbus Plan The proposed jets would also replace the Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft that dominated the market spanning the largest narrow-bodies and smallest twin-aisle planes. Airbus has been chipping away at that by adding new engines to the A321 narrow-body and smallest twin-aisle A330neo model. The U.S. planemaker was slow to respond earlier this decade when Airbus began marketing the redesigned A321neo as the heir to the out-of-production Boeing 757. The Airbus plane became a surprise bestseller, garnering more than 1,400 orders. Boeing executives were averse to “moonshots” after the 787’s costly development process and “it wasn’t clear that the A321neo was going to gather strength,” Aboulafia said. “They’ve got to hope this new plane will unlock a new point-to-point strategy.” The European planemaker is looking at expanding the A321neo, which can seat as many as 240 people, Airbus’s chief salesman John Leahy told reporters this week. “It’s not just the threat itself,” he said in reference to Boeing’s new plane. “We listen to our customers.” ‘Row 65E’ Delaney insists Boeing’s twin-aisle jet would be superior to an even longer Airbus single-aisle plane. “I certainly wouldn’t want to be in row 65E, waiting to get off,” he said. Boeing is working with 57 potential customers as it hones designs, range and potential fuel savings, McAllister said. It’s not sufficient to identify a market opportunity. The real challenge lies in developing a business case that will win the approval of Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and company directors. “We have to bring Dennis and the board a dog that hunts,” he said.

Image: Twitter Aircraft manufacturing major Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) today announced the delivery of the first crown and tail cone assembly for the Indian configuration of the CH-47F Chinook helicopter. Manufactured by TASL in Hyderabad, the parts will be delivered to Boeing for final assembly of the 15 helicopters on delivery to the Indian Air Force. “This delivery is another significant step in our journey to increase defense capability and manufacturing capacity out of India with our strategic partners,” said Pratyush Kumar, President, Boeing India. “Tata Advanced Systems has demonstrated its ability to deliver high-quality components to the CH-47 Chinook program on schedule, which in turn helps Boeing meet commitments to our customers. We are clearly invested in leveraging the full potential of capability that exists in India to continue delivering greater value for less cost to our U.S. and international customers.” Sukaran Singh, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, TASL, said, “We are proud to deliver the first crown and tail cone assembly for CH-47F Chinook helicopter. Undertaking the responsibility of complete manufacture and assembly for Boeing gives us an excellent opportunity to display our capability of development and assembly projects in high technology areas to global quality standards. Our endeavour is to significantly contribute to the Indian defense industry and demonstrate our commitment to the ‘Make in India’ initiative.” Ministry of Defence finalised an order with Boeing in 2015 for the production, training and support of 15 CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to enhance India’s capabilities across a range of military and humanitarian missions. Deliveries will begin in 2019. TASL is already delivering crown and tail cones for CH-47 Chinook helicopters for the U.S. Army and international customers. The CH-47F Chinook is the advanced multi-mission helicopter which is being operated by the U.S. Army and 18 other defense forces around the world. Boeing’s network in India includes 35 direct and 120 indirect suppliers from India that manufacture advanced and complex components and sub-assemblies for a range of various commercial and defense aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner, 777X, F/A-18, F-15, P-8, CH-47 Chinook and AH-64 Apache. Boeing supports the Make in India initiative through accelerated investments in manufacturing, skill development and engineering to build a strong and indigenous aerospace and defense ecosystem.

It might surprise you Aircraft usually reach speeds of close to 600mph in flight Hugh Morris 8 June 2017 • 10:38am It never seems that planes are going fast enough. Glance up at the sky and passing aircraft look like they're crawling across the clouds. Take-off can feel like it happens at a trundle. But in reality, aircraft have remarkably powerful engines capable of reaching impressive speeds and sustaining them for hours on end - and they do. Average cruising speed for a passenger jet is around 575mph. That is, however, a patch on the top speed ever reached by an aircraft, a record held by the Lockheed Blackbird, which tickled 2,193mph in 1976. The United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft was so fast its missile evasion technique was simply to accelerate and out-fly it. The Lockheed Blackbird, the fastest aircraft in history You won’t catch a passenger jet getting even near those speeds, but some are faster than others. How do planes measure speed? Aircraft speeds travelling at high altitude are not measured in the same way as, say, cars. Though mph figures can be produced, it is more common to use knots, air speed and its Mach number, a velocity relative to the speed of sound. For example, Mach 1 is equal to the speed of sound, 767mph. For the purpose of this article, we shall use the Mach measure. Which is the fastest passenger jet in service? Excluding military jets, there remains two types of aircraft: commercial passenger planes, such as the Boeing 747, and private passenger aircraft, or private jets. Below we've revealed the five fastest in the former group. Concorde, which is no longer in service but had an impressive cruising speed of Mach 2.02, would have easily beat them all.  It is worth noting that long-haul aircraft fly faster than short-haul jets, which are more concerned with quick and efficient ascent and descent. So which aircraft will get to to your destination quickest? At a glance | How fast do planes fly 5. Boeing 777 In fifth is the wide-body, twin-engine Boeing 777, used by the likes of British Airways and Emirates on long-haul flights, and boasting a typical cruise speed of Mach 0.84.

Morgan 3= Boeing 787 and Airbus A380 Tied in third are another Boeing, the recent 787 Dreamliner series, a long-haul, twin-engine airliner, with a cruise speed of Mach 0.85, and an aircraft from Airbus, Boeing’s rival, the A380, the largest passenger plane in the sky, with the same typical cruising speed.

Boeing 747-400 In second it’s the Boeing 747-400, popular with British Airways and the best-selling model of the 747 family. It is another wide-bodied, four-engine airliner and enjoys a typical cruising speed of 0.855, a smidge faster than its rivals. A British Airways 747-400 Credit: ullstein bild 1. Boeing 747-8i And the fastest aircraft mere mortals are likely to fly on is the Boeing 747-8i, otherwise known as the 747-8 Intercontinental, and the largest of the 747 family. It has a cruising speed of 0.86, but only currently used by three operators: Lufthansa, Korean Air and Air China. A Boeing-branded 747-8i Credit: 2011 Getty Images/Stephen Brashear What about private jets? If we were to consider private jets, the likes used by footballers and film stars, the brands involved are different to Boeing and Airbus. The aircraft to take the title is the Cessna Citation X+, introduced as the X in 1996 to overhaul the company’s reputation for sluggishness and then updated in 2010 as the X+. It boasts a top cruising speed of Mach 0.935. Does it make any difference? As you can see the speeds above vary only slightly, and are adjusted according to load, fuel efficiency and conditions. It is not as simple as ‘let’s fly from A to B as fast as we can’. Pilot and author Patrick Smith writes in his book Cockpit Confidential: “Optimum speed is different for every flight. If the plane is on time… we’ll fly at whatever Mach is most fuel-efficient. If we’re running late, and so long as fuel isn’t an issue, we’ll probably go a little faster.” He explains how on a long-haul flight of 13 hours, say between New York and Tokyo, a slightly faster speed can save several minutes. Which planes do airlines use the most today? What about top speeds? Wind conditions, of course, can make planes fly far quicker than the average cruising speed, and the jet stream means flight times on transatlantic routes are much shorter going east. In 2015, a Boeing 777 flown by BA reported speeds of up to 745mph, or Mach 0.97, just shy of the speed of sound, thanks to a surging jet stream. It meant a New York-London a flight time of just five hours and 16 minutes and an arrival 90 minutes ahead of schedule.  The 18 most important aircraft of all time Why aren't planes getting quicker? Smith also says that airlines and aircraft manufacturers are not constantly striving for faster speeds, because as they near Mach 1, the sound barrier, fuel use soars – and operating costs with it. “If anything, the 21st century airlines travel slightly slower than its counterpart of 30 years ago,” he says.

The plane is seen here landing at Boeing Field in Seattle. (Craig Larsen / Boeing Co.) Aerospace blog Boeing could commit to new airplane at Paris Air Show Dan Catchpole Thu Jun 8th, 2017 1:30am Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — The Boeing Co. could make headlines later this month at the Paris Air Show, where it could officially unveil its 737 MAX 10. The airplane maker already has an initial design for what would be the biggest version of its best-selling single-aisle jetliner, and is talking with airlines and other potential buyers. “We’ve put offers on the table” to customers, said Kevin McAllister during a June 2 press briefing with a handful of reporters. It was his first interview since leaving GE Aviation in November to take the helm of Boeing’s commercial airplane division. The MAX 10 would seat about 188 passengers in a standard layout with first-class and coach seating. The plane is a straightforward stretch of Boeing’s 737 MAX 9, which holds 178 passengers in the same layout. The MAX 10 is Boeing’s response to Airbus’ A321neo, which has dominated the market for the biggest single-aisle jetliners. The A321neo has room for 188 passengers as well. Since Boeing launched its 737 MAX update in 2011, airlines have shown moderate interest in the MAX 9. Instead, they’ve favored the larger A321neo. The 737 MAX 9 had its maiden flight in April. Boeing plans to show it off along with its other new jet, the 787-10, at the Paris show, which begins June 18. The show is the biggest of its kind, drawing tens of thousands of industry insiders from around the globe to France every other year. Given its marquis status within aerospace, companies often use it as a backdrop for big announcements. Reuters reported Monday that Boeing plans to officially unveil the MAX 10 at Paris with Indonesian low-cost carrier Lion Air as the launch customer. The company has not confirmed the report. Jet Airways, an India-based airline, is in talks to buy 50 737 MAX 10s, a deal worth at least $5.6 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Boeing assembles the 737 airplane in Renton. However, the single-aisle plane is critical to the company’s success in the next few years. Boeing plans on cranking up 737 output from 42 a month now to 57 a month by 2019. Boeing leaders are counting on the production increase to bring in more cash to make up for revenue declines on its 777 program. The company is winding down 777 production as it gets closer to rolling out a successor, the 777X, which is assembled in Everett. For now, McAllister said he is focused on smoothly increasing aircraft production and finishing current development programs: the MAX family, the 787-10 and the 777X. “We’ve got to deliver on both” production and development, he said. Airplane orders have softened in recent years, but McAllister said he is not concerned. “I think we’re seeing a pretty good market,” he said. While airlines and aircraft lessors are buying fewer jetliners in some parts of the world, Asia and Europe continue to set a steady pace for new orders, he said. Boeing continues closing in on an all-new airplane that would be bigger than a 737 and more compact than the 787, the company’s smallest twin-aisle airplane. So far, Boeing has talked in-depth with 57 customers about what they need in such an airplane, McAllister said. Boeing executives have indicated the all-new airplane would likely be called the 797. The key questions are: “Can we do this airplane? And can we do it economically?” McAllister said. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said Boeing would leapfrog reported plans by Airbus to update its hot-selling A321neo, as Boeing eyes a gap between narrow-body jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new mid-market airplane. "We have looked at the mild and we have looked at the wild and I can tell you we know that if you are going to address that market, you need a new airplane," Tinseth told Reuters after a two-day meeting of airline leaders in Mexico. Industry sources have said the mid-market development is pivotal for Boeing since it will spawn the industrial jigsaw, systems and cockpits likely to be used for the next plane after that, a three-aircraft replacement of Boeing's 737 cash cow. Getting the "production system" right now would partially allow Boeing to develop the next jet, which is expected to revolve around a model carrying 180 passengers, as an industrial spin-off of the mid-market one, albeit with major differences. This would result in significant cost savings and avoid repeating a patchwork of different production architectures. Two further derivatives could extend that post-737 jet family to 160-210 seats, based on current market forecasts. Boeing has not yet talked about its plans beyond the mid-market plane, which is expected to enter service by 2025. Boeing officials declined comment on the long-term options or specific details of the mid-market project, which one leasing company has dubbed "797". GOODBYE STEAM ENGINE For the mid-market jet, industry sources have said Boeing is settling on a family of two wide-body aircraft. These would effectively combine a twin-aisle cabin sitting on top of the reduced belly space of a single-aisle jet. The aim is to reduce wind resistance or drag and therefore operating costs. However, it involves a risky gamble that airlines will not need to carry much paid cargo on the routes for which the airplane is designed, delegates at the airlines meeting in Cancun said. The two mid-market models, designed to carry about 220-260 passengers over 3,500 to 5,000 nautical miles (6,400-9,260 km), will also have a wing resembling the distinctive stiletto design of the 787 Dreamliner but with significant internal differences. Seen from the front, the outline of traditional metal airplane fuselages is usually closer to a true circle. That allows pressurised air inside the cabin to push out uniformly in all directions, easing loads and removing the need for heavy strengthening materials. That well-tested concept is as old as the steam engine. Carbon composites allow manufacturers to make complex pieces in one shape and are well suited to the more elliptical design that Boeing has in mind for the new mid-market fuselage. However, composites are more expensive to produce. Reuters reported last month that the new aircraft could be built using cheaper and faster new production techniques without costly pressurised ovens, or autoclaves. That technology was used to weave the carbon wings of Russia's new MS-21 jet, which first flew last month. Airbus this week played down a project called A321neo-plus-plus in response to the Boeing mid-market jet, first reported by Reuters, and said it was always reviewing options.

The roster of potential buyers of the largest-ever 737, which is expected to launch this month, spans the globe. Initial sales prospects include Indonesia’s Lion Mentari Airlines PT, the aircraft-leasing arm of China’s development bank, Jet Airways India Ltd and Copa Holdings SA, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorised to speak publicly about the negotiations. The US manufacturer is seeking a groundswell of orders to demonstrate the Max 10’s market appeal and strike back at the A321neo, Airbus’s largest narrow-body jet, which is capturing trans-continental routes once dominated by Boeing’s out-of-production 757. The Max 10 talks aren’t final and Airbus could still try to thwart the sales ahead of the Paris Air Show later this month. A spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing declined to comment on the talks. Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, declined to comment on a potential order, as did CDB Aviation Lease Finance, the Chinese aircraft lessor. Lion, Jet Airways and Panama City-based Copa didn’t immediately comment. ‘Flailing about’ The newest 737 Max would seat about 220 passengers in a single-cabin layout popular with budget carriers while burning about 5 percent less fuel than its similarly sized Airbus rival, according to the US company. The Boeing jet isn’t slated to enter the commercial market until 2020. Airbus delivered the first A321neo earlier this year and has garnered 1,416 total orders, according to the company’s website. Airbus sales chief John Leahy dismissed the competitive threat in comments to reporters this week, saying the U.S. planemaker was responding to the A321neo only because the Airbus plane outsold the Max 9 by a four-to-one ratio. The Max 10’s frame would be five feet longer than that of the Max 9. Boeing doesn’t break out its Max sales by variant. Boeing is “flailing about, trying to come up with some answer to it that doesn’t cost them a fortune,” Leahy said. “Usually those things in aviation don’t work successfully.” United fleet United Continental Holdings Inc is studying whether to convert 61 orders for the 737 Max to the -10 version, while taking a handful of Boeing 777-300ERs, the largest twin-engine jetliner currently flying, some of the people said. The carrier gained the production slots last year after it converted an earlier order for the Boeing 737-700 to the Max. The Chicago-based airline is also considering an A321neo order, the people said. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz said United, the third-largest US carrier, was “interested” in the Max 10, during a brief interview on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association meeting in Cancun, Mexico, this week. Jet Airways, India’s biggest full-service airline, is preparing to order 50 single-aisle jets, Bloomberg reported June 5. The airline, which operates an all-Boeing narrow-body fleet, is evaluating the Max 10, the high-density Max 200 as well as the Airbus A321neo. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asia's richest man sees net worth soar US$2.8b in a day Hung parliament, Labour risks daunt traders day of UK vote Ringgit opens marginally lower to US dollar Singapore's rebound masks consumer pain as job losses mount Confusion rules Mideast waves as shippers seek Qatar-ban clarity Ringgit slightly higher against US dollar in early trade Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Bursa to be firmer next week Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Lion Air may help launch Boeing 737 MAX 10, sources say Boeing 737 Max back in flight as first plane delivery looms Boeing must get 737 MAX engine approval to fly again Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue Boeing profit jumps 19pc, full-year target lifted Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services
International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Innovation Self-flying plane: Boeing to test pilotless jetliners in 2018 The company is working on AI that can make the same decisions pilots make during a flight. By Agamoni Ghosh Updated June 9, 2017 07:27 BST Boeing plans to go pilotless for some of its jetliners Boeing Move over self-driving cars as self-flying planes could soon be a reality. Aerospace giant Boeing has announced that it will test some of its jetliners next year without pilots leading to flying its passenger aircraft autonomously some day. While self-driving technology for cars is relatively new, autopilot on aeroplanes have existed for over a decade. However, autopilot mode is mostly used when the aircraft is in the skies that too monitored by the pilots. The crucial task of take-off and landing are still a pilot's core responsibility even though some onboard flight computers do posses the technology to take off and land on its own. "The basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available... but I have no idea how we're going to do that. We're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms," Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development told Reuters days before the Paris Airshow. Sinnett, who is a pilot himself, says the company is working on artificial intelligence (AI) that can make the same decisions pilots make during a flight. It is likely that the maiden test routes will be devoid of congested areas and challenging landscapes like high mountains or large stretches of water. The biggest challenge will be to maintain altitude in accordance to air traffic parameters and conduct a safe and smooth landing. "A self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the 'Miracle on the Hudson.' If it can't, then we can't go there," says Sinnett. BAE Systems, the British defence company, has been testing robotic planes since last year and has successfully logged trials with its autonomous technology that has taken over the controls 15,000ft high in the sky.

Officials at the aerospace company say the basic building blocks for the technology already exist -- jetliners can take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers. The summer, Boeing plans to use a simulator to test artificial intelligence to make decisions that human pilots would normally make. Airlines are backing the idea due to what they describe as a shrinking pool of future airline pilots.

News 82nd Airborne turns 100: Here are 4 major innovations over the past 100 years by admin — June 9, 2017 This is the centennial year of the US Army 82nd Airborne Division. At Major General Michael Kurilla’s remarks at the 100th Anniversary Memorial Service on May 24, he touched on the group’s history, noting: “A group of Americans from all over the country [formed] to fight as a cohesive unit. This had never been done before. They represented the values of All Americans.” Back then, the 82nd Airborne had a limited number of troops and planes. Today, their firepower has increased considerably. That might was on display at the annual Airborne Review on June 1, with 4,500 paratroopers of the 82nd’s 18,000 strong taking part. From aircraft to artillery, here are four of the most impressive recent innovations. C-17 aircraft The Boeing C-17 aircraft, “Globemaster” can carry more than 100 paratroopers in the cargo hold and then unleash them as they parachute into a battlespace. The aircraft can also carry Army vehicles – even the M1 battle tank. This 174 foot long aircraft also provides the advantage of remarkably short takeoffs and landings. Rather than require modern paved landing strips, the C-17 can take off from a 7,000-foot strip and land in less than 3,000 feet – a big advantage for war zones. M777 Howitzer long-range artillery The M777 Howitzer long-range artillery is a 155mm 39 caliber used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The M77 can accurately strike over great distances. It works with standard ammo types, but it can also take advantage ultra advanced rounds like the EXCALIBUR. With a maximum range of more than 30 km, it can fire 5 rounds per minute for up to 2 minutes and then 2 rounds per minute in sustained rate of fire. Able to be transported by air, this weapon can be rapidly deployed to where it is needed. With low radar and thermal signatures and low silhouette, it is designed to be very difficult for an enemy to detect. CH-47 Chinook The Boeing CH-47 Chinook has those iconic rotor blades at each end of the aircraft. The Army uses Chinooks for assault, transporting troops, artillery and equipment as well as medical evacuation. It can reach maximum speeds of approximately 190 miles per hour. Boeing continues to enhance the Chinook. There have been recent advancements in the airframe, cargo handling, and a digital cockpit. Another innovation is the flight control system that would allow pilots to hover the aircraft in place in spite of brown outs and other low visibility conditions. AH-64 Apaches (1st Combat Camera Squadron, Photo by Tech. Sgt. Barry Loo) The Boeing AH-64 Apaches can be used for missions like assault and close air support. They’re fast, travelling at speeds more than 175 miles per hour. These helicopters bring serious firepower to the fight like 70mm rockets and laser-guided precision Hellfire missiles. An enemy force could also face weaponry like the 30mm automatic cannon with its 1,200 high explosive, ammunition rounds. To locate, track, and attack targets Apache can be equipped with systems like laser and infrared. The latest Apaches are amped up with further advantages like enhanced weaponry and the ability to detect objects without being detected. There are even ultra advanced systems to classify and threat-prioritize 128 targets in less than a minute.

UNMANNED Boeing-Huntington Ingalls team to chase Navy undersea drone program By Ross Wilkers Jun 08, 2017 Boeing and the largest U.S. military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries have teamed up to design and build underwater drones as they plan to pursue an upcoming Navy contract for unmanned undersea vehicles. The Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle program also known as "Orca" seeks a reconfigurable UUV with a modular, open architecture. A contract award is scheduled for September with a value to-be-determined, according to Deltek. Orca should have a modular payload bay or bays of at least 60 inches in height and 125 inches in length, along with total volume of a minimum 325 feet, according to solicitation documents. The XLUUV should also be able to travel to a location, loiter and periodically establish communications, deploy payloads and then return to its home base. This partnership encompasses Boeing's design and production facility in Huntington Beach, Calif. with HII's Newport News, Va. ship construction hub and Panama City, Fla.-based Undersea Solutions Group subsidiary. In recent months, Boeing has tested its Echo Voyager underwater drone off the Southern California coast. Echo Voyager is built with a modular payload bay of up to 34 feet and designed as fully autonomous without needing a support vessel for launch or recovery. Boeing is one of three major defense contractors that have acquired undersea drone manufacturers within the past year as airplane maker purchased California-based Liquid Robotics in December 2016. Other UUV-related acquisitions have included General Dynamics' deal for Bluefin Robotics in February 2016 and L3 Technologies' buy of OceanServer in April of this year. USG is one of several subsidiaries within HII's $1 billion government services segment the company launched late last year upon its purchase of Camber Corp.  About the Author Ross Wilkers is a senior staff writer for Washington Technology.

The Army uses Chinooks for assault, transporting troops, artillery and equipment as well as medical evacuation. It can reach maximum speeds of approximately 190 miles per hour. Boeing continues to enhance the Chinook. There have been recent advancements in the airframe, cargo handling, and a digital cockpit. Another innovation is the flight control system that would allow pilots to hover the aircraft in place in spite of brown outs and other low visibility conditions. AH-64 Apaches Related Image Expand / Collapse  (1st Combat Camera Squadron, Photo by Tech. Sgt. Barry Loo) The Boeing AH-64 Apaches can be used for missions like assault and close air support. They’re fast, travelling at speeds more than 175 miles per hour. These helicopters bring serious firepower to the fight like 70mm rockets and laser-guided precision Hellfire missiles. An enemy force could also face weaponry like the 30mm automatic cannon with its 1,200 high explosive, ammunition rounds. To locate, track, and attack targets Apache can be equipped with systems like laser and infrared. The latest Apaches are amped up with further advantages like enhanced weaponry and the ability to detect objects without being detected. There are even ultra advanced systems to classify and threat-prioritize 128 targets in less than a minute.

Artist’s concept shows a futuristic Boeing airplane in flight. (Boeing illustration) EVERETT, Wash. – The Boeing Co. says it’s on a path that could ultimately lead to self-flying commercial passenger airplanes, starting with simulations and ground-based experiments this year and progressing to flight tests by 2019. “In commercial air transportation, we are not yet in this business,” said Mike Sinnett, vice president of product development at Boeing Commercial Airplanes However, he said aviation industry trends are pushing the company to look into autonomous options. Boeing’s market outlook projects that nearly 40,000 airplanes will need to be purchased over the next 20 years to meet the demand for air travel. “More of those will be growth than replacement,” Sinnett told reporters last week during a briefing at Boeing’s Everett plant. “It begs the question, where are all those experienced pilots going to come from?” Mike Sinnett (Boeing Photo) In the past, airlines could turn to pilots with military experience, but Sinnett said that’s “not as true today as it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago, and it will become increasingly less true as time goes on.” It’s not clear whether pilot training schools can fill the gap, he added. Trends in air travel also point to a shift toward smaller airplanes and air taxi services, which will add to the demand for pilots. “There’s going to be a transition away from the requirement to have a skilled aviator operating the airplane tactically, to having a system that operates the vehicle autonomously – if we can do that at the same levels of safety, integrity and availability that we have today,” Sinnett said. “And that is a huge ‘if.’ That’s not a small ‘if.’ That’s a really big ‘if.'” Boeing has long experience with autonomous systems – ranging from underwater robots and robotic surfboards to the military-grade drones built by its Insitu subsidiary. There’s even a robotic co-pilot system called ALIAS that made a simulated Boeing 737 landing all by itself. Pilots already make use of autopilot systems and fly-by-wire controls for level flight and landings, and Sinnett acknowledged that the software could handle auto-takeoffs as well. “The airplane is capable of doing it, but not capable of doing it at the same level of integrity as with a pilot in the loop,” he said. There’s the rub: Most experts acknowledge that autonomous driving systems should reduce the nation’s traffic death toll of 40,000 annually. But when it comes to regularly scheduled commercial airline flights, no one has died in a jet crash in the U.S. since 2009. That’s one reason why the bar is set higher for planes than for cars, Sinnett said. “They’ve got to be better than 40,000,” he said. “We’ve got to be as good as zero.” Sinnett said Boeing’s studies would look into how close computer vision, machine learning and other artificial intelligence tools can come to the decision-making processes that pilots use. The classic example is the “Miracle on the Hudson,” the 2009 incident in which Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger successfully ditched an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after a wayward flock of geese took out both engines. On one hand, Sully’s unconventional landing choice saved the crew and passengers. On the other hand, computer simulations showed that he could have just barely brought the plane safely back to New York’s LaGuardia Airport – if only he were able to weigh all the options as quickly as a computer could. Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator test program will help push the envelope on autonomous control technologies. In 2019, the research plan calls for using a modified 787 to expand the use of fly-by-wire to control airplanes. “You could imagine auto-takeoff, auto-taxi, things like that nature on a 787 – not, obviously, in a certified environment, but with an experimental ticket,” Sinnett said. More from the Boeing tour: How robots and humans will join forces for 777X Between now and then, Boeing will be conducting other tests, on the ground and with smaller experimental aircraft, aimed at developing what Sinnett calls an “enterprise autonomy architecture.” He said reporters shouldn’t be surprised if they see “a van driving around a field in Moses Lake with a big boom on it that looks like it’s collecting information, and it’s got a Boeing logo on the side of it.” If Boeing makes enough progress, the company could work with the Federal Aviation Administration and other stakeholders on ways to validate machine systems for flight. “I’ve had discussions with regulators around the world, and in general, a very interesting discussion goes like this: ‘We don’t know how to certify non-deterministic systems. For the same set of inputs, we always get the same set of outputs,'” Sinnett said. “And I’ll say, ‘That’s not true. You certify non-deterministic systems all the time. They’re called pilots … Same set of inputs, different outputs.'” But Sinnett emphasized that autonomous flight systems would have to have as much integrity and reliability as human pilots. “The machine has to be capable of making the same set of decisions, and if it can’t, we can’t go there,” he said.

The study may also show that it’s absolutely essential to keep humans in charge when humans are in the air. And that would be just fine with Sinnett. “I would be perfectly happy if what came out of this whole study is that we need more pilots, and we’re going to commit to training and ensuring that we have the right levels of experience and competence,” he said. “This isn’t a quest to go take pilots out of the cockpit. This is a quest to ensure that the system maintains the same level of safety that we have today.” GeekWire aerospace and science editor Alan Boyle is an award-winning science writer and veteran space reporter.

The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,” said Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three. Simulator test Mr. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and “fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make,” he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They also need to convince regulators who don’t yet know how to certify such planes. “I have no idea how we’re going to do that,” Mr. Sinnett said. “But we’re studying it right now and we’re developing those algorithms.” Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the “Miracle on the Hudson,” Mr. Sinnett said. “If it can’t, then we can’t go there.” A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Mr. Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said.

By: Reuters | Bengaluru | Updated: June 8, 2017 8:59 PM Once Boeing gets the remaining design approvals from the FAA, it expects testing to proceed at a faster pace. (Reuters) The U.S. Air Force said there would be a further delay in taking delivery of Boeing Co’s KC-46 aerial refueling aircraft, as the planemaker tries to get airworthiness certifications and complete a flight test program. The U.S. Air Force assessment predicts first aircraft delivery beyond Boeing’s forecast into late spring of 2018, according to a statement by the U.S. Air Force. Boeing had previously forecast the aircraft to be delivered by September this year and now expects first aircraft delivery by December 2017. The top issues slowing progress are achieving the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness certifications and completing the flight test program, the U.S. Air Force said. Once Boeing gets the remaining design approvals from the FAA, it expects testing to proceed at a faster pace, according to the statement. The aircraft delivery delay is not expected to result in additional costs to the taxpayer, the U.S. Air Force said. No Comments.

Although mass production of the C919 is still at least two years away, Chinese authorities are seeking agreements on airworthiness with U.S. and European regulators to open the way for flights outside China. Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images Advertisement Last month’s maiden test flight by China’s homegrown C919 passenger jet has one U.K. plastics maker reaching for the skies. Victrex Plc supplied the polyetheretherketon, a thermoplastic used in fuel brackets on the aircraft wings that can save as much as 40% on weight. Just as Airbus SE has replaced an aluminum fitting on its A350 doors with the material -- also known as PEEK -- Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. could present a similar “raft of opportunities” for the U.K. company, Chief Executive Officer Dave Hummels said in an interview in London. Although mass production is still at least two years away, Chinese authorities are seeking agreements on airworthiness with U.S. and European regulators to open the way for flights outside China. Comac had orders and commitments from 23 mostly Chinese buyers for 570 airplanes as of late 2016, with China Eastern Airlines Corp. due to take first delivery as soon as 2019. “Just because you can fly a plane, doesn’t mean you can fly a passenger jet with 200 people on board, but I would never discount what Comac can do,” the CEO said. “It’s like when you initially had the Koreans and Americans saying that only they can do smart phones and not the Chinese. Well, the next thing you know the Chinese manufacturers are there.” Popular Now The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter 5 Ways to Develop a More Efficient Factory Honda Plays Catch-Up With Electric Car, Autonomous Driving Goals Victrex is hoping the inaugural flight of C919 over Shanghai on May 5 will prove a double winner, giving it an edge over competitors Solvay SA of Belgium and Germany’s Evonik Industries AG encroaching on its other PEEK markets, including smart phones and medical implants. The jet could also spur the incumbent duopoly of Airbus and Boeing Co. to embrace lightweight plastics and composites more, speeding up manufacturing in the process, Hummels said. PEEK content on the Comac is currently lower than on planes by established peers, including Airbus’ A320neo. The Chinese had to limit the amount of new innovation on board the C919 to get a prototype off the ground so it could move on to issues of reliability and production, according to Hummels. By hiring Airbus and Boeing engineers and tapping supply chains in place for decades, the Chinese avoided having to start from “ground zero,” Hummels said. Engineers in Russia are also developing a single-aisle passenger jet that relies heavily on composites. Lightweight Parts While Comac plays catch up, Airbus and Boeing are taking a deeper look at their production lines to work out how manufacturing times and order backlogs can be shrunk and weight saved, Hummel said. “Comac is looking to get a high-end plane flying, while Boeing and Airbus are looking ahead to what’s next as they already do that -- their biggest concern is that they can’t get enough planes out of the door,” Hummel said. “The tough thing for Comac is to stay up where technology is. At some point, you almost have to say let’s stop innovating and just assemble.” Chinese companies are also working out how to manufacture PEEK, a notoriously difficult polymer to make, according to Bernstein analysts Gunther Zechmann and Jeremy Redenius. To assess the competitive threat, the analysts purchased a few kilograms of PEEK on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s retail platform and carried out nuclear magnetic resonance, spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry tests. They found Chinese PEEK to be “good, but not perfect,” the analysts said in a note. “Entrance barriers due to quality, security of supply, service and customer qualification remain high,” Zechmann and Redenius said. “Technically, however, Asian players are catching up rapidly. Commercially, they are beginning to gain a foothold in the market.” Victrex, based near Blackpool, England, supplies the materials used to build the wing tips on planes. It’s also moved into manufacturing whole polymer-based parts through a joint venture with Tri-Mack Plastics Manufacturing Corp. It’s seeking more partnerships and acquisitions to add additional expertise in fibers and composites, Hummel said. “When we go to the likes of Boeing with these products they say, ‘Great, where can we get the parts made?’ and that’s why we did the Tri-Mack joint venture,” the CEO said. “There are a lot of different things we’re looking into.” by Andrew Noël Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

UNMANNED Boeing, Textron units win potential $475M Special Operations unmanned ISR contracts By Ross Wilkers Jun 08, 2017 Boeing's Insitu and Textron's AAI Corp. subsidiaries have won a pair of potential six-year, $475 million contracts for unmanned systems and related intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services to Special Operations Command. The Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems III contract covers a 54-month base period, followed by four 12-month ordering periods and then an added six-month ordering period. MEUAS III calls on awardees to provide UAS for launch, control and recovery missions to perform ISR functions and inject full-motion video into host systems, according to Deltek. Work under MEUAS III also includes site surveys to assess the adequacy of infrastructure to support ISR operations. Insitu and AAI will compete for task orders to carry out the ISR services at multiple locations worldwide through June 2022. AAI is also one of three companies participating in a five-year, $900 million contract awarded in April for technical services and field support to the Army for unmanned systems.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Boeing studies planes without pilots as it ponders next jetliner June 8, 2017 - 17:29 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow, Reuters reports. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and "fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make", he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes. "I have no idea how we're going to do that," Sinnett said. "But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the "Miracle on the Hudson," Sinnett said. "If it can't, then we can't go there." A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing.

Decisions approved earlier by the airline's board regarding aircraft acquisitions are currently "on hold" and tenders for procurement of new planes have been deferred till clarity emerges, an airline source said. In March, the Air India Board of Directors had approved a proposal to induct seven Boeing 787-9 aircraft in its fleet to improve connectivity to Canada, the US and Australia. The airline was planning to float tenders for procuring these aircraft on lease this month. The decision has now been deferred. "The decision (of floating tenders) is on hold until there is clarity on the airline's future," said a top Air India official when asked about the plan to acquire these planes. Similarly, the plan to procure ten ATR aircraft by Alliance Air, which has been awarded several routes under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN, have been put on the backburner, the official said. Alliance Air, the regional arm of the national carrier, currently has ten ATRs in its fleet and had recently placed orders for leasing of 10 more such smaller-sized aircraft by the end of this fiscal. As part of its fleet expansion plans, Alliance Air has plans to take its ATR fleet strength to 30 by FY 2018. On the other hand, Air India is also leasing 22 Airbus A320 Neos, of which 4 have already joined the fleet. According to the source, the airline had planned to issue bids for seven more such planes but now there is uncertainty over these tenders as well. However, there is no change in plan, as of now, to take the deliveries of the remaining four of the total 27 Dreamliners (Boeing 787-800s) that the airline had ordered in 2006, which are to be inducted in the fleet between July and October this year, the source said. The state-owned carrier has a total of 103 planes of which 42 are wide-bodied Boeing 777s, 747s, and 787s. 61 are narrow bodied Airbus 319s, 320s and 321s. Its low-cost subsidiary, Air India Express, has 23 Boeing 737s. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley too has proposed privatisation of Air India and the civil aviation ministry is looking at all options to make the airline strong and viable. A cabinet note in this regard is likely to be prepared shortly, according to Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha. Air India has piled up over Rs 50,000 crore of debt mainly because of high maintenance costs and lease rent. It barely made any operational profit in last decade, except in FY16.

(Comac) C919 aircraft as it taxis after landing at the Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, China, on Friday, May 5, 2017. China's first modern passenger jet completed its maiden test flight, giving wings to President Xi Jinping's ambition of turning China into an advanced economy. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Last month’s maiden test flight by China’s homegrown C919 passenger jet has one U.K. plastics maker reaching for the skies. Victrex Plc supplied the polyetheretherketon, a thermoplastic used in fuel brackets on the aircraft wings that can save as much as 40 percent on weight. Just as  Airbus SE has replaced an aluminum fitting on its A350 doors with the material -- also known as PEEK -- Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. could present a similar “raft of opportunities” for the U.K. company, Chief Executive Officer Dave Hummels said in an interview in London. Although mass production is still at least two years away, Chinese authorities are seeking agreements on airworthiness with U.S. and European regulators to open the way for flights outside China. Comac had orders and commitments from 23 mostly Chinese buyers for 570 airplanes as of late 2016, with China Eastern Airlines Corp. due to take first delivery as soon as 2019. “Just because you can fly a plane, doesn’t mean you can fly a passenger jet with 200 people on board, but I would never discount what Comac can do,” the CEO said. “It’s like when you initially had the Koreans and Americans saying that only they can do smart phones and not the Chinese. Well, the next thing you know the Chinese manufacturers are there.” Read more on China’s jet challenge by clicking here Victrex is hoping the inaugural flight of C919 over Shanghai on May 5 will prove a double winner, giving it an edge over competitors Solvay SA of Belgium and Germany’s Evonik Industries AG encroaching on its other PEEK markets, including smart phones and medical implants. The jet could also spur the incumbent duopoly of Airbus and Boeing Co. to embrace lightweight plastics and composites more, speeding up manufacturing in the process, Hummels said. PEEK content on the Comac is currently lower than on planes by established peers, including Airbus’ A320neo. The Chinese had to limit the amount of new innovation on board the C919 to get a prototype off the ground so it could move on to issues of reliability and production, according to Hummels. By hiring Airbus and Boeing engineers and tapping supply chains in place for decades, the Chinese avoided having to start from “ground zero,” Hummels said. Engineers in Russia are also developing a single-aisle passenger jet that relies heavily on composites. Lightweight Parts While Comac plays catch up, Airbus and Boeing are taking a deeper look at their production lines to work out how manufacturing times and order backlogs can be shrunk and weight saved, Hummel said. “Comac is looking to get a high-end plane flying, while Boeing and Airbus are looking ahead to what’s next as they already do that -- their biggest concern is that they can’t get enough planes out of the door,” Hummel said. “The tough thing for Comac is to stay up where technology is. At some point, you almost have to say let’s stop innovating and just assemble.” Chinese companies are also working out how to manufacture PEEK, a notoriously difficult polymer to make, according to Bernstein analysts Gunther Zechmann and Jeremy Redenius. To assess the competitive threat, the analysts purchased a few kilograms of PEEK on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s retail platform and carried out nuclear magnetic resonance, spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry tests. They found Chinese PEEK to be “good, but not perfect,” the analysts said in a note. “Entrance barriers due to quality, security of supply, service and customer qualification remain high,” Zechmann and Redenius said. “Technically, however, Asian players are catching up rapidly. Commercially, they are beginning to gain a foothold in the market.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Victrex, based near Blackpool, England, supplies the materials for brackets and fasteners used on planes to replace heavier titanium alternatives, as well as so-called burn barrier films used to reduce smoke in the event of a fire. It’s also moved into manufacturing whole polymer-based parts that can bear loads through a joint venture with Tri-Mack Plastics Manufacturing Corp. It’s seeking more partnerships and acquisitions to add additional expertise in fibers and composites, Hummel said. “When we go to the likes of Boeing with these products they say, ‘Great, where can we get the parts made?’ and that’s why we did the Tri-Mack joint venture,” the CEO said. “There are a lot of different things we’re looking into.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Alwyn Scott Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Photo: Reuters Seattle: Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world’s biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Air Show. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,” said Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice-president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their on-board flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and “fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make”, he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don’t yet know how to certify such planes. “I have no idea how we’re going to do that,” Sinnett said. “But we’re studying it right now and we’re developing those algorithms.” Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the “Miracle on the Hudson,” Sinnett said. “If it can’t, then we can’t go there.” A US Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. “This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors’” he said, referring to rival Airbus. “It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?” Reuters Alwyn Scott Topics: Boeing pilotless planes self-flying aircraft Paris Air Show Chesley Sullenberger More From Livemint READ MORE 10 places a music-lover must visit Bollywood’s ‘Raabta’, ‘Behen Hogi Teri’ compete with ‘The Mummy’ this week Global gold prices slip, early UK poll results point to hung parliament First Published: Thu, Jun 08 2017. 05 17 PM IST Editor's Picks Ajay Tyagi, and the job of a Sebi overhaul Indian Oil, HP, BP lose market share to Reliance, Essar, Shell IIT Delhi among three Indian institutes on global top 200 list Latest News 10 places a music-lover must visit Bollywood’s ‘Raabta’, ‘Behen Hogi Teri’ compete with ‘The Mummy’ this week Global gold prices slip, early UK poll results point to hung parliament Sumitro Ghosh: A winning brew closer home Review: Why Honor 8 Lite is a good buy Mint On Sunday The best food of Delhi’s state bhawans When parents step in to run schools The defenders of the skies of Roland Garros Beneath the beauty, Mauritius is an archive of human struggle and triumph The elusiveness of silence Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed Martin All Want to Upgrade America's Nuclear Missiles Kris Osborn June 8, 2017 TweetShareShare Nevertheless, despite clear evidence in favor of deploying nuclear weapons, modernizing the US arsenal has long been a cost concern and strategic liability for US strategic planners. In fact, Weinstein said there is concern that both Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals are now more modern and advanced than existing U.S. Minuteman IIIs.  Citing a Congressional Research Service report, a story in National Defense Magazine says the GBSD the program is expected to cost $62 billion from 2015 through fiscal year 2044.  That breaks down to about $14 billion for upgrades to command-and-control systems and launch centers, and $48.5 billion for new missiles, the report says.  Air Force officials say the service will award some contracts as part of its ongoing evaluation of formal proposals from three vendors competing to build hundreds of new, next-generation Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles designed to protect the US homeland well into the 2070s and beyond, service officials said.  Submissions from Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed are now being reviewed by Air Force weapons developers looking to modernize the US land-based nuclear missile arsenal and replace the 1970s-era Boeing-built Minuteman IIIs. Service officials told Scout Warrior a contract award is expected later this year. The new effort to build ICBMs, what the Air Force calls “Ground Based Strategic Deterrence,” aims to construct durable, high-tech nuclear-armed missiles able to serve until 2075. The new weapons will be engineered with improved guidance technology, boosters, flight systems and command and control systems, compared to the existing Minuteman III missiles. The weapon will also have upgraded circuitry and be built with a mind to long-term maintenance and sustainability. “Solid rocket fuel ages out after a period of time. You need to have an upgraded guidance package for sustainability and warfighting requirements. Looking at the current technology, it has moved faster than when these were first developed. Civilian industry has leapfrogged so we want the ability to use components that have already been developed,” , Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein, Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, said in an interview with Scout Warrior several months ago. Do Nuclear Weapons Save Lives? Philosophical Context If one were to passively reflect upon the seemingly limitless explosive power to instantly destroy, vaporize or incinerate cities, countries and massive swaths of territory or people -- images of quiet, flowing green meadows, peaceful celebratory gatherings or melodious sounds of chirping birds might not immediately come to mind. After all, lethal destructive weaponry does not, by any means, appear to be synonymous with peace, tranquility and collective happiness. However, it is precisely the prospect of massive violence which engenders the possibility of peace.  Nuclear weapons therefore, in some unambiguous sense, can be interpreted as being the antithesis of themselves; simply put – potential for mass violence creates peace – thus the conceptual thrust of nuclear deterrence. It is within this conceptual framework, designed to save millions of lives, prevent major great-power war and ensure the safety of entire populations, that the U.S. Air Force is now vigorously pursuing a new arsenal of land-fired, Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs  Weinstein cited famous nuclear strategist Bernard Brodie as a way to articulate the seismic shift in thinking and tactics made manifest by the emergence of nuclear weapons. Considered to be among the key architects of strategic nuclear deterrence, and referred to by many as an “American Clausewitz,” Brodie expressed how the advent of the nuclear era changes the paradigm regarding the broadly configured role or purpose of weaponry in war. Weinstein referred to Brodie’s famous quote from his 1940s work “The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order.” --- "Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on, its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose.” The success of this strategy hinges upon the near certainty of total annihilation, should nuclear weapons be used. ICBMs are engineered to fly through space on a total flight of about 30 mins before detonating with enormous destructive power upon targets. “If another nation believes they can have an advantage by using a nuclear weapon, that is really dangerous. What you want to do is have such a strong deterrent force that any desire to attack with nuclear weapons will easily be outweighed by the response they get from the other side. That's the value of what the deterrent force provides,” Weinstein said in an exclusive interview with Scout Warrior. Althought Weinstein did not take a position on the pior administration's considerations about having the U.S. adopt a No First Use, or NFU, nuclear weapons policy, Air Force Secretary Deborah James has expressed concern about the possiblity, in a news report published by Defense News. Limiting the U.S. scope of deterrence, many argue, might wrongly encourage potential adversaries to think they could succeed with a limited first nuclear strike of some kind.  Ground-Based Strategic Deterrence  It is within the context of these ideas, informing military decision-makers for decades now, that the Air Force is in the early stages of building, acquiring and deploying a higher-tech replacement for the existing arsenal of Minuteman III ICBMs. Weinstein pointed out that, since the dawn of the nuclear age decades ago, there has not been a catastrophic major power war on the scale of WWI or WWII.

PTI Air India was planning to float tenders for procuring these aircraft on lease this month. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi: Air India’s plans to expand its fleet have hit an air pocket, amid uncertainty after the government’s top policy-making body, NITI Aayog, proposed the total privatisation of the national carrier to the PMO (Prime Minister’s office). Decisions approved earlier by the airline’s board regarding aircraft acquisitions are currently “on hold” and tenders for procurement of new planes have been deferred till clarity emerges, an airline source said. In March, the Air India Board of Directors had approved a proposal to induct seven Boeing 787-9 aircraft in its fleet to improve connectivity to Canada, the US and Australia. The airline was planning to float tenders for procuring these aircraft on lease this month. The decision has now been deferred. “The decision (of floating tenders) is on hold until there is clarity on the airline’s future,” said a top Air India official when asked about the plan to acquire these planes. Similarly, the plan to procure ten ATR aircraft by Alliance Air, which has been awarded several routes under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN, have been put on the backburner, the official said. Alliance Air, the regional arm of the national carrier, currently has ten ATRs in its fleet and had recently placed orders for leasing of 10 more such smaller-sized aircraft by the end of this fiscal. As part of its fleet expansion plans, Alliance Air has plans to take its ATR fleet strength to 30 by FY 2018. On the other hand, Air India is also leasing 22 Airbus A320 Neos, of which 4 have already joined the fleet. According to the source, the airline had planned to issue bids for seven more such planes but now there is uncertainty over these tenders as well.

The state-owned carrier has a total of 103 planes of which 42 are wide-bodied Boeing 777s, 747s, and 787s. 61 are narrow bodied Airbus 319s, 320s and 321s. Its low-cost subsidiary, Air India Express, has 23 Boeing 737s. Finance minister Arun Jaitley too has proposed privatisation of Air India and the civil aviation ministry is looking at all options to make the airline strong and viable. A cabinet note in this regard is likely to be prepared shortly, according to Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha. Air India has piled up over Rs 50,000 crore of debt mainly because of high maintenance costs and lease rent. It barely made any operational profit in last decade, except in FY16.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You SEATTLE: Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and "fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make", he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes. "I have no idea how we're going to do that," Sinnett said. "But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the "Miracle on the Hudson," Sinnett said. "If it can't, then we can't go there." A US Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. "This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors'" he said, referring to rival Airbus. "It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?"

Dozens of complex robots are replacing humans for such mundane tasks as drilling and riveting, and Boeing is reordering some of its assembly steps to speed up the process. The savings, part of a long-term cost-cutting drive at the world's biggest plane maker that also includes substantial staff reductions, comes as Boeing has spent heavily to develop new aircraft models. It poured $1 billion into erecting a 27-acre factory to make carbon composite wings for its forthcoming 777X widebody jet. It scaled the factory to produce 100 planes a year. But with only 306 firm orders for the 777X on its books, and the production rate falling, Boeing is challenging workers to find more efficient ways to do the work so it can avoid purchasing some of the planned machinery. "Frankly, we would like to not to have to buy all of the equipment that we are currently sized for," said Eric Lindblad, vice president of the 777X program, during a recent factory tour. "It's just saving money on capital." Behind him, only two of six bays built to hold carbon fiber placement machines had been outfitted with all equipment. Boeing also has set up a temporary low-rate assembly line for initial production (LRIP) of the 777X so it can test processes before hitting the acceleration pedal. REDUCING RISK OF LEMONS The "LRIP" strategy comes in part from painful lessons on the 787 line, where early aircraft that came out of the factory needed heavy reworking. This time, "we are actually testing the primary elements of that new production capability" on the 777, a plane Boeing already knows how to make, said Jason Clark, vice president of 777 and 777X operations. Final assembly of the 777X begins next year, with testing in 2019 and first delivery in 2020. Lindblad said it might be delivered a quarter early, if customers want, but not in 2019. On the 787 line, where wings, fuselage and other major pieces are shipped from suppliers and simply assembled at Boeing, the savings options are fewer. But teams are still taking out costs. They have slashed production time by more than two-thirds in four years through such changes as organizing kits so mechanics have all parts on hand and putting interiors into planes earlier on the assembly line, said Bob Manelski, director of 787 business operations. Boeing builds the 787 in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. That allows it to try out new techniques on one line at a time. A year ago, it started noting a "champion time" for fastest production and analyzing how that was done. The savings are crucial to paying back about $27 billion in deferred 787 production costs racked up by the first few hundred 787s. Boeing's goal is to build the largest 787 version, the 787-10, in the same amount of time as the two smaller versions - and for the same cost as the 787-9. It has no choice but to continue getting lean, Manelski said. "We have to price the airplane more and more aggressively every time we got to the market."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Glenn Kessler By Glenn Kessler June 8 at 3:00 AM Follow @GlennKesslerWP The Trump administration claims to have made $350 billion-plus deals with Saudi Arabia. Fact Checker Glenn Kessler dives in. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) “I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” — President Trump, remarks in the Rose Garden, June 1, 2017 “These deals include an immediate $110 billion investment, which will grow to $350 billion over the next 10 years in defense cooperation from Saudi Arabia …. More than 30 commercial deals that include companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, GE, Dow, Honeywell, Emerson, Alcoa, and Cisco, among others, that will result in an additional $270 billion of Saudi investment in American businesses and American jobs.” — White House spokesman Sean Spicer, news briefing, May 30 The Fact Checker often is wary when an administration touts the potential benefits from an overseas deal, as there is a natural instinct to count chickens before they hatch. Given the Trump administration’s proclivity for exaggeration, we were especially skeptical of the numbers tossed around after the president’s trip to Saudi Arabia. During Trump’s trip, reporters traveling with the White House repeatedly pleaded for details of the agreements. Adding to the confusion, the State Department held a briefing May 30 in which Stuart Jones, the acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, said the commercial agreements amounted to just $80 billion. That was much lower than the White House’s $270 billion figure. The White House agreed to provide The Fact Checker with detailed spreadsheets of both the military and commercial agreements, and we have spent several days combing through them. We were given access to the data under the understanding that the details would not be published and that we only use information that is publicly available or confirmed by the companies involved. The numbers add up — $109.75 billion in military deals and $266.6 billion in commercial deals — but when you dig a little deeper, there’s less than meets the eye. The Facts Military deals The claimed $110 billion in military sales has aroused great skepticism by experts, with Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution calling the claim “fake news.” He noted that most of the publicly announced items had been previously announced by the Obama administration and that there appeared to be few, if any, signed contracts. Rather, many of the announcements were MOIs — memorandums of intent. Indeed, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency referred to the Saudi announcements as “intended sales” and listed six specific items that add up to $28 billion. But these were all previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration. Riedel, in an interview, noted that the $110 billion figure was not mentioned in the lengthy joint statement by Trump and Saudi King Salman, a signal that it is not etched in stone. Another telltale sign: Congress has not been officially notified of many of the Trump-era agreements. A congressional aide said that Congress has been notified about $18 billion in letters of agreement, dating to 2015, which have not yet been signed by Saudi Arabia. Another $1.5 billion in commercial licenses and training is under a 30-day congressional review period. With oil prices low, Riedel is doubtful that Saudi Arabia would choose to pay for this package now. The $110 billion list indicates that the delivery dates for many items are far in future — in some cases as late as 2028. Billions of dollars in bombs are scheduled for delivery in 2022. The list also includes at least $7 billion in sustainment agreements that ordinarily are not included in such announcements. Defense expert William Hartung said that including sustainment would have increased the value of President Barack Obama’s deals. His research indicates that Obama offered Saudi Arabia $115 billion in deals, about half of which resulted in actual sales. About 11 percent of the value of the deals claimed by the Trump administration are listed as “letter of agreement,” while the balance is listed as “memorandum of intent.” Another oddity is that some key elements have not been officially announced. Boeing said it’s on track for as much as $50 billion in deals, including a plan to negotiate a purchase of up to 16 commercial jumbo jets worth as much as $5 billion. Lockheed Martin said its deals amount to $28 billion, almost half of which are commercial items. But other big-ticket items on the list have not been announced, and few if any contracts appear to have been signed. The spreadsheet suggests potentially huge deals for Raytheon, but a spokesman for the weapons and defense electronics manufacturer said only: “The MOU [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Arabian Military Industries and our establishment of Raytheon Arabia are in their early days. We fully anticipate this work will enable us to expand our business in the Kingdom with new programs that will benefit both local and U.S.-based job growth.” The State Department’s Jones said at the May 30 briefing that $6 billion to purchase 150 Blackhawk helicopters from Lockheed was “a done deal” but that other agreements are “more forward-looking and haven’t been concretized.” Jones said the Blackhawk deal was part of the $110 billion in military sales, but it is listed as a commercial item in the White House spreadsheets (the helicopters will be manufactured and assembled in Saudi Arabia). A Lockheed spokesman said the agreement would “support” 200 jobs at the company in Connecticut and another 250 through “the supply chain” in North America, indicating these are not new jobs in the United States. Commercial deals There appears to quite a bit of double-counting, wishful thinking and fuzzy figures in the commercial list, which could explain why the White House claims $270 billion in deals and the State Department says there are just $80 billion in deals. The White House spreadsheet lists the numbers as “max value.” For instance, a huge chunk of the total — $100 billion — refers to a technology investment fund set up by SoftBank and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, of which the Saudis were contributing $45 billion. But that fund was announced three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump was regarded as having little chance of winning. Softbank has said that $50 billion would be invested in the United States, so the $100 billion figure appears to be a double-count. In any case, this arrangement was unrelated to Trump’s trip. Another $40 billion comes from a Blackstone partnership with the sovereign wealth fund for infrastructure investments in the United States, though the State Department valued the Saudi investment as $20 billion in its news briefing. The official announcement made it clear the deal was still a long way from fruition: “Blackstone and the Public Investment Fund (PIF) signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding for the project, which will depend on further negotiations.” The headline of an Alcoa news release tells a similar story: “Memorandum of Understanding explores potential expansion of Ma’aden Joint Venture.” The news release said the companies — already working together — “will assess the feasibility of a potential expansion” of an aluminum production complex. Ma’aden, a mining firm, announced a similar potential expansion with Mosaic in the phosphate business. The two nascent deals are pegged as being worth $18 billion, but virtually all of the jobs would be created in Saudi Arabia. A $10 billion deal between National Oilwell Varco and Saudi Aramco to manufacture drilling rigs and other equipment in Saudi Arabia is also subject to negotiation. At least another $45 billion in deals is listed as “localizing goods and services” in Saudi Arabia, as part of the kingdom’s effort to diversify its petro economy. Closer to home, ExxonMobil Chemical and Saudi Basics Industries. selected a site in Texas for a petrochemical project. This had already been announced in April. News reports said the project would cost $10 billion, but it is listed as being worth $22 billion in the White House document. In March, Trump had already claimed credit for ExxonMobil’s $20 billion in investments in the Gulf Coast, even though they had been announced in 2013. The potential sale of Boeing jumbo jets adds another $5 billion to the total. There are also another $2.5 billion in investments in the United States listed. The Pinocchio Test The administration’s numbers add up, but the numbers are inflated. The president said that we “concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.” Spicer described an “additional $270 billion of Saudi investment in American businesses and American jobs.” But a review of the deals shows that many deals are not concluded and are simply aspirational. Moreover, many of the investments are in Saudi Arabia, making it difficult to argue that these will create many jobs for Americans. Other deals, such as the SoftBank fund and ExxonMobil Chemical deal in Texas, had been announced months earlier and thus are not appropriate for inclusion on a list of achievements from the president’s visit. Given that the administration was able to show how it added up the numbers, we’d be tempted to say this was worthy of Two Pinocchios. But the administration’s consistent rhetoric suggesting the deals are completed and will mostly create American jobs tipped us to Three.

Julie JohnssonMichael SassoFabiola Moura The roster of potential buyers of 737 Max 10 jetliner, which is expected to launch this month, spans the globe. Photo: Reuters Chicago/Atlanta/Sao Paulo: Boeing Co. is in talks with United Airlines and at least four other companies as the US planemaker tries to line up initial customers for its 737 Max 10 jetliner and gain ground on a fast-selling Airbus SE model, people familiar with the matter said. The roster of potential buyers of the largest-ever 737, which is expected to launch this month, spans the globe. Initial sales prospects include Indonesia’s Lion Mentari Airlines PT, the aircraft-leasing arm of China’s development bank, Jet Airways India Ltd. and Copa Holdings SA, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. The US manufacturer is seeking a groundswell of orders to demonstrate the Max 10’s market appeal and strike back at the A321neo, Airbus’s largest narrow-body jet, which is capturing trans-continental routes once dominated by Boeing’s out-of-production 757. The Max 10 talks aren’t final and Airbus could still try to thwart the sales ahead of the Paris Air Show later this month. A spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing declined to comment on the talks. Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, declined to comment on a potential order, as did CDB Aviation Lease Finance, the Chinese aircraft lessor. Lion, Jet Airways and Panama City-based Copa didn’t immediately comment. ‘Better airplane’ The newest 737 Max would seat about 220 passengers in a single-cabin layout popular with budget carriers while burning about 5% less fuel than its similarly sized Airbus rival, according to the US company. The Boeing jet isn’t slated to enter the commercial market until 2020. Airbus delivered the first A321neo earlier this year and has garnered 1,416 total orders, according to the company’s website. “We aren’t looking to simply build something on par with the A321neo,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice-president for marketing. “We’re bringing a better airplane to the market — and that’s our focus.” Airbus sales chief John Leahy dismissed the competitive threat in comments to reporters this week, saying the US planemaker was responding to the A321neo only because the Airbus plane outsold the Max 9 by a four-to-one ratio. The Max 10’s frame would be five feet longer than that of the Max 9. Boeing doesn’t break out its Max sales by variant. Boeing is “flailing about, trying to come up with some answer to it that doesn’t cost them a fortune,” Leahy said. “Usually those things in aviation don’t work successfully.” United fleet United Continental Holdings Inc. is studying whether to convert 61 orders for the 737 Max to the -10 version, while taking a handful of Boeing 777-300ERs, the largest twin-engine jetliner currently flying, some of the people said. The carrier gained the production slots last year after it converted an earlier order for the Boeing 737-700 to the Max. The Chicago-based airline is also considering an A321neo order, the people said. Chief executive officer Oscar Munoz said United, the third-largest US carrier, was “interested” in the Max 10, during a brief interview on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association meeting in Cancun, Mexico, this week. Jet Airways, India’s biggest full-service airline, is preparing to order 50 single-aisle jets, Bloomberg reported on 5 June. The airline, which operates an all-Boeing narrow-body fleet, is evaluating the Max 10, the high-density Max 200 as well as the Airbus A321neo.

If enacted, the bill would streamline the licensing and regulatory processes involved in launching commercial satellites and closes a regulatory gap that prevented companies from investing in business opportunities in satellite servicing, commercial space stations and lunar landers. Spacecraft would be licensed by the Office of Space Commerce instead of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Getting a license to launch a satellite from NOAA sometimes took years, and the new bill automatically grants a permit if the Office of Space Commerce doesn’t make a ruling within 60 days. “This transformative legislation declares that America is open for business in outer space,” Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said in a press statement. “The bill establishes a favorable legal and policy environment for free enterprise with maximum certainty and minimum burden for stakeholders. With this innovative legislation, we position the American space industry as a leader,” said Smith, who introduced the bill. The bill has bipartisan support and is expected to breeze through the committee’s Thursday markup hearing. Opponents of the legislation worry it hands too much authority to the Office of Space Commerce, which is a relatively small department with few employees and a limited budget. Two Democrats Reps., Ed Perlmutter of Colorado and Derek Kilmer of Washington, joined their Republican colleagues to co-sponsor the legislation. The legislation comes days after a the Houston company Axiom Space announced plans to launch the first-ever commercial space station into orbit in 2020. U.S. plans to return astronauts to Earth’s orbit are entirely dependent on private companies, some of which are scheduled to launch by the end of this year. Boeing and SpaceX are both competing to be the first private company to send humans to the International Space Station. SpaceX has a human test flight planned for October 2017, while Boeing has a flight scheduled for May 2018. NASA wants these private companies to be the space agency’s “taxi service” to carry crews to the ISS. Once this service is established, the agency will refocus on long range deep space exploration. Astronauts began installing adapters that allowed commercial spacecraft to dock with the ISS last August to give NASA less expensive options to resupply the station. The legislation boosts NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which is intended to pay these companies to ferry astronauts up to the ISS. This will temper the U.S.’s  sole reliance on Russia for transporting American astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX has already successfully resupplied the ISS seven times, but one SpaceX resupply mission in June 2015 resulted in an explosion and a total loss of the spacecraft. The private company Orbital Sciences is also under contract with the space agency to resupply the ISS. Follow Andrew on Twitter Send tips to andrew@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

The report shows the organization launched a new set of advisory services last year, revised and approved its principles and criteria, added several participating operators and members, and further developed the RSB standard. With the support of the Boeing Corporate Citizenship program and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Switzerland, the RSB also developed a program to support smallholders in several regions around the globe. The RSB is an independent organization that operates a global certification standard for sustainable biomasterials, biofuels and biomass. It’s monitoring and evaluations (M&E) system focuses on biomass supply chains. According to the RSB, results from the M&E system are used to continually improve the RSB standard, policies, guidance and tools associated with the certification system. The report recently released by the RSB evaluates these results and compares them to expected short-term, mid-term and long-term impacts it expects to drive through its actions. According to the report, the RSB standard was used to certify wheat starch, sugarcane, jatropha, used cooking oil, yellow grease, carinata, waste carbon dioxide gas, and camelina in 2014. In 2016, the certification expanded to also include glycerol, coconut, gliricidia, macaúba and solaris tobacco. Product types it addresses includes farnesene, food ingredients, epichlorohydrin, biokerosene, ethanol, vegetable oil and biodiesel. From October 2014 through December 2016, operators under the program grew from 17 to 20, with sites increasing from 23 to 49. The number of farms certified under the program increased from 166 to 472, spanning a total of 17 countries, up from 14. New countries represented in the RSB system include Tunisia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Over the period covered by the report, RSB-certified operators produced approximately 256,284.3 metric tons of biofuels. As of the end of 2016, RSB certification covered 56,785.14 hectares of land.

The government owns a 29.8 percent stake while Air France KLM has a 26.73 percent stake in the airline, which slumped into the red five years ago following a downturn in tourism after a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. The government has previously said it planned to convert its loans into equity but did not give an amount. The figure of $243 million was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal. Kenya Airways warned in a statement on Thursday there was a risk of "significant" dilution of existing shareholders as it offers new equity in the restructuring exercise. The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments. The restructuring is expected to reduce the airline's debt to about $1.2 billion from above $2 billion, the government said in its submission to parliament. Parliament's term ends next week ahead of an August election the deal will need to be approved quickly.   Continued...

(KABC) -- There's been a strange sighting off the Palos Verdes coast. It looks a little like a futuristic version of the Loch Ness monster. But upon closer examination, it turns out to be a 50-ton, 51-foot-long monstrous underwater robot. It's the Boeing "Echo Voyager." The unmanned undersea vehicle is now going through several months of trials at sea before setting off on its own with no crew and no tether to a support ship. Powered by a hybrid electric battery system, it periodically surfaces to snorkel depth to recharge its batteries by raising a mast. The Echo Voyager can reach an impressive depth of 11,000 feet. It will be used for months-long surveillance and reconnaissance missions for defense, commercial and scientific customers.

The government owns a 29.8 per cent stake while Air France KLM has a 26.73 per cent stake in the airline, which slumped into the red five years ago following a downturn in tourism after a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory.

The figure of $243 million was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal.

The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments. The restructuring is expected to reduce the airline’s debt to about $1.2 billion from above $2 billion, the government said in its submission to parliament. Parliament’s term ends next week ahead of an August election the deal will need to be approved quickly. The government is also seeking to guarantee $750 million worth of the company’s current debt with international and local lenders as part of the restructuring. Some local creditors will convert some of their debt into equity too, a source at the airline said, without providing a figure of the amount. The restructuring is conditional on all creditors and shareholders agreeing to it, the government said in the document submitted to parliament. “There is a business case for a restructured Kenya Airways,” the government said, citing a study by an unidentified third party contracted to look into the issue. Kenya has spent billions of shillings upgrading the country’s main airports and views the airline as a strategic asset, supporting other industries such as tourism and encouraging investment from abroad. Kenya Airways flies 12,000 passengers a day on its fleet of Boeing and Embraer planes. It cut its pretax loss in the year to the end of March and reported a modest operating profit as it carried a record number of passengers despite a smaller fleet.

"Any disruption in any mature region or market that is relevant for us is a reason for concern," Chief Executive Tom Enders told reporters. Referring to the aviation blockade against Qatar imposed by Saudi Arabia and others this week, Enders said: "That's a development that is troubling for our industry, for many industries. We sincerely hope that these disruptions are not developing to a long-term conflict." The bust-up between Arab powers has dealt a blow to Gulf carriers already hurt by low oil prices and laptop bans and exposed the sensitivity of Gulf hubs to regional uncertainty, delegates at an airlines meeting said this week.. Analysts say any prolonged disruption could prompt Qatar to delay taking aircraft deliveries from Airbus and Boeing. Advertisement Advertisement Speaking at a media briefing ahead of the June 19-25 Paris Airshow, Enders played down suggestions that Airbus, the world's second-largest planemaker behind Boeing , was too reliant on the Middle East. "We are far from being over exposed… to this region," he said, noting it made up 13 percent of unfilled orders. "I think this region will remain important and relevant even allowing for some recouping, some consolidation; nobody can exclude that for the long term." With talks looming on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, Enders said Airbus's UK plants were among its most competitive and warned against crimping this advantage through restrictions on people or goods. "We are a company that is obviously very interested in the free flow of people. The mobility between our sites in Europe is crucially important," he said. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget "Any tariff barriers could also potentially impact the competitiveness of our activities in Britain." Enders was speaking shortly before a shock exit poll suggested that UK Prime Minister Theresa May had failed to maintain an overall majority after calling an election to strengthen her Conservative government's position ahead of EU negotiations. Several companies have expressed concerns over a so-called 'hard Brexit' under which trade tariffs could apply. Enders said "any British government paying attention to the importance of the aerospace industry is well aware of what is at stake". Analysts say Airbus is expected to press UK governments for continued support for the aerospace industry as the price for maintaining the same level of UK investment for future aircraft programs.

Mike Sinnett said the “basic building blocks of technology” are already in place for self-flying jets. Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar 3 Pilotless planes could be no longer be a spoof as seen in this classic scene from comedy Airplane featuring Julie Hagerty The vice-president of product development at US aerospace giant Boeing plans to test tech similar to that used in drones in a cockpit simulator later this summer. Speaking yesterday before the Paris Air Show, Mr Sinnett said he then hoped to fly a plane next year using “artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make”. Aircraft can take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped from three to two in recent years.

U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center's Dr. William Lewis and Dr. Dana Taylor led a special panel session titled "Advanced VTOL Air Vehicle Design" at the forum to discuss potential solutions for the future. VTOL refers to an aircraft's ability to takeoff, hover and land vertically. There are numerous advantages to advancing VTOL capabilities, particularly maneuverability in a combat situation. "It is the Aviation Development Directorate's charter to look at long-term technology solutions that will shape and drive Army aviation," said Taylor, a senior research scientist at AMRDEC. "It is our responsibility to understanding technology and identify technology have will have positive impact on Army for the next 20 to 30 years." The special session highlighted presentations by representatives of four manufacturers who each discussed aircraft development programs in progress including Aurora Flight Sciences' LightningStike aircraft, Bell Helicopters' V-280 Valor, Lockheed-Piasecki's Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System and Sikorsky-Boeing's SB>1 Defiant. "The LightningStrike and ARES aircraft are unmanned aircraft whose purpose is to demonstrate novel concepts and capabilities, while the V-280 and SB>1 are part of the AMRDEC ADD's Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator program," Taylor said. "The purpose of the JMR-TD program is to mature the critical technologies and reduce the risk toward replacing the military's current vertical lift fleet with a new family of aircraft as well as inform the requirements for the Future Vertical Lift program." "Different services have different needs, but the Army is trying to find the 'sweet spot' between low and high speed configurations," said JMR-TD Program Director, Dan Bailey. "Low speed maneuverability at the objective area is still a core Army capability requirement, but the future operational environments dictate a lead-ahead capability in the area of speed, range, and payload." Advanced rotary-wing configurations and enabling technologies are needed to achieve the combination of performance for range, speed, payload, as well as survivability, reliability and affordability for emerging Future Vertical Lift requirements and missions. Advancing these enabling technologies include examining areas like rotor control, blade control and vibration control. JMR-TD aircraft demonstrators are near completion for assembly and will fly from late 2017- 2019. The second iteration of architecture demonstrations will complete in mid-2017, with a final major demo in 2018-2020. The first Future Vertical Lift acquisition program of record has passed the Material Development Decision and is using the JMR-TD knowledge base robustly in decisions and analysis for that first and subsequent programs. --- U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to provide innovative research, development and engineering to produce capabilities for decisive overmatch to the Army against the complexities of the current and future operating environments in support of the Joint Warfighter and the Nation.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 4 Reasons Copa Holdings Has the Wind at Its Back Copa's most recent Investor Day presentation provides several compelling reasons to believe this investment will be a long-term winner. Andy Gould (CMFGouldberg) Jun 8, 2017 at 4:33PM After touching multiyear lows in late 2015, Copa Holdings' (NYSE:CPA) stock is finally taking off again. The Latin American airline's first-quarter earnings report showed unit revenue and operating margins trending back in the right direction, with upbeat guidance from management helping push the stock to a 24-month high. As impressive as those gains have been, this ride looks far from over. The company's most recent Investor Day presentation highlighted several reasons that Copa's impressive performance looks likely to continue for years to come. CPA data by YCharts. The Latin American economic recovery is underway Throughout 2015 and 2016, demand in many of Copa's primary markets -- including Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela -- fell sharply due to deteriorating economic conditions and weakening currencies. Latin American GDP growth grew just 0.1% in 2015 and fell 1% in 2016. Image source: Copa Holdings 2017 Investor Day presentation. Things have generally improved over the past couple of quarters, however, and a full recovery now looks to be underway. The International Monetary Fund is projecting Latin American GDP growth of 1.1% in 2017 and 2% in 2018. Copa's management says demand continues to strengthen in the second quarter, and expects this trend to continue for at least the remainder of this year. As these economies stabilize, Copa expects additional traffic increases in the years ahead, noting that air traffic in Latin America has historically expanded at two to three times the rate of GDP growth. And according to Boeing and Airbus estimates, traffic within Latin America is expected to grow at around 6% a year for the next 20 years. Image source: Copa Holdings.   Location, location, location Utilizing a hub-and-spoke model, the airline's hub in Panama City provides an ideal connection point for many travelers throughout Latin America -- and something of a competitive advantage as well. With service to 75 destinations in 31 countries, Copa is focused on what it calls "underserved, thin markets," operating primarily in markets that carry 50 or fewer passengers per day each way. This means that most other carriers can't sustain service to these destinations and that in most cases, Copa's network is the most convenient option. As a result, Copa has at least 50% market share in 45% of its markets. Panama City's Tocumen Airport -- where Copa already accounts for more than 80% of daily operations -- is also in the midst of a major expansion that should allow Copa to further capitalize on its geographic advantage. The new South Terminal, expected to open partially in 2018, will help fuel Copa's long-term growth with 20 additional available jet bridges. Much higher margins on the way Copa's ability to prudently manage its costs and capacity was on full display during the past couple of years. Even during the worst of its struggles, the airline managed to post operating margins of around 12% in both 2015 and 2016. However, the good news for investors is that margins are expected to rebound significantly. Management has targeted cost reductions in areas like fuel management and maintenance that should result in recurring annual savings of $50 million by the end of 2018. Between recovering economies, the cost initiatives above, and other revenue opportunities, the airline believes it can boost operating margins by 9 to 11 percentage points over the next two to three years -- which, if successful, would be even better than the company's historical highs of 19%-plus. That won't happen overnight, but the company is guiding for 2017 operating margin of 15% -- already a significant improvement over last year. A flexible approach to growth Copa currently operates a fleet of 100 planes, which it plans to grow to 111 by 2019. However, the company has the ability to flex its fleet growth significantly up or down depending on how the future unfolds. On the high side, Copa says it could expand its fleet count up to 170 or so by 2024, or as low as 115 if the company needs to grow more conservatively. This nimbleness should allow Copa to react to an unexpected market boom (or downturn) more quickly than its competitors. After the downright awful operating environment of the past couple of years, Copa appears to have emerged a stronger airline. With the Latin American economy now acting as a tailwind, Copa's geographic and low-cost advantages should come into sharper focus, helping the airline's business rise even higher over the next several years.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com SpaceX Will Launch Secretive X-37B Spaceplane's Next Mission By Samantha Masunaga PUBLISHED: JUNE 08 2017 SpaceX will launch the Air Force's X-37B experimental spaceplane later this year, in the military's latest vote of confidence in the Elon Musk-led space company. This will be the first time SpaceX has launched the uncrewed robotic vehicle. United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., has launched the spaceplane's previous four missions atop one of its Atlas V rockets. The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, which is responsible for the X-37B's experimental operations, said it was "very excited" for the fifth flight, which will test how special electronics and heat pipes will fare during a long-duration space mission. "We look forward to continued expansion of the vehicle's performance and are excited to continue hosting experimental payloads for the space community," the office's director, Randy Walden, said in a statement. The Air Force did not disclose when SpaceX won the contract. The Air Force has two of the spaceplanes, which look like miniature versions of the space shuttle and are known officially as X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles. The first X-37B was launched in 2010. The X-37B's most recent mission involved 718 days in orbit before the spaceplane landed last month. While details of the spaceplane's missions are scarce, the Air Force could be using the X-37B to test sensors for intelligence gathering from space, according to Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, a private organization that researches space security issues. Experts have also speculated that the spaceplane could be a vehicle for the military to quickly launch small satellites or as an on-orbit repair service for satellites. SpaceX -- which is based in Hawthorne and whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp. -- was certified by the Air Force in 2015 to carry national security satellites, which broke up a longtime and lucrative monopoly held by United Launch Alliance. Since then, SpaceX has won two contracts to launch national security satellites for the Air Force. © 2017 Los Angeles Times under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

The horses were transported from Liege in Belgium to compete in the first three legs of the Longines Global Champions Tour in Mexico City, Miami and Shanghai in April 2017. The air cargo carrier operated a total of 10 dedicated freighter flights each carrying 25 horse stalls to transport the equine champions and their grooms. Emirates SkyCargo worked closely with Peden Bloodstock, a specialist in horse transportation to manage the complex logistics involved in flying close to 100 horses across four different countries within the space of a few weeks. Mexico City and Miami Emirates SkyCargo transported 93 horses in two flights from Liege to Mexico City for the first segment of the journey between 31 March and 1 April 2017. The horses, each weighing between 600-650 kgs, were transported in Emirates SkyCargo Boeing 777F freighters along with 11 accompanying grooms and about 30 tonnes of equipment. The flights lasted close to 12 hours and the horses arrived at their destination a few days ahead of the start of the championships. Incidentally all the winners of the CSI 5 level competitions* at the Longines Global Champions Tour event in Mexico City had travelled on board Emirates SkyCargo. The second leg of the tour involved a relatively shorter three hour hop for the 93 horses from Mexico City to Miami onboard Emirates SkyCargo freighters. At the close of the event in Miami, the horses were brought back to Liege on 16 April 2017. Shanghai For the next stop in the itinerary, the air cargo carrier transported 96 horses and 27 grooms in three separate flights from Liege to Shanghai on 22 and 23 April 2017 and back on 1st and 2nd May 2017. The jet-setting horses had approximately one week on the ground at each destination to compete in tournaments before being transported to the next stop on their itinerary. Dedicated and trained staff were on the ground at each destination to ensure smooth handling and maximum comfort for the horses. Emirates SkyCargo combines state of the art facilities including a modern fleet of wide-bodied aircraft and custom designed horse stalls along with exceptional logistical arrangements on the ground by working with specialists such as Peden Bloodstock. The result is a calm and comfortable environment that ensures the well-being of horses while at the same time complying to all international norms for the transport of live animals. The air cargo carrier regularly transports champion horses for leading equestrian competitions around the world. With a global network of over 150 destinations across 83 countries, Emirates SkyCargo has regularly transported premium horses across six continents. Earlier this year the carrier transported some of the world's best racing horses to Dubai for the Dubai World Cup horse racing championship. Emirates SkyCargo also boasts of specialist facilities for horses such as a dedicated horse ramp for boarding horses at its freighter hub at Dubai World Central. Emirates SkyCargo charter for Longines Global Champions Tour in a nutshell - Close to 100 horses transported across three continents- Europe, North America and Asia in one month - 93 horses transported from Liege to Mexico City on 31 March and 1 April on two dedicated Emirates SkyCargo freighters - Horses were accompanied by 11 grooms and about 30 tonnes of equipment - On 9 April the 93 horses were then moved from Mexico City to Miami on two flights. - The horses were flown back to Liege from Miami on 16 April - 96 horses transported from Liege to Shanghai starting 22 April accompanied by 27 grooms and over 15 tonnes of equipment. - On 1 and 2 May 2017 the 96 horses were flown back to their starting point at Liege.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com NASA Picks 12 New Astronauts from Crush of Applicants By Marcia Dunn PUBLISHED: JUNE 08 2017 NASA chose 12 new astronauts Wednesday from its biggest pool of applicants ever, hand-picking seven men and five women who could one day fly aboard the nation's next generation of spacecraft. The astronaut class of 2017 includes doctors, scientists, engineers, pilots and military officers from Anchorage to Miami and points in between. They've worked in submarines, emergency rooms, university lecture halls, jet cockpits and battleships. They range in age from 29 to 42, and they typically have led the pack. "It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read what these folks have done," said NASA's acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot. Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the group during a televised ceremony at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. He offered President Donald Trump's congratulations and noted that the president is "firmly committed to NASA's noble mission, leading America in space." Pence assured the crowd that NASA will have the resources and support necessary to continue to make history. He said he would lead a resurrected National Space Council to help set the direction of the program. Under Trump, "America will lead in space once again, and the world will marvel," Pence said. More than 18,300 people threw their hats into the space ring during a brief application period 1 ½ years ago. That's more than double the previous record of 8,000 set in 1978, when the space shuttles were close to launching. The 12 selected Wednesday will join 44 astronauts already in the NASA corps. U.S. astronauts have not launched from home soil since 2011, when the space shuttles were retired, thus the low head count. Americans have been hitching rides aboard Russian spacecraft in the meantime, but that could change next year. After two years of training, the newbies may end up riding commercial rockets to the International Space Station or flying beyond the moon in NASA's Orion spacecraft. Their ultimate destination could be Mars. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules capable of carrying astronauts to the space station and back as soon as next year. A launch engineer and senior manager for SpaceX, Robb Kulin, is among the new astronauts. He's also worked as an ice driller in Antarctica and a commercial fisherman in Alaska. "Hopefully, one day, I actually fly on a vehicle that ... I got to design," Kulin said. Kulin and his classmates may be in for a long wait. Some members of the class of 2009 have yet to launch. Dr. Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL and specialist in emergency medicine, told reporters it "may be a little unclear" what the future holds, at least regarding what spacecraft he and his fellow astronauts might fly. "We're just happy to be here," he added. Jack Fischer, who was in the 2009 group, just got to the space station in April, but he said he couldn't be happier as he showed the latest hires their "new office" in a video. "It's a little bit cramped. The desk is kind of small. But the view. Oh, the view." Geologist Jessica Watkins already has experienced space -- vicariously -- as part of the team working with NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars. "We intend to send her to Mars one day, folks," NASA Flight Operations Director Brian Kelly said in introducing Watkins. She gave a thumbs-up. This is NASA's 22nd group of astronauts. The first group, the original Mercury 7 astronauts, was chosen in 1959. Altogether, 350 Americans have now been selected to become astronauts. Requirements include U.S. citizenship; degrees in science, technology, engineering or math; and at least three years of experience or 1,000 hours of piloting jets.

The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. The government has previously said it planned to convert its loans into equity but did not give an amount. The figure of $243m was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal. Kenya Airways warned in a statement on Thursday there was a risk of "significant" dilution of existing shareholders as it offers new equity in the restructuring exercise. Restructured Kenya Airways The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments. The restructuring is expected to reduce the airline's debt to about $1.2 bn from above $2 bn, the government said in its submission to parliament. Parliament's term ends next week ahead of an August election the deal will need to be approved quickly. The government is also seeking to guarantee $750m worth of the company's current debt with international and local lenders as part of the restructuring. Some local creditors will convert some of their debt into equity too, a source at the airline said, without providing a figure of the amount. The restructuring is conditional on all creditors and shareholders agreeing to it, the government said in the document submitted to parliament. "There is a business case for a restructured Kenya Airways," the government said, citing a study by an unidentified third party contracted to look into the issue. Kenya has spent billions of shillings upgrading the country's main airports and views the airline as a strategic asset, supporting other industries such as tourism and encouraging investment from abroad. Kenya Airways flies 12,000 passengers a day on its fleet of Boeing and Embraer planes. It cut its pretax loss in the year to the end of March and reported a modest operating profit as it carried a record number of passengers despite a smaller fleet.   Next Kenya to convert $243 mln debt in Kenya Airways into equity Show More Articles from This Author Nigerian aims to revolutionize reading in Afric...

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You The US Air Force said there would be a further delay in taking delivery of Boeing Co's KC-46 aerial refuelling aircraft, as the planemaker tries to get airworthiness certifications and complete a flight test program. The US Air Force assessment predicts first aircraft delivery beyond Boeing's forecast into late spring of 2018, according to a statement by the US Air Force. Boeing had previously forecast the aircraft to be delivered by September this year, and now expects first aircraft delivery by December 2017. The top issues slowing progress are achieving the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness certifications and completing the flight test program, the US Air Force said. Once Boeing gets the remaining design approvals from the FAA, it expects testing to proceed at a faster pace, according to the statement. The aircraft delivery delay is not expected to result in additional costs to the taxpayer, the US Air Force said.

All four previous X-37B missions were overseen by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin who launched the ship from atop one of its Atlas V rockets.  Director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office Randy Walden said of the announcement: “We are excited about this new partnership on creating flexible and responsive launch options and are confident in SpaceX’s ability to provide safe and assured access to space for the X-37B program.” The X-37B is boosted into space by a launch vehicle. It then re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere and lands as a spaceplane. Mystery surrounds the X-37B missions as most of their payloads and activities have been classified. However, the Air Force claims the mini-space shuttle is simply testing technologies in orbit and carrying out experiments which can be returned to Earth. The plane completed its last mission in May after a record-breaking 718 days.

Contracts are usually announced around two years before a flight.

Advertisement Delays to the first flight of  Airbus SE’s revamped A330neo jetliner stem from an unexpected requirement for extra testing of the model’s Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc engines, according to the planemaker. Rolls-Royce is struggling to find the capacity on its test-beds to complete the extra trials, Airbus’s head of programs,  Didier Evrard, said in an interview. That has pushed back the jet’s inaugural flight from spring to late summer, with service entry now scheduled for the end of the first half of 2018. While the A330neo’s Trent 7000 turbine is derived from an engine already used on the Boeing Co. 787, Rolls-Royce added ducts that will divert, or “bleed,” hot air over the Airbus plane’s wings for de-icing purposes. The Boeing aircraft employs a completely different cold-weather system featuring embedded heating mats. “The main issue is not the product itself, it’s the workload at Rolls-Royce and, particularly, the testing capacity,” Evrard said. “We have added some functions like the bleed function, which is not on the 787, so you have to go on the whole development cycle again. This requires a lot of testing to certify the engine.” Testing Bottleneck London-based Rolls-Royce said that it is continuing to work closely with Airbus on the A330neo program and that it aims to dispatch the initial set of Trent 7000 engines “in the coming days.” Evrard acknowledged that the first turbines are “very close” to being packaged and sent to Airbus’s base in Toulouse, France, where the planemaker has two revised A330 airframes ready and waiting. The manufacturer has so far secured 210 orders for the upgraded plane, with TAP set to be its first operator. The Portuguese airline said in December that its first jet would be delayed into March 2018 from the end of this year. Rolls is also the sole provider of engines for Airbus’s A350 wide-body, which is ramping up production following 49 deliveries last year. The Trent XWB turbine for the largest -1000 variant of the plane is approaching certification. Meanwhile, a powerplant for the 787-10 is also in final development at the British manufacturer. While Rolls-Royce has expanded test facilities at its main plant in Derby, as well as in Germany and Spain, to cope with the workload, Evrard said the stresses are inevitable. “Across the board there are production ramp-ups and new developments,” he said. “This is really what they have been struggling with.” Popular Now The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter Honda Plays Catch-Up With Electric Car, Autonomous Driving Goals AI ‘Good for the World’...

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Deconstructing Kansas By Bernie Becker 06/08/2017 10:00 AM EDT With help from Aaron Lorenzo SO, ABOUT KANSAS: This is the big question about what has to be called the failure of the Kansas tax cut experiment — what sort of impact will it have on the tax reform debate up and down Pennsylvania Avenue? Story Continued Below Our Aaron Lorenzo and your Morning Tax author tackled that question, and found there were definitely some lessons that Washington could learn from the problems in Topeka. (For starters, broadening the base is your friend in tax reform.) Top tax writers like House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said what happened in Kansas would have “no impact” on their work on a tax overhaul. But it’s certainly a fair question, given that there are at least some similarities between what was enacted under Gov. Sam Brownback and what Washington Republicans want to do — in short, a lower rate for pass-through income than ordinary individual income. Here’s one explanation that was offered for why the two are an imperfect comparison — the design of the Kansas tax cuts, which totally erased taxes on pass-throughs, was so bad that it’s hard to even contemplate anything like it passing in D.C. “I don’t know how you could possibly replicate it at the federal level,” said Liam Donovan, the director of legislative and political affairs at Associated Builders and Contractors and a former top staffer at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “It’s so egregious — we’re talking about pass-throughs paying zero. It’s almost cartoonish.” Democrats saw the end of the Brownback tax cuts as vindication for their long-held and deep skepticism over supply-side economics, and the idea — still being pushed recently by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — that tax cuts can pay for themselves. “We need to lock our congressional Republicans in a room with the Kansas Legislature — not exactly a radical group, to be clear — so the Kansas folks can explain to the D.C. folks the totally predictable failure of their trickle-down experiment,” said the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ Jared Bernstein, who was a top economic adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden. Bernstein added: “If facts could kill trickle-down lore, I’d have written its eulogy years ago.” WELCOME TO THURSDAY, where Morning Tax couldn’t be the only tax dork to be distressed by Wednesday’s rather sharp exchange between Sen. Ron Wyden and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence. We’ll always have the 2011 Wyden-Coats bipartisan comprehensive tax reform bill. And yes, they apparently know this down to the day: The Vikings began their invasion of England on this day 1,224 years ago, with a raid on an abbey on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne. Let us know what’s going on. Email: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, cwilhelm@politico.com, alorenzo@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @colinwilhelm, @AaronELorenzo, @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax. THIS IS WHERE WE ARE ON THE BAT: Even Douglas Holtz-Eakin — who co-wrote the paper that House Republicans used to sell the border adjustment — sounds like he thinks the idea’s time has passed. “At some level, these ideas are your children and you love them. It’s pretty hard to say, well, now you’re an orphan, sorry, bye,” Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, told Bloomberg, adding: “Time is our enemy here.” The major thrust of the Bloomberg story is that House Speaker Paul Ryan — and, by association, Brady — is clinging to his plan, which has few other fans, to the detriment of trying to find an alternative. “The resulting impasse could relegate the House to the sidelines as the Trump administration and Republican senators try to come up with an alternative plan. The worst-case scenario for Republicans is that they never find one,” Anna Edgerton wrote. (The devil’s advocate here: If there was a compelling alternative, wouldn't it have materialized by now?) UNDERSCORING ALL OF THAT … : The Business Roundtable, the group of big corporate chief executives, sent a letter Wednesday imploring congressional leaders that “now is the time to shift from listening to action” on tax reform. (And remember, the White House just launched another round of "listening sessions.") More than 20 chief executives thanked Congress for reaching out to business on the issue and holding hearings, before calling a tax overhaul the “highest priority.” “Business Roundtable recently surveyed its membership and found that a significant majority of CEOs believe that tax reform is the single most effective action that Congress can take to accelerate economic growth over the next year,” the CEOs wrote. On some level, it’s not surprising that business leaders are getting antsy about tax reform. But the letter also underscores how hamstrung the tax debate has been in recent months. Chief executives from companies in the pro-border adjustment coalition (GE, Boeing) and the opposition (Wal-Mart) both signed the letter, illustrating the difficulty groups like BRT have had on tax reform given the divisions within their own membership. BAT DEBATE GETS CHIPPY: Brady took a little shot at the Koch brothers and their opposition to the House blueprint this week — calling them just a “special interest fighting to retain a special tax break," as documented by the Washington Examiner’s Joseph Lawler. As it happens, Koch World didn’t take too kindly to that. "Respectfully, please show us that tax break and we’ll oppose it. Our company has consistently opposed the establishment and continuation of any subsidy, mandate, or special interest carveout (examples here, here, here and here) that rigs the system and gives preference to one industry over another. This includes any special interest tax break and those programs where we might participate and benefit,” Philip Ellender of Koch Companies Public Sector aid in a statement, adding they opposed the border adjustment because it would raise prices on consumers. ** A message from Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America: Wine and spirits wholesalers are family-owned businesses and a major economic engine operating at some 3,000 locations nationwide and employing 74,000 workers. These workers earn more than $6.5 billion in wages each year. The industry as a whole generates more than $50 billion in state and federal taxes. ** GIVING SOME OF THOSE TAXES BACK: Talk about something that would be a big deal for both health care and tax reform — Senate Republicans are seriously looking at keeping some of Obamacare’s taxes for a few more years in their replacement proposal, the POLITICO’s Jennifer Haberkorn, Burgess Everett and Adam Cancryn report. On one level, that makes a lot of sense — the Senate GOP has been talking about policies that are more generous than the American Health Care Act passed by the House, and there’s only so many ways to pay for that. "There are just two dials here," said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. (One dial is the tax side, the other dial the benefits side.) "You have to keep turning [them] until you get a majority who says, 'I like that dial and that dial set right there.' And that's a big part of how this has to come together." There’s no doubt that keeping portions of the Obamacare taxes would disappoint House Republicans and small-government types. Brady has talked over and over about what he sees as the destructive nature of the Affordable Care Act taxes, when asked about the possibility of the Senate not getting rid of them all. Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform tweeted this week about “ugly rumors that the Senate might not repeal all the $992 billion in Obamacare taxes.” Another potential issue, though this is looking pretty far down the line: A GOP tax overhaul would not lower the tax burden as much as some Republicans would like if some ACA taxes survive. THAT’S NOT GOING OVER WELL: More than five dozen countries, including China, signed a pact on Wednesday that seeks to rein in both double taxation and tax avoidance — but one country was conspicuous in its absence, according to Bjarke Smith-Meyer, our colleague from POLITICO Europe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 co-wrote the agreement, but the U.S. — a member of both — didn’t sign it. OECD officials said America’s absence won’t make much of a substantive difference, given the strength of the U.S.’s tax treaties. It’s also fair to note that this would have been the outcome under either President Barack Obama or President Donald Trump. Still, critics said America’s decision not to sign undermines the efforts to battle offshore tax gaming, with some suggesting it’s the latest sign that the U.S. is retreating from its role as a world leader. “Today, the U.S. administration chose to double down on its abdication of American leadership. After withdrawing from the climate change accords last week, the administration backed away from another Paris-based international agreement today — one that combats tax avoidance by multinational corporations,” said Clark Gascoigne of the FACT Coalition. PSA: Do you want to see improvements in the IRS’s website? Well, tell them about it. The tax collector has a new seven- to nine-minute survey on its site that asks how the IRS can improve its web presence. PERSONNEL UPDATE: The National Association of Manufacturers named Carolyn Lee executive director of The Manufacturing Institute, its central research arm. Lee has spent almost six years as senior director of tax policy at NAM. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE — THAT’S ONE WAY TO PUT IT: Germany’s environment minister called a court ruling that could force Berlin to give back billions of euros in taxes to energy utilities a “colossal irritation,” the BBC reports. The nuclear fuel tax, now more than six years old, pumped some 6.3 billion euros into Germany’s finance ministry between 2011 and 2016, The Financial Times noted. But Germany’s Constitutional Court ruled that parliament had exceeded its powers in enacting the tax. The tax first went into place as a trade between the industry and the government, with the nuclear sector getting a longer service life for its reactors. But following the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to shutter the nuclear industry by 2022, yet kept the tax on the books. STATE NEWS — WHO LOVES PROPERTY TAXES? The Oregon Legislature is considering a bill that would hike property taxes for buyers of newer properties in the state’s largest county, Multnomah, the Oregonian reports. The bill would let cities fiddle with property tax rates for newer structures and buildings after renovations, a step that some local officials said would ease the tax burden for longtime residents. “Certainly this has a positive revenue impact for the city, but we're also motivated by the fairness issue,” said a lobbyist for the city of Gresham. In perhaps bigger news from the Beaver State: “Top Democrats in the Oregon House and Senate say they've reached agreement on a corporate tax plan that would raise nearly $900 million in the next two years to patch the state's budget hole and increase education funding.” QUICK LINKS — Sen. Orrin Hatch: Short-term revenue loss in tax reform wouldn’t be a big deal. — Rep. Richard Neal: Tax reform, infrastructure should be linked. — National taxpayer advocate: Policy to deprive people with seriously delinquent tax bills might violate rights to due process. — West Virginia is still stuck on taxes. — Uber fares in Britain don’t include the value-added tax, allowing it a leg up on competitors. DID YOU KNOW? Gresham’s Law, in economics, states that “bad money drives out good.” ** A message from Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America: Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) is a widely-accepted inventory accounting method used by large and small companies around the country. Under some tax reform proposals, family-owned American wine and spirits wholesalers would be forced to pay massive retroactive taxes on their LIFO reserves. This tax on family businesses would result in a tax increase of nearly $3,000 for every wholesaler employee. LIFO repeal results in higher future tax bills that are a particular burden for family-owned companies and threatens wine and spirits wholesalers’ ability to invest in new inventory, employees, training, equipment and technology. WSWA opposes the repeal of LIFO.

The government owns a 29.8 percent stake while Air France KLM has a 26.73 percent stake in the airline, which slumped into the red five years ago following a downturn in tourism after a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. The government has previously said it planned to convert its loans into equity but did not give an amount. The figure of $243 million was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal. Kenya Airways warned in a statement on Thursday there was a risk of "significant" dilution of existing shareholders as it offers new equity in the restructuring exercise. The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments. The restructuring is expected to reduce the airline's debt to about $1.2 billion from above $2 billion, the government said in its submission to parliament. Parliament's term ends next week ahead of an August election the deal will need to be approved quickly. The government is also seeking to guarantee $750 million worth of the company's current debt with international and local lenders as part of the restructuring. Some local creditors will convert some of their debt into equity too, a source at the airline said, without providing a figure of the amount. The restructuring is conditional on all creditors and shareholders agreeing to it, the government said in the document submitted to parliament. "There is a business case for a restructured Kenya Airways," the government said, citing a study by an unidentified third party contracted to look into the issue. Kenya has spent billions of shillings upgrading the country's main airports and views the airline as a strategic asset, supporting other industries such as tourism and encouraging investment from abroad. Kenya Airways flies 12,000 passengers a day on its fleet of Boeing and Embraer planes. It cut its pretax loss in the year to the end of March and reported a modest operating profit as it carried a record number of passengers despite a smaller fleet.

The government owns a 29.8 percent stake while Air France KLM has a 26.73 percent stake in the airline, which slumped into the red five years ago following a downturn in tourism after a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. The government has previously said it planned to convert its loans into equity but did not give an amount. The figure of $243 million was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal. Kenya Airways warned in a statement on Thursday there was a risk of "significant" dilution of existing shareholders as it offers new equity in the restructuring exercise. The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments. The restructuring is expected to reduce the airline's debt to about $1.2 billion from above $2 billion, the government said in its submission to parliament. Parliament's term ends next week ahead of an August election the deal will need to be approved quickly. The government is also seeking to guarantee $750 million worth of the company's current debt with international and local lenders as part of the restructuring. Some local creditors will convert some of their debt into equity too, a source at the airline said, without providing a figure of the amount. The restructuring is conditional on all creditors and shareholders agreeing to it, the government said in the document submitted to parliament. "There is a business case for a restructured Kenya Airways," the government said, citing a study by an unidentified third party contracted to look into the issue. Kenya has spent billions of shillings upgrading the country's main airports and views the airline as a strategic asset, supporting other industries such as tourism and encouraging investment from abroad. Kenya Airways flies 12,000 passengers a day on its fleet of Boeing and Embraer planes. It cut its pretax loss in the year to the end of March and reported a modest operating profit as it carried a record number of passengers despite a smaller fleet.

Air Works has 17 aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) hangars across India and other countries. It provides a range of services including airline and business aircraft MRO, commercial and business aircraft asset management. With Gurgaon-based airline SpiceJet's Boeing 737 aircraft, bearing registration VT-SLB, rolling out of Air Works' Base Maintenance facility at Hosur mid-last month, the company successfully completed its 200th base maintenance check, a release said. Base maintenance is also known as heavy or hanger maintenance. The company's Hosur maintenance facility has the approval from European aviation regulator EASA besides India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). "This is a proud and a momentous step for us. We are thankful to SpiceJet for making us their partner of choice in this endeavour," said Air Works Executive Vice President Anand Bhaskar. He also said that the aviation industry is likely to grow further and expand to tier-II cities in view of the encouraging policy moves outlined in the National Civil Aviation Policy and regional connectivity scheme UDAN. "We appreciate the quick turn-around times and their world class MRO facility. I look forward to sustaining our engagement with them in the future," said SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh. He also said with Air Works completing the heavy maintenance work in six days as compared to the scheduled time of seven days, the time saving resulted in airline earning an extra day's worth of revenue from the aircraft. Air Works offers base maintenance services on B737, A320, ATR42/72 aircraft at Hosur (near Bengaluru), and line maintenance services on A320, A330, A340, B737, B777, B787, and ATR72 aircraft across 18 international airports in India for domestic and international operators. The company also said in the release that its MRO business clocked revenues to the tune of Rs 600 crore last fiscal, adding the existing order backlog stands at around Rs 1,800 crore.

He prodded Cook to manufacture his iPhones and other gear at home rather than outsource them to China. “One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants,” Trump said he told Cook. That sums up the economic vision of the Trump administration. The president and his advisers are convinced more factories can cure the trade deficits, lackluster growth, and (supposed) joblessness plaguing the U.S. economy. Trump has vowed to lure back plants that departed for cheaper locales such as China or Mexico and sanction companies that dare to leave. The result, he claims, will be investments that revitalize down-on-their-luck communities and American economic vitality. “We will bring back our jobs,” he pledged in his inauguration speech. “We will bring back our dreams.” The president, though, is plain wrong. Factories won’t restore the American dream. That’s because they don’t contribute as much to the economy as they once did, despite all the fuss politicians make over them. Chasing them with pro-factory policies will not only fail to bring the benefits Trump has promised but could also hurt the very middle-class families they’re designed to help. A die-hard conviction remains among many Americans that the more an economy manufactures, the stronger it is. Some workers feel that making steel or cars is more respectable than stacking shelves at a Gap, and the Trump administration readily agrees. Calling steel “critical to both our economy and our military,” the president signed an executive order in late April that in all likelihood will lead to curbs on imports to protect U.S. mills. Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s key economic advisers, argues that bringing factories back from foreign countries will shore up the nation’s growth and security. “One of the goals of the Trump administration is to reclaim all of the supply-chain and manufacturing capability that would otherwise exist if the playing field were level,” he recently said. This strategy is based on flawed thinking. Manufacturing is certainly not as important to the U.S. economy as it once was, declining to less than 12 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 from 26 percent 50 years earlier. But the whole idea that “we don’t make anything,” as Trump himself has put it, is a fallacy. The U.S. remains a production powerhouse, accounting for almost 19 percent of global manufacturing, behind China’s 25 percent but bigger than Germany’s and Japan’s shares combined. U.S. manufacturers are still extremely competitive in high-tech and hard-to-duplicate products—think Boeing Co. aircraft. And even as some factory work has moved abroad, the U.S. economy remains remarkably strong. Home to many of the world’s most important and innovative companies, from Facebook Inc. to Tesla Inc., the U.S. boasts an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, less than half the euro-area level. What Trump fails to appreciate is that the true value in making something is no longer in making it. Companies figured out long ago that they can capture most of the value of a product by focusing on its design and research and development, its branding, and the services that support it after it’s been sold. Stan Shih, the founder of Taiwan’s Acer Inc., illuminated this phenomenon in the early 1990s with his “smile curve.” The middle of the smile—the lowest point of value—is where the fabrication takes place; the highest value is found at the corners—the R&D at the beginning and the customer service at the end. Manufacturing is at the lowest point on a curve that plots where companies profit most That simply reflects supply and demand. The talent necessary to conceive, brand, and market a new product is much scarcer than the skills to manufacture it. The integration of giant emerging economies such as China and India into global supply chains increased the number of available hands to screw or sew things together, dropping the cost of making a product even further. There’s “a lot of supply for the actual manufacturing, but not a lot of supply for creating the next Google or Apple,” says Ann Harrison, management professor at the Wharton School and co-editor of the book The Factory-Free Economy. That disparity shows clearly in the apple of Trump’s eye: the iPhone. In a 2010 study, the Asian Development Bank Institute pulled apart an iPhone and figured that the process of assembling it in China accounted for 3.6 percent of its production cost. The remaining 96.4 percent was paid to the parts suppliers, and Apple, as the creator, claimed the big profits. Net income at Apple, which does almost no manufacturing, was an impressive 21 percent of revenue in its last fiscal year, and its shares trade at 18 times earnings. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the companies to which Apple outsources its manufacturing, recorded net profit of 3.5 percent of sales; investors value its shares at 12 times earnings. Apple also creates lots of jobs without big factories: It directly employs 80,000 people in the U.S. and plans to add thousands more. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans Based on Cook’s reaction to Trump’s nagging, he fully understands where the real profits lie. Although Cook in early May made a surprise announcement that Apple was earmarking $1 billion to invest in advanced manufacturing, the savvy CEO never said his company would build and operate factories itself. (Apple’s first investment was $200 million into Corning Inc., a supplier that makes the glass for iPhones.) Of course, more factories mean more jobs, and more jobs are always good. Studies show that workers who lose their job when a plant closes take a long-term hit to their standard of living. Unfortunately, the 21st century factory won’t create the jobs that yesterday’s did. With advancing technology in robotics and automation, a modern plant can churn out a lot more stuff with fewer workers. That’s why U.S. manufacturing output continues to swell while employment in the sector has withered. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans. There are some measures he can take to woo factories home. A corporate tax cut, for instance, might make the U.S. more attractive to some manufacturers. But to entice supply chains back en masse from China and Mexico, where it’s cheaper and more efficient to make certain things, he’d have to intervene in market forces to overturn those cost advantages—for example, by imposing taxes and tariffs on imports lofty enough to render manufacturing outside the U.S. much more expensive, as he’s already threatened to do. But whenever government tries to outmuscle the market, the result is almost always extra costs that have to be borne by the greater economy. A border tax being contemplated in a Republican tax plan could hurt shareholders, by decreasing corporate profitability and share valuations, and consumers, by hiking prices at their local Walmart or Target. That suppresses consumption, which is bad for growth and jobs. A major effort by the administration to force factories home could destroy lots of other jobs. Raising the price of imports would likely decimate the already struggling retail industry, which supports 1 of 4 American jobs, with slower sales and slimmer profits—almost certainly causing store closings and layoffs. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up By obsessing over factory jobs that no longer exist, Trump may cost Americans the jobs of the future. The logic of the “smile curve” suggests he should focus on developing and supporting the parts of the manufacturing process that hold the real value—in other words, fostering more Apples. That would entail upgrading the skills of the U.S. workforce by devoting more resources to education and reducing the financial burden of a college degree, while encouraging foreign talent to start their next big ventures in Silicon Valley, not Shanghai. Rather than restricting trade, Trump should press for an even freer global exchange of goods and services so U.S. corporations can best organize their operations to maximize profits. Unfortunately, he and his team aren’t headed in that direction. Describing his talk with Cook, Trump called an Apple factory in America a “real achievement for me”—not Apple, the American worker, or the economy. By rallying political support, his obsession with factories may be good for him, but it isn’t necessarily great for the rest of us. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The astronaut class of 2017 includes doctors, scientists, engineers, pilots and military officers from Anchorage to Miami and points in between. They've worked in submarines, emergency rooms, university lecture halls, jet cockpits and battleships. They range in age from 29 to 42, and they typically have led the pack. "It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read what these folks have done," said NASA's acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot. Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the group during a televised ceremony at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. He offered Donald Trump's congratulations and noted that the president is "firmly committed to NASA's noble mission, leading America in space". Under Trump, "America will lead in space once again, and the world will marvel," Pence said. More than 18,300 people threw their hats into the space ring. That's more than double the previous record of 8000 set in 1978, when the space shuttles were close to launching. The 12 selected on Wednesday will join 44 astronauts already in the NASA corps. US astronauts have not launched from home soil since 2011, when the space shuttles were retired. Americans have been hitching rides aboard Russian spacecraft in the meantime, but that could change next year. After two years of training, the newbies may end up riding commercial rockets to the International Space Station or flying beyond the moon in NASA's Orion spacecraft. Their ultimate destination could be Mars. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules capable of carrying astronauts to the space station and back as soon as next year. A launch engineer and senior manager for SpaceX, Robb Kulin, is among the new astronauts. He's also worked as an ice driller in Antarctica and a commercial fisherman in Alaska. "Hopefully, one day, I actually fly on a vehicle that ... I got to design," Kulin said. Kulin and his classmates may be in for a long wait. Some members of the class of 2009 have yet to launch. Dr. Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL and specialist in emergency medicine, told reporters it "may be a little unclear" what the future holds, at least regarding what spacecraft he and his fellow astronauts might fly. "We're just happy to be here," he added. Geologist Jessica Watkins already has experienced space - vicariously - as part of the team working with NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars. "We intend to send her to Mars one day, folks," NASA Flight Operations Director Brian Kelly said in introducing Watkins. She gave a thumbs-up. This is NASA's 22nd group of astronauts. The first group, the original Mercury 7 astronauts, was chosen in 1959. © AP 2017 Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

The X-37B is a reusable unmanned aircraft manufactured by Boeing which is launched into space on the back of a rocket and lands on a runway once it has completed its mission. The spacecraft’s purpose is classified, but it has completed numerous long missions since its creation, and spent almost two years in orbit on its last mission. According to a report by ArsTechnica, the US military opted to use SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket for the launch due to the reduced costs in comparison to the Atlas V rocket used for previous spy plane launches. The spy plane will reportedly launch in August.

Gatot Nurmantyo as quoted by Antara during his visit to Ternate, on Thursday. He said the deployment of the reconnaissance aircraft would be accompanied by additional sea vessels, which would carry out sea patrols in several locations considered prone to terrorist infiltration, especially the outermost areas, such as Morotai Island regency. Gatot said the TNI also planned to build military bases on several of Indonesia's outermost islands, including Morotai Island. Once construction of the military base on Morotai Island is complete, the TNI will install a primary weaponry defense system specially designed for border area security. Gatot said the program, which was initiated by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, would be realized after the construction of a military base on Natuna Island in northwestern Kalimantan was completed. “Based on the program initiated by President Jokowi, Morotai is one of the islands where we will build a military base supported by primary weaponry defense systems.

The astronaut class of 2017 includes doctors, scientists, engineers, pilots and military officers from Anchorage to Miami and points in between. They've worked in submarines, emergency rooms, university lecture halls, jet cockpits and battleships. They range in age from 29 to 42, and they typically have led the pack. "It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read what these folks have done," said NASA's acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot. Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the group during a televised ceremony at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. He offered President Donald Trump's congratulations and noted that the president is "firmly committed to NASA's noble mission, leading America in space." Pence assured the crowd that NASA will have the resources and support necessary to continue to make history. He said he would lead a resurrected National Space Council to help set the direction of the program. Under Trump, "America will lead in space once again, and the world will marvel," Pence said. More than 18,300 people threw their hats into the space ring during a brief application period 1 ½ years ago. That's more than double the previous record of 8,000 set in 1978, when the space shuttles were close to launching. The 12 selected Wednesday will join 44 astronauts already in the NASA corps. U.S. astronauts have not launched from home soil since 2011, when the space shuttles were retired, thus the low head count. Americans have been hitching rides aboard Russian spacecraft in the meantime, but that could change next year. After two years of training, the newbies may end up riding commercial rockets to the International Space Station or flying beyond the moon in NASA's Orion spacecraft. Their ultimate destination could be Mars. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules capable of carrying astronauts to the space station and back as soon as next year. A launch engineer and senior manager for SpaceX, Robb Kulin, is among the new astronauts. He's also worked as an ice driller in Antarctica and a commercial fisherman in Alaska. "Hopefully, one day, I actually fly on a vehicle that ... I got to design," Kulin said. Kulin and his classmates may be in for a long wait. Some members of the class of 2009 have yet to launch. Dr. Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL and specialist in emergency medicine, told reporters it "may be a little unclear" what the future holds, at least regarding what spacecraft he and his fellow astronauts might fly. "We're just happy to be here," he added. Jack Fischer, who was in the 2009 group, just got to the space station in April, but he said he couldn't be happier as he showed the latest hires their "new office" in a video. "It's a little bit cramped. The desk is kind of small. But the view. Oh, the view." Geologist Jessica Watkins already has experienced space - vicariously - as part of the team working with NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars. "We intend to send her to Mars one day, folks," NASA Flight Operations Director Brian Kelly said in introducing Watkins. She gave a thumbs-up. This is NASA's 22nd group of astronauts. The first group, the original Mercury 7 astronauts, was chosen in 1959. Altogether, 350 Americans have now been selected to become astronauts. Requirements include U.S. citizenship; degrees in science, technology, engineering or math; and at least three years of experience or 1,000 hours of piloting jets. A brief look at the elite 12: - Navy Lt. Kayla Barron of Richland, Washington, a submarine-warfare officer and nuclear engineer who was among the first class of women commissioned into the submarine service and now works at the U.S. Naval Academy. - Zena Cardman of Williamsburg, Virginia, a graduate research fellow at the National Science Foundation with a specialty in microorganisms in subsurface environments such as caves. - Air Force Lt.

Politics 10:00, 08 June 2017 REUTERS Matvienko claimed the decisions of international courts were increasingly being used as an instrument of political, economic pressure and interference in Russia's internal affairs. "As an attempt to interfere, we can consider the initiatives to create an international tribunal in the case of the crash of the Malaysian Boeing in Donbas. The politically-inspired investigation of the International Criminal Court into the events of 2008 in South Ossetia, the recognition as illegal the reunification of Crimea with Russia made it impossible for our country to participate in the ICC Rome Statute," Matvienko said.

Matviyenko noted that an idea arose, similar to the anti-corruption expert assessment of bills, to conduct an analysis of norms being adopted on their vulnerability to external influences, a so-called "sovereign expertise." In particular, she called the adoption of the federal constitutional law on granting the Constitutional Court the right to recognize impossible for Russia to fulfill the decisions of international courts if they contradict the Russian Constitution. "Hybrid wars have become the realities of our time. Their objective is simple - to undermine the sovereignty of states, to subordinate their domestic and foreign policies. In fact, this is also the conquest, but without military operations," she said. UNIAN memo. Malaysia Airlines' MH17 Boeing 777 heading from Amsterdam for Kuala Lumpur was shot down on July 17, 2014, over militant-occupied territory in Donetsk region. All 298 people on board who were citizens of 10 countries were killed in the crash. The majority of the victims, 196, were citizens of the Netherlands.

It was revealed that the plane had been shot down by a Buk anti-aircraft missile system. The Joint Investigation Team in its report published on September 28, 2016, confirmed that the plane had been downed by a Russian-made Buk brought to Ukraine from Russia. The missile launch site was located in militant-controlled Pervomaisk. Nearly 100 people are among the suspects in the investigation.

The conference opened Tuesday in Beijing. (Xinhua/Chen Yehua)  BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China is looking towards increased cooperation with international space leaders, it stressed Tuesday at the Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX 2017) currently being held in Beijing. In a letter of congratulations sent to the conference by Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said that China wants to enhance cooperation with the international community in peaceful space exploration and development. Xi noted that progress in space science and technology will benefit people around the world and China wants to use space exploration achievements to create a better future for mankind. "China is expanding cooperation with the United Nations (UN) in space exploration, and will disclose projects later this year," said Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut and current deputy director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office. The country has previously undertaken bilateral cooperation with various countries and institutions and is now looking towards multilateral projects. China will carry out joint projects with the UN Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) including astronaut training, space station scientific experiments and multilateral application of such experiments, said Yang. "Rather than a space race, I think cooperation is always good and worldwide cooperation is even better. I hope we can breach Earth's crises by having worldwide cooperation in space," said Jan Woerner, director general of the European Space Agency (ESA). "We should not try to duplicate everything, and if we join forces we can do even more with the same amount of money," he added. The conference, which ends Thursday, was jointly held by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) and the Chinese Society of Astronautics and follows the GLEX 2012 conference held in Washington D.C. International space engineers and delegates from leading aerospace companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Airbus attended the conference. SPACE ODYSSEY Although China has completed many successful space exploration projects, the country's space expeditions are far from over. At the conference, Yang said that China plans to use a Long March-5 carrier rocket to launch the core module of the country's manned space station in 2019 and build a space station around 2022. With the International Space Station set to retire in 2024, the Chinese space station will offer a promising alternative, and China will be the only country with a permanent space station. China National Space Administration (CNSA) held a ceremony to recognize and thank the ESA and four countries, namely the Netherlands, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Sweden, for their participation in the Chang'e-4 lunar exploration to the far side of the moon which will be launched in 2018. Liu Jizhong, director of the CNSA's China Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center said that later this year China plans to send the Chang'e-5 lunar probe to the moon to collect samples, marking the third step in its lunar program. He said that China is looking to offer cooperation opportunities in investigating the lunar south pole region, setting up an international moon village and carrying out experiments including energy supply. Liu added that in accordance with the principle of "openness and cooperation, sharing both risks and achievements," China will create an open platform for cooperation enabling other countries to participate. COOPERATION UNDERWAY China has always advocated win-win cooperation between nations and it introduced the notion of building a community of shared destiny in late 2012. To create peaceful cooperation in outer space, China has signed agreements with over 30 countries and organizations, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Germany, France, the ESA and UNOOSA. China's contribution to the international space industry has included helping over 20 countries and regions with 50 launches, and exporting satellites to nine countries. Scientific innovation was a central topic at the recent Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, with China proposing a Belt and Road Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation Action Plan. China also voiced its willingness to carry out more projects with Belt and Road countries in various fields, including satellite launches, maritime navigation and archaeological studies to enable more countries to benefit.     | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Friday morning the cockpit will be hoisted into place with a crane and attached to the building with 20-foot steel beams in advance of the exhibit’s mid-July opening. When the exhibit is complete, children will be able to sit in the pilot’s seat and look out of the cockpit, test their own wings in a windtunnel and fly in flight simulators.

The astronaut class of 2017 includes doctors, scientists, engineers, pilots and military officers from Anchorage to Miami and points in between. They’ve worked in submarines, emergency rooms, university lecture halls, jet cockpits and battleships. They range in age from 29 to 42, and they typically have led the pack. “It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read what these folks have done,” said Nasa’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot. Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the group during a televised ceremony at Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston. He offered President Donald Trump’s congratulations and noted the president is “firmly committed to Nasa’s noble mission, leading America in space.” Pence assured the crowd that Nasa will have the resources and support necessary to continue to make history. He said he would lead a resurrected National Space Council to help set the direction of the programme. More than 18,300 people threw their hats into the space ring during a brief application period 1-½ years ago. That’s more than double the previous record of 8,000 set in 1978, when the space shuttles were close to launching. The 12 selected Wednesday will join 44 astronauts already in the Nasa corps. US astronauts have not launched from home soil since 2011, when the space shuttles were retired, thus the low head count. Americans have been hitching rides aboard Russian spacecraft in the meantime, but that could change next year. After two years of training, the newbies may end up riding commercial rockets to the International Space Station or flying beyond the moon in Nasa’s Orion spacecraft. Their ultimate destination could be Mars. Trump and Nasa in rare agreement of manned flight to Mars and beyond SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules capable of carrying astronauts to the space station and back as soon as next year. A launch engineer and senior manager for SpaceX, Robb Kulin, is among the new astronauts. He’s also worked as an ice driller in Antarctica and a commercial fisherman in Alaska. “Hopefully, one day, I actually fly on a vehicle that ... I got to design,” Kulin said. Kulin and his classmates may be in for a long wait. Some members of the class of 2009 have yet to launch. Dr Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL and specialist in emergency medicine, told reporters it “may be a little unclear” what the future holds, at least regarding what spacecraft he and his fellow astronauts might fly. “We’re just happy to be here,” he added. Jack Fischer, who was in the 2009 group, just got to the space station in April, but he said he couldn’t be happier as he showed the latest hires their “new office” in a video. “It’s a little bit cramped. The desk is kind of small. But the view. Oh, the view.” Geologist Jessica Watkins already has experienced space — vicariously — as part of the team working with Nasa’s Curiosity rover on Mars. “We intend to send her to Mars one day, folks,” Nasa Flight Operations Director Brian Kelly said in introducing Watkins. She gave a thumbs-up. This is Nasa’s 22nd group of astronauts. The first group, the original Mercury 7 astronauts, was chosen in 1959. Altogether, 350 Americans have now been selected to become astronauts. Requirements include US citizenship; degrees in science, technology, engineering or math; and at least three years of experience or 1,000 hours of piloting jets. A brief look at the elite 12: — Navy Lt Kayla Barron of Richland, Washington, a submarine-warfare officer and nuclear engineer who was among the first class of women commissioned into the submarine service and now works at the US Naval Academy. — Zena Cardman of Williamsburg, Virginia, a graduate research fellow at the National Science Foundation with a specialty in microorganisms in subsurface environments such as caves. — Air Force Lt Colonel Raja Chari of Cedar Falls, Iowa, director of the F-35 Integrated Test Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California. — Navy Lt Cmdr Matthew Dominick of Wheat Ridge, Colorado, department head for Strike Fighter Squadron 115. — Bob Hines of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a Nasa research pilot at Johnson Space Centre. — Warren “Woody” Hoburg of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. — Dr Jonny Kim of Los Angeles, a Navy lieutenant who trained as a SEAL and is completing his residency in emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. — Robb Kulin of Anchorage, Alaska, who leads the launch chief engineering group for SpaceX at Hawthorne, California. — Marine Major Jasmin Moghbeli of Baldwin, New York, who tests H-1 helicopters and serves as a quality assurance and avionics officer for Marine Operational Test Evaluation Squadron 1 in Yuma, Arizona. — Loral O’Hara of Sugar Land, Texas, a research engineer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. — Dr Francisco “Frank” Rubio of Miami, an Army major who is serving as a surgeon in Fort Carson, Colorado. — Jessica Watkins of Lafayette, Colorado, a postdoctoral fellow at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.

(BA) is in talks with United Airlines and at least four other companies as the U.S. planemaker tries to line up initial customers for its 737 Max 10 jetliner and gain ground on a fast-selling Airbus SE model, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The report said the roster of potential buyers of the largest-ever 737, which is expected to launch this month, spans the globe. Initial sales prospects include Indonesia's Lion Mentari Airlines PT, the aircraft-leasing arm of China's development bank, Jet Airways India Ltd. and Copa Holdings SA. The U.S. manufacturer is seeking a groundswell of orders to demonstrate the Max 10's market appeal and strike back at the A321neo, Airbus's largest narrow-body jet, which is capturing trans-continental routes once dominated by Boeing's out-of-production 757. The Max 10 talks aren't final and Airbus could still try to thwart the sales ahead of the Paris Air Show later this month.

The firm said the investment is targeted at facilitating the leasing of aircraft for Nigerian operators, setting up of aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul centre, spares parts, logistics and supply and other aggregated services solutions. Executive Director, SpringFountain Infrastructure Limited , Mrs Tokunbo Fagbemi who spoke at the agreement signing ceremony between Boeing Corporation and SpringFountain Infrastructure Limited said the partnership with the United States based aircraft manufacturer will also open the vista of opportunity for Nigerian operators access 200 Boeing aircraft in the next 20 years. She said Nigeria aviation has had a rocky history but has a promising future, affirming that it is time to move the industry forward and not procrastinate. According to her, “This is a major step in moving forward in “the sands of time” to play our role in repositioning Aviation in Africa through our African Aircraft Leasing Project.” “ We have therefore started this journey working with Boeing on the following; African Aircraft Leasing Company (AALC) Aircraft OEM Maintenance Repairs and Overhaul (AOMRO) African Aircraft Spares Parts Centre (AASC), Aggregated Service Solutions Provider (AASP), Our key driver is to provide platforms and systems that will reduce the Cost per Air-seat Kilometre (CASK) of our clients. She explained that “What do we ask from Government is commitment, commitment to increase primary demand for air travel. We need for government to commit today to “take” flying to the masses by making air travel affordable and convenient.” She said “ If Nigeria is to have 44 million passenger departures per annum, it will require over 100 aircrafts to meet this propensity to travel, Nigeria will need more aircrafts. To boost its international including intercontinental flight potential, the airlines have to improve in both the quality and quantity of the aircrafts. In addition, the aircrafts have to be brand new to be at par with competition within Africa at the least. “ We want to work with Government and the aviation industry to bring brand new aircraft which hopefully will bring down the cost of operations for operators and bring down the cost of airfare for passengers in Africa. We therefore call on Government to facilitate the implementation of the Yamoussoukro Declaration (YD) and the African Union Declaration 2063. The Government should work with us to make the Aircrafts’ Ambassadors to African Aviation. Also “ We cannot overemphasize for Government to create a right enabling environment for the African Aircraft Leasing Company (AALC), OEM led MRO centre, African Aircraft Spare Parts Company (AASC) and Aggregated Services Solutions provider to be able to list and trade on the NASD OTC, Nigerian Stock Exchange, Aviation Asset Backed Securities (ABS), Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates and other innovative tradeable monetary and debt instruments. She said “ Government should provide exemption from certain charges such as customs duties and grant us pioneer status, to create a one stop shop for the processing and issuance of all necessary permits and licenses. The AALC project will need fiscal support from the Government. The importation and clearing of aircraft spares will need to fall under a different customs clearance regime. We will need a special visa regime and dedicated immigration procedure for crew and workmen in the aviation industry. Airport concession fees and other charges will need to be waived or differed for these brand-new aircrafts and especially for the MRO bound aircrafts. Regarding freight, “Freight cargo handling and freight cargo handling procedure will need to be improved. Cargo clearance procedure will need to be harmonised especially for spares as domestic cargo. The Federal Government should work to align Nigeria with international standards on control and compliance with aircraft noise and fuel emission. Government should invest in aviation education, skill building and skill development capacity. Participants also charged the Government should also provide a dedicated space where the MRO could be located. The government should create a Special Economic Free Trade Zone (SEFTZ) for the MRO and the Spare Parts Company.

The Nasdaq composite outperformed, gaining 0.36 percent. The Senate Intelligence Committee released Comey's full written testimony Wednesday afternoon, at which time the major indexes traded back near session highs. Dow intraday chart (Comey testimony release time circled) © Provided by CNBCSource: FactSet "I would say everything is pretty benign here," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "The fact that we're rising here implies that the market was looking for something more damning." Comey is slated to testify in front of the committee on Thursday and answer questions, marking the first time he publically speaks since being fired from his post. Trump abruptly fired Comey last month. While Comey was FBI chief, Trump allegedly asked Comey to ease off on a probe into Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor. The Washington Post reported Tuesday night that Trump asked his top intelligence official to get Comey to back off on Flynn's investigation. "We'll get a lot of theater for sure, but the market has been able to look through the noise," said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds. "Unless we get Comey suggesting the president participated in a criminal activity, the market will look beyond that." The stock market has mostly traded sideways this week as investors hold off on making big bets ahead of Comey's testimony. Maris Ogg, president of Tower Bridge Advisors, said she does not expect a smoking gun to come up with the testimony. "I think that if he indicts Trump, he indicts himself," Ogg said. "After that, I think you have to go back to the underlying fundamentals, which have been good." Equities hit all-time highs recently as Wall Street remained undeterred by most news coming out of Washington. Some investors also believe there is still the possibility that the Trump administration will pass pro-growth policies like tax reform sometime this year. Nevertheless, traditional safe havens have appreciated in value recently. The benchmark 10-year note yield hit its lowest level since Nov. 10 on Tuesday and gold prices hovered near a seven-month high. "It's difficult to reconcile the tepid message from many of the macro barometers with the strength in equities, and we're certainly mindful of this backdrop as the market's weaker seasonal period approaches," Chris Verrone, head of technical analysis at Strategas Research Partners, said in a note Wednesday. Wall Street also looked ahead to a general election in the United Kingdom, with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party expected to win. However, recent opinion polls show the Conservative's lead narrowing. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank is set to release its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. While interest rates are expected to remain unchanged, the central bank may cut its inflation forecasts. The euro traded 0.2 percent lower against the dollar at $1.1254. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency's performance against six major currencies, traded 0.13 percent higher at 96.75.

A retired Boeing engineer, Pegues has been in a series of court cases with the Shamrock Homeowners Association beginning in 2012. He contends the homeowners’ association covenant that requires dues that began at $50 a month, is only valid if the association establishes “common property” for the neighborhood. Specifically, he argues, a pool and office that haven’t been built. The dispute also includes a complex disagreement about property adjacent to Pegues property and what he was allowed to do with it. After three rounds of lawsuits filed against Pegues, he had succeeded in not having to pay back dues to the association, but was also ordered to pay dues going forward. Another lawsuit filed by the association in 2014 had a different outcome. The association won the case and Pegues was ordered to pay just over $3,000 in dues, interest and fees and $10,000 in attorney’s fees. He appealed, but lost the appeal last year. The homeowner’s association moved to have the judgment paid. It obtained a writ, showing the final judgment, from the Madison County Clerk of Court that was then given to the sheriff’s office. The sheriff began the process of advertising the house for auction, putting a notice in Speaking Out News for three weeks. The association’s attorney Jonathan Watson said Pegues had been informed at each step what was happening to collect the judgment. Pegues said he was shocked when he was notified there was an effort to sell his house. Court records show there was an auction at the courthouse in April and Watson was the only bidder with a $500 bid. Pegues was notified by letter in May that he had 10 days to vacate the property. He owns the house outright, but with the $13,000 judgment unpaid, he had to leave his home in order to preserve his rights to redeem the property. Basically, he has to pay to the outstanding judgment against him in order to return to his home. But Pegues also says the fight isn’t over, he said he’ll settle the judgment and then look at other legal moves. Watson issued a statement to WHNT News 19 on the matter Wednesday: "A lawsuit was filed in 2014, as Mr. Pegues had refused to honor his contractual obligations to the HOA. Every member of the HOA is required, per the Restrictive Covenants, to pay assessment fees and to observe building restrictions. Mr. Pegues did not abide by these terms. “The Association won the lawsuit and acquired a judgment against Mr. Pegues. Mr. Pegues appealed and lost. He has refused to pay and satisfy this judgment. As such, the Association has taken lawful and reasonable action to recover the judgment against Mr. Pegues.  He has been informed and has received notice throughout each stage of this process. He has nonetheless refused to act. “The current situation is the complete result of Mr. Pegues's failure to act. The Association will continue to pursue its rights under the law and pursuant to the restrictive covenants on behalf of its members."       Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular 1 dead, multiple people injured in Madison County church bus crash outside Atlanta Man dies in Florence police custody; investigation underway Sheriff: Disgruntled ex-worker killed 5, then himself Latest News Family identifies church bus crash victim as 17-year-old Sarah Harmening Emotional congregation members react to Mt.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print As someone who believes climate change is a moral issue, I’m appalled at President Trump’s announcement that he is pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. It’s particularly disturbing coming just days after his meeting with the Pope, who has stressed repeatedly that climate change is “one of the principal challenges facing humanity today.” The Pope also noted how it has a particularly devastating impact on the poor. All of us who read The Blade and watch the news are deeply aware of the turbulent effects of climate change, including melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and devastating storms. Scientists blame these frightening events, at least partly, on global warming. Our own experience over the past several summers, as well as carefully documented statistics, indicates an ongoing rise in temperature that doesn’t seem likely to reverse itself. Mr. Trump has abdicated his responsibility here. Let’s urge Rep. Bob Latta (R., Bowling Green) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) to provide leadership in reducing carbon emissions in Ohio, ensure a careful transition to renewable energy, and prepare workers for the new jobs in this area. PATRICIA SCHNAPP Homerdale Avenue   Click here to submit a letter to the editor   Incivility caused by the liberals A June 4 editorial bemoaned the lack of civility in today's America (“On the restoration of civility”). At one point, Republicans were criticized for not having the courage to meet the people of their districts in town hall meetings. Liberals were then praised for their efforts to host these types of sessions, but always before friendly crowds. When a conservative attempts to hold a similar event, hecklers show up to try to disrupt things. So, who is causing the lack of civility? BEN LESNIEWSKI Maumee   Hussain column lacking facts In his June 5 column, Dr. S. Amjad Hussain stated that the Trump Administration approved a deal with Iran so that Boeing could sell commercial aircraft to them (“Trump Administration should be careful when siding with the Saudis”). That deal was approved in September, 2016, by the Treasury Department under the Obama Administration. He also stated that the Trump Administration lifted sanctions against Iran. From what I have read, President Trump has put new sanctions in place against Iran and other countries who do business with them. Mr. Hussain fails to mention that President Obama paid a ransom of $400 million to release hostages and gave Iran $1.3 billion in funds that were frozen. Mr. Hussain also made fun of President Trump’s sword-dancing ceremony but seems to have forgotten that President Barack Obama bowed to the Saudi king, which is a sign of weakness. BONNIE NEWMAN Swanton   Where are the honorable pols? From George Washington’s “I cannot tell a lie” to Honest Abe Lincoln, to Bill Clinton’s “I did not have sexual relations with that woman,” to this. My, my it is very sad, isn’t it?

The $244 million test of the rocket by Orbital ATK Inc. and the  Raytheon Corp.“hit-to-kill” warhead it released “mimicked that of an actual operational scenario,” Army Lieutenant Colonel Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for the Defense Department testing office, said in a statement. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up The testing office’s assessment bolstered statements from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency that the $36 billion system of radar, command links and ground-based interceptors can defeat any long-range threat that North Korea or Iran can develop through 2020. The interceptor, launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, crashed into the mock ICBM fired from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The test employed precision tracking “in an operationally realistic way to guide the interceptor to the target,” Cabiness said, while acknowledging that the incoming missile was accompanied only by simple decoys to throw the interceptor off course. The Pentagon says this video shows a ground-based interceptor destroying a mock missile on May 30. (Source: Bloomberg) The conclusions were reached by David Duma, a career professional who’s acting director of the test office, where he’s worked since 2002. The launch of the ground-based interceptor last week was the first since a test that the Missile Defense Agency called a success in June 2014 -- after two that failed in 2010. The tests have been criticized as scripted and artificial by arms-control experts. “What I think it showed is that they’re on the right track in the fixes to this kill vehicle” but it didn’t prove a “realistic capability,” Laura Grego, senior scientist for the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an interview after last week’s test. “A real adversary would try to confuse you as much as possible” by launching at night, perhaps in the rain and with a barrage of decoys. ‘Demonstrated Capability’ Duma’s office concluded that the system now “has demonstrated capability to defend the U.S. homeland from a small number” of ICBM threats protected by “simple countermeasures” when the U.S. “employs its full sensors/command-and-control architecture,” Cabiness said. That’s an upgrade from the office’s finding in 2012 that the system of interceptors -- managed by Boeing Co. and linked by a command-and-control network from Northrop Grumman Corp. -- had a “limited capability” to defend against a small number of ICBMs. The test also verified that successful corrections were made to the latest version of the interceptor after past quality flaws, according to Duma’s office. Vice Admiral James Syring, director of the Missile Defense Agency, told a House Armed Services subcommittee on Wednesday that the interceptor obliterated the mock ICBM in “an exact replica of the scenario that this country would face if North Korea were to fire a ballistic missile against the United States.” But Syring said he still has “reliability concerns with the system that have been systematically addressed in large part over the last, I’ll say, six years, bit-by-bit. It’s not just the interceptor, it’s the entire system. We’re not there yet.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The astronaut class of 2017 includes doctors, scientists, engineers, pilots and military officers from Anchorage to Miami and points in between. They’ve worked in submarines, emergency rooms, university lecture halls, jet cockpits and battleships. They range in age from 29 to 42, and they typically have led the pack.

Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the group during a televised ceremony at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. He offered President Donald Trump’s congratulations and noted that the president is “firmly committed to NASA’s noble mission, leading America in space.” Pence assured the crowd that NASA will have the resources and support necessary to continue to make history. He said he would lead a resurrected National Space Council to help set the direction of the program. Under Trump, “America will lead in space once again, and the world will marvel,” Pence said. More than 18,300 people threw their hats into the space ring during a brief application period 1½ years ago. That’s more than double the previous record of 8,000 set in 1978, when the space shuttles were close to launching. The 12 selected Wednesday will join 44 astronauts already in the NASA corps. U.S. astronauts have not launched from home soil since 2011, when the space shuttles were retired, thus the low head count. Americans have been hitching rides aboard Russian spacecraft in the meantime, but that could change next year. After two years of training, the newbies may end up riding commercial rockets to the International Space Station or flying beyond the moon in NASA’s Orion spacecraft. Their ultimate destination could be Mars. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules capable of carrying astronauts to the space station and back as soon as next year. A launch engineer and senior manager for SpaceX, Robb Kulin, is among the new astronauts. He’s also worked as an ice driller in Antarctica and a commercial fisherman in Alaska. “Hopefully, one day, I actually fly on a vehicle that … I got to design,” Kulin said. Kulin and his classmates may be in for a long wait. Some members of the class of 2009 have yet to launch. Dr. Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL and specialist in emergency medicine, told reporters it “may be a little unclear” what the future holds, at least regarding what spacecraft he and his fellow astronauts might fly. “We’re just happy to be here,” he added. Jack Fischer, who was in the 2009 group, just got to the space station in April, but he said he couldn’t be happier as he showed the latest hires their “new office” in a video. “It’s a little bit cramped. The desk is kind of small. But the view. Oh, the view.” Geologist Jessica Watkins already has experienced space — vicariously — as part of the team working with NASA’s Curiosity rover on Mars. “We intend to send her to Mars one day, folks,” NASA Flight Operations Director Brian Kelly said in introducing Watkins. She gave a thumbs-up. This is NASA’s 22nd group of astronauts. The first group, the original Mercury 7 astronauts, was chosen in 1959. Altogether, 350 Americans have now been selected to become astronauts. Requirements include U.S. citizenship; degrees in science, technology, engineering or math; and at least three years of experience or 1,000 hours of piloting jets. 17446946 Share this story By Marcia DunnThe Associated Press More from Nation Today in history, and birthdays May’s election gamble appears to backfire United Nations says Islamic State has killed hundreds of civilians in Mosul A group of cancer doctors plans to reduce patients’ drug costs, without touching prices Comey testimony grips the nation Comment on this story Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Get top headlines daily Submit This image is copyrighted.

On Point The Pentagon's Air and Sea Lift Deficit by Austin Bay May 10, 2017 On May 2, U.S. Transportation Command commander Air Force General Darren McDew told the Senate Armed Services Committee that America doesn't have enough supply ships, transport planes and tanker planes to move a large combat force to a distant battlefield (like Korea) and sustain that force. To win a war, warriors and weapons must reach the battlefield and soldiers and machines must be supplied. General McDew told committee chairman Senator John McCain that the U.S. can airlift only one brigade combat team from the U.S. to a theater of operations such as Korea. Flying one brigade combat team would require the USAF to "surge" every large jet transport in its inventory. McCain said he doubted "there's a conflict in Korea for which one brigade combat team would be sufficient." That's an understatement. McDew said airlifting an "initial" brigade (to Korea as a rapid reinforcement) would take around 200 C-17s. McDew agreed that supplying the brigade while delivering more units would be very difficult. He deftly acknowledged America might lose some transports to enemy action. The U.S. has around 220 C-17 Globemaster IIIs and some 50 modernized C-5 Galaxies. Both jets can carry the M1 Abrams tank. However, the best way to move a heavy armor unit (versus a single tank) is on the fast "roll on-roll off" sea ships operated by the Military Sealift Command. McCain said the Pentagon needs the MSC's organic "surge sealift fleet" for rapid response operations. MSC currently has 27 vessels. The senator estimated it needs ten more to meet minimum requirements. But hauling the vehicles requires seaworthy ships. On average, MSC ships are 39 years old and poorly maintained. A recent report rated fewer than 60 percent as "ready" for service. Why? Over the last decade, in order to pay for operations, the Pentagon has reduced maintenance funds. The sealift ships aren't the only equipment that has degraded due to limited maintenance. During the hearing, McCain lamented that "A look at sealift...reveals the same downward spiral we've seen elsewhere in the military: budget cuts mean fewer new ships, existing ships get older, maintenance gets more expensive and more difficult, readiness suffers, and more money is siphoned from future modernization to pay for current readiness." McCain has argued the situation must improve or America will not have the capacity to a Korea-type crisis respond in time and with an effective military force. McDew and McCain also discussed cyber threats. TRANSCOM operates with commercial logistics, supply and communications services and their information networks are vulnerable to enemy cyber attacks. Cyber attacks can seriously damage the U.S. logistics system. McDew said he thinks the USAF will need more KC-46 Pegasus tanker planes to support global operations. Congress will have to find the money. The big C-17 and C-5 transports are the fastest way to deliver military forces. However, there aren't enough of them to sustain a fight. The C-5s are old. The last C-5 was built in the 1980s. Boeing built its last C-17 in late 2015. Many people thought ending C-17 production was foolish. The plane has admirers around the globe, and not just in military circles. It can land on primitive airfields and has earned a stellar reputation for delivering aid in natural disasters and humanitarian crises. Would Congress be willing to fund more? That is not a likely prospect, unless more international buyers appear. There are reports of renewed international interest. Several nations fly C-17s, including India, Australia, Canada, Qatar and Britain. Note McDew and McCain mulled the combat loss of U.S. strategic transports. U.S. adversaries have developed extended range anti-air defenses, and that is evident in Asia. Replacing C-17 combat losses requires a "reserve" of some size. If the U.S. "pivot" to Asia is for real, America and its allies will need more C-17s.

In fact, it is the opposite — an abundance of choreographed, hectic activity during a “getaway day” contest, with two teams on the move upon the final out. The point man for making sure everybody — visiting team and umpires included — gets out of town as smoothly as possible is Ryan Maxwell, the fourth-year Isotopes clubhouse manager, whose duties extend way beyond managing the two clubhouses. Maxwell is also travel coordinator and gets rave reviews for doing that. “His professionalism doesn’t go unnoticed by me or the (Pacific Coast League),” said Isotopes general manager John Traub. Advertisement Continue reading “He’s very good at what he does,” added Isotopes play-by-play announcer Josh Suchon, who called Maxwell’s gig “a thankless job.” While groundskeepers prepped the field Thursday morning for what would be a difficult 5-4 Isotopes loss to the visiting El Paso Chihuahuas, Maxwell went to the Sunport to procure 33 boarding passes for the Isotopes’ next destination, Salt Lake City. By game’s end, he’d oversee five employees working on loading of El Paso’s equipment onto a bus — including the “wet packing” of dirty uniforms so the Chihuahuas could get on the road quickly. He’d oversee the packing of some 100 bags for the Isotopes’ traveling party — keep individual bags at 50 pounds or fewer please — to load on a truck traveling overnight to Smith’s Ballpark, where the ‘Topes play tonight. It’s days like this, Maxwell says, when his diet staples are “Red Bull. And coffee.” A spring training ritual for the Isotopes team likely to break camp includes Traub standing before the players and warn them that the travel “will suck” — though early starts like Thursday’s for a homestand finale mercifully allow a more leisurely start to the road trip. It’s not always that way. “The lore of the PCL,” said Isotopes veteran right-hander Thad Weber, “is the 3:30 (a.m.) bus to the airport for the 5:30 flight across the country to play that night. It’s very taxing.” And a far cry from much of what pro baseball players experience at any other level. Travel in the majors, with chartered flights, bag-handlers, the privilege of bypassing airport security and going right to the plane, is in a league of its own. Lower-level minor leagues, meanwhile, travel almost exclusively by bus to nearby destinations. Younger players coming to Triple-A at first may be excited for air travel until those 3 a.m. wakeup calls. Weber, for one, prefers the comforts of a sleeper bus on an overnight trip to a 5:30 a.m. flight out. “You can get somewhere at 6 or 7 in the morning having slept the whole night,” he said. Advertisement Continue reading The Isotopes can travel by bus to PCL cities Colorado Springs, Oklahoma City and El Paso, depending on what Traub and manager Glenallen Hill decide. They also sometimes travel by bus between road-trip cities — Nashville and Memphis as an example. The PCL model for travel is that the home team designee handles the in-and-out of each visiting team as well. On Sunday, Maxwell was working in the Isotopes clubhouse until about midnight after the series finale vs. Sacramento that started at 6 p.m. At 3:30 a.m. Monday, he would have to meet the local company charged with getting Sacramento’s equipment to the airport. Rather than try to sleep in the clubhouse, he took the half-hour drive to Rio Rancho, napped for 90 minutes, showered and came back. He waited until El Paso’s equipment showed up in the pre-dawn hours, then went back home for another 90-minute nap. Then, back to the clubhouse by 10:30 a.m. to begin his usual routine as another home series began. “That day,” Maxwell admitted, “was rough.” There are trends that have developed for the Isotopes and their unique travel needs. For one, they fly Southwest “70 to 80 percent of the time,” Traub said, because of the airline’s standard fleet of Boeing 737s, which more easily handle equipment and larger travel parties, and its more convenient schedule out of the Sunport. The flip side is that Thursday’s 7 p.m. Southwest departure out of Albuquerque didn’t get the team directly to Salt Lake City, unlike Delta would. It first had to fly a leg to Los Angeles. Another trend is that the Isotopes will truck their baseball equipment overnight to the next destination whenever possible. A truck and two drivers were to make the overnight haul today to Utah. The advantage is that anything that doesn’t need to go through an airport is a plus. Suchon said occasionally, the Isotopes and a team they just finished playing will end up on the same first-leg flight to Denver, or Dallas or Phoenix. And then, “you just really hope and pray that the baggage handlers make sure all the equipment goes to the right place,” said Suchon. For a truck, the main worry is a breakdown on the side of the road. With that, Maxwell and Traub and Co.’s worries are much the same as would be any other commercial traveler’s — multiplied by the number of travelers and the accompanying baggage. One Isotopes road trip in a recent year was to begin at Round Rock, which meant a flight from Albuquerque to Dallas, another to Austin, Texas, and short bus ride. But the flight to Dallas got canceled, and alternate arrangements got the team to Houston. From there, Isotopes management decided to fork over $15,000 to find a last-minute charter to get to Round Rock. “And then after one inning,” said Traub, a deluge came and the game was rained out.

This is an event that the aerospace world attends, one which private companies and governments both employ as a stage to showcase some of their best products and impressive capabilities. European companies, in particular, are fond of using the Paris Air Show to launch major new platforms. In addition, it has become quite common for aircraft manufacturers to announce major sales during the show. Historically, the biennial Paris Air Show has provided a snapshot of the state of aerospace industries around the world. Particularly during the Cold War but even afterwards in times of increased international tensions, the major military powers used this venue to send messages regarding their abilities in the air and space domains. This year is likely to be no different. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the U.S. Air Force, after some initial hesitancy, decided to allow two F-35A Joint Strike Fighters (JSF) to conduct a flight demonstration at the show. This is not the first time that U.S. F-35s have appeared in European air space. The Marine Corp’ F-35B, the short takeoff and vertical landing variant, participated in the 2016 Farnborough International Airshow. Earlier this year, eight F-35As conducted the first joint training deployment in the United Kingdom. These aircraft also made politically-important visits to both Estonia and Bulgaria. Nevertheless, this planned F-35A flight demonstration is important on several levels. It is part of a concerted effort by the U.S. government to underscore its commitment to the security of Europe. It sends a message to friends and foes that the U.S. military leads the world in the development and deployment of fifth-generation aircraft. Visits to the United Kingdom and France also serve as reminders that the JSF is an international fighter and that seven NATO members invested their money in the program. In fact, these allies are planning to acquire several hundred F-35s. Finally, the flight demonstration will underscore the fact that virtually all of the JSF’s “teething” problems are behind it. The F-35 will not be going to Le Bourget alone. The Department of Defense will send many of its top-of-the-line aircraft and helicopters to Paris including the P-8A anti-submarine aircraft, the C-130J transport, the V-22 Osprey, AH-64 Apache and the CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter. These are among the best military aircraft in the world which is reflected in the continuing demand for them by friends and allies. In addition, the Textron/Airland team is sending its Scorpion, a light attack/intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance jet aircraft, to Le Bourget. On the commercial side, Boeing is sending both its 737 MAX 9 and 787-10 Dreamliner flight test airplanes along with enhanced versions of its popular aircraft to the air show. Other U.S. companies that will provide display versions of their products include Gulfstream and Bell Helicopters. Even the appearance at Le Bourget of non-U.S. commercial aircraft can say something important about the state of this country’s aerospace industry. The Canadian Company Bombardier, which debuts its C Series passenger jet at the 2015 air show, will be back looking for additional sales. Embraer, Brazil’s major aircraft producer, used the last air show to unveil its E-Jet E2 family of narrow-body, medium range commercial aircraft. It is reported that this year Airbus will publically fly for the first time its new A321neo, one of several variants in the family. What these aircraft programs have in common is that they all are powered by Pratt & Whitney’s advanced geared turbofan engine (GTF). The GTF also is on A320neos operated by numerous airlines and will power hundreds more that are on order. This engine provides a substantial improvement over those presently in service in terms of fuel use, noise level, emissions and operating costs. The GTF has experienced some problems with respect to the reliability of specific components. Pratt & Whitney is taking steps to deal with these issues, which are not uncommon for new aviation products. Given the company’s past successes in troubleshooting its products, including its development of a rapid solution to a fan blade rubbing problem with the F-35’s engine, it is likely that GTF’s problems will be solved. Like the 51 air shows that have come before, the 2017 event will be a testament to the technological progress that continues to be made in the aerospace sector. It also will speak to the importance of the U.S. and its allies continuing to invest in aerospace capabilities that will ensure its military superiority over any potential adversaries.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News U.S. Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air North Korea Hawaii's X-band radar vindicated by successful missile intercept, military says By Malia Zimmerman Published June 08, 2017 Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Email Print   An odd-looking, colossal contraption located near Pearl Harbor has been generating praise ever since it successfully intercepted a test-fired missile, and helped demonstrate the U.S. can handle whatever North Korea tries to send its way. In the days since America's Missile Defense Agency (MDA) took out the missile fired at the West Coast from a Pacific Ocean island, people outside of Oahu are getting a peek at what looks like a giant white golf ball atop a football field-sized nine-story oil rig platform near Pearl Harbor. Officially called the Sea-based X-band radar, or SBX, the $2.2 billion, 50,000-ton radar is a key part of the nation’s defense against North Korea - or any other hostile nation with an intercontinental ballistic missile. Though the radar system has been criticized in media reports for being costly and ineffective, it performed flawlessly during the May 30 live missile test, the first test of its kind, during which the MDA’s ground-based defense system successfully intercepted an ICBM. “SBX performed exactly as designed during this test,” said Chris Johnson, the MDA’s director of public affairs. “The radar identified the target missile, developed a projected track, discriminated lethal from nonlethal objects, and provided that data to the command and control system, which is exactly how it would perform during an actual scenario.” The SBX, a key component of missile defense in the Pacific region, hasn’t always garnered so much praise. The multibillion dollar project was deemed a “flop” by the LA Times in a 2015 special report. “Although it can powerfully magnify distant objects, its field of vision is so narrow that it would be of little use against what experts consider the likeliest attack: a stream of missiles interspersed with decoys,” the LA Times report claimed. The LA Times said the project “not only wasted taxpayer money, but left a hole in the nation’s defenses.” While not addressing the specific criticisms, Johnson said a number of improvements have been made to SBX. “Since 2015, the platform itself has received hull, mechanical and electrical modifications to extend its service life -- like any other ship -- and SBX is available to support a wide range of operations,” Johnson said. The LA Times also claimed the SBX spends most of its time “mothballed” in Pearl Harbor. While Johnson said his agency does not comment on the SBX’s deployment schedule, U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, said the SBX is in high demand by the U.S. military and is particularly important to defend Hawaii, which could be hit within 20 minutes of a North Korean missile launch. “There is no serious argument that we don’t need SBX to assist in the ballistic missile defense of Hawaii,” Rogers said.  While the SBX has some drawbacks, mainly operational costs and vulnerability to attack, said Michaela Dodge, a policy analyst for defense and strategic policy at the Heritage Foundation’s Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, the radar “is an incredible capability” that gives the U.S. defensive flexibility. “The sea-based SBX serves an important mission, providing U.S. interceptors more granular data than available from some other types of sensors we use,” said Dodge, who specializes in missile defense, nuclear weapons modernization and arms control. “It also has a signaling value both for deterrence of adversaries and assurance of allies.” Constructed on a self-propelled, ocean-going, semi-submersible platform with two hulls, the vessel is stable in high winds and turbulent sea conditions, the MDA said. Developed by Raytheon in partnership with Boeing, the SBX also has been extensively tested in sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. “The radar’s ability to be positioned wherever it is most needed to support missile defense testing and defensive operations has proven to be an excellent capability, and it will provide a highly capable sensor for target tracking and discrimination for many years to come,” Johnson said. During the successful May 30 test, Johnson said an ICBM was launched from an atoll in the Marshall Islands, while a ground-based interceptor was sent from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to intercept and destroy the target “in a direct collision.” "This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” MDA Director Vice Adm. Jim Syring said in a statement. “I am incredibly proud of the warfighters who executed this test and who operate this system every day."     Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

That puts them on a downward spiral.” In these situations, your savings can be a crucial buffer. But banks typically pay their highest interest rate to the depositors that give them the most money, upwards of $100,000, “That makes it hard to motivate people living paycheck-to-paycheck to put money in a savings accounts, especially with the low interest rate environment we’ve been in.” (He cites a report that found 43% of Americans can’t afford a $400 emergency expense.) So Porter and BECU have flipped that model, “We pay our highest interest rate on the first $500 in deposit from our members, whether it’s kids or adults, to show them the benefit of savings.” The 6% interest rate that BECU offers is incredibly rare in today’s historically low interest rates, and it incentivizes its members to start saving. Last year, the credit union returned $174 million to its members (or $180 per member) in the form of better rates and lower fees, Porter points out. He credits the innovation with making them the “preferred piggy bank for kids in the Puget Sound because we have over 90,000 of these early saver accounts, and I think it’s popular with parents and the kids because they actually can see their money grow.” The credit union, which began as an institution for Boeing’s employees and their families, has since expanded its membership to those who live and work in Washington state (changing their name from Boeing Employees’ Credit Union to BECU in 2004 to better reflect their membership). Under Porter’s leadership, BECU has also applied the same customer focused thinking to its lending products. “When our members make good financial decisions over the year and their credit score improves, we automatically lower the interest rate on their consumer loans.” As part of a program, which is unique to BECU, he reports that last year the credit union’s 40,000 members “saw an automatic decrease in their interest rate that saved them $2.7 million dollars in interest charges.” In many ways, BECU’s approach is summed up in its tagline, “more than just money” which is directly counter to how big banks operate. Unlike most large banks that no longer hold their own mortgages, selling them into the secondary market (trading activity in that market turned out to be a major reason for the financial collapse in 2008), he says, “we hold many of our mortgages in portfolio which gives us almost complete ability to modify a loan. The difference for BECU is that we own it, we hold the servicing and so we’re able to make that decision.” Its keen focus on listening to its customers explains why the credit union has grown to more than 1 million members, to become the fourth largest in the U.S. They are driving innovation in the financial services industry in large part by doing so, and uncovering new opportunities to develop some of their most successful products. “Our metrics are not at all related to financial return.” [Photo: courtesy BECU] Relationships, Not Returns “Banks struggle to serve because their focus is on profit,” says Porter. “Community banking allows them to not treat people as just numbers.” Unlike a bank, a credit union is a member organization and its owners are also its customers. This avoids the conflict that banks face in meeting the needs of their customers versus its shareholders. Porter says he has only one boss–his customers, and that informs how the credit union measures its performance. advertisement “Our metrics are not at all related to financial return,” he says. “All of our employees across our organization have member experience as part of their performance goals. This makes us different from for-profit banks that look to sell more products to their customers each year. We don’t look at it that way.” Instead, BECU uses the net promoter score to measure their success. It’s a measure, now used widely in the market, that simply asks customers if they would refer a friend or family member to their business. Porter says BECU’s score is more than double the banking average; 35% of BECU’s customers report they would refer it to their friends. For Porter, it is important as CEO to really get out and meet members. Every month he personally reaches out to “our members who are first time home buyers or are celebrating a long term anniversary as a member of the credit union, and I’ll give them a call.” Though he admits many of these calls end up in voicemail, he shares a time when he reached a young woman’s cell phone. “She happened to be at Home Depot in the process of buying paint, to go paint a wall in a new condo, that she’d just purchased with a loan from us. It was just great. I mean, she was so happy.” “Can you still have the same culture, the same employee experience as you grow?” [Photo: courtesy BECU] CEO As Chief Culture Officer Porter invests similar time with his employees understanding and building empathy for the work they do. “I go to the contact center, sit down with one of our customer service reps, and listen to calls. When you sit in their shoes and see all the screens they have to go through in order to serve our members… it’s helped lead us to new initiatives as we try to improve those experiences.” BECU also hosts an annual meeting with their members, which is billed as their “members’ summit”, where members can sign-up to educate themselves on topics like retirement planning or buying their first home, and members can also ask BECU’s executive team their questions on any topic. While Porter says he is confident their “members love BECU.” He still wonders “if we will lose the magic sauce as we grow. Can you still have the same culture, the same employee experience as you grow?” As a result, he views his role as the credit union’s chief culture officer to keep their community focused culture alive. This more than anything else informs his leadership approach including the hiring decisions they make as they grow, “The vast majority of people we hire to BECU come from other service organizations because we want to target people who like serving. We generally don’t hire people from other financial institutions unless it’s a particular skill set gap that we’re trying to fill. We generally hire from great service organizations like Nordstrom’s and Starbucks and others, and we’re fortunate to have so many of these organizations, here in the northwest, that we can find talent from.” advertisement Cash-Free Branches BECU has relatively few physical branches and the majority have no money on site. Instead of tellers, its neighborhood financial centers have member consultants who provide one-on-one support for opening accounts and lending services. This was the result of a major push to invest in ATMs, online, and mobile banking, after Porter came on board as CEO. He says, “People want to be able to bank wherever they are 24/7.” Porter recalls being so excited when the credit union rolled out its new mobile application. “We had done everything. And I thought this is going to be great.” But the product was not as well received by their members, “It was in the app store rated two stars.” So he began to engage with his members to get their input and turn it around, and discovered that they had let the technology lead the way instead of designing the app to their members’ needs. For Porter, this was an important reminder of the value of listening to their customers, “We don’t want to lead them farther than they want to go. And sometimes technology will do that to you.” The feedback led to nine releases over the next 12 months. As a result, “It’s now a five-star-rated app, one of the top in the app stores for any bank in the country, and to us it’s the example we use around here, to go where the puck is going to go–but then we also listen to our members to make sure we do it in a way that they appreciate.” Porter says he has only one boss–his customers, and that informs how the credit union measures its performance. [Photo: courtesy BECU] Importance of Storytelling For Porter, the culture and success of BECU lies in stories. “We can share facts and figures about our performance and growth, but I don’t think they reflect our values like a story does.” He is regularly telling stories and soliciting them from both his employees and their members. “I think the story we probably tell the most is about how BECU came into being.” The credit union was founded by 18 Boeing employees, during the Great Depression when Boeing didn’t supply the tools that new workers needed. At the time small consumer loans weren’t available. “There really wasn’t a source for folks to be able to go out and buy these tools. These eighteen workers had the foresight, after reading an article in the Reader’s Digest about a new cooperative lending concept. They put in 50 cents each, so they had a credit union with assets of nine dollars. Their first loan was a $2.50 tool loan. That’s how we got started. BECU was basically a tool lending cooperative.” “It’s good to keep reminding people of why were we formed to exist and what we are really about,” he says. “It was people helping people.” That philosophy guides BECU to this day. This article is part of a series of articles by Aaron Hurst exploring how leaders find purpose and meaning in their jobs. Last fall, Hurst’s company, Imperative, released a global survey of the role of purpose at work, in partnership with LinkedIn Talent Solutions, which found that those who are intrinsically motivated to find purpose in their jobs consistently outperform their colleagues and experience greater levels of job satisfaction and well-being, regardless of country, gender, or ethnicity. They are also 50% more likely to be leaders. This series will profile those leaders, and how they connect with what’s meaningful to them in their role and the organizations they lead. About the author Aaron Hurst is a globally recognized social entrepreneur and authority of social innovation.

Ujal Singh Bhatia, chairman of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization, said he and his six fellow appeals judges were already dealing with five big appeals and five more were likely to land in their laps in the next six months. "By the end of the year, if all five of the projected appeals materialise, there will be further delays of several months in fully staffing and taking up these appeals," Bhatia told an audience at the WTO in Geneva. "This problem cannot be expected to go away by itself." The WTO is run by its 164 members, and any change to its rules or working practices needs to be agreed unanimously. Even the smallest tweak to the rules can be contentious. Reform of the WTO's dispute settlement rules has been on the table for years, but there is no sign of progress. Bhatia said the rules were set up to ensure prompt resolution of disputes, because "in the world of commerce, time really is money". But in recent years, the system had "substantially ceded ground on this", he added. More disputes were now being appealed, especially the more complicated ones, and more cases went on to a second stage where the parties argued over whether or not the defendant had complied with the original ruling, he said. The largest WTO cases include a dispute between the European Union and the United States over funding for aircraft giants Boeing and Airbus, and a four-country attempt to stop Australia's stringent anti-tobacco laws. Recent appeals have covered diverse areas of trade law, including environmental protection, renewable energy subsidies, tax evasion, money laundering, patent protection, food safety, animal welfare, consumer information and more, Bhatia said. During the tobacco dispute, Australia complained that the countries that brought the litigation were deliberately holding up proceedings to discourage other countries from introducing similar anti-tobacco legislation. "To the extent that delays in dispute resolution involve delays in the assertion of the rule of law, they provide an incentive to those who benefit from those delays," Bhatia said. He added that slow resolution of disputes would encourage member countries to "look for other solutions, potentially elsewhere".

Initiated this past March through a Department of Labor grant, Portland’s Urban League is one of seven affiliates of the national organization that is facilitating the program.   The tech jobs project was created to bridge the gap between a pool of long-term unemployed individuals and a booming industry that offers sustainable employment. In fact, jobs in STEM – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – have among the highest earnings projections and job growth, while holding the lowest unemployment rate over other industries. With the first cohort underway, the Urban League’s second cohort will begin accepting applications on July 31 for a September 25 start date. The program is hosting an open information session on July 18. Over the course of three separate cohorts running through 2019, the accelerated technology training program will have served some 95 people.  Having already completed job readiness workshops – in partnership with the Leadership Lab – the program’s first 32 participants are currently enrolled in tech courses. With classes offered by Creating IT Futures Foundation, participants can choose between Microsoft, CompTIA and Cisco certifications, before embarking on a paid on-the-job training with a local company. Some positions also carry the possibility of full-time hire. “We found that the local tech community is very supportive of the program,” said Urban Tech Jobs Team Leader, Andrea Gall. “As we start getting more name recognition, we’ll start finding more employers that are interested in specifically pulling candidates out of our pool, which is the ideal situation.”   Gaining the confidence To be eligible for UTJP, a person must be unemployed or under-employed, have a high school diploma or GED, and be 18 years or older. Forty-seven percent of participants in the first cohort are African American; and overall, 41 percent are women and 59 percent are men. While every participant comes to the table with a varying level of education and tech expertise, some enter the program with little to no background in the field. Yet part of UTJP’s goal is to help participants identify their transferable skills and pivot them from their past experience towards a new career path; for example, a retail background could lead to a customer care position at a software company. “It’s a stellar business model for people who are changing their career fields or have an interest in the tech world,” said participant Jerome Smith, who previously served in the air force. After the recession hit, Smith – a father of five – lost his job and found himself living in his car. Through an assistance program for veterans, he learned about UTJP and enrolled in the nick of time.  “The confidence I’ve gained in just four weeks – to be able to know what I’m doing with computers – it really increased my value,” Smith told The Skanner. He’s now living in a veterans’ family shelter in Beaverton, with part-time employment in private security, and has aspirations to work for Boeing in the field of cyber security.   Wraparound services In addition to UTJP’s flagship tech training, the Urban League offers supplemental programs that are unique to the organization, such as healthcare and housing assistance. The result is a wraparound services program that reaches beyond workforce development. “A part of our population that we serve in this program is people that have a legal history,” explained Cinna’Mon Williams, career and life coach for UTJP, who recruits participants to the program. “We work with people on how to write their resumes in a way that they’re transparent,” continued Williams. “We teach them how to interview and disclose. And personally, I help people work through the mental aspect of transitioning and recovering from mistakes in their past.” After soft skills and tech training is complete, Williams provides support to participants six months into their full-time employment.   Potential careers According to the Department of Commerce, employees of STEM jobs earn 26 percent more than from non-STEM jobs; and between 2008 and 2018, job openings in those sectors are expected to increase by 17 percent. Through UTJP, graduates could qualify for careers in network administration, IT support, software development, IT security, 3D modeling, and project managing. “Getting your foot in the door in a field that has upward potential is something we take very seriously,” said Gall. “This isn’t a quick fix program – it’s more long-term to bring you to that next level in your skillset.”   about-the-Urban-League-of-Portland homepagefeature about-STEM Melanie Sevcenko tech-jobs Urban-Tech-Jobs-Program Details Recently Published by The Skanner News Default Title Date Random +Read More Comey Says He Was Fired Because of Russia Investigation Comey also accused the Trump administration of spreading "lies, plain and simple" about him and the FBIRead More +Read More Urban League Offers Tech Job Training for Under-Employed Adults Program includes soft skills, tech certifications and on-the-job trainingRead More +Read More All-Black Paratroopers Recognized with Oregon Historical Marker The secret history of the Triple Nickles is commemorated at the Siskiyou Smokejumper MuseumRead More +Read More Rev.

Ujal Singh Bhatia, chairman of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization, said he and his six fellow appeals judges were already dealing with five big appeals and five more were likely to land in their laps in the next six months. "By the end of the year, if all five of the projected appeals materialize, there will be further delays of several months in fully staffing and taking up these appeals," Bhatia told an audience at the WTO in Geneva. "This problem cannot be expected to go away by itself." The WTO is run by its 164 members, and any change to its rules or working practices needs to be agreed unanimously. Even the smallest tweak to the rules can be contentious. Reform of the WTO's dispute settlement rules has been on the table for years, but there is no sign of progress. Bhatia said the rules were set up to ensure prompt resolution of disputes, because "in the world of commerce, time really is money". But in recent years, the system had "substantially ceded ground on this", he added. More disputes were now being appealed, especially the more complicated ones, and more cases went on to a second stage where the parties argued over whether or not the defendant had complied with the original ruling, he said. The largest WTO cases include a dispute between the European Union and the United States over funding for aircraft giants Boeing and Airbus, and a four-country attempt to stop Australia's stringent anti-tobacco laws. Recent appeals have covered diverse areas of trade law, including environmental protection, renewable energy subsidies, tax evasion, money laundering, patent protection, food safety, animal welfare, consumer information and more, Bhatia said. During the tobacco dispute, Australia complained that the countries that brought the litigation were deliberately holding up proceedings to discourage other countries from introducing similar anti-tobacco legislation. "To the extent that delays in dispute resolution involve delays in the assertion of the rule of law, they provide an incentive to those who benefit from those delays," Bhatia said. He added that slow resolution of disputes would encourage member countries to "look for other solutions, potentially elsewhere".

Virgin Australia brings back direct flights to Johannesburg through South African Airways codeshare Virgin Australia Photo: Glenn Hunt Virgin Australia customers will now be able to book South Africa Airways flights through a codeshare agreement. Virgin Australia Photo: Glenn Hunt Virgin Australia Photo: Glenn Hunt Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Local Business Virgin Australia will sell direct flights to Johannesburg for the first time in nearly four years after striking a codeshare agreement with South African Airways. The new partnership comes after Qantas Airways and South African Airways severed their alliance on flights between Sydney and Johannesburg and Perth and Johannesburg earlier this year. Qantas had flown the Sydney-Johannesburg route, while South African Airways flew the Perth-Johannesburg sector under the alliance. Members of Virgin's Velocity frequent flyer program will be able to earn points and status credits on the Perth-Johannesburg route, with connecting flights available on Virgin to east coast destinations. Virgin had previously been selling Johannesburg flights with partner Singapore Airlines that required a stop-over in Singapore, lengthening the flight time considerably. Virgin had entered the Melbourne-Johannesburg route with its own Boeing 777s in 2010 but quit the route less than a year later after experiencing heavy losses. The Virgin flight time was two hours longer than it would have been otherwise in both directions because it chose to use a twin-engined planes rather than the four-engined aircraft used by Qantas and South African Airways. Qantas uses 747s on its Sydney-Johannesburg route and South African Airways uses A340s from Perth to Johannesburg. The four-engined planes use routes that track close to Antarctica, whereas a two-engined aircraft had been required to be within 180 minutes of an airfield where it could land in an emergency situation on one engine. South African Airways had already been offering its customers codeshares on Virgin flights connecting to the Perth-Johannesburg service since the collapse of its Qantas alliance earlier this year. The Perth-Johannesburg route is particularly popular with the resources industry and the large community of South African expatriates in Perth. Qantas now offers customers from Perth the option to either fly to Sydney and connect with its Sydney-Johannesburg service or to fly to Johannesburg via Dubai. Both options are several hours longer than a direct flight from Perth to Johannesburg. Fares from Perth to Johannesburg will go on sale through Virgin's website from October 14 for travel from October 21. The story Virgin Australia brings back direct flights to Johannesburg through South African Airways codeshare first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Front row, from left: Zena Cardman, Jasmin Moghbeli, Jonny Kim, Raji Chari and Loral O’ Hara. Back row, from left: Frank Rubio, Matthew Dominick, Warren Hoburg, Robb Kulin, Kayla Barron, Bob Hines, and Jessica Watkins. Credit: NASA/Robert Markowitz NASA has picked 12 engineers, scientists and pilots to begin basic training for future spaceflight assignments from more than 18,300 applicants, adding U.S. military combat veterans, two medical doctors, a submarine officer, an MIT professor, an expert on submersibles, a SpaceX launch engineer, a field biologist and a planetary geologist to the agency’s astronaut ranks. Vice President Mike Pence, lawmakers and political dignitaries welcomed the 12 astronaut candidates Wednesday at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. The new cadre of astronaut candidates are part of NASA’s largest astronaut class since 2000, and they will begin two years of training in August before becoming full-feldged members of the astronaut corps and eligible for flight assignments. “These are 12 men and women whose personal excellence and whose personal courage will carry our nation to even greater heights of discovery and who I know will inspire our children and our grandchildren every bit as much as your forebears have done so in this storied American program,” Pence said. Pence reiterated the White House’s plans to reestablish the National Space Council, a multi-agency panel that was last active during President George H.W. Bush’s administration. Pence will chair the council, which will include representatives from civilian and military agencies, the private sector and academia. “America needs a National Space Council once again,” Pence said. “Twice before in our nation’s history, our nation has had a federal body charged with advising the president on national policy and strategy for space.” Vice President Mike Pence congratulates the 2017 astronaut class. Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls Pence did not offer specifics of the White House’s vision for NASA, but President Trump’s fiscal year 2018 budget request proposes a $19.1 billion budget for the space agency next year, a $561 million reduction from NASA’s current-year spending. The budget request calls for a $170 million cut in Earth science spending, the elimination of five Earth science missions, the shuttering of NASA’s education office, and the cancellation of a planned mission to retrieve a boulder-sized piece of an asteroid and return it to the vicinity of the moon for astronaut visits. NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion capsule, designed for deep space human exploration, would receive a multibillion-dollar budget, and the robotic Mars 2020 rover and Europa Clipper probe are kept on track in the White House proposal. A Europa lander would be terminated. “We will continue to unlock the mysteries of space, but to do so, we most reorient our civilian space program toward deep space exploration and provide the capabilites for America to maintain a constant presence in low Earth orbit and beyond,” Pence said. NASA released biographies of the 12 new astronaut candidates, who applied for the space program after NASA posted astronaut job openings in December 2015. Here are brief overviews of the 12 new astronaut candidates provided by NASA: Kayla Barron, 29, Lt., U.S. Navy, is originally from Richland, Washington. She graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a bachelor’s degree in systems engineering. A Gates Cambridge Scholar, Barron earned a master’s degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Cambridge.

Cmdr., U.S. Navy, was born and raised in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of San Diego and a Master of Science in Systems Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School. He also graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Dominick was at sea on the USS Ronald Reagan, serving as department head for Strike Fighter Squadron 115, when he got the call saying he’d been selected as an astronaut candidate. Bob Hines, 42, considers Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, his hometown. He graduated from Boston University with a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering. From there, he went on to graduate from the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School, and then the University of Alabama, where he earned a master’s degree in aerospace engineering. He has served in the U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserves for 18 years. For the last five years, Hines has served as a NASA research pilot at Johnson. Warren “Woody” Hoburg, 31, is originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He earned a bachelor’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT. He continued on to earn a doctorate in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkley. He is a private pilot and has extensive experience with wilderness search and rescue efforts. Hoburg will come to NASA from MIT, where he currently is leading a research group as an assistant professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Dr. Jonny Kim, 33, Lt., U.S. Navy, was born and raised in Los Angeles. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy, then trained and operated as a Navy SEAL, completing more than 100 combat operations and earning a Silver Star and Bronze Star with Combat V. Afterward, he went on to complete a degree in mathematics at the University of San Diego and a doctorate of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Kim is a resident physician in emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Robb Kulin, 33, hails from Anchorage, Alaska. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Denver before going on to complete a master’s degree in materials science and a doctorate in engineering at the University of California, San Diego. He has previous experience as an ice driller in Antarctica on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and Taylor Glaciers, and as a commercial fisherman in Chignik, Alaska. Since 2011, Kulin has worked for SpaceX in Hawthorne, California, where he leads the Launch Chief Engineering group. Jasmin Moghbeli, 33, Maj., U.S. Marine Corps, considers Baldwin, New York, her hometown. She earned a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering with information technology at MIT, followed by a master’s degree in aerospace engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School. She also is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Moghbeli currently tests H-1 helicopters and serves as the quality assurance and avionics officer for Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron 1 in Yuma, Arizona. Loral O’Hara, 34, calls Sugar Land, Texas, home. She earned a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering at the University of Kansas and a master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Purdue University. As a student, she participated in NASA’s KC-135 Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program, the NASA Academy at the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Center, and the internship program at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. O’Hara is currently a research engineer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Dr. Francisco “Frank” Rubio, 41, Maj., U.S. Army, is originally from Miami. He earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a doctorate of medicine from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Rubio has accumulated more than 1,100 hours of flight time in helicopters, including 600 hours of combat and imminent danger time. He’s currently serving as a surgeon for the 3rd Battalion of the Army’s 10th Special Forces Group at Fort Carson, Colorado. Jessica Watkins, 29, hails from Lafayette, Colorado. She graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor’s degree in geological and environmental sciences, then went on to earn a doctorate in geology from the University of California, Los Angeles. Watkins has worked at NASA’s Ames Research Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory and currently is a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology, where she collaborates on the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity. “As American astronauts, you may yet return our nation to the moon, you may be the first to travel to Mars, (and) you may have experiences that we can only imagine,” Pence said. NASA culled the 12 finalists from more than 18,000 applicants, a record level of interest in the astronaut job opportunities that bested the number of applications for the space agency’s 1978 astronaut class, the first to include women and minorities. “Getting down from 18,000 to some manageable number was a feat in and of itself,” said astronaut Chris Cassidy, deputy chair of the astronaut selection board. “We physically interviewed 120 people here in Houston — obviously these 12 were a part of that — and that’s when it really gets hard.” The would-be space explorers are a diverse group, hailing from different personal backgrounds and boasting a range of professional experiences. Five of the astronaut candidates hold doctorate degrees, and seven are current or former military officers. Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL and currently an emergency physician, said NASA told the incoming astronauts they would likely initially train to fly on commercial SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing CST-100 Starliner capsules to the International Space Station. Asked if he would ride on a CST-100 Starliner crew craft owned and operated by Boeing, a SpaceX rival, SpaceX engineer Robb Kulin said yes. “I’ll ride on whatever spacecraft I can go on,” said Kulin, who helped design parts of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and most recently led SpaceX’s launch chief engineering office. “I’m pretty confident in the processes, as a whole, to get us there safely.” Two of the astronaut candidates have experience in NASA’s robotic exploration programs. Watkins, a former college rugby player, worked on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover and other missions at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Chari was an intern at two NASA centers as a student at the Air Force Academy, assigned to teams developing the Spitzer Space Telescope and a Mars sample return mission. “I think one (area) that was a bigger focus in this selection was skills that are appropriate for longer-tern spaceflight, so stays on the ISS that are six months or longer, or possible deeper space exploration missions,” said O’Hara, a subsea systems engineer. “We have a little more of a remote and extreme environment skillset than maybe previous classes did.” Bob Hines, the oldest of the group, said he attended Space Camp as a child, which “fanned the flame” and grew his interest in spaceflight. But his lifelong passion has been aviation, and he only became interested in the astronaut corps recently as a pilot based at Johnson Space Center. Matthew Dominick was deployed on the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific Ocean when he learned of his selection to become an astronaut. Email the author.

Vice President Mike Pence joined other elected and NASA officials in applauding the group. (collectSPACE) June 7, 2017 — NASA introduced 12 new astronauts on Wednesday (June 7), who will train for missions into Earth orbit and to deep space. The seven men and five women comprise the 22nd class of American spaceflight trainees since 1959. The group is the largest NASA has selected in almost two decades. Vice President Mike Pence joined NASA leaders, including acting administrator Robert Lightfoot and director of flight operations Brian Kelly, in Houston, Texas to announce the new astronaut candidates, or "ascans." The event was set inside the Johnson Space Center's Space Vehicle Mockup Facility in front of a full-scale engineering model of NASA's Orion spacecraft, which the new astronauts might fly in the coming years on missions beyond low Earth orbit. "To the members of this new class of American astronauts, I say congratulations," remarked Pence. "You have already captured the admiration and respect of your peers — when you lift off the launch pad, to boldly go, you will capture the imagination of your nation and the world." Vice President Mike Pence addresses NASA's new 12 astronauts at Johnson Space Center in Houston, June 7, 2017. (collectSPACE) "As American astronauts, you may yet return our nation to the moon.

NASA's new astronaut class, as seen in social media photographs. The group includes seven men and five women, ages 29 to 42. NASA's astronaut corps currently has 44 active members, led by newly-named Chief Astronaut Patrick Forrester. The 22nd group of astronaut candidates was selected out of a record 18,000 applicants, based on education, experience, and their interviews with NASA's selection board. "We are excited to welcome them to the team," said Ellen Ochoa, Johnson Space Center director and former shuttle-era astronaut. Selection as an ascan does not ensure becoming a NASA astronaut, which requires the successful completion of the basic training program. With the addition of the new class, NASA has selected 350 men and women to train as astronauts in its nearly 60-year history. "While their numbers may be few, their accomplishments have been legion — and the tales of our astronauts are a testament to the indomitable spirit of the United States of America," said Pence. © 2017 collectSPACE.com All rights reserved.

Might as well ground it REUTERS The airline is a story of multiple organ failure, thanks to neta-babu control. Better to unlock value and move on Soon after civil aviation minister Gajapathi Raju talked of the Centre reviewing options to revive Air India, his colleague Jayant Sinha informed the country of a “robust” multi-dimensional plan to turn the national carrier into a “great global airline for India”. Sinha’s brave stance sounds platitudinous, too familiar. For long there have been several suggestions for revamping Air India. Most commentators suggest the Government should cut its umbilical cord with the carrier. It was referred to Disinvestment Commission in 1998; the then disinvestment minister Arun Jaitley advocated its privatisation. So did a 2012 study commissioned by the corporate affairs ministry. Again in 2013, the civil aviation minister rooted for privatisation; the move was blocked by the Opposition. A lot of turbulence As the Economic Survey of 2016-17 eloquently put it, “Defying history, there is still the commitment to make the perennially unprofitable public sector airline ‘world class’”, although acknowledging that the exit is “difficult especially in a precocious, cleavaged democracy dominated by vested interests”. However, there are signs of hope. With Niti Aayog’s reported recommendation for AI’s strategic disinvestment, finance minister Arun Jaitley’s assertion that if private airlines already carry 86-87 per cent of country’s air traffic, they might as well carry 100 per cent, and civil aviation minister Raju assuring that a decision for its “rejuvenation” will be taken within three months, a decision may be on the cards. The Modi sarkar could live up to Prime Minister’s oft-repeated avowal that the Government has no business being in business. Of course, as Niti Aayog says, the Government will perforce need to considerably relieve AI of its ₹55,000-crore debt overhang to make it attractive for investors. With its decision for an equity bailout of ₹30,231 crore over a nine-year period till 2020-21 as a key element in AI’s turnaround plan, the UPA government predictably opted for a soft option. The plan has not helped. As Sinha said, AI carries a “crushing load” of debt; ₹50,357 crore at end-FY16. Worse, the CAG has said that AI in fact incurred a loss of ₹321 crore in 2015-16, instead of an operating profit of ₹105 crore it claimed. The auditor stated that AI understated losses to the tune of ₹6,415 crore in three years from 2012. Many ailments There is little evidence of any systematic diagnosis done of AI’s real ailment. The national carrier’s stewardship has mostly been an almost-exclusive prerogative of babus with little domain expertise, nominated directors stacked along with pliant chief executives. Once a former AI chief lamented how the management was bullied by a minister into seeking “immediate and unquestioned compliance” with orders for financially damaging and commercially unviable measures. Probing ‘Air India scam’ at Supreme Court’s instance, the CBI has just filed three FIRs: one, against AI’s own assessment in 2000-01 that it should only lease aircraft, an order was placed in 2004-05 to buy 68 Boeing airplanes for Air India and another 43 for Indian Airlines; second; AI dry-leased four B-777s for five years in 2006 even when new planes were due to arrive in mid-2007, resulting in five B-777s and five B-737s standing idle, involving an estimated loss of ₹840 crore during 2007-09; third, several lucrative routes and schedules were given away for private airlines. Air India’s woes are too deep, it is a story of multiple organ failure. It is not just its abysmal financial situation or myriad operational glitches that often surface; the politico-bureaucratic stranglehold on it has nurtured a sinister culture of free-for-all rent-seeking and wanton fleecing of, what once it was, a real Maharaja airline, one of the world’s very best, which has steadily scraped the bottom of the barrel. In reply to a question sometime ago, Parliament learnt of a score of cases of malfeasance and misdemeanour like fraudulent claims, even of some senior staff actually working elsewhere. Frequent work stoppages by different employees’ unions and groups, even by “world’s highest paid” pilots strangely categorised as “workmen” did an enormous damage. Minister Raju believes that, notwithstanding the legacy issues, which drag down AI’s finances, the carrier has “definitely improved” in parameters like the passenger load factor, on-time performance and aircraft productivity. Yet, some doubts linger. For example, with 32,235 employees on its rolls – regular and some 4,350 casual and contractual hands, AI’s tooth-to-tail employees/aircraft ratio in 2011 stood at scandalously high of 298, almost thrice the industry’s average. This is reflected in employee costs constituting 23 per cent of working expenses for AI in comparison with 12 per cent on Jet. AI’s employee/aircraft ratio shown as 120 for 2015-16 is explained only by its total strength reckoned at 12,880 employees, against the number of its regular employees alone being 26,921 in 2011-12. The big drop in the numbers may be ascribed to its splitting the engineering and cargo businesses into two separate subsidiaries in 2013. Trailing behind While younger Indian airlines such as IndiGo and SpiceJet are scripting a bold narrative in aviation industry — increasing capacity, gaining market share, improving asset utilisation, load factor and on-time performance, AI is losing out. AI’s paltry 13-per cent domestic passenger market share trails far behind IndiGo’s, JetAirways’, and SpiceJet’s. Its international market share of 10.7 per cent also lags behind Jet’s 14.5 per cent. AI’s on-time performance at six of India’s metro airports in 2015-16 was 89.2 per cent vis-a-vis Jet’s 91.8 per cent and IndiGo’s 95 per cent. Notwithstanding the diligence and sincerity of the management now in the saddle, AI’s very credibility as an institution is in question. AI will never be permitted to function as a truly autonomous enterprise and, instead, be hostage to debilitating diktats. Consider the import of the recent appalling conduct of MP Gaikwad on an AI flight tacitly, supported by a number of his colleagues, and the FIR filed by the national carrier virtually ending in the culprit having the last laugh. Amidst a plethora of suggestions to pull AI out of the quagmire, it will be prudent to devise an innovative mechanism to somehow unlock AI’s optimal value, and let it extinguish itself in its existing incarnation, to be born again in another — alive and kicking.

If enacted, the bill would streamline the licensing and regulatory processes involved in launching commercial satellites and close a regulatory gap that prevents companies from investing in business opportunities in satellite servicing, commercial space stations and lunar landers. The Office of Space Commerce would license spacecraft instead of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Obtaining a license to launch a satellite from NOAA sometimes took years, and the new bill automatically grants a permit if the Office of Space Commerce doesn’t make a ruling within 60 days. “This transformative legislation declares that America is open for business in outer space,” Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said in a press statement. “The bill establishes a favorable legal and policy environment for free enterprise with maximum certainty and minimum burden for stakeholders. With this innovative legislation, we position the American space industry as a leader,” said Smith, who introduced the bill. The bill has bipartisan support and is expected to breeze through the committee’s Thursday markup hearing. Opponents of the legislation worry it hands too much authority to the Office of Space Commerce, which is a relatively small department with few employees and a limited budget. Two Democrats Reps., Ed Perlmutter of Colorado and Derek Kilmer of Washington, joined their Republican colleagues to co-sponsor the legislation. The bill comes days after Houston company Axiom Space announced plans to launch the first-ever commercial space station into orbit in 2020. U.S. plans to return astronauts to Earth’s orbit are entirely dependent on private companies, some of which are scheduled to launch by the end of this year. Boeing and SpaceX are both competing to be the first private company to send humans to the International Space Station. SpaceX has a human test flight planned for October 2017, while Boeing has a flight scheduled for May 2018. NASA wants these private companies to be the space agency’s “taxi service” to carry crews to the ISS. Once this service is established, the agency will refocus on long range deep space exploration. Astronauts began installing adapters that allow commercial spacecraft to dock with the ISS last August. This affords NASA less expensive options to resupply the station. The legislation boosts NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which is intended to pay these companies to ferry astronauts to the ISS. This will temper the U.S.’s  sole reliance on Russia for transporting American astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX has already successfully resupplied the ISS seven times, but one SpaceX resupply mission in June 2015 resulted in an explosion and a total loss of the spacecraft. The private company Orbital Sciences is also under contract with the space agency to resupply the ISS. Follow Andrew on Twitter Send tips to andrew@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

Science Now Discoveries from the world of science and medicine Science Science Now These 12 Americans had the right stuff to be picked for NASA's new class of astronaut trainees NASA The members of the 2017 NASA Astronaut Class seemingly can do it all -- including take a group selfie. The members of the 2017 NASA Astronaut Class seemingly can do it all -- including take a group selfie. (NASA) By Karen KaplanContact Reporter Space Exploration Space Antarctica NASA Orion Space Mission Caltech The Pennsylvania State University Meet 12 of the coolest, most accomplished people in America — the members of NASA’s newest class of astronaut candidates. These impressive overachievers have studied cave slime on Earth and Gale Crater on Mars. They’ve worked on nuclear submarines and low-gravity research planes. They have built machines that can fly for five days straight and tested rockets headed for space. Half of them have served in the armed forces. NASA asked the applicants a lot of questions before picking a new class of astronaut candidates, but they didn’t cover every topic. But they haven’t made it to space just yet. Starting in August, they’ll report to Johnson Space Center in Houston for a two-year training program. Then they’ll be eligible for missions aboard the International Space Station, the new Orion spacecraft or one of the vehicles being built by private aerospace companies. These would-be astronauts were chosen from among more than 18,300 applicants who hailed from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and American Samoa. That means their odds of being selected were less than 1 in 1,500. Here’s what it took to make the cut: Kayla Barron This 29-year-old naval lieutenant from Richland, Wash., has a master’s degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Cambridge, where she studied as a Gates Cambridge Scholar. A former submarine warfare officer — one of the first women to serve on a Navy sub — she’s used to working in tight quarters surrounded by an inhospitable environment. Most recently, Barron worked at the U.S. Naval Academy as a flag aide, a right-hand-woman to the school’s superintendent. Astronaut Candidate Kayla Barron (Robert Markowitz / NASA) Zena Cardman Cardman studies extremophiles — the organisms that live under the most extreme conditions on Earth. That includes hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean and the walls of caves that never see the light of day. (Her current research at Penn State involves cave slime.) Cardman, 29, has been something of an extremophile herself, having worked at the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research station in Antarctica. She hopes her work will earn her a PhD in geoscience, and make her well-equipped to look for life beyond Earth. Astronaut Candidate Zena Cardman (Bill Ingalls / NASA) Raja Chari Chari is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and the Naval Test Pilot School who also earned a master’s degree in aero/astro engineering at MIT. The 39-year-old lieutenant colonel is stationed at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California, where he is the commander of the 461st Flight Test Squadron and director of the F-35 Integrated Test Force. A native of Waterloo, Iowa, Chari flew combat missions in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Astronaut Candidate Raja Chari (Robert Markowitz / NASA) Matthew Dominick Another alum of the Naval Test Pilot School, Dominick was deployed aboard the carrier Ronald Reagan when he learned he would be joining NASA’s new class of astronaut candidates. The 35-year-old is a lieutenant commander in the Navy with engineering degrees from the University of San Diego and the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. Astronaut Candidate Matthew Dominick (Bill Ingalls / NASA) Bob Hines This 18-year veteran of the Air Force and Air Force Reserves may have had an inside track to the astronaut program — for the past five years, he has worked as a NASA research pilot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. More than 3,500 hours of his life has been spent in the air, in 41 kinds of aircraft. Hines, 42, studied aerospace engineering at Boston University and the University of Alabama. Astronaut Candidate Bob Hines (Robert Markowitzv / NASA) Warren Hoburg Some might say there’s no better job than being a professor at MIT, but Hoburg will be leaving a faculty position there to train for his new career as an astronaut. The 31-year-old, who goes by “Woody,” earned his PhD at UC Berkeley and spent a year at Boeing before returning to MIT, where he went to college. Among other things, he led a group that designed an unmanned aerial vehicle that can take off from the roof of a moving car and stay aloft for five days. Astronaut Candidate Warren Hoburg (Bill Ingalls / NASA) Jonny Kim Dr. Kim took an unusual path to Harvard Medical School. A graduate of Santa Monica High School, he enlisted in the Navy and made his way onto a SEAL team. After proving himself as a combat medic (among other roles) in more than 100 missions — and earning a Silver Star and Bronze Star — he joined the ranks of naval officers and earned a degree in math from the University of San Diego. Now 33, Kim is training as an emergency physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. Astronaut Candidate Jonny Kim (Robert Markowitz / NASA) Robb Kulin Kulin has worked at both ends of the Earth, catching fish in Alaska and drilling ice in Antarctica. His most recent job was at SpaceX in Hawthorne, where he made sure the company’s rockets were ready for launch. Kulin, 33, has a private pilot’s license and a PhD in engineering from UC San Diego. Astronaut Candidate Robb Kulin (Bill Ingalls / NASA) Jasmin Moghbeli A major in the Marines, Moghbeli is based in Yuma, Ariz., where she tests H-1 helicopters. She’s used to spending time in the air — NASA says she has racked up more than 1,600 hours of flight time, some of which came over the course of 150 combat missions. Like many of her fellow astronaut trainees, Moghbeli attended MIT, the Naval Postgraduate School and the Naval Test Pilot School. She was born in Germany 33 years ago but calls Baldwin, N.Y., her hometown. Astronaut Candidate Jasmin Moghbeli (Bill Ingalls / NASA) Loral O’Hara O’Hara already has a long resume with NASA. While in school, she earned a spot in the space agency’s KC-135 Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program, which gives budding researchers a chance to run their own microgravity experiments. She was an intern at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge and spent a summer as a research associate at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The 34-year-old now puts her engineering skills to use at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution coming up with ways to study extreme environments. Astronaut Candidate Loral O'Hara (Robert Markowitz / NASA) Francisco Rubio Dr. Rubio’s career is a mix of military and medicine. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and earned his medical degree at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Before starting medical school, Rubio (who goes by Frank) flew UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. On the ground, the 44-year-old Army major has served as a family physician in Alabama and Colorado. Astronaut Candidate Francisco Rubio (Bill Ingalls / NASA) Jessica Watkins Watkins may be a newcomer to NASA’s astronaut program, but she is already exploring Mars as part of the JPL team that operates the Curiosity rover. With a bachelor’s degree from Stanford and a PhD from UCLA, the 29-year-old Caltech postdoc is working to unravel the Red Planet’s geological history. When she’s focused on Earth, she spends time writing short stories, playing rugby, climbing rocks, coaching basketball and flying planes.

CC0 / / NASA Not Planning to Withdraw From ISS Program Before 2024 – OfficialKristian Rouz – The US is bound to expand its space exploration activity, supported by both the increases in federal budget spending on aerospace, and the resurgence in popular interest in outer space. The US space agency selected 12 new astronauts from the record highest 18,300 applications filed last year, compared to the previous all-time high of 8,000 applications filed in 1978. On Wednesday, NASA announced that 12 new members will join its pool of active astronauts, bringing their total amount to 56 people, who will soon board the newest spacecraft and lead the next stage of space exploration. The newly-selected astronauts, five women and seven men, albeit being already highly-skilled scientists and aerospace professionals, will undergo an intensive two-year training, designed to prepare them for the challenges they will face working or the Earth’s orbit and beyond. US Vice President Mike Pence attended the special event at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX, to welcome the new astronauts, and outline the contours of the Trump administration’s vision of the US’ involvement in space exploration. The US currently has only 44 astronauts, mainly because the Space Shuttle program was ended in 2011 and the nation has not launched a single astronaut into space from its territory. The US’ withdrawal from space, accompanied by economic problems in the form of aftershocks of the Great © AP Photo/ U.S. Air Force Secret US Mini-Space Shuttle Returns to EarthRecession, had undermined the nation’s confidence in the prospects and benefits of space exploration. It had seemed at some point that the enthusiasm, that once surrounded the tight and highly-competitive Soviet-American ‘space race’ of the 1950s-1980s, has bitten the dust, having become another page in history books. Yet, the recent resurgence of public interest in space, motivated by the breakthrough experimentation of SpaceX, the world’s most prominent privately-held aerospace enterprise, has produced the record highest number of applications to become an astronaut. NASA selected from a pool of 18,300 applicants, all of whom had to meet certain demands, such as a Bachelor’s degree in science, technology, engineering, or math, or about 1,000 of hours operating a jet aeroplane, along with physical and mental health requirements. NASA has not seen such massive public interest in its activity in about four decades. In 1978, the amount of applications to become astronaut, hit its then-record highest at 8,000, and since then public interest seems to have faded. Despite the Space Shuttle program being launched in 1981, the astounding rise of the financial sector, computer science and entertainment had diverted public attention from space for a long time. The situation, however, is changing gradually. Space exploration is no longer dominated by the governmental interest. Moreover, the decline in space exploration entailing the end of the Cold War – on both sides of the former Iron Curtain – whilst reflected the perception of space flights as redundant in both Washington and Moscow, has also created the new exciting opportunities for the private-sector commercial missions to space. © AP Photo/ U.S. Air Force US Air Force’s Mysterious X-37B Space Plane to Head Back Into Orbit on SpaceX RocketSpaceX and Boeing in the US, and Russia’s privately-held enterprise, Dauria Aerospace, are only a few examples of companies, aimed at extracting commercial revenue from space flights. Hence the renewed public interest in space exploration across the globe – rather than being an auxiliary function of each nation’s military-industrial complex, national security and prestige, aerospace is becoming a profitable sector of national economy, like Wall Street or Canary Wharf, in the US and beyond. Most likely, some observers have noted, NASA’s 12 new astronauts will end up flying commercial rockets upon the completion of their 2-year training. One of the new astronauts, Robb Kulin, is an actual SpaceX launch engineer and senior manager, and his view of the new era in space exploration reflects the shift in perception of aerospace from the secretive activity dominated by national security interest to a process driven by international business cooperation. ‘‘Hopefully, one day I actually fly on a vehicle that… I got to design,’’ Kulin said. Meanwhile, Vice President Pence, without going too much into detail, said that the Trump administration is committed to increase the federal support for NASA activities. “America will lead the way in space once again,” Pence said. Vice President also mentioned that the White House will soon reassemble the National Space Council – a governmental agency that determined the direction of the national space program in the 1960s and 1970s, but disbanded in 1993, after the end of the Cold War. The White House, thus, sees space exploration as bound together with national interest, foreign policy goals and international prestige. © Photo: Pixabay Trump's $19.1Bln Space Budget Sustains US Efforts to Land Astronaut on MarsSince 2011, when the last Space Shuttle, Atlantis, was decommissioned, American astronauts have flown to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard Russian spacecraft together with their Russian colleagues. Albeit the US might come up with their own, possibly commercially feasible – courtesy of SpaceX – alternatives soon, the American aerospace industry is dependent on the imported Russian rocket engines, whilst those currently made in the US do not provide enough power to deliver the necessary amount of cargo into orbit. Amid the rapid development of private-sector aerospace companies across the globe, and business-minded cooperation in the field of space exploration, even national governments have adopted a mindset centred on cost-efficiency motivated by fiscal policy considerations. The exchange in technology and space exploration-related products is bound to deepen and increase in the coming years as space flights are becoming increasingly multiobjective, including the projected flights to other planets, the ongoing space tourist launches, ISS missions centred on scientific experiments in zero gravity, and many more to come. ...

Photo: AP via NASA mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:35 PM, June 8, 2017 NEW YORK — It’s not too late to be an astronaut. NASA doesn’t have an age limit for this gig, and the basic requirements aren’t as onerous as you might think. The odds of scoring one of those coveted seats to the stars, however, are getting long. The US space agency named 12 new astronauts Wednesday’a hyper-elite squad winnowed from 18,300 applicants. That’s right, in every 100 CVs, Uncle Sam finds .07 astronauts. There have been about 350 professional star voyagers in the nation’s history. Some 56 of them are active or in training and 22 are “management astronauts” no longer eligible for a space flight. About 60 are deceased. Given the numbers, a more realistic career goal might be playing quarterback in the NFL or running a Fortune 500 company. The pay for both of those paths would be far better, to boot. That said, the requirements for your latest job were likely tougher than NASA’s most recent “astronaut” classified listing. One no longer has to be a test pilot or a rocket scientist. Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg probably wouldn’t make the cut (not enough schooling), but virtually every high school science and math teacher does, as well as physicians and professional pilots. “Some people would be surprised to learn they might have what it takes,” NASA Flight Director Brian Kelly said in soliciting the current crop of candidates. “We want and need a diverse mix of individuals to ensure we have the best astronaut corps possible.” Getting in the door requires four things: 1. US citizenship. 2. A Bachelor’s degree in engineering, science or math. 3. The ability to pass a NASA physical (20/20 vision is a must but glasses and corrective surgery are accepted). 4. 1,000 hours flying a jet or three years of “related, progressively responsible, professional experience” (graduate school and teaching both qualify). After NASA tosses the applicants who don’t meet those criteria, a panel of 50 people’mostly active astronauts’ narrow the list to a few hundred top prospects. These are the folks who have their references called. The field is then shrunk to 120 candidates. They are brought in for more medical screening and “intense interviews.” Finally, 50 of them are called back for a week of more of interviews and medical screening. (It helps to know how to swim and speak Russian.) For the recent search, NASA estimated at least 3 million U.S. residents would have met the basic requirements. Not all of them applied, butAmericans do seem particularly keen on the space race these days. Applications almost tripled from the past hiring round as NASA played up the likelihood of a busier flight schedule. In calling for candidates, the agency noted incoming crews will soon be able to fly to space from Florida’ rather than rural Russia since the Space Shuttles were mothballed’as it brings online new crew capsules from both Boeing Co and SpaceX. Meanwhile, the agency is prepping its new Orion craft for deep-space missions, pushing to launch astronauts on the pod by 2023. “You may be the first to travel to Mars,” Vice President Mike Pence told the rookies at Wednesday’s announcement. Historically, most astronauts eventually get to ride on a rocket. Leaving aside the 2013 class, which only recently completed preliminary training, only about 6 per cent of astronauts have failed to fly on a mission, according to NASA data. Not surprisingly, there are no slouches in the new class. All of the new astronauts have at least one graduate degree and four of the 12 are trained test pilots, much like the original Mercury astronauts back in the days of The Right Stuff. Then there’s Jonny Kim, a decorated Navy SEAL who finished 100 combat missions and went on to Harvard Medical School. “It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read about what these folks have done,” NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said. With a starting salary of $66,026, the pay isn’t all that great for this diligent dozen’ but the travel benefits are next level.

President Robert Mugabe In a statement, ex-finance minister Tendai Biti’s party said the 93 year old leader may have mistaken Tokwe-Mukosi dam for an ocean. The Zimbabwean leader officially commissioned the country’s largest inland dam in Masvingo few weeks ago. “Unless if we want to annex a neighbouring country and administer its oceans, then what are we doing there,” said the party on Monday. “Maybe, Mugabe got confused when he officially opened Tokwe Mukosi Dam. He probably thought that Zimbabwe had built an ocean against the wishes of the imperialists.” PDP said Mugabe’s endless foreign jaunts were draining the fiscus. The party further noted that while the President’s trips were already a cost to the country, Mugabe’s recent trips have turned even more expensive as the veteran leader has been forced to charter expensive planes from outside following the banning of the national carrier Air Zimbabwe from flying into other countries. “The People’s Democratic Party is aware that Mugabe uses more than five million dollars to for each state visit he takes, when hospitals cannot afford to procure basic painkillers. “The costs are going up considering the fact that Mugabe now prefers to hire private planes due to the depletion of the Air Zimbabwe fleet which has since been declared unsafe by many countries including the United States which is the mother country of Boeing the manufacturer of the plane which Mugabe used to take for his infinite trips abroad,” said PDP. Biti’s party has described President Mugabe’s love for foreign trips as a demonstration of madness which requires all political players to unite against. With only six months into the year, Mugabe has been out of the country for 77 days prior to the current trip which is his 10th out of the country for the ageing leader.

Source: AAP 8 Jun 2017 - 5:22 PM  UPDATED YESTERDAY 5:22 PM Tweet NASA has chosen 12 new astronauts from its biggest pool of applicants ever, hand-picking seven men and five women who could one day fly aboard the nation's next generation of spacecraft. The astronaut class of 2017 includes doctors, scientists, engineers, pilots and military officers from Anchorage to Miami and points in between. They've worked in submarines, emergency rooms, university lecture halls, jet cockpits and battleships. They range in age from 29 to 42, and they typically have led the pack. "It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read what these folks have done," said NASA's acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot. Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the group during a televised ceremony at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. He offered Donald Trump's congratulations and noted that the president is "firmly committed to NASA's noble mission, leading America in space". Under Trump, "America will lead in space once again, and the world will marvel," Pence said. More than 18,300 people threw their hats into the space ring. That's more than double the previous record of 8000 set in 1978, when the space shuttles were close to launching. The 12 selected on Wednesday will join 44 astronauts already in the NASA corps. US astronauts have not launched from home soil since 2011, when the space shuttles were retired. Americans have been hitching rides aboard Russian spacecraft in the meantime, but that could change next year. After two years of training, the newbies may end up riding commercial rockets to the International Space Station or flying beyond the moon in NASA's Orion spacecraft. Their ultimate destination could be Mars. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules capable of carrying astronauts to the space station and back as soon as next year. A launch engineer and senior manager for SpaceX, Robb Kulin, is among the new astronauts. He's also worked as an ice driller in Antarctica and a commercial fisherman in Alaska. "Hopefully, one day, I actually fly on a vehicle that ... I got to design," Kulin said. Kulin and his classmates may be in for a long wait. Some members of the class of 2009 have yet to launch. Dr. Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL and specialist in emergency medicine, told reporters it "may be a little unclear" what the future holds, at least regarding what spacecraft he and his fellow astronauts might fly. "We're just happy to be here," he added. Geologist Jessica Watkins already has experienced space - vicariously - as part of the team working with NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars. "We intend to send her to Mars one day, folks," NASA Flight Operations Director Brian Kelly said in introducing Watkins. She gave a thumbs-up. This is NASA's 22nd group of astronauts. The first group, the original Mercury 7 astronauts, was chosen in 1959.

They were chosen from a record 18,300 applicants, for a new era of space travel. Lieutenant Colonel Raja Chari will report for duty in August 2017. Thirty-nine-year-old Chari is the first Indian-American after Kalpana Chawla to be chosen by NASA for one of its missions. The Iowa native graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1999 with Bachelor’s degrees in Astronautical Engineering and Engineering Science. He continued on to earn a Master’s degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Raja Chari At the time of his selection, Chari was a Colonel select in the U.S. Air Force, serving as the Commander of the 461st Flight Test Squadron and the Director of the F-35 Integrated Test Force. He has accumulated more than 2,000 hours of flight time in the F-35, F-15, F-16, and F-18 including F-15E combat missions in Operation Iraqi Freedom and deployments in support of the Korean peninsula. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the five women and seven men, aged 28 to 42, during their introduction at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Pence said the White House planned to form a council to advise President Donald Trump on space policy and strategy, relaunching a body that has been inactive for more than 25 years. Trump is “firmly committed to NASA’s noble mission – leading America in space,” Pence said, noting that only 338 Americans have served as NASA astronauts. The trainees include a scientist working with the Mars robotic rover Curiosity, a SpaceX engineer, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and an Army surgeon. NASA is developing a heavy-lift rocket and Orion capsule for travel to the moon and eventually Mars. It is also working with Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Boeing Co to develop commercial space taxis that can ferry crews to and from the International Space Station, a $100 billion research lab that flies about 240 miles (400 km) above Earth. “Hopefully one day I’ll get to fly on a vehicle that has components I’ve actually designed,” said Robb Kulin, 33, a doctor of engineering and Fulbright Fellow who is joining the astronaut corps from SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Since the shuttle programme ended in 2011, NASA has been dependent on Russia for rides to the station, a 15-nation project. Jessica Watkins, 28, a post-doctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology, joins the class after serving on the science team operating the car-sized Curiosity rover which has been exploring Gale Crater on Mars since August 2012. “We intend to send her to Mars one day,” said acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot. The astronauts have two years of training before they are eligible for flight assignments. They are scheduled to report for duty at the Johnson Space Centre in August.

President Robert Mugabe In a statement, ex-finance minister Tendai Biti’s party said the 93 year old leader may have mistaken Tokwe-Mukosi dam for an ocean. The Zimbabwean leader officially commissioned the country’s largest inland dam in Masvingo few weeks ago. “Unless if we want to annex a neighbouring country and administer its oceans, then what are we doing there,” said the party on Monday. “Maybe, Mugabe got confused when he officially opened Tokwe Mukosi Dam. He probably thought that Zimbabwe had built an ocean against the wishes of the imperialists.” PDP said Mugabe’s endless foreign jaunts were draining the fiscus. The party further noted that while the President’s trips were already a cost to the country, Mugabe’s recent trips have turned even more expensive as the veteran leader has been forced to charter expensive planes from outside following the banning of the national carrier Air Zimbabwe from flying into other countries. “The People’s Democratic Party is aware that Mugabe uses more than five million dollars to for each state visit he takes, when hospitals cannot afford to procure basic painkillers. “The costs are going up considering the fact that Mugabe now prefers to hire private planes due to the depletion of the Air Zimbabwe fleet which has since been declared unsafe by many countries including the United States which is the mother country of Boeing the manufacturer of the plane which Mugabe used to take for his infinite trips abroad,” said PDP. Biti’s party has described President Mugabe’s love for foreign trips as a demonstration of madness which requires all political players to unite against. With only six months into the year, Mugabe has been out of the country for 77 days prior to the current trip which is his 10th out of the country for the ageing leader.

This after Ford’s record earnings last year, capping a blistering run of profitability stretching back to the end of the Great Recession. And folks wonder why the Blue Oval’s directors quickly moved to oust former CEO Mark Fields, replace him with mobility guru Jim Hackett and engineer a broad shakeup of global senior leadership? Maybe it’s because the people charged with representing the financial interests of shareholders — and those of the controlling Ford family — saw this rude awakening coming because they’re in a position to do so. And they’re obligated to act. Maybe it’s because Fields’ forward movement looked more like slow motion in comparison to General Motors Co. under CEO Mary Barra and her team. They’re reshaping the automaker’s global operational footprint and exiting under-performing markets to maximize near- and mid-term earnings while making more aggressive bets in the mobility space. Maybe it’s because GM already has a purpose-built, sub-$30,000 electric vehicle — the Chevrolet Bolt — in showrooms. It’s well ahead of Ford and the Model 3 from Silicon Valley’s Tesla Inc., vying with GM to be America’s most valued automaker. And Ford? A distant third in a U.S. industry its founder, Henry Ford, revolutionized with the moving assembly line and his Model T for the masses. Maybe it’s why Ford used the change at the top to execute a sweeping reorganization of senior leadership. It’s unlike anything CEO Alan Mulally ever attempted during his eight-year rescue of the Blue Oval, his elimination of six of eight brands and a singular focus on creating One Ford around the world. In addition to segmenting the world into its traditional geographic pieces — the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, Asia-Pacific — Ford is splitting the business into “markets” under former Europe boss Jim Farley and “operations” under former Americas chief Joe Hinrichs. In simple terms, Hinrichs leads the functions that develop, design, engineer and build the products; Farley leads the business units charged with marketing, selling and delivering results to the bottom line. It’s a meaningful change designed to flatten the senior executive structure, speed decision-making — and it’s a departure from what Mulally bequeathed to Fields. Which means the results, whatever they actually turn out to be, will be blamed for departing from Mulally’s disciplined approach. Or they’ll be credited to senior management and directors who understood the necessity to adapt to challenges that did not materially exist when their superstar CEO arrived from Boeing Co. in 2006. The automotive world is changing, undeniably. Mulally’s industrial prescription for the traditional car and truck business, effective and popular as it was, was necessary. It delivered sequentially better results quarter after quarter; it focused top management on similar processes and common results; and it suppressed legendary infighting among top execs. But it is not proving sufficient to navigate quickly and persuasively the new technology-driven rivalries with a muscular GM and some of the biggest (and richest) players Silicon Valley can muster. The two-dimensional outline of Ford’s profitability, grounded most in its F-Series pickups, suggests the Mulally Method didn’t anticipate the coming revolution. And Ford is saying as much in a carefully worded, if introspective, response to Jonas: “We have not changed our guidance. We are now more focused than ever on speeding decision making, investing capital where we can create value and moving decisively to address areas of the business that are under-performing or destroying capital.” Telling choices of words, those, emphasizing speed and acknowledging Detroit’s legendary reputation for “destroying capital” instead of leveraging it into bigger profits, faster growth and new market segments. That’s why Fields is no longer CEO. And this: “At this time, the vast majority of Ford’s vehicles in operation are completely unconnected, do not collect data, have a rudimentary sensor suites, minimal computing power and extremely limited ability to conduct over-the-air (OTA) updates of firmware,” Jonas wrote. Moving Ford to OTA capability — which GM and Tesla already do, regularly — “would send a powerful signal to investors and strategic partners that Ford truly embraces the areas in which it can add value in Auto 2.0.” GM has 12 million connected vehicles, the company says, almost as many as all other automakers combined. Using OnStar, GM has been delivering OTAs since 2009. And its current generation of hardware on model years 2014 and newer can pull 6.7 billion points of data per day.

Citing the need to stay engaged with The Trump Administration, American business leaders said they will remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Last Thursday, President Trump said he would pull the United States from the Y 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from some world leaders and some heads of industry. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) CEO Robert Iger left White House advisory councils after President Trump’s deceleration Asked about CEO’s’ criticism of the US withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Mr. Spicer added he does not know if President Trump will replace Messrs Musk and Iger on the business council. “IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world,” a company spokeswoman said. Jamie Dimon CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized President Trump’s decision, but said he would not step down from the President’s business group. “I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Mr. Dimon said in a statement. General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on President Trump’s manufacturing council, said he was disappointed in the decision and added: “Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” Mr. Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on President Trump’s manufacturing council, called the withdrawal “a failure of American leadership.” A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve “as a voice for working people.” Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In a TV interview last Friday, Mr. Cohn said the move was part of the administration’s efforts to boost US economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for US goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. “If we can grow our economy, we’re going to consume more and more products,” he said. “We’re going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption.” President Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP (NYSE:BX). Blackrock Inc CEO Larry Fink said he will continue to serve on President Trump’s business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra will remain on the Presidential advisory panel.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, unveiling a 20-year policy review that had been in the works for months, said the armed forces budget would jump by 73 percent to C$32.7 billion ($24.2 billion) in 2026/27 from C$18.9 billion in 2016/17, with the biggest increases coming in later years. The Liberal government made the announcement a day after Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada would have to play a larger global role as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump retreated from multilateralism. Sajjan told reporters the policy would result in "a Canada that is strong at home, secure in North America and engaged in the world." Canada and the United States are traditionally close allies but the relationship has become strained under Trump, who was elected on a promise to "put America first." David Perry, defense analyst at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said he was pleasantly surprised by the spending plans. The center-left Liberals have traditionally been skeptical about major military purchases. "They've promised ... to spend money on a lot of needed priorities, most of it on capital investments, which is where I think the real priorities were," Perry said by phone. Sajjan said the boost would take total defense expenditures to 1.4 percent of GDP by 2024/25 from 1.2 percent now. Other estimates put Canada's spending at closer to 1.0 percent. North Atlantic Treaty Organization members have committed to spend 2 percent of GDP on the military, a target few meet. Trump last month upset NATO leaders by insisting they commit more funds and also by not personally affirming the alliance's mutual defense doctrine. Asked whether he thought Trump would be satisfied, Sajjan said: "This defense policy is for Canada". NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the announcement would "ensure Canada has the armed forces and the key capabilities that the Alliance needs". Ottawa will hold an open competition to buy 88 advanced fighters to replace its fleet of 77 CF-18 planes, more than the 65 new jets the previous Conservative government had planned. The defense review said the jets would need to operate seamlessly with planes of Canada's allies and estimated the cost at between C$15 billion to C$19 billion. Ottawa said last year it wanted to buy 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as an interim measure but has since threatened to scrap the plan unless the U.S. firm drops an anti-dumping challenge against planemaker Bombardier Inc . Potential winners include rival jet makers, such as Lockheed Martin Corp , Dassault Aviation SA , Airbus SE and Saab AB , analysts said. Sajjan declined to comment when asked whether the spending would result in a larger budget deficit than the Liberals are already forecasting. One major uncertainty is that the Liberals may not be in power in a decade's time. They took office in 2015 and Canadian governments usually last between eight and 10 years. Indeed, when in government, the Conservatives promised in 2008 to boost defense spending to C$30 billion by 2027/28 from C$18 billion in 2008/09. But by end of 2014/15, their last full year in power, the budget had only edged up to C$20.1 billion. "It's really really easy to backload promised spending, especially when you're able to backload it into the 2020s," said Kim Richard Nossal, a political studies professor at Queen's University in Kingston who specializes in defense procurement. The Liberal government also confirmed longstanding plans to buy 15 new ships and said the cost would rise to between C$56 billion and C$60 billion. Conservatives had put the cost at C$26.2 billion. The Conservatives said they were skeptical the Liberals would be able to deliver on their promises. "We learned that the majority of the funding announced today won't be available until after the next election and the government won't tell us where it is going to come from," said party defense spokesman James Bezan.
