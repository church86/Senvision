View All Editorials → Apple Hires Satellite Experts away from Google Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin 1 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 9:05 PM EDT | Analysis Apple has hired away a pair of Google’s top satellite experts, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Citing unnamed sources, Mr. Gurman reported that Apple hired John Fenwick, who previously led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering at Google. They are part of a new hardware team at Apple headed by another former Googler, Dropcam cofounder Greg Duffy. Apple in the Skies? Apple Hires Satellite Experts The first question you might have is why Apple would want to make satellites. The answer to that could be in a recent Boeing regulatory filing. According to Bloomberg, Boeing is working on plans for a network of 1,000 satellites that would provide broadband internet access. That service could be offered anywhere, including areas with no wired or wireless telephone infrastructure. Boeing has reportedly talked to Apple about being part of the project. Whether or not that’s true, and whether or not Apple is going to work with Boeing, it’s easy to understand that Apple could be interested in offering that sort of service. Opening up the third world to high speed internet access is a goal of many tech giants, and that would certainly include Apple. The company could also turn such an operation into a direct revenue generator in the developed world. Bloomberg noted that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. forecasted $30 billion in satellite internet revenues by 2025. That’s serious money even for Apple. Apple could also use a satellite fleet for multiple purposes. The company could take its own photographs for Apple Maps, and sell those images on the open market like Google. Apple could also contribute to or compete with existing global positioning systems. Perhaps most importantly, Apple could use satellites to augment its own data distribution for iTunes and the App Store. Or Maybe Not Apple has tons of projects, most of which get killed along the way. Just because Apple hired two satellite experts and has them working in a new hardware team doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will ever be involved with satellites. In addition, just because these two folks are satellite experts doesn’t necessarily mean this team is even working on satellites. They’re reporting to someone who isn’t a satellite expert, for instance. But, it’s interesting news no matter how you slice it. I think many Apple fans would love for Apple to launch its own ISP, especially if it was dedicated to Apple’s existing commitment to privacy and security.

Boeing laid out a plan to provide broadband internet access through over 1,000 low-earth orbiting satellites in a 2016 regulatory filing, and a source “familiar with the matter” told Bloomberg that Apple spoke with the aerospace company about coming an investor-partner in the project. Further, TMF Associates satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar wrote in a recent blog post that industry insiders said Boeing’s project was being funded by Apple at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. Farrar noted that a Wall Street Journal article reported that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025, showing the potential of the field. One of the major lures for tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to develop broadband internet is to tap into the large demographic of people who don’t yet have internet access, notes Bloomberg. Facebook has long espoused this goal. The report also states that Apple might be putting its satellite experts to work on something else closely related — such as drones or near space technology like high bandwidth radio transceivers or high-altitude balloons. Whatever it is, however, likely has its home in the sky.

EVERETT — Friday was an unseasonably sunny day in Everett, but that probably was little comfort for the hundreds of Boeing workers who were laid off. Nearly 500 union workers were told they’ll be without jobs in 60 days. A Boeing spokesman declined to say how many non-union workers were laid off. Managers were included in the layoffs. The cuts are part of a company-wide campaign to slash costs that Boeing executives say is necessary to stay competitive. While the company faces financial and market challenges, its executives have added to them by repeatedly pledging to boost profits to record highs and rain more cash on shareholders. Boeing laid off 277 engineers and technical workers represented by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), including 191 in Everett. It also laid off 217 Machinists union members. Some of the Machinists already had been laid off in March, according to Jon Holden, head of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District Lodge 751, which represents roughly 30,000 Boeing workers around Puget Sound and in Portland. “I hate to see layoffs,” Holden said. “These jobs are so important for our communities and the aerospace industry” in Washington. Competitors already are trying to snap up talented engineers and others. “We’ve been contacted by recruiters for Raytheon, Honda and a third aerospace firm in Palm Beach,” Florida, SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich said. He did not know who the Palm Beach recruiter represents. Lockheed Martin recruiters recently came to the area searching for talented engineers. “That’s good news for laid-off engineers — and bad news for Boeing,” which trained many of the people laid off Friday, Dugovich said. Boeing is past the busiest periods for several major development programs: the 737 MAX, 777X and 787-10. So, the layoffs could simply reflect the declining workload, said Scott Hamilton, an aerospace analyst based on Bainbridge Island. Most of the laid-off SPEEA members work at Boeing Commercial Airplanes: 247 compared to 30 assigned to Boeing Defense, Space & Security. From SPEEA’s perspective, the layoffs have more to do with promises to shareholders than development schedules, Dugovich said. The company faces financial headwinds in the next few years. Its top-earning jetliner programs, the 777 and 737, are expected to bring in less profit — for different reasons. Orders for new airplanes have dropped as airlines’ credit cards cool off following a nearly decade-long spending spree. At the same time, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg repeatedly has pledged to rain more cash on shareholders and to boost profit to record highs. He and other company executives say that cost-cutting, increasing efficiency, better earnings from the 787 program and cranking up 737 production will offset the financial headwinds. Chicago-based Boeing has slashed its workforce over the past few years. Company executives in December said they plan to cut jobs in 2017 at about the same pace as last year, when Boeing’s total workforce dropped by nearly 11,000, including about 7,000 jobs cut in the commercial airplane division. The company continued cutting jobs this year with a new round of buyouts and limited layoffs. So far, the company has trimmed more than 2,000 jobs this year, including about 1,800 buyouts and more than 200 layoffs. At the end of March, the aerospace giant employed 146,962 people around the world. Nearly half — 70,640 — work in Washington, including more than 35,000 in Everett. The number of Boeing workers in the state has dropped by nearly 9,000 since the end of 2015. Boeing Commercial Airplanes, based in Renton, is the company’s largest division, and employed 74,196 people as of March 30. That is down from 83,508 at the end of 2015, an 11 percent reduction.

Photo / Chris Ratcliffe After revolutionizing phones, Apple is testing self-driving cars and exploring augmented reality. Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet's Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple's private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn't respond to requests for comment. With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications. In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates, wrote in a recent blog.

Related Content Brian Gaynor: No reason to go back to the bad old days 60-plus, swindled and flat broke Imposing GST on low-value imports doesn't level the playing field A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook is to connect billions of people who don't have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. "You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren't inhibited by the hard knocks of the past," said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra. Still, TMF's Farrar said there's no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its "internet from the sky" plan more than a decade ago. It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation. Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It's already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela's new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It's internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet's Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple's augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet's Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs, a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb, and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Qualcomm's Sales Decline for Baseband Modems for the iPhone 8 will hurt their Bottom Line | Main April 21, 2017 Apple may be Backing Boeing's Low-Earth Satellite Constellation Project that would Compete with Google, SpaceX & Others In a new report this afternoon we learn that at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insider Tim Farrar said Boeing's low-earth satellite project was being funded by Apple. Tim Farrar is a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates. The reason that this speculation may have some meat on its bones is because Apple has recruited a pair of Google satellite executives for a new hardwared team. Google is backing the OneWeb project. Whether it's another dream chasing team like Apple's Project Titan for electric cars is unknown at this time, but Apple has to dream big if they want to tap into possible emerging markets. Bloomberg's authors try to stitch together a plausible scenario and you could read their full story here.   Boeing's application for a license from the Federal Communications Commission to launch and operate a network of 1,396 satellites was actually reported on last June. Boeing want's to be able to compete with SpaceX (Elon Musk) and OneWeb (backed by Google) in a race to build constellations for broadband Internet access. The catch is that Boeing stated that the project would launch in six years after obtaining approval from the Commission. So this isn't a project 'just around the corner' and why speculating too far ahead is close to useless.   In total, Boeing says that they would eventually have 2,956 satellites designed to provide Internet and communications services for commercial and governent users around the globe.   According to the LA Times report, Boeing was still working out whether it will actually provide the service or just make the satellites and get them into orbit, and where the satellites will be built.   Marco Caceres, senior space analyst for the Teal Group, said at the time that the new plans for satellite constellations are driven by the potential of increased access to and new uses of the Internet. 'Everybody's trying to propose these massive constellations and be the first one to get it up there and take advantage of creating a whole new market. No one wants to be left behind."   So we can understand that Apple has to get their head around how they can craft hardware and services to take advantage of such a new satellite based Internet service.   While this kind of venture has been dreamed up before and failed, this next generation of satelites could make it economically feasible. A secondary L.A. Times report posted in December 2016 noted that "Launching one of these smaller satellites can cost a fraction of the price for a larger, school-bus-sized satellite. These new satellites will largely be mass-produced.     If this latest wave of satellite networks gets off the ground, it could pose a challenge to a $224.6-billion industry currently dominated by telecom and cable companies with their miles of fiber optic and copper wires.   Taylor Palmer, industry analyst at market research firm IBISWorld stated in the 2016 report that satellilte networks are "going to shake up how these operators are controlling different regions, and it's going to allow the consumer a little more of an option."   If Apple still has any dreams of a true TV challenging service that could bypass the cable networks, satellite networks would be the way to go.   Once Boeing entered the market, their possible future competitors attempted to point to the flaws of their proposed system. FierceWireless posted a report on this in November 2016 titled "Boeing responds to 'errors' and 'flawed assumptions' about its proposed satellite system in 37/39 GHz band."   Who were some of these Boeing competitors? Interestingly enough, they're also Apple competitors, Samsung and Nokia. So would it be in Apple's interest to fund Boeing's project and prepare a backup business plan for the next-wave of the internet? Yes of course.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Paul Ausick April 21, 2017 12:35 pm EDT Print Email Tweet European aircraft maker Airbus on Thursday delivered the first A321neo off the company’s assembly line to long-time customer Virgin America, which is now part of Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK). Virgin America has been a long-time customer of Airbus and before Thursday’s delivery flew 63 of the company’s A319s and A320s. Each A321neo is powered by two CFM LEAP-1A engines, and they will become the largest planes in the Virgin America fleet, with seating capacity for 185 passengers in two classes on routes up to about 3,750 nautical miles. That’s enough range to fly nonstop from Anchorage to Miami. The meaning of yesterday’s delivery can’t have been lost on Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). Alaska flies Boeing’s 737 exclusively and has a fleet of 158 the planes with 46 unfilled orders including 32 for the new 737 MAX. But even Boeing’s 737 MAX 9, which the company took on its first test flight just last week, does not come with the credentials of the A321neo. In a two-class configuration, the plane’s passenger capacity is slightly less than the A321neo’s at 178, its range is slightly less at 3,515 nautical miles. The MAX 9 uses two CFM LEAP-1B engines. The Airbus orders and deliveries spreadsheet shows no A321neos on order from Virgin America nor is there an entry in the spreadsheet for Alaska Airlines, which has never ordered an Airbus commercial jet. Still, the A321neo claims 1,385 orders of a total of more than 5,500 for single-aisle Airbus planes. Boeing’s latest order book shows 3,703 orders for the 737 MAX but does not specify how many orders have been placed for each variation of the plane. There are believed to be about 500 orders for the MAX 9. The first commercial flight for the Virgin America A321neo is set for May 31, originating in San Francisco and terminating in Washington, D.C. Alaska Air has announced that the Virgin America brand will disappear in 2019.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple may be funding Boeing’s satellite system for global broadband coverage Christian Zibreg on April 21, 2017 2 Today’s report from Bloomberg on Apple’s latest high-profile hirings includes a passage that sheds light on Boeing’s alleged talks with Apple regarding a broadband satellite service. According to Boeing’s regulatory filing, the aerospace giant is planning to blanket the Earth with more than a thousand satellites providing fast Internet coverage throughout the United States and internationally. According to authors Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen, Boeing has talked with Apple about investing in or partnering on the project. It’s unclear from the report if those talks might result in a deal. However, industry consultant Tim Farrar recently quoted an insider who unequivocally stated that, yes, Boeing’s project is indeed being funded by Apple. Of note, Boeing’s former CEO and Corporate President, James Bell, joined Apple’s Board of Directors in October 2015. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Internet from the sky? What Boeing is basically proposing here is a NGSO (non-geostationary satellite orbit constellations) low-earth orbit satellite system with the aim of providing better-than-cellular broadband coverage throughout the United States and internationally. To that extent, Boeing asked the FCC to consider the allocation and authorization of additional uplink spectrum in the bands 50.4-51.4 GHz and 51.4-52.4 GHz so that it could create a full five gigahertz of paired spectrum for V-band operations. Here’s an excerpt from the filing (emphasis mine): This new uplink spectrum will help create a five gigahertz block of uplink spectrum that, paired with fixed satellite service downlink spectrum in the 37.5-42.5 GHz band, will enable very high data-rate V-band satellite broadband services that will be deployed in the near future. The system would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems, bringing communications service to all users at the same cost regardless of location. There are currently four gigahertz of allocated satellite uplink spectrum in USA: 47.2-50.2 GHz: Not yet designated for fixed satellite service use. 50.4-51.4 GHz: Shared between NASA/military and commercial entities, with co-primary allocations for fixed, fixed satellite, mobile and MSS services. 51.4-52.4 GHz: Currently allocated for terrestrial fixed and mobile wireless services. The 50.4-51.4 GHz and 51.4-52.4 GHz bands are well-suited for satellite use because they are not being used by terrestrial wireless, at least not in the United States. Boeing explains that millimeter wave technology and phased arrays forming numerous small transmission and receive beams allow fixed satellite service systems to re-use individual frequencies many times within the beams of a given satellite transponder. Potentially lucrative business Nearly 100 million Americans, many in rural and remote areas, lack access to broadband. More than 23 million American in rural areas have access to broadband Internet with speeds lower than 25 MB down and 3 MB up. And when it comes to the baseline 25 Mbps downstream service, three out of four Americans homes are served by a single provider or none at all. The cost of deploying terrestrial broadband remains extremely high so the opportunity exists to bring ubiquitous satellite Internet access to those areas that remain underserved. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. Boeing’s filing sums it up nicely: By bringing comparable Internet speeds, performance and prices to Americans regardless of where they live, satellite broadband systems also have the potential to create new national broadband competitors and re-invigorate the United States telecommunications marketplace. Could Apple be funding Boeing’s satellite constellation so that it could sell its own high-speed telecommunications and data services to iPhone owners? Only time will tell. But we do know: Apple is starting a whole new hardware team for which it hired two Google executives who specialize in satellites for collecting images and those for communications.

EVERETT — Friday was an unseasonably sunny day in Everett, but that probably was little comfort for the hundreds of Boeing workers who were laid off. Nearly 500 union workers were told they’ll be without jobs in 60 days. A Boeing spokesman declined to say how many non-union workers were laid off. Managers were included in the layoffs. The cuts are part of a company-wide campaign to slash costs that Boeing executives say is necessary to stay competitive. While the company faces financial and market challenges, its executives have added to them by repeatedly pledging to boost profits to record highs and rain more cash on shareholders. Boeing laid off 277 engineers and technical workers represented by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), including 191 in Everett. It also laid off 217 Machinists union members. Some of the Machinists already had been laid off in March, according to Jon Holden, head of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District Lodge 751, which represents roughly 30,000 Boeing workers around Puget Sound and in Portland. “I hate to see layoffs,” Holden said. “These jobs are so important for our communities and the aerospace industry” in Washington. Competitors already are trying to snap up talented engineers and others. “We’ve been contacted by recruiters for Raytheon, Honda and a third aerospace firm in Palm Beach,” Florida, SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich said. He did not know who the Palm Beach recruiter represents. Lockheed Martin recruiters recently came to the area searching for talented engineers. “That’s good news for laid-off engineers — and bad news for Boeing,” which trained many of the people laid off Friday, Dugovich said. Boeing is past the busiest periods for several major development programs: the 737 MAX, 777X and 787-10. So, the layoffs could simply reflect the declining workload, said Scott Hamilton, an aerospace analyst based on Bainbridge Island. Most of the laid-off SPEEA members work at Boeing Commercial Airplanes: 247 compared to 30 assigned to Boeing Defense, Space & Security. From SPEEA’s perspective, the layoffs have more to do with promises to shareholders than development schedules, Dugovich said. The company faces financial headwinds in the next few years. Its top-earning jetliner programs, the 777 and 737, are expected to bring in less profit — for different reasons. Orders for new airplanes have dropped as airlines’ credit cards cool off following a nearly decade-long spending spree. At the same time, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg repeatedly has pledged to rain more cash on shareholders and to boost profit to record highs. He and other company executives say that cost-cutting, increasing efficiency, better earnings from the 787 program and cranking up 737 production will offset the financial headwinds. Chicago-based Boeing has slashed its workforce over the past few years. Company executives in December said they plan to cut jobs in 2017 at about the same pace as last year, when Boeing’s total workforce dropped by nearly 11,000, including about 7,000 jobs cut in the commercial airplane division. The company continued cutting jobs this year with a new round of buyouts and limited layoffs. So far, the company has trimmed more than 2,000 jobs this year, including about 1,800 buyouts and more than 200 layoffs. At the end of March, the aerospace giant employed 146,962 people around the world. Nearly half — 70,640 — work in Washington, including more than 35,000 in Everett. The number of Boeing workers in the state has dropped by nearly 9,000 since the end of 2015. Boeing Commercial Airplanes, based in Renton, is the company’s largest division, and employed 74,196 people as of March 30. That is down from 83,508 at the end of 2015, an 11 percent reduction.

Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies.  The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.'s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple's private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn't respond to requests for comment.  With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications.  In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal.  At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.  "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025.  A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook Inc. is to connect billions of people who don't have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. "You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren't inhibited by the hard knocks of the past," said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra Inc. Still, TMF's Farrar said there's no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its "internet from the sky" plan more than a decade ago.  Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It's already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela's new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It's internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet's Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple's augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet's Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs Inc., a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb Ltd., and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX.  Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. -- With assistance from Alex Webb, Julie Johnsson and Ashlee Vance Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Charles Mudede Embattled Mayor Murray Surprises Everyone With a Proposal to Tax Seattle's Rich: According to the Seattle Times, Mayor Ed Murray proposal to impose a city income tax on the rich had for many at a forum for mayoral candidates that happened in a Lake City church last night the unmistakable air of coming out of nowhere. It was like nothing he had said before. And why was he saying such a thing now? Was he looking for light, any light out there, because his political career is in its darkest hours? Seattle Times says that the former Mayor Mike McGinn, who attended the forum, and who announced his run for mayor early this week with, indeed, a proposal to tax the rich, could not hide his surprise when he heard Murray talking his talk, and also the talk of the progressive organization Transit Riders Union, which, with other like-minded organizations, believe the tax is needed to "Trump-Proof Seattle." (The urban planner and activist Cary Moon and lawyer and activist Nikkita Oliver also participated in the forum.) Our embattled mayor even said he was going to do this thing in a matter of weeks. The City Council would vote on it; but even if it cleared that hurdle, it would most likely end up stuck in our courts for lord knows how long. The rich hold on to their money with the tenacity of a dead man. What Are The Current Layoffs At Boeing Really About? According to an internal memo from John Hamilton, the head of engineering for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the job cuts are all about keeping the company competitive in a harsh market environment. So, those who lose their jobs should not take it personally. It's just business. But the real reason for the cut is found in the heart of the excellent and frank post on Everett's Herald Net: Boeing executives have promised to keep sending more cash to shareholders and to boost profits to about 15 percent of revenue, more than 50 percent above the company’s performance last year. They also pledged to continue spending billions of dollars to buy back issued shares, driving up the value of outstanding shares. It's not that Boeing is not making profits (seven percent profit is actually a big deal); but the company is not making enough profits for its shareholders, who need big profits today in order to extract more wealth from the future, capitalism's final frontier. If profits are small today, then more of tomorrowland closes up.

One is said to be a 19-year-old man; the other, a 17-year-old girl. According to KOMO, this is how it all went down: They took stuff (booze and so on) out of the store allegedly without paying for it. When confronted by a store employee, one of the teens, the 19-year-old man, allegedly pulled out a gun. If he did so or no, one thing is for sure: these were the last moments of his young life. The countdown to his Armageddon started. He may have sensed this, for what else is a moment of danger but the feeling that this might be it, this is what undoes me—this avalanche in the distance, this speeding and skidding car, this charging water buffalo—this is how I end. That attendant of the 7-Eleven? He was looking at one of the last persons he would ever see again. And the sky—that sky, which was blue around this time with, in the distance, clouds as big and majestic as continents? If he looked up, that was the last bit of blue he would see because in a few minutes all would be nothing to him. Cops were called, soon arrived, and almost immediately contacted the suspects. A struggle ensued; and the 17-year-old girl allegedly hit one of the cops over the head with a beer bottle. Bullets were exchanged. An officer's chin was hit. One officer's hand was hit. Another officer's life was saved by their bulletproof vest. The 17-year-old girl was captured, and the 19-year-old man was found dead in an office building he had slipped into. The police have not informed the public of how this young man died. He was only 19, in a madman's dream. 2 Seattle Police officers shot following downtown robbery, suspect dead: https://t.co/eoZkzZM4dt pic.twitter.com/t0ON7llWZf — KOMO News (@komonews) April 20, 2017 Louisiana Man Who Has Been Shrimping for Years Is Just Like Trump: He hates science.

Yesnowitz and Chuck Jones Grant Thornton LLP Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm �A recent determination by the World Trade Organization (WTO) serves as a reminder that incentives that states provide to attract businesses are subject to potentially restrictive international trade requirements.1 In late 2016, a WTO panel determined that a conditional tax incentive that Washington was providing to Boeing was a prohibited subsidy under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) because Boeing was required to use domestic goods. States and companies that receive substantial incentives should be aware of the WTO requirements. SCM Agreement Requirements The SCM Agreement outlines rules regarding whether a WTO member such as the United States may provide a given subsidy. Under the SCM Agreement, a subsidy exists where "there is a financial contribution by a government or any public body within the territory of a Member."2 Due to this provision, the SCM Agreement applies to state and local governments. The agreement allows most WTO members to receive subsidies, but Article 3 of the SCM Agreement describes the subsidies which are prohibited. Specifically, Article 3.1(b) prohibits "subsidies contingent, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over imported goods."3 Subsidies are administered throughout the world as a tool for recognizing government policies, in the form of grants, tax exemptions, low-interest financing, investments and export credits.4 In fact, it is common practice for companies within the United States to receive benefits through the use of grants, tax exemptions and credits. States authorizing and companies receiving these benefits may need to consider whether the benefit is in fact a subsidy that is subject to WTO requirements. Two Types of Subsidies The SCM Agreement creates two basic, exclusive categories of subsidies: those that are prohibited and those that are actionable.5 Prohibited Subsidies There are two categories of prohibited subsidies. Export subsidies: These are contingent subsidies, in law or fact, whether wholly or as one of several conditions, on export performance. A detailed list of export subsidies is annexed to the SCM Agreement.6 Local content subsidies: This category consists of subsidies that are contingent, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over imported goods. The above-listed subsidies are prohibited because they are designed to directly affect trade and are most likely to have adverse effects on the interest of other WTO members. Actionable Subsidies Most subsidies are considered to be actionable subsidies and are not prohibited.7 However, these subsidies may be challenged, either through multilateral dispute settlement or through countervailing action, if they cause adverse effects to another WTO member.8 WTO Panel Determined Washington Subsidy Was Prohibited The European Union (EU) alleged that legislation enacted by Washington relating to the development, manufacture and sale of large civil aircraft constituted prohibited subsidies.9 In its complaint, the EU listed "seven separate tax incentives, including a reduced business and occupation tax rate, credits against business taxation, and exemptions from other taxes in the state of Washington"10 as incentives that were prohibited subsidies. On November 28, 2016, a panel formed by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) issued a report concluding that one of the tax incentives alleged by the EU, the Business and Occupation (B&O) tax rate reduction, which Boeing received for manufacturing and selling commercial planes under the 777X program, was a prohibited subsidy because it was contingent on the use of domestic goods over imported goods. Specifically, the lower tax rate was contingent on Boeing using plane wings that were manufactured in Washington. The panel recommended that the subsidy be withdrawn within 90 days. The panel report has been appealed by the United States and currently is being considered by the Appellate Body.11 Commentary Due to the broad implications of government subsidies, states and companies must be aware of the international trade requirements. When a government subsidizes projects, the benefits may extend well beyond the industry directly concerned. For example, companies that supply materials and components to the targeted industry may also benefit. The WTO panel found a Washington B&O tax reduction that was granted to Boeing was a prohibited subsidy because of a requirement that domestic goods be used. The total tax incentives package that Boeing received has been reported to be $8.7 billion,12 but the subsidy that was found to be prohibited would only be a portion of this amount. The WTO has specific procedures for settling disputes.13 If a country that is the subject of the complaint loses, the country is required to follow the recommendations of the panel report or appeals report. The country must state its intent to comply at a DSB meeting within 30 days or request additional time if necessary. If the country does not comply within the prescribed period, it is required to negotiate with the complaining country or countries to determine compensation that is mutually acceptable. In situations where compensation is not agreed upon within 20 days, the complaining countries may request the DSB for permission to retaliate. The DSB monitors the implementation of its rulings. In the Boeing dispute, if the Appellate Body affirms the panel recommendation, Washington presumably would be required to withdraw the prohibited subsidy and Boeing would return the funds to the state. Prospectively, states should consider the WTO requirements when enacting legislation or entering into agreements that provide substantial incentives to a company. Similarly, companies receiving large incentives or subsidies from a state should be cognizant of this potential issue. Though incentives are used throughout the United States and in other countries to encourage development within certain areas, states and companies must evaluate whether or not the agreement is considered either a prohibited or actionable subsidy as the incentives from states may result in WTO challenges.

Note that this decision is being appealed. As described on its Web site, "the World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with global rules of trade between nations. Its main function is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible."

Annex I, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, World Trade Organization. 7 For example, a production subsidy. 8 There are three types of adverse effects: (i) injury to a domestic industry that is caused by subsidized imports in the complaining country's territory; (ii) serious prejudice (usually a result of adverse effects such as export displacement in the market of a subsidizing member); and (iii) nullification or impairment of benefits accruing under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 (typically arises where improved market access that is presumed to flow from a bound tariff reduction is undercut due to the subsidy). 9 DS487: United States � Conditional Tax Incentives for Large Civil Aircraft, Word Trade Organization Panel Report, Nov. 28, 2016. The challenged Washington provisions were enacted by S.B. 5952, Laws 2013. 10 Summary of Key Findings, DS487: United States � Conditional Tax Incentives for Large Civil Aircraft, World Trade Organization Panel Report, Nov. 28, 2016. 11 On December 16, 2016, the United States notified the DSB that it had decided to appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations in the panel report to the Appellate Body. On January 17, 2017, the EU notified the DSB that it intended to cross-appeal the decision. On February 10, 2017, the Appellate Body announced that it would not be able to release its decision within the 60-day or 90-day period required by Article 17.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. 12 Paul Shukovsky, Washington State to "Wait-and-See" on WTO Boeing Ruling, BLOOMBERG BNA WEEKLY STATE TAX REPORT, Dec. 1, 2016. 13 For a discussion of WTO dispute settlement, see https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm.

An artist's impression of the SB&gt;1 Defiant, which Sikorsky-Boeing is developing for the US Army's Joint MultiRole - Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD)/ Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. (Sikorsky) Speaking to reporters on 18 April, programme leaders said that recently aired comments in the media that the X2's rigid co-axial rotor and pusher propeller technology could not be scaled-up into the Defiant were wide of the mark, and that there should be no problems in doing so. "There have been some comments as to whether the X2 scales-up to the [Defiant]. There are some issues with regard to the loads on the rotors increasing as they increase in size, but at this time they are not a challenge. We had the Critical Design Review at the beginning of 2016, and the design was closed-out at that time. We are meeting all of the predictions, and I don't see any restrictions on what we can do to this vehicle in terms of scalability," Sikorsky Vice-President of Future Vertical Lift and Mission Systems, Dan Spoor, said. The X2 demonstrator incorporated many of the technologies that will feature in the SB&gt;1 Defiant Programme officials see no problem in scaling-up from the 6,000 lb to the 32,000 lb Defiant. (Sikorsky) Developed by Sikorsky to cruise comfortably at 250 kt while retaining excellent low-speed handling, efficient hovering, and safe autorotation combined with a seamless and simple transition to high-speed flight, the X2 incorporated a number of advanced technologies that included fly-by-wire flight controls, counter-rotating all-composite rigid rotor blades, hub drag reduction, active vibration control, and an integrated auxiliary propulsion system that included a pusher propeller that was driven by the same gear box that also turned the main rotors. Weighing 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) and accommodating a crew of just two, the X2 was significantly smaller than the 32,000 lb (14,515 kg) and up to 18-person Defiant. Partly in order to help bridge this gap, Sikorsky developed its X2-derived S-97 Raider, which weighs in at 11,000 lb (4,990 kg) and can accommodate up to eight crew and passengers. Want to read more?

NASA Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement Next time you spot an airliner flying overhead, consider that it would have looked virtually the same back in 1960. But the shape of planes to come could see a dynamic shift over the next 20 years. Almost every commercial jetliner, from the first Boeing 707 to the jumbo 747 and the superjumbo Airbus 380, features the identical tube-and-wing layout: a cigar-shaped fuselage with engines hanging off a pair of wings at the midpoint, and a trio of stabilizers at the tail. Airline-tried and passenger-tested, this arrangement is pretty much how jets have always looked, so it's no surprise that it's what today's designers still consider the best and safest way to fly the friendly skies. Related: Driving on the Roads of the Future Will Be a Real Trip As the aviation industry gears up for its next generation of redesigns, the archetypal airframe is showing amazing staying power despite a half-century of astonishing innovation in aerospace technology. The continuing tenure of these airliners has been aided by the fact that all the world's airport gates are built to handle its shape. Also crucial is its ease of maintenance, since engines mounted below the wings provide simple access for mechanics. Add in the industry's cautious approach toward adopting technology — in stages, only after proof and FAA certification — and it's easy to see why steering away from existing equipment isn't all that easy. A Change in the Air Commercial aircraft operations today account for almost 8 percent of all transportation-related carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S., and over the next 20 years the worldwide fleet is expected to grow by some 36,000 airplanes — costing upwards of $5 trillion — to fulfill worldwide travel demands. The prospect of this unprecedented surge, plus stricter emissions limits and rising fuel costs, could, at last, bring visible changes to the familiar airliner, says James Heidmann, manager of the Advanced Air Transport Technology project at NASA Glenn in Cleveland. This transformation would be the biggest since the jet was introduced in the mid-1950s. Three industry teams spent 2011 studying how to meet NASA's goals for making future aircraft burn 50 percent less fuel than aircraft that entered service in 1998, emit 75 percent fewer harmful emissions; and shrink the size of geographic areas affected by objectionable airport noise by 83 percent. NASA NASA's New Aviation Horizons initiative, an effort to explore large-aircraft designs and greener technologies is currently unfunded and on hold. But the four chief contractors for the subsonic concepts, Aurora Flight Sciences, Dzyne Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing, successfully completed their research contracts, Heidmann reports. One of the initiative's goals is to craft airliners that burn half the fuel of current jets and generate 75 percent less pollution while being much quieter. Breaking the Mold Dzyne's Blended Wing Body concept. Dzyne Technologies Most striking of these futuristic designs are Boeing's and Lockheed Martin's hybrid wing body, and Dzyne's blended wing body. With wings and fuselages melded at various degrees, these efficient flying machines are almost whale-like in appearance, featuring clean lines and voluminous interiors that are particularly suited for carrying military cargo. Boeing's Truss-Braced Wing concept. NASA Boeing's Truss-Braced Wing concept has a standard tubular fuselage that's a bit more familiar, but it mounts on long, thin, high-efficiency wings supported by diagonal trusses — like a Piper Cub on steroids. Its glider-like wings are so long that their tips would likely have to fold up to fit at the airport gate, adding unwanted weight and complexity. The "double bubble" D8 Series future aircraft design concept comes from the research team led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NASA/MIT/Aurora Flight Sciences Meanwhile, the double-wide fuselage of Aurora's D8 Double Bubble airliner — seemingly two cigars merged side-by-side — enables the introduction of a new, fuel-saving propulsion concept NASA researchers call Boundary Layer Ingestion, or BLI. It's a potentially game-changing technology, Heidmann says, but one that requires moving the engines from the wings to the top of the rear fuselage (a layout that mimics Lockheed's L-1011 Tristar, a pioneering design of the recent past). Suck it in, Spit it Out One promising BLI-based airliner design is the STARC-ABL, an acronym for 'single-aisle turbo-electric aircraft with an aft boundary layer propulsor.' Think of a standard Boeing 737, except with a large module the same diameter as the fuselage attached to the tail — like a wasp's stinger. STARC-ABL. NASA This airliner "combines the benefits of hybrid-electric propulsion with the proven tube-and-wing configuration," Heidmann says. Such a BLI-demonstrator could be possible in five to ten years. Inside its stern-mounted power pod is an electrically driven fan that provides propulsion while also ingesting much of the slow-moving 'boundary layer air' that flows next to the fuselage. This low-energy air enters a front intake vent and is blown out the back, reenergizing the plane's wake to cut aerodynamic drag. Boundary Layer Ingestion primeimages / Getty Images/iStockphoto The STARC-ABL carries downsized, less fuel-thirsty turbofan engines on its wings that can produce thrust or generate electric power, allowing the hybrid-electric design to operate like a flying Toyota Prius. During takeoff, the engines would supply 80 percent of the necessary thrust, with the remainder delivered by the aft-mounted, in-line electric fan. Studies show that the concept airliner offers a potential 10 percent to 15 percent improvement in fuel consumption, even considering the extra weight of the additional module. Another BLI-Based Concept BLI technology is also the "make-or-break" aspect of Aurora's D8 Double Bubble concept, says John Langford, company chairman and CEO. The D8, which is being developed in concert with MIT and Pratt & Whitney, moves the engines away from the "clean" airflow conditions below the wings to the top rear of the double-wide fuselage. The challenge of the D8 design is determining whether the smaller, lighter turbofans, which are normally engineered to work in uniform air flows, will be able to operate in the unsteady air flows at the back of the plane. In this case, every time the engines' front fan blades swing down toward the airplane's skin, where slower, boundary layer air flows, the blades are exposed to severe stresses. Aurora D8. "This is like getting hit by a hammer once every time your fan blade goes around," says Heidmann, who notes that a separate NASA-led research consortium recently completed wind tunnel testing a BLI engine to better understand its function. "Now we have a better idea how to design a fan that can operate in this distorted flow environment." Langford is confident BLI propulsion will work just fine on the D8. And because the design's double-wide, oval fuselage creates a significant amount of aerodynamic lift and its engines are integrated into its surface, the wings can be smaller, ensuring that the plane will fit at existing airport gates. "Of all the X-Plane concepts, it's the least disruptive to the airlines and the airports," Langford says. Related: These Giant Drones Could Seriously Disrupt the Shipping Industry Aurora's CEO is likewise sure the D8's wind-cheating features will combine to make it extremely economical to fly. At the same time, the design's top-mounted engine position and the distinctive tail structure will shield engine noise. "The best thing about the D8 design is that it allows two aisles for easy seating and deplaning," Langford says of its wider, short interior. "And with the engines positioned to the rear, the cabin would be very quiet. Passengers will love this plane." Electric Airliners on the Runway Another novel concept is NASA's X-57 Maxwell, an electric aircraft that features 14 small, electrically driven propellers that line the wings. Intended for exploring the feasibility of electric propulsion (a potentially quieter and greener way to fly), the X-57 is one of several speculative aircraft designs and propulsion concepts that have recently garnered interest among the aviation community. This artist's concept of the X-57 Maxwell shows the plane's specially designed wing and 14 electric motors. NASA Langley/Advanced Concepts Lab, AMA, Inc. Two more electric plane startups have come to light just in the last month. In a partnership with British budget airline EasyJet, Wright Electric plans to develop a 150-seat electric airplane that would make short flights from New York to Boston or London to Paris. Meanwhile, Zunum Aero's stated goal is to build its electric-hybrid airliner prototype within the next two years. And citing continuing progress in electric propulsion technology, European aerospace giant Airbus announced plans to drop its all-electric family of light aircraft to work instead on a larger aircraft with a more powerful electric propulsion system. Called E-Fan X, it could fly within three years. Artist conception of the two-seater version E-Fan 2.0, which will be a fully electric training aircraft powered only by batteries. Courtesy Airbus Group Ideally, all these aircraft would be powered by clean, green electrochemical batteries, but current technology doesn't provide all that much power for the weight, which severely limits range. The batteries on NASA's X-57 prototype are estimated to weigh in at about 800 pounds each compared to the fuselage of the 3,000-pound vehicle. Put another way, the jet-fuel capacity of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner is reportedly around 223,000 pounds. A battery pack that can store an equivalent amount of energy would weigh about 4.5 million pounds. Related: Could This Be the Battery That Revolutionizes Our Cars and Phones? Airbus engineers estimate that a regional aircraft might require up to 20 megawatts of power, which would mean that its batteries would need to be ten times more powerful than any available today. Failing a major breakthrough in battery technology, these electric jets will need to rely on hybrid power plants similar to that used in the SPARC-ABL concept. Supersonic Transports Reborn After the withdrawal of the Concorde supersonic transport (SST) more than a decade ago, faster passenger air travel could once again be in the cards now that aerospace engineers have made progress toward supersonic flight without the sonic boom. A boom-less supersonic airliner would be able to overfly land, whereas the Concorde was limited to flights over the ocean. An artist's concept of a possible Low Boom Flight Demonstration Quiet Supersonic Transport (QueSST) X-plane design. The award of a preliminary design contract is the first step towards the possible return of supersonic passenger travel - but this time quieter and more affordable. Courtesy of Lockheed Martin NASA is sponsoring the preliminary design of a quieter, "low boom" demonstration aircraft — the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) — by Lockheed Martin. Following feasibility studies and efforts to better understand maximum acceptable sound levels across the country, the QueSST project aims to produce a plane that creates a relatively soft thump rather than a big boom. Boom Supersonic And earlier this year, a startup firm called Boom Supersonic announced it had raised the necessary capital to build and fly an arrow-shaped supersonic jet demonstrator, the XB-1, which will a one-third scale prototype of the airliner it hopes to someday sell. The bigger Boom jet aims to travel from New York to London in just three hours and 15 minutes, less than half the time it now takes, at a ticket cost of $2,500 each way. With continued perseverance and a bit of luck, it's probably just a matter of time before you see new shapes flying overhead. Follow NBC MACH on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

All you need to know The whereabouts of the Boeing 777 has remained a mystery since 2014 and now the search to find it has been called off By Amanda Devlin 21st April 2017, 10:00 am Updated: 21st April 2017, 11:30 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments DOOMED Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared without a trace. Analysis of the plane’s last moments have suggested that it crashed at a high speed without a pilot in control. Alamy 4 Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board Hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is called off But, months after the hunt to find was called off - after almost three years - Australian scientists have said they believe it lies north of the former search zone. Here is all you need to know: Why was the search called off? The missing aircraft, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew, vanished in March 2014 - with researchers saying they had been looking in the wrong place. Despite experts never having found the body of any of its passengers, the hunt for MH370 was set to end after nearly three years. On January 17 it was officially announced as over by officials in Australia. Only 33 pieces of wreckage were found during the hunt, which saw investigators searching the deep sea areas near to the suspected crash site, and scanning the water by air. News that the search teams have abandoned their mission saw a series of conspiracy theories resurface – so here are the key facts about the missing plane. On the third anniversary of when MH370 went missing, the Australian government minister in charge of the suspended seabed search for the Malaysia Airlines jet told victims' families and friends at an anniversary church service that he remained hopeful that the plane would be found. Darren Chester, minister for infrastructure and transport, said: “While to date we have been unsuccessful, we remain hopeful that at some stage in the future, there will be a breakthrough, the aircraft will be found, and we will be able to answer more of your questions.” The Malaysian Government added: “We remain ever hopeful that we will be able to find the answers we seek when the credible evidence becomes available."   What happened on March 8, 2014? Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur carrying 239 people on board. They included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadn't been home in a year. The plane had recorded 7,525 take-offs and landings as well as 53,420 flight hours when it made its last journey. 'Alien hunter' claims to have spotted MH370 at the bottom of sea The MH370 Boeing was seen for the last time on military radar at 2.14am, close to the south of Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca. Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was "Good night Malaysian three seven zero". Half an hour later, the airline lost contact with the plane. It had been due to land at around 6.30am. The search and rescue: What happened next? Evidence from a military radar suggested the plane had suddenly changed course. Dozens of rescue planes and ships moved their search efforts to the sea west of Malaysia before the country's Prime Minister Najib Razak claimed MH370 had been deliberately diverted by someone on board. He added that they believed it had continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with air control. In the end, the search spanned to almost three million square mile - which is 1.5 per cent of the earth's surface. MH370: New items wash ashore on Reunion A week after disappearing satellite images of possible debris appeared to suggest that the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, south west of Australia. But the search for the black box in this area was abandoned after nothing was found. Now it seems that the search took place in the wrong location. An international investigation revealed that the search area needs to be extended to an untouched 25,000 kilometre square area in the southern Indian Ocean. In April 2017 report by Australia's national science body CSIRO supported the theory that the plane's wreckage was north of the original search area. the report used data and analysis from ocean testing of an actual Boeing 777 flaperon. Aidan Ellis 4 In total 1.5 per cent of the earth's surface has been searched for the missing plane When was debris from the plane discovered? On July 29, 2015 - more than a year after the plane's disappearance - debris was found by volunteers cleaning a beach in St Andre, Reunion. A week later investigators confirmed the debris did belong to MH370, but it did not help to locate the plane as it had drifted in the water. On October 7, 2017  it was announced that two wing flaps found in Mauritius came from missing flight. Some shocked relatives found it difficult to believe that this was genuinely debris from the plane. They said they think their loved ones are still alive and are being held at "an undisclosed location for unknown reasons." AFP 4 A map showing pieces of debris scattered from the Malaysia Airlines jet that went missing in 2014 What has MH370's debris revealed? The wing flaps showed that the plane was not in a landing position when it plunged into the ocean, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said. If the pilot was planning a controlled ditching of the plane, the wing flaps would have been configured for landing. As this was not the case, a report by the bureau concluded that the aircraft appeared to be "out of control" during its final journey. Flight MH370 was not in a controlled descent when it plunged into the Indian Ocean Chief search operator Peter Foley said: "You can never be 100%. We are very reluctant to express absolute certainty. "You can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone was in control." If someone had been controlling the plane it could have glided much further than thought - meaning rescuers could have been searching the wrong area. More than 20 bits of debris suspected or confirmed to be from MH370 have washed ashore on coastlines throughout the Indian Ocean. However, a deep sea sonar search for the main underwater wreckage found nothing. Getty Images 4 This shows a trailing edge section of Boeing 777 left, outboard flap, originating from the Malaysian Airlines aircraft What are the theories about the fate of MH370? 1) Russian president Vladimir Putin was accused of being involved in the hijacking of MH370. by a US Science writer. Jeff Wise claimed Putin "spoofed" the plane's navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome  so he could "hurt the West". 2) French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked. A book called Flight MH370 – The Mystery also suggested that it had been shot down accidentally by US-Thai joint jet fighters suring a military exercise and covered it up. 3) Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested that the crash could have been suicide. He said that someone on-board could have taken out a large life insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back money they owed.

Business Economy Are Trump's plans to revive Export-Import Bank a good thing? A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., Tuesday, July 28, 2015, in Washington. The fe Jacquelyn Martin / AP A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., Tuesday, July 28, 2015, in Washington. A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., Tuesday, July 28, 2015, in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin / AP) By Phillip MolnarContact Reporter Export-Import Bank of the United States Donald Trump President Donald Trump plans to revive the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which provides loans to foreign entities to enable them to buy American goods. Some conservatives have argued it hurts American jobs and interferes in the free market. Many large companies, like Pfizer, cheered the move. Question: Do you think reviving the Export-Import Bank of the United States is a good thing? Phil Blair Phil Blair, Manpower Not participating this week. Kelly Cunningham Kelly Cunningham, National University System NO: While claiming to help small business, 97 percent of the bank’s loan guarantees go to just 10 corporations, led by Boeing and General Electric. Forcing working Americans to subsidize the trade of wealthy companies that can easily afford their own is not sound economic policy. It is the backwards form of corporate welfare subsidizing rich companies. Government guaranteeing of the loans results in money poorly invested, serving special interests, and businesses being an extension of politics. David Ely David Ely, San Diego State University YES: In an ideal world, firms would compete for customers in global markets without the involvement of government agencies. However, many national governments have created entities like the U.S. Export-Import Bank to facilitate the financing of exports to foreign buyers on attractive terms. Without the support of the Export-Import Bank, U.S. firms pursuing customers in global markets would find themselves at a competitive disadvantage to their foreign competitors. Gina Champion-Cain Gina Champion-Cain, American National Investments NO: The Export-Import bank is a political tool as evidenced by both presidents Trump and Obama having railed against it on the campaign trail only to support it once elected. Conceptually, the bank was to aid U.S. small-business export markets. In practice the program almost exclusively provides below market financing for the largest corporations in the country. Three months into the new administration we can now rest assured that policy is firmly in the hands of lobbyists. Alan Gin Alan Gin, University of San Diego YES: Conservatives argue that the Export-Import Bank interferes with the market mechanism, which is the case. However, in doing so, it helps promote the purchase of goods manufactured in the United States and, in turn, employment in those industries. It is particularly important in helping people and companies in foreign countries buy big-ticket items such as airplanes, farm equipment, and industrial equipment. There are probably some abuses in the program, but they should be corrected as opposed to eliminating the program completely. James Hamilton James Hamilton, UC San Diego NO: The Export-Import Bank helps foreigners buy goods from certain U.S. firms. The bank may subsidize sales of Boeing jets to Emirates Airlines in hopes of boosting U.S. exports of planes. But when a foreign resident purchases a ticket from Delta Airlines, that also counts as a U.S. export. If the bank helps Emirates take market share from Delta, it’s not clear that it’s increasing exports overall. These decisions too easily become another way politicians can reward their supporters. Gary London Gary London, London Moeder Advisors Not participating this week Norm Miller Norm Miller, University of San Diego NO: Such a government bank does nothing for smaller manufacturers and the larger U.S. companies have other private sector alternatives to help finance purchases, including seller financing off their own balance sheets. I’d prefer the government stay out of ventures the private market can handle solo, and not compete with private banks or the capital markets. This is one agency we do not need to re-start. Jamie Moraga Jamie Moraga, IntelliSolutions YES: It may help increase U.S. manufacturing jobs and allow the U.S. to compete more globally with other countries. The Export-Import Bank is designed to help provide loan guarantees to foreign buyers that they can’t get from conventional lenders. Without it, business is likely to go to foreign suppliers. The Bank helps large corporations like Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar, and their extensive supply chains that include small businesses, remain competitive in the global marketplace. Approximately 85 countries have similar Export-Import Banks; without one, it could put the U.S. at a global competitive disadvantage. Austin Neudecker Austin Neudecker, Rev Not participating this week. Bob Rauch, R.A. Rauch & Associates YES: The Export-Import Bank provides for American companies to compete in foreign markets or where countries require government guarantees that the bank's loans provide. President Trump must staff this with experienced banking executives with strong opposition to cronyism, the primary objection to this organization. The bank can and should be an important element in boosting the economy and specifically manufacturing employment. Lynn Reaser Lynn Reaser, Point Loma Nazarene University NO: It is a form of corporate subsidy and gives preferential treatment to companies, ranging from aircraft manufacturers to farmers, who benefit. A company with only domestic customers receives no benefit. It is a form of credit allocation, where political factors can dominate. Its only defense is that it counters subsidies offered by other countries to boost their exporting firms. A better solution would be to work towards such practices by all. Chris Van Gorder Chris Van Gorder, Scripps Health YES: If President Trump truly intends to reform the Export-Import Bank and eliminate cronyism, I believe reviving the bank could be a good thing. Historically, these loans have mostly favored a few large corporations, such as Boeing and GE, rather than benefiting smaller businesses, hence the criticism that it interferes with free markets. I don't agree with the argument that it hurts American jobs, given the purpose of the bank is to finance foreign purchases of American goods. Have an idea for an EconoMeter question?

Citing people familiar with the matter, the report notes that Apple has recently hired John Fenwick former lead of Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, who headed up satellite engineering at Google. Both now allegedly report to Greg Duffy, the Dropcam cofounder who joined Apple in January. Speculation on Duffy’s hire earlier this year suggested that he was “likely to be leading a special project at Apple that is operating like a startup within the company” but no further details were available at the time as to what such a project would be; the two most recent hires, however, suggest that Apple is pursuing another entirely new line of research and development. Fenwick and Trela are leading experts in the demanding and expensive field of satellite design and operation, generally representing work in the areas of image collection and communications. Bloomberg notes a regulatory filing last year where Boeing outlined a plan to provide broadband access through over 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit, and according to a person familiar with the situation, the aerospace company has allegedly spoken with Apple about being involved in that project, but it’s unclear if that’s directly related to this new special project, or even if those talks will result in any kind of a deal. However, according to a blog post by satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, industry insiders at the annual Satellite 2017 conference recently reported that Boeing’s project was in fact being funded by Apple. Unlike Google, Apple has traditionally shown little interest in becoming a telecommunications provider of any kind, however Farrar and other consultants in the satellite industry have suggested that Apple may be looking to make a mark in an entirely new area of satellite internet, which is expected to each $30 billion in revenue by 2025. Companies such as Boeing are exploring solutions to provide lower latency and faster speeds at lower costs than existing cellular systems, which could revolutionize wireless communications. However, as Farrar points out, there’s still no guarantee that Apple will be involved int he Boeing project, as it remains a high risk industry “littered with bankruptcies and other failures.” It seems equally likely that Apple may have hired the new executives for their expertise in unrelated areas, such as imaging capture systems for its mapping platforms. Despite Fenwick and Trela’s background, they’re reporting to a lead who has consumer product and imaging experience, suggesting that their expertise may have been brought on board for less far-reaching plans. As a whole, the new hardware team led by Duffy still reports to Dan Riccio, Apple’s SVP of Hardware Engineering, the department traditionally focused on developing the iPhone, iPad, and Mac hardware, as well as Apple’s augmented reality efforts.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple Hires Two Google Executives With Satellite Expertise Apple Hires Two Google Executives With Satellite Expertise Friday, 21 April 2017 (13 hours ago) Apple has recently hired John Fenwick and Michael Trela, two Google satellite executives, reports Bloomberg. Fenwick led Google's spacecraft operations, while Trela was head of satellite engineering. Both Trela and Fenwick are reporting to Greg Duffy, the former co-founder of camera company Dropcam. What the two are doing at Apple is unclear, but Bloomberg speculates they're either working on satellites for image collection or satellites for communications. Rumors have suggested Apple is using a fleet of drones to collect data to improve Apple Maps, with the company having filed for an FAA permit to be able to fly drones for commercial purposes. Apple also acquired Aether Industries in 2015, a previously unknown purchase. Aether Industries develops high-bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. On its website, Aether Industries shows off a range of high-resolution aerial imagery and claims to provide a "full imaging and mapping solution for full color aerial images." There's also evidence Apple is interested in deploying satellites for communication purposes. Boeing has been working on sending more than 1,000 satellites into low-earth orbit for the purpose of providing broadband access, and the company has reportedly been in talks with Apple.The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Former Boeing executive James Bell also joined Apple's board of directors back in October of 2015, another potential link between Apple and Boeing. It continues to be unclear if Apple will get involved with Boeing's broadband endeavor, but it's easy to see why Apple might be interested with Boeing aiming for faster speeds than existing cellular systems. Apple and Google declined to comment on the hiring, while Fenwick, Trela, and Duffy did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comments.Tags: Google, satellite, Aether Industries, Apple acquisitions Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 8 hours ago< > Embed Apple Signals Interest in Internet Satellites 00:41 Apple's next big launch may be a literal one as the tech giant seemingly has an interest in internet-beaming satellites.

Apple has a new high-flying project in the works. According to Bloomberg, Apple is getting involved in launching satellites that would beam down broadband Internet access. Recently, Apple poached two Google satellite executives to form a new hardware team within the company. John Fenwick led Google’s spacecraft operations and Michael Trela was head of satellite engineering. The report adds that Fenwick and Trela will now report to Greg Duffy, the Dropcam founder who joined Apple earlier this year. Presumably, they will be working on a secret project to design and develop Apple’s own satellites.  Another recent development that points to Apple’s growing interest in this area is a partnership with Boeing to launch more than 1,000 low-orbit satellites. Apple has held discussions with Boeing about being an investor/partner in the project, according to Bloomberg. Furthermore, aerospace insiders believe Apple is helping fund the Boeing satellites. It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation. “It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation,” wrote Tim Farrar, a satellite consultant at TMF Associates. “SpaceX alone could generate $30 billion in revenue from satellite Internet by 2025.” Why this matters: A world with better access to faster, low-latency Internet will definitely help Apple’s future. It would help increase the demand for the iPhone in emerging markets, and also help make connected homes the next big thing. There are a few caveats, however. Satellite-beamed “Internet from the sky” has long been a dream for major tech companies, including Google and Facebook, which would also benefit from a more-connected world. But launching a fleet of satellites has proven to be expensive and risky, and many satellite companies have gone out of business as a result. It’s entirely possible that Apple hired the ex-Googlers to work on a project that’s more down to earth. Duffy’s experience is more in consumer products and image-capturing, so perhaps Apple’s new hardware team could be creating drones for improving Maps, and thus replacing the camera-equipped minivans.

(Evan Vucci/AP) By Hans Baumann Friday, 21 Apr 2017 11:02 AM Current | Bio | Archive Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    NASA an independent Agency with 20,000 civil service employees and over 60,000 sub-contractors is in search of a mission. Since the Apollo program and the demise of the space shuttle, there are not many accomplishments to show for justifying its now 19.5 billion dollar budget. It got so bad, that for the past years after the demise of the space shuttle, the agency was not able to supply our astronauts in the International Space Station and had to rely on the Russians— as well as private contractors — to do it. So instead, why not send a man to Mars? According to The Wall Street Journal, NASA is working on a new Orion Space Launch System with Boeing and Lockheed Martin as the main contractors. This will be a mammoth rocket heavy enough to send men to outer space. A Boeing spokesperson said, "The possibility of NASA putting humans into the vicinity of the moon and onto Mars is exiting." Not to be outdone, Mr. Musk and his team will try with their Space-X Rocket to do the same. Their ambition is, according to The Wall Street Journal, " . . . within a few years to take humans around the moon and eventually land settlers on Mars." Who will pay the 20 billion plus dollar price tag? You, the taxpayer, of course. Living on Mars has been the stuff of fiction and the dreams of not so young children. Cashing in on this public mystique enticed NASA to research Mars by having their sub-contractors built un-manned space probes to Mars yielding impressive scientific results. Admittedly, this is a great public relations job vis-a vis the Russians and Chinese. Unfortunately, all data so far indicated that Mars is inhabitable not only for humans but also for tiny microbes. Consider: There is virtually no oxygen to breathe. However there is 96 percent CO2 gas and the atmosphere is very dusty (sand storms). You must be living in a virtual vacuum, since the pressure is only 0.087 pounds per square inch (compared to 14.7 pounds per square inch on earth). There are only traces of water. If they are found, they are briny. Even if you synthesize water from CO2, which is very energy-demanding, the water would evaporate immediately in the open due to the vacuum present Winds at the poles can reach 250 miles per hour The mean annual temperatures are -82 Fahrenheit  There is no way to produce food Worst of all is the extremely high radiation level of 76 megarays per year. Unprotected life could only exist if one would live 25 feet below the surface. To get to Mars which is 34 million miles away, it would take a minimum of 1.6 years, even if you could travel at 20,000 miles per hour. However to get there, one has to cross the high ghly radioactive Van Allen Belt. The outer layer of the belt at between 20,000 and 40,000 km above the Earth can have peak radiation levels of 500 million volts, which would need 5.5 inches of lead shielding to prevent harm A three-meter-diameter space capsule would need about 45 tons of lead to line the inside walls. No wonder, NASA is planning on building an enormous rocket, one which can lift 130 tons into space at a cost of $ 600 million per liftoff. One question persists. Why is it so difficult now to have man circle the moon? After all, it wasable to be done in December of 1968. At that time, three U.S. astronauts circled the Moon 10 times, returning to Earth.

However, new hires recently made by the company are making a satellite constellation project seem likely. AirPods A new Bloomberg report details that Apple has hired two former Google satellite executives as it starts a new hardware team. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.’s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. Satellite design and operation are highly expensive and the report notes that most projects in this field are focused on collecting images or for communications. An unnamed source shared that Boeing has plans to roll out a satellite broadband network and Apple has been it talks with the company about possible involvement. In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It’s unclear if those talks will result in a deal. However, Apple may be more interested in how this new hardware team headed by Fenwick and Trela could improve its maps services and possible integration with future AR features. It’s already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. This seems a more likely focus for this new endeavor as Fenwick and Trela’s direct report Greg Duffy has mostly image and video product experience from his time at Dropcam. The unnamed source(s) close to this matter also pointed out that Apple’s SVP of hardware engineering, Dan Riccio, will oversee this team as he already does for Apple’s AR work.

This project will use advanced sensing equipment mounted on a research aircraft operated by the NRC to measure the impact of biofuel blends on contrail formation by aircraft on five biofuel flights operated by Air Canada between Montreal and Toronto in the coming days weather permitting. During these flights the National Research Council of Canada will trail the Air Canada aircraft with a modified T-33 research jet to sample and test the contrail biofuel emissions. The sustainable biofuel is produced by AltAir Fuels from used cooking oil and supplied by SkyNRG. „We are pleased to support Canada’s research on the additional benefits of aviation biofuel. This project is an important step in furthering the industry’s understanding of how biofuel reduces aviation’s carbon footprint and overall environmental impact,” said Teresa Ehman, Director, Environmental Affairs at Air Canada. „Air Canada recognizes its environmental responsibilities and the importance of understanding and integrating environmental considerations into our business decisions.” „The National Research Council of Canada is proud to collaborate with our Canadian partners on this important research that will further reveal the viability of biofuels. By contributing our unique T-33 research aircraft specializing in contrail data collection and our expertise in emissions analysis, we hope to provide key information toward biofuel inclusion in all future flights,” said Jerzy Komorowski, General Manager of NRC’s Aerospace portfolio. „We significantly improve airplane fuel efficiency through constant technology and operational improvements,” said Sheila Remes, vice president of strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. „But additional efforts are required to achieve aviation’s ambitious carbon-reduction targets. Sustainable aviation fuels have the single greatest potential to reach those goals. Boeing is committed to supporting projects like this around the world to advance aviation’s knowledge and growing use of biofuel.” A reduction in the thickness and coverage of contrails produced by the jet engines of aircraft could reduce aviation’s impact on the environment, an important beneficial effect of sustainable biofuel usage in aviation. This project involves six stakeholder organizations, with primary funding from the Green Aviation Research and Development Network (GARDN), a non-profit organization funded by the Business-Led Network of Centres of Excellence of the Government of Canada and the Canadian aerospace industry.  The project has further financial support from the NRC and the enabling support of Air Canada ground and flight operations. In addition to Air Canada, other CAAFCER partners include (alphabetical order) Boeing, National Research Council Canada (NRC), SkyNRG, University of Alberta, and Waterfall. Air Canada and the environment To reduce its emissions Air Canada has adopted a four-pillar strategy that includes: the use of new technology, improved operations, infrastructure changes and the use of economic instruments. One example is Air Canada’s participation as an airline partner in Canada’s Biojet Supply Chain Initiative (CBSCI). It is a three-year collaborative project begun in 2015 with 14 stakeholder organizations to introduce 400,000 litres of sustainable aviation biofuel (biojet) into the shared fuel system at Montreal airport. The CBSCI project is a first in Canada and is aimed at creating a sustainable Canadian supply chain of biojet using renewable feedstocks. In 2012 Air Canada operated two biofuel flights one between Toronto and Mexico City as part of a series of commercial biofuel flights that took the secretary general of ICAO to the United Nations conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro; the second flight transported a number of Olympic athletes and officials on their way to the London 2012 Olympic Games. Air Canada is also investing in new aircraft. In 2016 the airline continued taking delivery of the most modern commercial aircraft now in operation – the Boeing 787 Dreamline. Initial results show these aircraft are delivering approximately 20 percent improvement in efficiency over the aircraft they replaced. Air Canada plans to introduce 37 of these new aircraft in the coming years. In addition, later this year, we will be acquiring up to 79 new Boeing 737 Max aircraft, expected to yield a 14 per cent decrease in fuel use over the most current narrow-body aircraft. In total, our aircraft investments represent a commitment of more than $11 billion at list prices. One of Air Canada’s most notable recent accomplishment is a 40 percent improvement in average fuel efficiency between 1990 and 2016. Air Canada is taking further steps to reduce its carbon footprint including: Through the National Airlines Council of Canada, supporting the Canadian government in Canada’s Action Plan to Reduce GHG Emissions from Aviation; Endorsing targets set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which include cutting CO2 emissions 50 percent by 2050 relative to 2005 levels; and, Building on its strong record of environmental legislative and regulatory compliance, Air Canada has established an Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 to address long-term environmental issues and challenges. Following publication in September 2015 of an updated ISO 14001 standard, Air Canada commenced a review of its current EMS and will continue working to bring it into alignment with the new standard.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Northrop leads defense contractors in first quarter lobbying By Gregory Hellman 04/21/17 08:30 AM EDT With Zach Montellaro, Connor O’Brien and Jacqueline Klimas LOBBYING TALE OF THE TAPE — NORTHROP LEADS DEFENSE FIRMS IN Q1: Northrop Grumman led defense contractors in lobbying spending during the first three months of the year, according to new lobbying disclosures. Northrop, which was chosen by the Air Force in 2015 to build the new B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, spent $4.3 million on lobbying during the first quarter. Similarly, it topped the defense industry during the same period last year. Story Continued Below Aerospace giant Boeing was second with $4 million in lobbying spending, and Lockheed Martin, which builds the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, was third with $3.5 million. United Technologies moved up to fourth at $3.1 million. And General Dynamics, which placed fourth last year, spent $3 million to round out the top five. Of the five highest spending contractors, only GD and United Technologies increased their spending on lobbying over the same period last year. MATTIS SAYS SYRIA HAS ‘DISPERSED THEIR AIRCRAFT,’ our colleague Bryan Bender reports from Tel Aviv: “Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday that, in the wake of punitive U.S. missile strikes, the Syrian Air Force has moved its combat aircraft to make them less vulnerable to attack — and re-issued warnings to the Assad regime not to use chemical weapons again. “In response to the recent U.S. strikes — the first against the Assad regime since U.S. forces began attacking the Islamic State in 2014 — Syria has reportedly moved its combat planes to a Russian base in the northeastern part of the country. “‘They have dispersed their aircraft, no doubt,’ Mattis said in a joint press conference with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman during the first visit to Israel by a Cabinet official from the new Trump administration. ‘They have dispersed their aircraft in recent days.’ “Mattis also confirmed recent reports that Syria, which was targeted by U.S. missile strikes for air attacks against rebel fighters using nerve gas, retains stockpiles of chemical weapons.” — EARLIER, MATTIS PLEDGED COUNTER-ISIS AID TO EGYPT, reports Stars and Stripes: “Defense Secretary Jim Mattis vowed Thursday that the United States will aid Egypt in its battle against terrorism, pledging to strengthen the military bond between the two countries strained during Barack Obama’s administration. “‘We agreed on the need for a renewed and strong security partnership, as the new administration comes in,’ Mattis said of his discussions Thursday in the Egyptian capital with President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Defense Minister Gen. Sedki Sobhy. ‘… I left Cairo very confident, very confident in the avenues we have to advance our military-to-military relationship, which has been a bedrock and has stood solid all these years.’ “Thursday’s meetings focused primarily on Egypt’s efforts to counter terrorism, primarily the Islamic State, which has infiltrated the country through its porous western border with Libya and has maintained a long-term insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, said U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.” Following the pledge, a video emerges appearing to show an Egyptian soldier killing unarmed men in the Sinai Peninsula, reports The New York Times. And Egypt releases an U.S. aid worker imprisoned on widely-derided charges of child abuse and trafficking following negotiations by the Trump administration, adds The Washington Post. — U.S. DECLINES TO GIVE ‘MOAB’ ASSESSMENT, writes our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: “The U.S. won't conduct a damage assessment following the drop of the ‘mother of all bombs’ on Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan a week ago, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Thursday. “The U.S. hasn't characterized its effectiveness in war through the number of enemy casualties for decades, Mattis said, citing lessons learned from body counts in the Vietnam War. “We stay away from [bomb damage assessment] in terms of the number of enemy killed,” he told reporters traveling with him in Israel. “It is continuing our same philosophy that we don’t get into that, plus, frankly, digging into tunnels to count dead bodies is probably not a good use of our troops’ time.” AIR FORCE ORDERS NORTHROP TO STOP WORK ON WAR-PLANNING NETWORK, reports Bloomberg: “The U.S. Air Force ordered Northrop Grumman Corp. to stop work on developing an upgraded war-planning network for air operations after Congress refused to approve more money for a project that’s doubled in cost and fallen more than three years behind on a key deadline. “The stop-work order, effective Wednesday, pauses development of the cyber-hardened network ‘until further notice,’ Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in a statement. The action was forced after the Senate Armed Services Committee declined to approve a request to shift, or reprogram, $66 million from other accounts to cover part of an overrun.” And Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain backs the Air Force, noting his committee would review the service’s plan for the program in the fiscal 2018 budget. “The Congress has given the military services greater authority for acquisition,” the Arizona Republican said in a statement. “I applaud the Air Force for taking responsibility for a troubled program and taking the initiative to reach a better solution.” HAPPY FRIDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we're always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

HAPPENING TODAY — SCIENCE & SECURITY SUMMIT: The Federation of American Scientists hosts its Science & Security Summit at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. MORNING D TRIVIA: Today’s trivia question comes from last week’s winner, Bill Bodie. What was President Ulysses S. Grant’s full given name, when was it changed and why? The first person to email the correct answer to Morning D (ghellman@politico.com) wins a mention in Monday’s edition. TERROR STRIKES PARIS AHEAD OF ELECTION, reports the NYT: “A gunman wielding an assault rifle on Thursday night killed a police officer on the city’s most iconic boulevard, the Champs-Élysées, stirring France’s worst fears of a terrorist attack, which could tip voting in a hotly contested presidential election that starts on Sunday. “The gunman was shot dead by the police as he tried to flee on foot; two other police officers and a bystander were wounded. The police quickly blocked access to the crowded thoroughfare, lined with restaurants and high-end stores, as a helicopter hovered overhead.” LAWMAKERS PLAN NEW ISIS-AUMF PUSH, via Defense News: “When Congress returns from recess, U.S. President Donald Trump will face a push from some lawmakers who say he should ask for their authorization to wage an extended war in Syria and Iraq. “A top House Republican, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, said the authorization passed after 9/11 has been stretched beyond its original intent. To fight Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces or the Islamic State group, Trump should submit a request to Congress, he told Defense News.” UNSHACKLED GENERALS MISS THE BIG PICTURE, writes the NYT: “ When Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the military’s top commander in the Pacific, ordered the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson “to sail north” from Singapore this month, he was oblivious to the larger — and incorrect — impression that he was rushing a naval strike force to confront an increasingly belligerent North Korea. “Four days later, when Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. dropped the most powerful conventional weapon in the American arsenal on Islamic State fighters in a tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan, he not only seized headlines around the world but also unintentionally signaled to dictators in Syria and North Korea that they might be the next target of what the Pentagon called the ‘mother of all bombs.’ “Instead of simply achieving tactical objectives, the timing of their actions surprised their bosses at the Pentagon, upset edgy allies and caught the White House flat-footed. Taken together, the episodes illustrate how even the military’s most seasoned four-star field commanders can fail to consider the broader political or strategic ramifications of their operational decisions, and some current and former senior officials suggested that President Trump’s decision to unshackle the military from Obama-era constraints to intensify the fight against terrorists risked even more miscues.” INDUSTRY INTEL — LOCKHEED RADAR PASSES REVIEW HURDLE, reports Defense News: “The Long Range Discrimination Radar that will be operational in Alaska in 2020 has passed the preliminary design review phase, hitting a major milestone for the program in less than 18 months from the contract award in October 2015, Lockheed Martin announced Thursday...” “The very large and powerful radar will support the ballistic missile defense system, primarily for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, or GMD, set up to defend the homeland against missile threats from North Korea and Iran. It will be networked to the company’s Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications system.” Trump calls North Korea a “menace,” although he declined to assess Kim Jong Un’s mental stability, our colleague Nolan D. McCaskill writes. — DIUx TO CONTINUE ‘FULL SPEED,’ DIRECTOR SAYS, via Jacqueline: “The Trump administration has told Defense Department innovation hubs started by former Defense Secretary Ash Carter to continue their outreach to nontraditional companies at ‘full speed,’ the leader of the program said today. “Raj Shah, who heads up the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, said his interactions with the new Trump administration have all indicated it's very focused on innovation and delivering the best technology to the warfighter.” WAR REPORT — RUSSIAN OFFICER KILLED IN SYRIA, reports Reuters: “A Russian marine major has been killed in combat in Syria, Russian news agencies reported on Thursday, confirming an earlier report that one of Moscow's highest-ranking officers there had lost his life. “Major Sergei Bordov was killed during an attack by militants on a garrison, they said, quoting the Russian defense ministry. The reports gave no further details.” — RESENTMENT FESTERS IN MOSUL, Reuters writes: “If you want to hear the resentment people of Mosul feel now that Iraqi forces have driven Islamic State out of most of the city, you should talk to Saddam Hussein. “Not the dictator, but the Mosul schoolteacher, who proudly shows off an identity card bearing the name which his parents gave him in the ruler's honor 45 years ago, and which he passed on to his sons... “Here in Mosul, where most people are Sunnis who feel disrespected by the authorities in Baghdad, he is still beloved, just one example of the many ways in which the local narrative veers sharply from that of most of the rest of the country.” TOP DOCS — HUNTER DINGS NAVY ON E-CIG BAN, via Jacqueline: “Rep. Duncan Hunter is asking the Navy to explain why it's no longer letting troops smoke e-cigarettes on ships, saying the service is denying them access to a ‘life-saving alternative to traditional tobacco use.’ “The Navy announced last week it's banning the use and possession of electronic cigarettes on its ships, submarines and aircraft beginning May 14. Sailors and Marines can still use e-cigarettes at shore bases in designated areas. “The service is implementing the ban after some sailors suffered ‘serious injuries’ including ‘first- and-second-degree burns and facial disfigurement’ when the lithium ion batteries in the units overheated or exploded.” Hunter vaped during a congressional hearing last year to prove there’s “nothing noxious about this whatsoever.” And you can check it out here. — CNA REPORTS ON SOF’S 30 YEARS IN THE ‘GREY ZONE:’ Special operations forces should focus more upon winning ambiguous conflicts rather than positioning for future conflicts, CNA concludes in a new report, published to coincide with U.S. Special Operations Command 30th anniversary.

There has been no emergency situations on the International Space Station (ISS) so far, but the US space agency is preparing for any possible eventuality. Nasa astronauts are thoroughly tested to ensure their good health over the duration of a mission, but in the case of a medical emergency, there needs to be a vehicle for rapid evacuation. The International Space Station. Image: Getty Images Currently, the Russian Soyuz spacecraft does double duty as an escape vehicle. Every astronaut on board has a seat reserved, which limits the number of crew working at the ISS at any point of time. Nasa is working closely with Boeing and SpaceX for getting their spacecraft ready to use as lifeboats for the ISS. The CST-100 Starliner from Boeing and the Crew Dragon from SpaceX are being thoroughly tested on the ground. The critical functionality for use as a lifeboat is that all the systems required for a safe flight back should be up and running in short notice. The air circulation fans, the thrusters and the life support systems have to engage within minutes. The Boeing CST-100 Starliner Kathy Lueders, manager of Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program says “Some systems will take longer to bring online, but the idea is to have spacecraft that astronauts can get into quickly for survival and then use to pull away from the station and come home if that is needed. Defining exactly what that means, and what the companies can do to make it real was the hard part. That’s why we took a teamwork approach from the start and why we’ve treated this as a partnership.” The SpaceX Dragon The spacecraft are also being prepared to be used as a temporary safe harbour, where the crew can sit it out while a problem gets fixed. Potential scenarios that require such a module to temporarily house the crew include an ammonia leak and failure in the electrical systems of the ISS. After the ground based testing, the spacecraft will be tested in orbit sans crew, and only then will the spacecraft be certified by Nasa for operational missions. The spacecraft could be docked to the ISS for months at a time.

Calgary-headquartered WestJet aims to kick off the service late this year with an initial fleet of 10 Boeing Co 737-800s planes. Bob Cummings, WestJet's executive vice president, commercial, told Reuters the new offering would feature an "a la carte model" of a base fare plus specific fees for services like checked baggage, only taken one step further. While other low-cost carriers have failed in Canada, WestJet's strategy would work by winning market share from competitors such as Rouge and Sunwing Airlines while cannibalizing some of its own traffic, Cummings said. "Between taking share from others and, quite frankly, taking some share from us, the math makes sense." Cummings declined to give specifics about the new fares, but said the cost structure would not be comparable to the deeply discounted fares offered by European ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryan Air. "We are not likely to be at the Ryan Air end of the spectrum," he said in a phone interview. WestJet, which started life as a low-cost airline, has added premium services in a bid to increase revenue, but is planning the ultra-low-cost structure to service the other end. In planning the new service, Cummings said WestJet considered both the comparatively high-cost structure of operating flights in Canada and examples from abroad, including low-cost Australian carrier Tigerair Australia, which is operated by Virgin Australia Holdings, and Jetstar by Qantas Airways. Consumer advocates have long complained that limited competition, high fares and airport fees make Canada a comparatively expensive country for air travel. Canada in November lifted foreign investment limits for Canadian airlines to 49 percent from 25 percent, a change spurring competition and lower fares by encouraging the launch of low-cost airlines. "We're trying to create a climate where passengers are offered lower costs and greater choice," Transport Minister Marc Garneau said by phone following WestJet's announcement. A spokesman for Air Canada was not available for comment. Cummings said the new carrier would focus on domestic and sun destinations served by WestJet's B737s. The new carrier appears to be avoiding short-haul domestic routes. "As you travel further, the percentage of taxes and fees becomes less of a burden," Cummings said. "We have a big country here."

By Eric Tegler Apr 21, 2017 Amidst the chaotic withdrawal of American forces from Saigon in April 1975, a young man in the South Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF), Tinh Nguyen, peered out from a bunker at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The airfield had been under North Vietnamese mortar fire all night and more than 100 aircraft had been destroyed. But there was still one flyable C-130A (the initial production version). During a lull in the firing, it taxied toward the runway navigating around the smoking debris. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below This massive plane's rear ramp was still open with a crowd of people huddling on it, and Nguyen knew he had to get to it. "It was either leave right then or stay and get killed." C-130 Hercules flying along the South Vietnamese coast. Getty Bettmann Archive With others, he made a desperate dash from the bunker toward the lurching C-130. "Every time [the pilot] jammed on the brake, it pushed the passengers forward," Nguyen told Fox News in 2014. "It created more space in the back… So, I jumped in. Everybody jumped in. And a few minutes after that, the ramp door closed..." Designed to carry only 90 paratroopers, the Hercules's belly was bursting with far more people than that. Its lone pilot, a VNAF major, pushed its four Allison T56 turboprops to full throttle and began his takeoff down the 10,000 foot runway. At the opposite end of the runway, the airplane still hadn't taken wing. "It was either leave right then or stay and get killed." But in the runway's 1000-foot overrun, the C-130 staggered into the air. After a harrowing flight, it touched down three and a half hours later at U Tapao Royal Thai AB, southeast of Bangkok. On the ramp, American personnel were visibly surprised as they watched 452 people disembark. With herculean effort, the C-130 had lifted more than 20,000 pounds above its operational limit. The C-130 has been a lifesaver during its six-decade history. It's been a death-bringer, too. Hercules Is More Than a Name U.S. Air Force Advertisement - Continue Reading Below With a squat stance, bulbous nose, four big turboprop engines, and massive fuselage, the C-130 cruises at a relatively modest 290 to 320 knots. Lockheed dubbed it "Hercules" after the mythological hero known for his strength and courage. The name fits the company's tradition of naming aircraft after celestial constellations, along with the P-2V Neptune and P-3 Orion. Compared to high-profile jet fighters like the F-22 Raptor or F-35 Lightning II, the Hercules looks like a bloated throwback. But what it lacks in sleekness it more than makes up for in heart. Like the A-10 Warthog, it's the Hercules' awesome capability that makes it a total badass. Simply put, the C-130 is a do-anything aircraft and its service record shows it. Lockheed says the C-130 has flown at least 100 different missions in its 63-year-old life, including its most recent return to the military limelight. On April 13, an MC-130 dropped the largest conventional bomb ever used in combat—the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), or "mother of all bombs"—on an Islamic State tunnel complex in Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province. The MC-130's crew released it from the rear cargo ramp using a drag chute, a procedure that dates back to before the Korean War. Indeed, that conflict is where the C-130 was born. During that war, the Air Force recognized it had no airplane capable of airlifting combat troops over medium distances to short, austere airfields. In 1951, Boeing, Douglas, and Fairchild presented alternative proposals, but ultimately the USAF chose Lockheed's design. Willis Hawkins, who would go on to design the Corona satellite, Polaris missile, and M1 Abrams tank, created the winning design and described the C-130 in a mere 110-page document. Compared to Lockheed's 2,500-page F-35 proposal, the C-130 writeup is a breezy read. According to Lockheed Martin historian Jeff Rhodes, Hawkins' design team took the M551 Sheridan Tank, the largest piece of equipment the Army needed to airlift, and "drew a circle around it and that set the diameter of the fuselage." As for the fuselage's 40-foot length, it's inspiration came from somewhere else entirely. "The basic C-130, aft of the cockpit and before the ramp, is the length of a railroad boxcar," Rhodes says.

Getty Stocktrek Images Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The YC-130 made its first flight on Aug. 23, 1954, at Lockheed's Burbank, California plant. With four Allison T56-A-lA turboprop engines, delivering 3,750 horsepower each and driving three-bladed Curtiss-Wright electric-reversible propellers, the YC-130 took off in only 800 feet. The Pentagon had found its plane. Whatever Is Needed Two U.S. colonels overlook production of the C-130 in Marietta, Georgia. Getty George Rinhart Production of the C-130A began at Lockheed's plant in Marietta, Georgia soon thereafter and the Herc has been rolling off the assembly line ever since. The Hercules has the longest continuous military aircraft production run in history, and one of the top three longest continuous aircraft production lines of any type. A remarkable 70 countries operate C-130s, which have been produced in more than 70 different variants. "The C-130 is whatever is needed," Rhodes observes. "It's an ambulance, it's a gunship, it drops paratroopers, it carries cargo, it's a TV broadcast system, it's launched drones, and caught satellites. You name it, the Hercules has done it at some point in its career." The Herc has served with the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, NASA, and foreign militaries and commercial operators (as the L100) all over the world. It's been an aerial refueler, forward air controller, hurricane hunter, fire tanker, Antarctic resupply aircraft, search-and-rescue platform, and on and on and on. "The C-130 is whatever is needed...you name it, the Hercules has done it at some point in its career." C-130s went into harm's way almost immediately with its first deployment to Europe in 1956, and the first combat loss came in 1958, when a C-130A-II was shot down over Armenia during a reconnaissance mission. While gaining notoriety for its performance ashore, the Hercules simultaneously made history as the largest, heaviest aircraft ever to land on and launch from an aircraft carrier, a distinction it earned in October 1963 as part of a test to assess its feasibility as a carrier onboard delivery aircraft.

Getty Bettmann Advertisement - Continue Reading Below A year later, the C-130A began sorties for the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam. They hauled cargo, dropped leaflets, and delivered weapons on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Foreshadowing President Trump's recent Afghanistan mission, C-130Bs also dropped a pair of 10,000-pound bombs in Vietnam in October 1968 as a means of clearing landing zones for helicopters. But the C-130 was more than an military brute, it was was one of three legendary Lockheed airplanes operated by the CIA in the 1960s, joining the U-2 and A-12 (SR-71) as an intelligence gathering tool. In 1969, a CIA-operated C-130E made a clandestine drop of sensor pallets near China's Lop Nur Nuclear Weapons Test Base to get information on Chinese nuclear capabilities. C-130B-II electronic reconnaissance aircraft operated in Europe and Japan and later C-130E models took on standoff jamming roles in the 1970s. In one of their more surprising roles, special EC-130E Commando Solo Hercs transmitted radio and TV broadcasts several hours a night over Iraq as part of psychological warfare campaigns as prelude to the 1991 Persian Gulf War and 2003 Iraq War. A Hawk of War, a Dove of Peace AC-130H jettisons flares during countermeasure training, 2007. U.S. Air Force Today's AC-130E/H/U/W Spooky/Spectre/Stinger gunship is renowned for its ability to protect special operations troops on the ground from Vietnam all the way up to the recent Afghanistan War with lethal 20mm/30mm/40mm cannon, and even 105mm Howitzer as well as additional smart bombs and missiles. In fact, one single AC-130 helped stop a southbound Iraqi armored column during the Battle of Khafji in 1991. But the Herc was also central to rescue missions, whether dramatic hostage situations like the successful 1976 Israeli Raid on Entebbe or the failed 1980 Iranian hostage mission, and has saved countless lives on land and at sea with the Coast Guard. Breaking more records, the C-130 is also the first fixed-wing aircraft to land at the site of natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, Haiti's earthquake, Fukushima, and the recent Peruvian floods. C-130H plots course to deliver medical supplies to Sendai, Japan after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. U.S. Air Force Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The Hercules even helps make other planes as it served as a testbed for what would eventually be the engines of the European Airbus A400M airlifter. Long story short, saying the C-130 is a jack of all trades is selling it short. But one important question remains: What is it like to actually fly the thing? "Flying low level, going into dirt or grass strips, landing at little places that nobody else could get to with this big airplane is so much fun," says former USAF C-130 pilot and Lockheed director of business development Larry Gallogly. "I think of all the assault landings I made early in my career which may not have been as smooth as I would have liked but the airplane could take a beating." More Badass Planes Why the F/A-18 Hornet Is Such a Badass Plane Why the F-22 Raptor Is Such a Badass Plane Why the A-10 Warthog Is Such a Badass Plane And "take a beating" is putting it mildly. In 1971, for example, a ski-equipped Navy LC-130 crashed on takeoff in Antarctica. It lay there buried in an icy crevasse for 17 years before the Navy decided to pull it out and repair the damage. It took off and flew to New Zealand on January 11, 1988, and with a little more work it served the Navy for several years thereafter. "We've been accused of making a pilot's airplane," says Lockheed Martin C-130 Chief Experimental Test Pilot, Wayne Roberts. The latest C-130J model upholds the Hercules' reputation as a sweet-handling airplane. Roberts adds that the Herc is so flexible, it can fly at speeds as low as 80 knots with one engine out. With its digital cockpit, automated flight systems management, six-blade Dowty propellers and Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprop engines, the latest C-130J/LM-100J enjoys one-third better range, 15 percent better fuel efficiency and 25 percent more thrust than legacy A-H models. New features from a sophisticated heads-up display to optional carbon brakes and upcoming next-gen radar make the C-130 more effective than ever before. GIF Lockheed Martin building the new LM-100J. Lockheed Martin The "J model" Hercules is taking on nearly all the roles of its predecessors. The LM-100J version will make its first flight in a few weeks, offering civilian operators the ability to haul heavy equipment—and even goats—to remote airports in places like central Africa. The new AC-130J gunship will not only carry a 105mm Howitzer, it will have the first significant airborne lasers. But just incase you're still not convinced of the C-130's badass nature, just ask Tim Nguyen about the hulking, do-everything aircraft that saved his life. "This is a magnificent machine...the sound of the engines, the look of the airplane… it will be in my mind forever. U.S. Air Force More from Popular Mechanics: PM_Logo Created with Sketch.

Credit: NASA New commercial crew spacecraft for the International Space Station will be able to do more than just carry astronauts to the orbiting lab: They will also serve as temporary shelters, or even fly crew home, if there is an emergency in space, according to NASA.  Currently, in dangerous situations, such as when a piece of orbital debris threatens the space station, crewmembers take shelter in the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. And if a medical emergency were to arise that could not be handled in orbit, the crew would head back to Earth in the Soyuz craft. The SpaceX Dragon and the Boeing CST-100 commercial crew spacecraft are both set to start crewed flights as early as next year, and NASA is working to ensure that these new spacecraft will serve most of the Russian spacecraft's protective functions, agency officials said in a statement. [ISS Tour: Russian Segment & Soyuz Spacecraft (Video)] "The scenarios that would call for the spacecraft to operate as space-borne lifeboats have not occurred on the International Space Station before, but mission planners have long made sure they are prepared," NASA officials added.  "An electrical issue or ammonia leak on the space station could call for astronauts to shelter inside a Commercial Crew Program spacecraft long enough to correct the problem." Today, the space station typically has six people on board, made up of two separate Soyuz crews, although the number sometimes reaches nine. Each person has an assigned emergency seat that he or she would use if the need were to arise. Therefore, the number of emergency seats limits how many people can be on the spacecraft at one time.  The Russian Soyuz can seat up to three people at a time. Depending on the crew configuration, the Dragon and CST-100 vehicles will each seat up to seven crewmembers. However, the new spacecraft must meet a strict list of NASA requirements to serve as a lifeboat. Specifically, NASA said the spacecraft must be able to turn on quickly, even after sitting dormant at a docking station for weeks or months. "Some systems will take longer to bring online, but the idea is to have spacecraft that astronauts can get into quickly for survival and then use to pull away from the station and come home if that is needed," Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in the statement. "Defining exactly what that means, and what the companies can do to make it real, was the hard part. That's why we took a teamwork approach from the start and why we've treated this as a partnership." Both Boeing and SpaceX are performing Earth-based tests of their spacecraft before doing in-orbit evaluations with a crew on board. After that, they will test their spacecraft's capabilities during a short mission. "Their performances in space — without an actual emergency — are to be considered carefully before NASA certifies the companies to fly operational missions, which could see a spacecraft docked to the station for months at a time," agency officials added.

The old adage that every investor hears is “buy low, sell high.” If only it were that easy! That’s always the end goal, but as we know, for every winner, there is a loser. To avoid the latter, we tend to ignore overheated assets. This brings us to our discussion of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Source: Yuanbin Du Via Flickr For such a mainstay in the financial markets, AAPL stock is exceptionally spirited. Year-to-date, shares are up 21%. To put this into perspective, Apple stock leads all other companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not even close. The next-best performer is Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which has garnered a comparatively small 15%. Needless to say, life is grand for investors of AAPL stock. That’s wonderful news for those that stuck to their guns and ignored the naysayers. But for those that are late to the game, they have a quite a dilemma. Do they buy into the strength of Apple stock, hoping for further gains? Or do they decide that the opportunity is far too deep to offer anything meaningful? AAPL Stock Is Built for the Long Haul To help answer the first question, we have to forecast whether Apple stock will continue to be relevant. That’s fairly easy to determine. This is Apple, not some speculative start-up company. It would be the shock of the century to witness Apple stock crumble. The difficult question is the latter — can AAPL stock do something for me in the here and now? Time and again, we hear the same thing about the iconic consumer tech giant: Against a variety of metrics, Apple stock represents great value. This isn’t just based on fundamental granularity. As InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth points out, the stock is assessed strictly as a hardware manufacturer. However, “it’s very much a service business with iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, etc.” The best part is that this business diversity is paying real dividends. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, service revenue for AAPL totaled $7.2 billion. That represents an 18% growth rate compared to the year-ago quarter. Should the trend continue to move forward — and there’s no reason to doubt it — the allocation of service revenue against total revenue will easily hit strong double-digits. Because of this shifting dynamic, Mr. Ashworth argues that the flagship iPhone doesn’t have to break records all the time. So long as sales don’t crumble, Apple stock will remain the undisputed king of consumer tech. It also helps that the competition is constantly playing catch-up. Although Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) are making strides, they can’t match the organic connectivity of AAPL. Seemingly, the dominance of Apple stock is assured.

In a move that is likely to place pressure on Australia, Malaysia and China to resume the hunt, Australia’s CSIRO said it has all but confirmed that the plane is in a 9,653 square-mile zone north of the original search zone in the Indian Ocean. Families of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the missing plane have been demanding the three nations reverse their decision earlier this year to suspend the search. Credit: Reuters The CSIRO has conducted fresh analysis of the likely drift route of a flaperon, or wing part, across the Indian Ocean. The analysis followed the discovery of a flaperon from MH370 on Reunion Island. Instead of using a replica flaperon – as was done in an earlier analysis – the scientists obtained a used Boeing 777 flaperon and then replicated the damage that was found on the MH370 wreckage. The subsequent drift analysis found the Boeing flaperon was faster and veered 20 degrees to the left of the models used earlier. This confirmed analysis from late last year which had pinpointed the plane’s location to the northern crash zone. "Testing an actual flaperon has added an extra level of assurance to the findings from our earlier drift modelling work," said Dr David Griffin, from the CSIRO. "We cannot be absolutely certain, but that is where all the evidence we have points us, and this new work leaves us more confident in our findings.” Credit: PA Using wind and current speeds, and the likely angle of the piece in the water, the scientists said the proposed zone was "very consistent with the July 2015 arrival time on [Reunion Island]". In January, authorities from Malaysia, China and Australia called an end to the search after a painstaking operation which covered a  46,000 square-mile zone in the southern Indian Ocean.  No trace of the plane was found, though numerous pieces of debris have washed up off the coast of south-east Africa. The authorities agreed to halt the search but said they would resume it if “credible evidence” emerged. Darren Chester, Australia’s transport minister, said the new analysis did not appear to constitute new evidence.

Earlier, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were primarily used for surveillance and patrolling. With the growing need for operational requirements, UAVs were armed and converted into UCAVs. Broadly, UCAVs are used for surveillance, direction of artillery fire, gathering electronic intelligence (ELINT) information, lasing targets for fighter aircraft, and for post-strike damage assessment. While several nations operate unarmed UAVs, as of 2016, only the US, Turkey, Israel, Italy, Iran, China, India, and Pakistan had manufactured UCAVs.

 The first Mars astronauts may be trapped inside of a tube for 3 years with no chance of escape Dave Mosher Apr. 21, 2017, 10:30 AM 72,380 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock NASA has finally revealed details about its plan to send astronauts to Mars. The plan calls for building an outpost to orbit the moon and test Mars hardware. A crew of four may have to spend up to three years inside of a Mars spaceship — yet never land on the planet. It remains to be seen if NASA's flat budget can facilitate reaching Mars by 2033. For years, NASA has talked about sending people to Mars with its gigantic new rocket, the Space Launch System, and a new spacecraft called Orion. But NASA hasn't said exactly how it plans to use this hardware, which it's spending $40 billion to develop — not even with the publication of a 36-page Mars exploration plan in October 2015. Fortunately, a plan may finally be coming into place. On March 21, President Donald Trump signed a law that mandates NASA send people to Mars by 2033. Then, a week later, the space agency published its most detailed plan yet for reaching the red planet. The scheme is neither for the claustrophobic nor the faint of heart. It involves locking astronauts into a tube-shaped spaceship, sending them into deep space for three years, and giving them no form of emergency escape beyond the moon. What's more, astronauts would only orbit Mars in 2033 — they'd never attempt a landing. That's according to a document by William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA's human exploration and operations directorate, that he presented during a NASA advisory council meeting on March 28. We learned about the presentation via a story by Eric Berger at Ars Technica. "NASA is leading the next steps into deep space near the moon, where astronauts will build and begin testing the systems needed for challenging missions to deep space destinations including Mars," NASA said about the plan in a press release. Getting to Mars in five phases An artist's concept of NASA's Deep Space Gateway space station, left, near the moon. NASA Gerstenmaier's program lists five phases to reach Mars. Phase 0 involves using the International Space Station "as a test bed to demonstrate key exploration capabilities and operations, and foster an emerging commercial space industry" with partners like SpaceX, Boeing, Orbital ATK, and others. We're currently in this phase. Phase 1 is ambitious, involving six launches between 2018 and 2025. First, NASA wants to launch its inaugural SLS rocket, a 321-foot behemoth that's designed to rival the Saturn V rockets that blasted Apollo astronauts to the moon. If the maiden flight and tests of its Orion spaceship went well, the space agency would launch five more SLS rockets. The first of those five would send NASA's unrelated Europa Clipper probe to Jupiter, where it would study an icy moon with a hidden ocean that may be habitable to alien life. Four other missions would each launch a piece of a new space station, called the Deep Space Gateway, into orbit near the moon — a region called cislunar space — where four astronauts would help assemble and provision it. "The gateway could move to support robotic or partner missions to the surface of the moon, or to a high lunar orbit to support missions departing from the gateway to other destinations in the solar system," Gerstenmaier said in the release. An artist's concept of NASA's Deep Space Transport spaceship, right, near the moon. NASA Phase 2 would build on the lunar space station by launching a Deep Space Transport to it in 2027. Then, around 2028 or 2029, four lucky astronauts would spend up to 400 days inside the 41-ton tube as it orbits near the moon. Their mission: make sure the DST works and nothing critical stops working. Phase 3 would begin around 2030, assuming the DST and its crew experienced no problems. Another SLS flight would restock the spaceship with supplies and fuel, then yet another launch would load it with four people — the first crew to visit Mars. Their two- to three-year flight "would likely involve a Venus flyby and a short stay around Mars" and "would offer no hope for an emergency return once the crew leaves cislunar space," Berger wrote. Phase 4 would happen beyond 2033 and is fairly nebulous at this point. All it calls for in Gerstenmaier's document is "development and robotic preparatory missions" to deliver habitats and supplies to the surface of Mars, plus eventual "Mars human landing missions." Will NASA put the first boots on Mars? NASA It remains to be seen whether NASA can pull off this grand plan on the relatively flat budget Congress keeps handing it. During the Apollo moon missions, NASA made up more than 4% of the US budget. Today, its share has shrunk to about half a percent. Even if NASA manages to execute this plan, it may have competition from the private partners it hopes to involve. The private sector may even beat NASA to Mars. Elon Musk, the founder of the rocket company SpaceX, recently said he planned to send people to Mars by 2022. Boeing has also challenged SpaceX in getting to the red planet. Musk said he was OK with this because all he wanted to do was colonize Mars and protect humanity from self-imposed annihilation or a rogue asteroid. "I think it's good for there to be multiple paths to Mars ... to have multiple irons in the fire," Musk said in August. Get the latest Boeing stock price here.

Hyperloop is an alternative mode of transportation that would cost less than a train and travel faster than an airplane. Pressurized pods would be sent through vacuumed-sealed steel tubes at very high speeds with little to no wind resistance.  The system would be run off renewable energy, as there would be solar panels attached to the top of the tubes. Since June of 2015 when Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and founder and CEO of SpaceX,  announced the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition, the Drexel Hyperloop Team worked to build a pod. “The team was born out of a senior design for the College of Engineering with 10 subsystems that rolled up into one Hyperloop pod,” Miranda Shroyer, a fourth-year junior with a finance, business analytics, and management information systems major, explained. According to Shroyer, in the beginning there were only about 20 students working on the project, but at its largest, the Drexel Hyperloop Team had 120 members. “It started as a grassroots effort where students were recruiting their friends and students were recruiting other people within their college and students were working to attain a goal. There was an actual product that was delivered at the end,” Shroyer said. Shroyer, who joined the effort in February 2016, was the leader of the steering committee and the head of sponsorship. Building a hyperloop pod is not an easy or inexpensive task. The team initially set out with a goal to fundraise $120,000 for parts. In the end, they were able to raise around $75,000. In order to raise that money, Shroyer had regular meetings with Drexel’s College of Engineering associate vice president of Institutional Advancement, Michelle Yurko. Shroyer would detail how much money the team needed and for what purpose and Yurko would help her find connections that could potentially donate money. Some of those connections included Boeing and PECO. “Drexel supported us wholeheartedly,” Shroyer noted. “Drexel will give you anything you need, you just need to find it. The university was so supportive of us and all the hard work we put into it.” Shroyer was initially apprehensive to give presentations to potential donors but with the help of her partner, Yoshi Mua, she was able to get over her nerves. Mua and Shroyer would spend several hours together every week, not necessarily going over their presentation but getting comfortable with each other. Once it came down to actually asking for money, Shroyer had gotten over her fear. “Presenting was easy and a no brainer,  [Mua and I] got to talk about something we loved… and once I realized that these people are genuinely interested in what I have to say and that I am so excited about this project I was able to move on.” There were several different tier levels for donors. Gold level donors gave over $10,000 and had the largest logos on the pod. These donors included Drexel University, who gave around $25,000, and an Australian biomedical group, ide Group. Blue level donor gave above $5,000, Dragon level donated above $1,500 and Bronze level donors gave above $500. Their logos on the pod varied based on tier level. “We had a combination of supply donations,  software donations, and cash donations…and we spent all of it buying parts to build the actual pod,” Shroyer said. In order to make it to the final stage of the competition, the team first had to make it through two preliminary rounds. Twelve hundred initial designs were submitted in the first round from 16 different countries. Drexel’s design was chosen along with designs from 120 other teams. These teams attended a design weekend at Texas A&M in January of 2016. After presenting their design in Texas, the Drexel Hyperloop Team was one of 31 selected to move on to the building phase of the competition. Teams built their designs and then showed them off at the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California this past January. “When we went out to SpaceX in January, we didn’t run our pod in the actual tube but we displayed it and had all our subsystems out and open so you could see what was inside of our pod. In the end, we had six or seven subsystems,” Shroyer explained. “What we were able to accomplish in a year was significant but it still wasn’t enough time.” The model that was built by the Drexel Hyperloop Team was a quarter scale model and reached a maximum speed of 250 miles per hour. A full scale hyperloop pod could reach 760 miles per hour and fit about 60 people. A 35-minute trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco would cost about $35 dollars per person. A credit course was offered at Drexel with Professor Pramod Abichandani to look into Hyperloop’s real world feasibility.   “We analysed what a Hyperloop would look like and we determined the best business case, at least initially, is actually cargo because the safety factor doesn’t have to be as high and as a long term proof of concept, it’s cheaper,” Shroyer noted.   Dubai has invested funds into developing a hyperloop and it is still being looked into as a feasible mode of transportation. SpaceX plans to make this competition annual, and while the Drexel Hyperloop Team isn’t currently active, there is a Hyperloop Competition II scheduled for August 25-27.

Alex Moore Email 12:48 Friday 21 April 2017 0 Have your say Councillors have approved plans to build a £50 million factory for supercar firm McLaren on the edge of Sheffield. Members of Rotherham Council's planning board this week granted Harworth Group PLC permission to put up the 75,000 sq ft building at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Waverley. McLaren will build its carbon-fibre chassis at the 50 million factory. The landowner will let the factory to McLaren, allowing the company to bring production of its carbon-fibre chassis to South Yorkshire in a deal that will create 200 jobs. Iain Thomson, associate director, partnerships and communications at Harworth, said: "We're naturally delighted that we've received planning consent for this unit, marking the next exciting phase of development at the AMP." Construction is due to start this year. The University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre nearby will build prototypes ready to be delivered in the second half of the year. Full production is expected to begin at the new factory by 2020. Sheffield City Region has agreed to pay £12 million towards the project from its business investment fund. The site is an Enterprise Zone benefiting from fast-track planning and tax breaks. Chairman of the City Region Local Enterprise Partnership Sir Nigel Knowles said: “I’m delighted to see this progress. “It’s absolutely fantastic to see McLaren coming to the north – the McLaren Composites Technology Centre will be the company’s first purpose-built facility outside its current campus in Surrey. "The region's £12 million commitment to the £50 million project has been critical to ensuring McLaren could get the project off the ground. “Strategic investment in projects which will create good quality employment is central to our target of creating 30,000 high value jobs and 6,000 new businesses.” Aerospace giant Boeing plans to build its first factory in Europe in the area. Boeing Sheffield will make hi-tech components called actuators for aircraft in a plant set to stand on the Sheffield side of the Parkway. Sheffield Council leader Julie Dore said: “McLaren Automotive’s move to the region has confirmed Sheffield City Region’s reputation as a world-leading centre of manufacturing excellence. "It will bring hundreds of millions to the economy, create the company’s first-ever graduate trainee programme and create hundreds of new, highly-skilled jobs. “It also shows what we can achieve working with the formidable research and development strengths of our two universities and our partners. "The building of the McLaren Composites Technology Centre can now take place and represents an important part of the journey for the company, and for the region as a whole, keeping this highly-coveted scheme on the right track.” Today’s top stories: VIDEO: Calls for safety barriers at Meadowhall Railway Station after girl, 16, is hit by train South Yorkshire MP Michael Dugher quitting Parliament to 'make a difference outside of politics' WATCH: Dramatic video captures moment man is 'wrestled to ground' by police in Sheffield street INTERNATIONAL NEWS: Policeman shot dead in Paris 'terror attack' Nando's reveals plans for fifth Sheffield branch Sheffield Wednesday: Rams face anxious wait over David Nugent Sheffield United: Chris Wilder admits to making a rare mistake ahead of MK Dons trip Sheffield Wednesday: Get all the latest Owls stats Download The Star's mobile app now for FREE Sheffield United: Get all the Blades stats Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   An unexpected big donor to Trump’s inaugural haul posted at 2:01 pm on April 20, 2017 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES I assume you’ve already seen the stories making the rounds about all that money President Trump raised for the inaugural. It’s really quite scandalous sounding, at least on MSNBC. But it’s not the total haul which is quite as interesting as the list of players who kicked in some cash. CNBC makes it sound like the League of Cartoon Villains got together to pull this off. Major corporations and business titans fueled a record fundraising haul for President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, according to newly released disclosures. The president’s inaugural committee raised $106.7 million, about double what was raised for President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, a Federal Election Commission filing shows. The biggest chunk of that haul came from casino magnate and major Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, who contributed $5 million. You can see who they’re highlighting here. Sheldon Adelson, naturally. And there’s the usual list of huge, but politically unpopular corporate outfits such as Bank of America, Boeing, Pfizer, Qualcomm and Dow Chemical, all of whom kicked in at least $1M each. But if you dig down a bit further in the records you come up with a company that the media doesn’t like to pick on so often and who is actually quite unexpected. Google. They only get a single line mention with no context offered, but they’re in there. And while they didn’t cross the seven figure threshold, it was still a pretty generous contribution. Here’s the receipt. (Click for full size image.) That’s well over a quarter million dollars. Of course, Google can afford such generosity any time they wish these days, so why is it so surprising? Mostly because they gave every impression of doing their level best to get Hillary Clinton elected in 2016 while trying to stymie conservatives at every turn. You may recall that Google’s Eric Schmidt wasn’t just at Clinton’s “victory” party in November… he was listed as being on the staff. No surprise, considering that Schmidt also reportedly drew up a campaign strategy plan for Hillary a full year before she announced her candidacy. Alphabet Inc. (a.k.a. Google) was Clinton’s second largest contributor in the campaign. If you follow the money, as the old saying goes, the Google gang’s all here when it came to supporting Clinton’s campaign. So what’s with this extremely generous deposit at the Bank of Trump’s Inauguration from Google? Could this be the fallout from the “oh crap” moment when they realized they’d backed the wrong horse and now they’re trying to purchase a bit of forgiveness? Not that I’m completely faulting them for the effort. That’s just the price of doing business. But I also have to wonder about two things here. First, how well is Google’s target audience responding to finding out that they dropped a bunch of cash on The Evil Trump? And second, is it really going to buy them any influence inside the White House at this point? Trump has proven that he has a long memory for those who sought to undermine him, as well as showing that he can raise plenty of money from his actual friends and supporters when he needs to. This isn’t world shaking news, I fully admit. Just one of those moments inside the Beltway that makes you go “hmmm.” Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES Tags: contributions, Donald Trump, Google, Hillary Clinton, inauguration Related Posts: Deputy DNC chair: Obama’s to blame for the state of the party Who could it be?

And while the space agency is hoping to induct U.S.-made spacecraft into service, the manufacturers need to build them with some very specific safety features. SpaceX and Boeing are both working on their own spacecraft — Crew Dragon and CST-100 Starliner respectively — for crewed flight. And according to NASA, the vehicles would need to be capable of both serving as an emergency shelter, as well as a quick getaway “lifeboat.” Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, said in a statement Thursday: “Some systems will take longer to bring online, but the idea is to have spacecraft that astronauts can get into quickly for survival and then use to pull away from the station and come home if that is needed. Defining exactly what that means, and what the companies can do to make it real was the hard part. That's why we took a teamwork approach from the start and why we've treated this as a partnership.” An illustration to show NASA's safety requirements from private commercial crewed spacecraft, manufactured by Boeing and SpaceX. Photo: NASA There hasn’t been a single instance yet on the ISS that has required emergency protocol of this nature to kick in, but when you are that far away from the closest hospital, it helps to be prepared. For example, an electrical issue or an ammonia leak could necessitate astronauts stay inside the commercial spacecraft while they work on fixing the problem. And in the event a bigger problem requires emergency evacuation, the spacecraft should be able to depart quickly. In discussion with designers from SpaceX and Boeing, NASA said the spacecraft must be capable of being “powered on quickly while docked to the station, even if it has been dormant for weeks or a couple of months. From air circulation fans to life support systems to thrusters, the spacecraft's systems will be designed to engage in minutes,” according to the statement.

Woodville-raised Mitchell has been at the world's biggest long-haul carrier for nearly 15 years. The ex-RNZAF Skyhawk pilot said the sessions in Auckland on April 28 and Christchurch on April 30 weren't formal recruiting days but were more about "spreading the word and sharing the information". Worldwide there is a shortage pilots and the New Zealand Airline Pilots Association says it is concerned New Zealand's own airlines are not investing enough in the ongoing training of local pilots. Mitchell said Kiwi pilots were sought after. ''We're looking for as many pilots as we can get at the moment - particularly given the level in which New Zealand-based training is held in high regard." Emirates pilots typically work 85 hours a month. At entry level a first officer is paid up to 44,450 Dirham ($17,031) a month including a housing allowance. That can be tax free depending on accounting arrangements. A captain with 7000 hours command time is hired on 58,770 Dirham a month, including an accommodation allowance. Staff also get other benefits, including insurance and free travel. Mitchell said Emirates flies to 155 destination in 83 countries and its 4227 pilots were busy. Continued below. Related Content Lessons from the United Airlines debacle Emirates cuts US flights, blaming Trump administration curbs Video Watch: Emirates celebrates first year connecting Dubai and Auckland ''It's a bit like the old Navy adverts - join Emirates and you'll see the world." Pilots would be flying the biggest passenger plane in the world, the Airbus A380 or Boeing 777s, ''which is no slug either". While average flying times are about six hours, the airline flies some of the longest routes in the world - up to 17 hours - and pilots can bid for the sectors that they want to do. From a pilot's satisfaction point of view it's horses for courses. Some don't adjust to different time zones and others only like ultra long haul. It really is a personal thing. ''They put in preferences to try and massage their rosters for them and the company - even the most junior pilot gets the chance to be at the top end of the bidding priority," he said. The airline was not targeting any particular group and was now able to hire those with a multi engine turbo prop background as well multi engine jets meaning some Air New Zealand link pilots would be eligible if they had sufficient hours. ''We've had great success with turbo prop pilots - those who fly the smaller aircraft often have more challenging roles flying lower altitudes close to icing levels and into smaller airports with limited facilities ." Pilots of 20 tonne aircraft with 2000 hours' experience would be eligible and those who had flown 10 tonne to 20 tonne planes needed 3000 hours. ''Its harder to get pilots - particularly experienced pilots - we have high standards and that's what we're after, the selection process is no cakewalk - Air New Zealand and all the good airlines do it." Trainees work in flight simulators then go out on the line with a training captain and build up their experience with up to 30 to 40 sectors of line flying, often more for those without jet experience. Emirates is also looking for freighter pilots, although the pay is lower they work on a 28-day on and 13 day off roster and on flights that take them to an even greater range of destinations than those flying passenger jets. Mitchell's father was an airman attached to the RAF. ''We grew up with this legend in our house." Mitchell spent 10 years with the RNZAF flying in its aerobatics squad and Skyhawks. He didn't follow the standard route from the Air Force into Air New Zealand. ''Around about that time they decided the Skyhawk pilots were a bit too much trouble and didn't have the right sort of background with too many bullets and bombs and not enough of getting on with people. So guys like me had to go abroad and get their experience." He taught in Saudi Arabia's air force for four years before flying for British Midlands. ''With 9/11 things got a bit tough and we decided to seek a bit of job security in the Middle East. It may seem a bit paradoxical that you would go to the Middle East for job security but from an airline industry perspective it is one of the best places to get a job as a pilot." He joined Emirates as a first officer in the A330, went on to be captain of A340s and in 2008 was appointed chief flying instructor for those aircraft. He's recently upguaged to A380s which he flies regularly - twice a month on average - together with his head office job in Dubai where nearly all Emirates' staff are based. Emirates is competing in a tough market for pilots. By Boeing's calculations there will be 617,000 new pilots needed within the next 20 years. The New Zealand Air Line Pilots Association says together with government and industry financial barriers must be lowered to entry in order to retain New Zealand's best talent. "Global demand for pilots are at an all time high and we must preserve New Zealand's expertise by ensuring working terms and conditions in New Zealand are attractive enough to provide a secure career path, thus delivering a safe and experienced piloting workforce in New Zealand," said the association's president Tim Robinson. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Calgary-headquartered WestJet aims to kick off the service late this year with an initial fleet of 10 Boeing Co <BA.N> 737-800s planes. Bob Cummings, WestJet’s executive vice president, commercial, told Reuters the new offering would feature an “a la carte model” of a base fare plus specific fees for services like checked baggage, only taken one step further. While other low-cost carriers have failed in Canada, WestJet’s strategy would work by winning market share from competitors such as Rouge and Sunwing Airlines while cannibalizing some of its own traffic, Cummings said. “Between taking share from others and, quite frankly, taking some share from us, the math makes sense.” Cummings declined to give specifics about the new fares, but said the cost structure would not be comparable to the deeply discounted fares offered by European ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryan Air <RYA.I>. “We are not likely to be at the Ryan Air end of the spectrum,” he said in a phone interview. WestJet, which started life as a low-cost airline, has added premium services in a bid to increase revenue, but is planning the ultra-low-cost structure to service the other end. In planning the new service, Cummings said WestJet considered both the comparatively high-cost structure of operating flights in Canada and examples from abroad, including low-cost Australian carrier Tigerair Australia, which is operated by Virgin Australia Holdings <VAH.AX>, and Jetstar by Qantas Airways <QAN.AX>. Consumer advocates have long complained that limited competition, high fares and airport fees make Canada a comparatively expensive country for air travel. Canada in November lifted foreign investment limits for Canadian airlines to 49 percent from 25 percent, a change spurring competition and lower fares by encouraging the launch of low-cost airlines. “We’re trying to create a climate where passengers are offered lower costs and greater choice,” Transport Minister Marc Garneau said by phone following WestJet’s announcement. A spokesman for Air Canada was not available for comment. Cummings said the new carrier would focus on domestic and sun destinations served by WestJet’s B737s. The new carrier appears to be avoiding short-haul domestic routes. “As you travel further, the percentage of taxes and fees becomes less of a burden,” Cummings said. “We have a big country here.” (Reporting by Allison Lampert; Additional reporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Will Dunham and Leslie Adler) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail NEW YORK:General Electric Co reported quarterly sales and adjusted earnings results that beat analysts estimates on Friday, but its shares fell on concerns about some of its industrial businesses and its cash outflow. The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment also reported a negative US$1.6 billion in cash flow from industrial operating activities compared with a negative US$600 million it expected for the quarter due to a US$1.3 billion increase in working capital and the timing of bills to customers. Investors have been watching cash flow as an indicator of GE's operating performance, and GE said it still expects to hit its cash target of US$12 billion to US$14 billion for the full year. Shares were down 2.3 percent at US$29.57 in afternoon trading, making it the second-biggest decliner on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "There was immediate disappointment that cash came in low," said Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital markets. Analysts asked numerous questions about it on the conference call and "it gave investors a reason not to feel good about the quarter." Advertisement The company also raised concern by giving itself wiggle room to deliver fewer LEAP aircraft engines this year, a key risk for the company. It said the range for the year was 450 to 500 engines, instead of nearly 500 it stated earlier. "It is notable that GE is taking a more cautious slant by backing away from a firm target of "500," Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said. But GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview there was no change in the LEAP forecast. "We're not changing our view on our ability to deliver the LEAP engine this year for Boeing and Airbus," Bornstein said. GE shipped 81 engines in the first quarter and expects to ship 100 in the second quarter, he said, adding: "There's no delays to customers whatsoever." GE beat analysts estimates for adjusted earnings and revenue, even though revenue fell 1 percent to US$27.66 billion, due to lower sales in its oil-and-gas and lighting businesses. Analysts expected US$26.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 21 cents a share were unchanged from a year ago and beat analyst estimates of 17 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said industrial organic revenue, which is from continuing businesses, grew 7 percent in the quarter, a strong showing according to analysts. Industrial operating profit margins rose by 1.3 percent points, also more than analysts expected, and ahead of the 1 percentage point forecast for the year. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt noted a 10 percent rise in quarterly orders and said the world economy was "an attractive environment for GE." "We see global growth accelerating, while the U.S. continues to improve," Immelt said on the conference call, adding that growth in China, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa this year were all "stronger than last year." Separately, European engineering groups ABB Ltd and Schneider Electric SE are competing for GE's solutions division, which could fetch as much as US$3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

By 1991, Mullis would have up to 70 dogs at the old Columbia city dog pound near the water treatment plant at any given time. None ran loose because they were threats to each other and to Mullis’ customers. One night that year, someone broke into the pound, stole some prime Rottweiler puppies, computers and tools. Then it happened again. Frustrated, Mullis threw up a crude electric fence around his property. It worked. Then, when a county jail in Georgia wanted to buy some guard dogs, Mullis offered them an electric fence because it was safer for employees and inmates. Then a salvage company asked for one when one of Mullis’ guard dogs bit off the owner’s thumb. From there, an innovative company with an odd name was born – Electric Guard Dog. “It was a combination of necessity and fluke luck,” Mullis said. Mullis sold the business to a private equity firm in 2007, and it has since been sold again. But the name has remained the same. And to some people it’s confusing. “For people who aren’t familiar with security, they confuse us with electric dog fencing. That’s a negative,” said current chief executive Jack DeMao “However when they hear our story, the logic of the name sticks with them.” Today, the company — located on the USC campus —installs high-tech, solar-powered electric security fences in 48 states for companies like Fedex, UPS and United Rentals. Last year it was voted Dealer of the Year by Security Distributing and Marketing Magazine. And unlike any other security company, Electric Guard Dog installs and maintains the fence and equipment for free and charges a monthly subscription service. The average subscription is about $1,000 a month on a 36-month contract. “Nobody is doing what we’re doing for commercial security,” DeMao said. “We took the concept of farm fencing, connected it with solar power, a monitoring system and an alarm system.” Using solar power is not only green, Mullis said, but ensures the security fences keep working when the power goes down during a storm or other emergencies. “I did solar from the beginning, because people would ask me about power outages,” Mullis said. “I was solar before solar was cool.” Electric Guard Dog has been expanding its business by 15 percent each year since 2007. The goal is to expand by 25 percent per year in the future, DeMao said. Currently, the company draws about $3 million a month in subscriptions,” he said. The company recently moved from its offices on Fairfield Road to the brand new, five-story Innovation Center office building at the corner of Assembly and Blossom streets. The building, on the University of South Carolina campus, is a partnership between the university and Atlanta developer John Holder. IBM also has a presence in the building. “We’re pleased that Electric Guard Dog has found a home at USC,” said Bill Kirkland, director of USC’s Office of Economic Engagement. “The Innovation Center, and the Innovista district in general, is an ideal place for growing companies who want to be in a vibrant location where researchers, students and entrepreneurs can interact on a daily basis. That’s a big part of the reason companies like Boeing and IBM have chosen to create partnerships with the university, and we look forward to even more successes in coming months.” Electric Guard Dog spent $800,000 to build-out the entire 20,000-square-foot fifth floor of the building. The move allowed the company to double its staff from 60 to 120. It also has 100 contractors nationwide. DeMao said being on campus has multiple benefits, from tapping into university research on such technologies as improved batteries and solar panels, to being able to draw from a large pool of interns and young professionals connected to USC. “It will be easier to find people to hire going forward,” he said, “I can offer (interns and new graduates) practical experience.” Because the technology is new, Electric Guard Dog often has to negotiate new regulations with individual states, counties and cities. “We’re Uber-like in that regard,” he said, referring to the ride-hailing app. “The rules that exist don’t include electric security fences.” DeMao has made a career taking start-ups from founding to the next level, both domestically and internationally. The workspace at the Innovation Center is bright, cheery, flexible and, well, innovative. DeMao himself is engaging, enthusiastic and dedicated to the company and his employees. But there is a major down side to the job. To show customers and others that the fence will deter thieves, but isn’t deadly, DeMao often touches a small, mobile grid of fence carrying 8,400 volts of current, the same as the fence.. “It’s the least plesant part of my job,” he said. “It hurts really bad.” Gerry Melendez gmelendez@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:38 Investigators search for missing items of teen killed Pause 2:28 Get ready now for the August solar eclipse 3:29 Alton "Pops" Blanks celebrates his 90th birthday with the McDonalds Family 1:03 CEO purposely shocks himself 1:12 A look at the Pop-up drive in theater coming to Columbia: FunFlicks Outdoor Movies Commercial 1:13 Doolittle Raid's 75th anniversary 3:17 Martin, Staley, Pastides kick things off at Darius Rucker concert 2:33 USC President Harris Pastides discusses new plaques recognizing slavery's early role at USC 0:31 This online political ad draws ire of the pastor at Emanuel AME church 7:13 I-85 Roadway Collapse - Press Conference 3-31-17 Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 5 hours ago Investigators search for missing items of teen killed 2:38 5 hours ago Investigators search for missing items of teen killed 5:58 6 hours ago Surveillance of teenager whose body was found shot and burned 3 1:45 7 hours ago Surveillance of teenager whose body was found shot and burned 1 View More Video Local Another lawsuit filed against accused killer Todd Kohlhepp Two Vista warehouses to be renovated Slaves built USC’s earliest buildings, new plaques will acknowledge Dylann Roof transferred to federal custody Columbia native’s reign ends on ‘Jeopardy’ Local Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital & Home Subscriptions Digital Replica Edition Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Archive Search Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Mobile Options Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Special Sections More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

The company just hired Alphabet’s John Fenwick, who was Google’s head of spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, Fenwick’s colleague and head of satellite engineering, to be part of a new team under Dropcam co-founder Greg Duffy. Apple hired Duffy, who himself left Alphabet in 2015 shortly after Nest acquired Dropcam, earlier this year for an undisclosed position. Apple is putting resources toward satellites and space It’s unclear what exactly Duffy’s unit is working on, but Fenwick and Trela’s expertise in the satellite business seems to suggest the company is looking into internet delivery. Fenwick was the co-founder of SkyBox Imaging, a satellite company Google acquired in 2014 and later sold to competitor Planet Labs back in February of this year. Another big name in the satellite business, Greg Wyler, left Google back in 2014 to work with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and Google ultimately invested $1 billion alongside Fidelity in the space transportation company it appears in lieu of building out its own division. So it’s clear the general winding down of satellite work at Google has pushed some of its in-house talent to competitors, but Apple is still a peculiar pick given its nonexistent track record in the satellite space. Both Facebook and Alphabet are the biggest players in the tech industry when it comes to delivering internet over the air, with Facebook working on solar-powered drones and Alphabet having shifted its resources from satellites and drones of its own to its hot-air balloon project Loon and Google Fiber unit. But telecom consultant Tim Farrar wrote last month that Apple is funding a Boeing effort to deliver internet using a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites. Duffy’s role at Apple working under Dan Riccio, who oversees Apple’s consumer hardware teams, also suggests Apple could be building some of this tech itself, according to Bloomberg. While what the iPhone maker is up to is all very murky right now, it’s clear CEO Tim Cook has gotten serious about looking beyond smartphones and other consumer electronics and into more forward-looking industries like satellite internet and self-driving cars.

Fenwick led Google's spacecraft operations, while Trela was head of satellite engineering. Both Trela and Fenwick are reporting to Greg Duffy, the former co-founder of camera company Dropcam. What the two are doing at Apple is unclear, but Bloomberg speculates they're either working on satellites for image collection or satellites for communications. Rumors have suggested Apple is using a fleet of drones to collect data to improve Apple Maps, with the company having filed for an FAA permit to be able to fly drones for commercial purposes. Apple also acquired Aether Industries in 2015, a previously unknown purchase. Aether Industries develops high-bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. On its website, Aether Industries shows off a range of high-resolution aerial imagery and claims to provide a "full imaging and mapping solution for full color aerial images." There's also evidence Apple is interested in deploying satellites for communication purposes. Boeing has been working on sending more than 1,000 satellites into low-earth orbit for the purpose of providing broadband access, and the company has reportedly been in talks with Apple. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.Former Boeing executive James Bell also joined Apple's board of directors back in October of 2015, another potential link between Apple and Boeing. It continues to be unclear if Apple will get involved with Boeing's broadband endeavor, but it's easy to see why Apple might be interested with Boeing aiming for faster speeds than existing cellular systems. Apple and Google declined to comment on the hiring, while Fenwick, Trela, and Duffy did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comments.

Rating: 5 Votes macduke 12 hours ago at 12:12 pm Would love it if Apple became an ISP. We could cut out all of these companies that are monopolizing and manipulating our laws so they can sell our privacy without our permission. Apple would make a great set of dumb pipes, but it's probably going to cost us. I'd be willing to pay as anything they devise would likely be fast and secure. Satellites though? That sounds like a big challenge. Rating: 2 Votes SeattleMoose 13 hours ago at 11:29 am I'm surprised Apple just doesn't straight-up build it's own ISP service. They really need to cut out the middle-man, especially with net-neutrality gone. It's expensive, but Apple is one of the few companies that can do it. [doublepost=1492799150][/doublepost]Also, satellite internet is really slow, and should only be used for emergency communications. The bandwidth just isn't there, even with a thousand low-earth satellites. Boeing/Apple would be a good partnership. They are both leaders in their fields. The current "slow" technology will NEVER get better until time is spent refining and polishing it. Or by some new technology that emerges by design or accident and becomes a game changer. Rating: 2 Votes farewelwilliams 12 hours ago at 12:18 pm Loving the ping, speed, and cost. http://www.inmarsat.com/service/isathub/ try again with: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/spacex-plans-worldwide-satellite-internet-with-low-latency-gigabit-speed/ [doublepost=1492802391][/doublepost] That's existing satellite providers which only have ~60 satellites tens (hundreds?) of thousands of miles from the surface of the planet. If you have a satellite network made up of thousands of satellites ~200 miles from the surface, the ping and bandwidth will dramatically improve, as well as the efficiency and battery consumption (another major issue with existing satellite internet you left off.) As for price - if you reuse your rockets that put the satellites into orbit, you dramatically reduce that (that's why Google is heavily investing in SpaceX.) And that final point is why I expect SpaceX's satellite internet (expected to be deployed within a year or two) to kick cellular's, and maybe also broadband's, behind. Not sure what Boeing's plan for deploying their own satellites. exactly this. also, imagine the number of hops would be dramatically reduced once everyone starts getting on satellites. bottleneck would be scalability by the satellites.

Maps, ads, experimental projects, world comms. Wouldn't be surprised if Apple got into search engines soon. Yup, latency. Am on wildblue satellite internet and while better, you are still a slave to physics it's all in the distance. That's why I'm always interested in any lower altitude ideas. Yep, current satellite latency is why companies continue to lay underwater cables all around the globe. Even at light speed (186,000 miles per second), a few 22,000 mile geosynchronous orbit satellite hops (each way!) add up. It's a lot faster to use a fiber cable at sea level (and below) to go around the world, where the max distance is closer to half the earth's circumference, or roughly a mere 12,000 miles.

More seriously, the electrical power had dropped, and was not returning to normal. The spacecraft was only in its third year in orbit. Activating on-board cameras that had been used two years earlier to monitor the deployment of the solar panels, the operators found the problem. It was enough to make an engineer’s blood run cold. There was a 40-centimetre-wide damaged area on one of the solar panels. The spacecraft had been hit by a piece of space debris. Subsequent computer simulations of the damage indicated that the solar panel had been hit from behind and that the size of the impacting object was no more than just a few millimetres. It packed such a punch because it was travelling at orbital velocities, which are measured in kilometres per second. It was lucky that the debris wasn’t any larger. If it had been, the entire solar panel could have been shattered and the mission ended. Worse, the fleck could have struck the main body of the satellite. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The picture shows Sentinel-1A’s solar array before and after the impact of a millimetre-size particle on the second panel. The damaged area has a diameter of about 40 cm, which is consistent on this structure with the impact of a fragment of less than 5 millimetres in size. Photograph: ESA In that case, “the outcome might have been much more severe,” said Holger Krag this week at the opening of the 7th European Conference on Space Debris, which was held at ESA’s Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Krag is Head of the ESA Space Debris Office. His team monitors the 10 satellites that ESA currently operate in low Earth orbit to protect them from the swarm of human-made debris that now surrounds our planet. On average there is a high risk alert of a potential collision every week, and every ESA satellite has to be manoeuvred to avoid a collision once or twice a year. “It’s just normal life now,” says Krag. Radar stations track 18,000 objects in orbit. Of these, only 7% are operational satellites. The rest is space debris. And radar only sees the big stuff. Using observations and computer models, Krag estimates that there are around 5,000 objects larger than 1m, 20,000 objects larger than 10cm, 750,000 larger than 1cm (he calls these “flying bullets”), and a whopping 150 million larger than 1mm (or about the size of the piece that damaged Sentinel-1A). Space debris comprises spent rocket parts and fragments from defunct spacecraft: old batteries can explode, leaks can occur in coolant systems that solidify into pellets, occasionally satellites actually collide. Worryingly each collision produces more fragments and exacerbates the problem. And it’s not just satellites that are at risk. So too are human lives. The conference was addressed by ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet, via a satellite link from the International Space Station (ISS). Just like other satellites, the space station has been manoeuvred out of harm’s way in the past. Chillingly, however, if the collision alert comes with less than 24 hours warning, there is nothing that can be done. Pesquet described how the astronauts must close all the hatches between the various modules and then wait in their Soyuz spacecraft, ready to perform an emergency evacuation to Earth if needed. This procedure has been enacted four times in the 19-year history of the ISS. The latest was in July 2015, when the three man crew received just 90 minutes warning that a collision was possible. Thankfully, the space debris sailed cleanly by and to date no catastrophic debris strike has taken place. But it’s set to get worse. So called mega-constellations of satellites are planned by companies such as One Web, Boeing, SpaceX and Samsung to bring Internet access to all sectors of the globe. These will loft more than ten thousand satellites into orbit. By way of comparison, since the launch of the world’s first spacecraft, Sputnik One, in 1957, only 7000 spacecraft in total have been launched in the entire 60-year exploration of space. Broadband expansion could trigger dangerous surge in space junk Read more The nightmare scenario that space debris experts contemplate is called the Kessler syndrome, after American astrophysicist Donald Kessler. In 1978, while working for Nasa, he published an analysis that showed frequent collisions exponentially increased the amount of space debris, leading to many more collisions, leading to much more debris until we lose the use of certain orbits because anything we put there would certainly be hit. Krag showed the conference a graph of the radar-tracked fragments and said that since 2002, “The growth has entered into the more feared exponential trend.” There can be absolutely no doubt that the time to do something about space debris has arrived, and this is what the experts have spent the week discussing. At the conclusion of the conference today, Jan Wörner, ESA Director General, committed the Agency to leading European activities to combat space debris. This includes detection, tracking, and development of automatic collision avoidance systems for satellites, and new binding guidelines on satellite design. He went further saying that there had to be a concerted effort to reduce and remove the space debris that is already there. ESA knows this is challenging. Their own debris removal mission, called e.deorbit, failed to get the backing of enough European governments last year and so was not funded. Addressing this point at the conference, Brigitte Zypries, German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, said that the mission would be re-tabled at the next ministerial meeting in four years time. Wörner also said that he would not tolerate any excuse for non-participation. Clearly there is palpable determination in the agency, and a growing interest around the world. For the first time in its history, the conference was oversubscribed, and had to turn researchers away. But unless a global community comes together quickly to tackle this problem, it will inevitably end up being too little too late. Stuart Clark is the author of The Search for Earth’s Twin (Quercus).

When the tired rhetoric of our two party system can’t bring us to a satisfying catharsis, there is always the deus ex machina of grand conspiracies and hidden rulers.  The actual nature of our oppression, however, has been in plain sight for decades, although assiduously avoided by much of our media. The criminality of the CIA and the FBI is a case in point. Both agencies have long been well beyond Congressional oversight. The dirty tricks, political harassment, and illegal spying carried out by the FBI, as well as the foreign assassinations, political coups, and massive surveillance of the CIA have only been thoroughly investigated once, and that was during the Church Committee hearings of 1975. The hearings exposed the lawlessness of FBI and CIA, but made little difference in either agencies’ long term accountability, despite the creation of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Thirty two years later, Senator Jay Rockefeller, then Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was asked what progress his organization had made in finding out about the secret operations of the nation’s intelligence agencies. In exasperation, he told a young freelance reporter, “Don’t you understand the way intelligence works? Do you think that because I’m chairman of the Intelligence Committee that I just say ‘I want it, give it to me’? They control it. All of it. All of it. All the time.” Dirty tricks, however, don’t really add up to the power many attribute to the Deep State. Killing foreign leaders like Patrice Lumumba, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or filming Martin Luther King‘s hotel rooms, blackmailing him, and pressuring him to commit suicide are criminal acts. But they don’t really destroy the primacy of our basic democracy. Martin Luther King’s murder, however, is different. So are the murders of the other progressive leaders of the 1960’s who challenged the entrenched power of the national security state: Fred Hampton, Malcolm X, Robert Kennedy, and of course, President John Kennedy himself. JFK was determined to bring the CIA under his control, right up to his assassination in Dallas. Whether or not he actually said he wanted “to splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds,” as reported in The New York Times in 1966, his frustration and anger at the CIA are well documented. So to is his choice to use the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE) to negotiate with Nikita Khrushchev during the perilous nuclear standoff. Were these threats to CIA dominance enough to bring in its assassins? The FBI takedown of Richard Nixon is similarly destructive to our constitutional form of government. “Deep Throat,” the hidden source of information about Nixon’s ties to the Watergate burglars, was non other than the Associate Director of the FBI, Mark Felt. Both Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters from the Washington Post who exposed Nixon’s impeachable offenses, have admitted they were fed the critical information by Felt. Nixon had appointed an ally, L. Patrick Gray, as acting director of the FBI in an attempt to bring it under his control. Did Felt act alone, or was Nixon’s impeachment orchestrated by the agency? If the CIA and the FBI were complicit in the overthrow of presidents and the murder of popular American leaders, then all bets are off. There is no democracy, only Deep State directed terror. The fact that the American people are never given enough information to distinguish dirty tricks from Deep State assassinations and the removal of elected presidents, is a growing cancer in our body politic. The existence of great decision making power apart from any democratic process is worrisome enough. But the lack of any accountability to the people and sheer criminality of what little that has been uncovered leads inevitably to the illegitimacy of the state in most citizens’ eyes. The immense and unchecked power of the major corporations and their billionaire owners are another source of doubt about our present form of government. Is there a federal agency not under some sort of corporate control? Hundreds of millions in dark money have been flooding our electoral process. Congress and the president are only vaguely accountable to the voters because their very existence in office is dependent on this largely untraceable flow of money. We have seen Trump’s plans to drastically cut the Environmental Protection Agency and expose American citizens to even more pollution and the accelerated destruction of our natural habitat. Under Obama, the criminality was a bit more subtle. A five year EPA report about the effect of fracking on the nation’s drinking water was simply altered at the very end to support the continuation of this form of natural gas extraction. Who ordered the scientific conclusion to be altered? Non other than head EPA officials after meeting with key advisers to President Obama. The dominance by big business interests is welcomed by both establishment parties. Corporate millions buy armies of lobbyists, think tank analysts, media commentators, and willing scientists. Hidden campaigns attempt to neutralize opposition though dirty tricks and “astroturf” corporate supporters. Then there is the government to industry employment pipeline, the best way for politicians and their crony colleagues to cash in after they sell out. The most pernicious of these lobbies are the ones for big oil, big agriculture, big pharmaceutical, big banks, and of course the defense industry. Military spending is close to half the national budget, and Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and General Dynamics all have their “advisors” who sit in the Pentagon planning new wars for the American people to pay for. With 800 foreign military bases, and drone assassinations being conducted in at least seven countries, the US is consistently seen as the “greatest threat to world peace” in international surveys. As this country moves its armies and missiles ever closer to Russia and China, the chances of a nuclear Armageddon increase along with the profits for US weapons makers. The continuation of life on earth is never part of the profit making equation. The major corporations have been so successful in dominating governmental decision making that foreign nations have taken notice. Two extremist and racist theocracies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, have established the most influence in Washington. The Saudis gave the Clinton Foundation 10 million for access to new jet planes, which they have used to wage a genocidal war against a Shia uprising in neighboring Yemen. And Israel has conducted a brutal 50 year occupation of Palestinian land and the apartheid oppression of 5 million people, all with US military aid and US protection at the United Nations. During Israel’s recent high tech slaughter in Gaza, over 500 Palestinian children were murdered. Many were incinerated by lasers and white phosphorus bombs while cowering in UN schools. But our Congress, paid sycophants to the Lobby, voted that Israel had a right to “defend itself” by destroying Gaza’s only power plant as well as 18,000 of its homes. Israel lost just one house. The only interest group in the US that has the power to make public criticism illegal is the Israel Lobby. Express condemnation of Israel’s apartheid state and we might lose our job or be added to a government blacklist. Advocating for the rights of 5 million oppressed Palestinians may soon become completely illegal. Would Exxon Mobile, Lockheed Martin or Monsanto ever have the clout in state capitals or in Washington to make public criticism of them against the law? The Israel Lobby, with its deep financial, high tech, and religious ties to the US is the best example of how our constitutional form of government has been infiltrated and subverted. Even the First Amendment is for sale. Do we, in fact, need to keep talking about the Deep State when the anti democratic forces in our country are quite plain to see? There are certainly the eccentric and secretive billionaires like the Koch brothers, Robert Mercer, and Haim Saban who shovel hundreds of millions into our supposedly democratic system. Yes, we have a multilayered kleptocracy with its share of secret channels and dirty dealing. But to think that it is completely hidden makes us overlook the obvious. We have been living with the corruption of our democratic ideals for decades. And now the transition from neoliberalism to a form of ultra corporatism is being done right in front of our eyes. Let’s not waste our time speculating about the Deep State. We see the machinery of surveillance and repression first hand, and although we can’t be aware of all its secret machinations, we know enough to join the resistance while we still can.

Nonetheless, he maintained optimism that any remaining campaign promises will materialize. One by one we are keeping our promises - on the border, on energy, on jobs, on regulations. Big changes are happening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2017 And the position that the media would unfairly cover his accomplisments. No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017 Five months after those promises secured victory, here’s a look at where the Administration now stands on various economic issues. Border-Adjustment Tax In an interview with Fox Business News, Trump seemed disinclined to embrace the border-adjustment tax championed by House Republicans and central to their tax reform plan. Displeased with the term “adjustment” for its connotation of compromise and weakness, the president instead advocated for a “reciprocal tax” or “import tax.” "There has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it," Trump said. "The other countries, if they're charging you a 50 percent tax, you say: 'O.K., whatever you charge, we're charging'." National Debt Although having previously promised to eliminate the $20 trillion of federal debt, Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told CNBC reporters the commitment was hyperbolic and unrealistic. Government Health Care Following the Republicans’ failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in March, Trump initially asserted a shift in focus from healthcare to tax reform. Last week's Fox interview revealed a renewed emphasis on the original initiative. An ensuing interview with the Wall Street Journal then highlighted an updated plan to cancel subsidies to health insurers under Obamacare — which contradicted an April 10 announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services promising continued funding of cost-sharing subsidies. Trump suggested that the reversal would stimulate Democrat cooperation on a healthcare bill. Export-Import Bank Against previous assertions, Trump said last Wednesday he had no desire to eliminate the nation’s Export-Import Bank. Instead, he plans to fill two vacancies on the board to empower the agency with a long-needed quorum. The president expects the bank to foster jobs growth and benefit small businesses, but it is also known to advance major manufacturers such as Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE). Interest Rates Claiming that low interest rates created a “false stock market” and injured the economy, Trump advocated for rate raises during his campaign. As of last Wednesday, he expressed preference to keep rates low, as the U.S. dollar “is getting too strong.” Janet Yellen While previously denouncing Yellen for an alleged political bias, Trump told the Washington Post last week that he might consider her reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2018. In his words, she’s “not toast.” Chinese Currency Manipulation Despite having recently referred to the Chinese as “world champions” of currency manipulation, Trump said the label no longer applies. In fact, the Treasury Department’s semi-annual report on major currencies will not list China among alleged manipulators.

Advertise Contact Us Subscribe Home News Opinion Living Events Talent Rare B-17 Bomber Rumbles into Redding with a Payload of World War II History By Jon Lewis April 21, 2017 5 More than 70 years ago, as many as 1,000 B-17 bombers could be amassed to darken the skies over Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. On Thursday, Aluminum Overcast, one of only a dozen remaining airworthy B-17 bombers in the world and a living reminder of World War II aviation history, rumbled into Redding. The iconic bomber, replete with the 13 .50-caliber machine guns that earned it the Flying Fortress nickname, will remain at Redding Municipal Airport through Sunday and is available for tours and flights. The plane is owned by the Experimental Aircraft Association, a nationwide group of aviation enthusiasts, and the Redding tour stop is sponsored by the Redding EAA Chapter 157. On Thursday, a group of reporters, EAA volunteers and Cong. Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale, were treated to a demonstration flight and a chance to experience, albeit briefly, what it was like for the thousands of young men who flew countless missions in the B-17. Cong. Doug LaMalfa (blue shirt, sunglasses) chats with passengers. EAA volunteer pilot Rick Fernald said the B-17 crew likes to do a little “audio advertising” each time they arrive at a new airport on their itinerary, so Thursday’s flight constituted about 20 minutes of easy circles above Redding at an altitude of about 1,500 feet. Even in that relaxed, sunny setting with nary an enemy fighter plane in sight, the noise (robust but not deafening), vibrations and the sensation of thrust from the four 1,200-horsepower Curtiss-Wright radial engines was enough to spark the imagination and set the mind to wondering how it felt for an 18-year-old airman to be buckled in and rattling off on a combat mission to Berlin. That experience and those sentiments are precisely why the EAA works to keep Aluminum Overcast in tip-top shape and moving about the country. Keeping a 72-year-old bomber airborne is not an inexpensive proposition, according to Terry Tucker, the crew chief. Even with EAA volunteer pilots, it costs $4,000 for each hour of flight time. “It’s a money pit, but we do it for the memory of those brave, brave World War II veterans,” Tucker said. Flights and ground tours will be available Friday through Sunday. “Seats are on the expensive side, but every penny goes into keeping this machine in the air for as long as possible,” Tucker added. Shawn Knickerbocker, who piloted Thursday’s flight, said he gladly gives of his time because Aluminum Overcast represents “living history and we’re transferring that knowledge and keeping the dream alive.” Shawn Knickerbocker, left, and Rick Fernald. Fernald, also a retired military pilot, said sitting at the controls of the B-17 “is the best part-time volunteer job I’ve ever had. We’re aviation fans, first and foremost, and when you fly this thing, I don’t care what kind of pilot you are, you’re a rock star.” Knickerbocker, who said his father was a tail gunner in a B-17, said the people he meets—and the World War II veterans in particular—are the best part of the job. Both pilots said the B-17, which travels with a pair of mechanics, is a trustworthy plane but challenging to fly at times. “I tell people it’s like driving a cement truck with two flats and no power steering,” Fernald said with a laugh. Boeing built 12,731 B-17s over a 10-year period beginning in 1935. Of those aircraft, 4,735 were lost during combat missions. Prized for its speed, range and durability, the B-17 became the emblematic bomber of World War II. According to Air Force records, B-17s dropped 640,036 tons of bombs—more than any other aircraft during the war. Although the Consolidated B-24 bomber was faster and carried a larger payload, it had a lower rate of survival in combat. “A lot of the younger kids would say, ‘if it ain’t Boeing, I ain’t going,” Knickerbocker said. Serving on a B-17 crew had its share of hazards as well. According to The History Learning Site website, of the 250,000 Americans who flew in B-17s, 48,500 were either killed or wounded. Flights on Aluminum Overcast are available from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Friday through Sunday. The cost is $435 for EAA members and $475 for the general public. A minimum of six passengers is required and 10 passengers is the maximum. Ground tours are available from 2 to 5 p.m. at a cost of $10 per individual or $20 per family; veterans and active-duty military are invited to take a free ground tour.

Sometimes they would land at Moffitt Field in Mt. View…..even though just before the War began, it stopped being Army and reverted to the Navy, again. Reply A. Jacoby says: April 21, 2017 at 8:42 am When seeing the WW II planes, it takes me back to my childhood and going to  the  “lookout tower” with my mother where she volunteered as a look=out  for enemy planes.  As a seven year old, I’d get  lump in my throat evertime we would sight one of those “big birds.” Also, thanks for mentioning the B-24.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Recent Study: Global Hybrid Aircraft Market 2017-2021 Boston, MA — (SBWIRE) — 04/21/2017 — Hybrid aircraft represent the new age, futuristic aircraft that use more than one propulsion system. A powered hybrid aircraft generates partial lift by using gases that have average densities lower than that of air (as in lighter-than-air [LTA] airship) and partially from aerodynamic lift (as in a heavier-than-air aerodyne). Hybrid airships can be broadly classified into dynastats and rotastats. A dynastat is a hybrid airship that has a long endurance capacity, requires forward flight to create aerodynamic lift, and has fixed wings. Technavio’s analysts forecast the global hybrid aircraft market to grow at a CAGR of 9.75% during the period 2017-2021. Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global hybrid aircraft market for 2017-2021.

The company said revenue in the first quarter from its international markets, which accounted for about 37 percent of its total revenue, fell 1.3 percent to $642.1 million. Interpublic, whose agencies include MullenLowe Group, McCann and FCB, reported organic revenue growth of 2.2 percent in its international markets. Analysts on average had expected an international organic growth rate of 4.7 percent, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. However, the company's net income available to shareholders jumped nearly four-fold to $21.5 million, or 5 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, as total expenses fell 58.6 percent. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. U.S. rival Omnicom Group Inc reported slower-than-expected quarterly growth in North America, while France's Publicis said it suffered less than expected in the first quarter from losses on big U.S. media accounts. Interpublic, whose clients include Mondelez International Inc, Coca-Cola and Boeing Co, said that foreign exchange rates hurt revenue by 1 percent in the first quarter. The "big four" ad agencies in the world including Interpublic received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice in December as part of an investigation into video production practices in the industry. Interpublic's net revenue in the latest quarter rose marginally to $1.75 billion, missing analysts' estimate of $1.76 billion. Up to Thursday close, Interpublic's stock had risen 8.2 percent in the last 12 months.

Good times for a pair of augmented reality leaders. ... Can you learn a language with a robot?. ... Mark Zuckerberg lobs the latest volley in Facebook’s cold war with Snapchat. Rethink Robotics Advertisement Welcome on in to The Tech Column, a new feature here at IndustryWeek that we hope will catch you up on some of the major news of the week from around manufacturing and technology. Trends, products, notes and quotes, a tweet or two, maybe even some gossip (OK, probably not much gossip … probably not any gossip, ever) — it will all be here, on the site by Friday morning and over in the Manufacturing Technology newsletter. Up first this week, Rethink Robotics, the Massachusetts industrial robot maker that has been a favorite for years because of its approachability and ease of use. Baxter and Sawyer aren’t the strongest robots on the floor, but they might be the quickest to program — and now they can do a little more. On Thursday, Rethink introduced its ClickSmart series, a set of end-of-arm gripper kit tools that incorporate “smart sensing and rapid swapping capabilities.” I haven’t had a chance to look at these in person yet, but the ability of being able to swap out five different gripper kits — large pneumatic, small pneumatic, large vacuum, small vacuum and foam vacuum — sounds like appealing. So does the embedded sensing, gripper recognition and access to actuators and sensors the series includes. The kits will allow users “to deploy robots faster, more intelligently, in more tasks and applications, and without any time-consuming customization,” according to Rethink president and CEO Scott Eckert, who added that this is the first “single-source solution for fully integrated deployments.” This seems like the next logical step for a company that has opened up industrial robotics to companies that had never before considered a fleet of robots, or that didn’t have the staff to program them. Rethink makes things easy (heck, a couple years back, even I was able to program some movements on a Baxter in minutes, and I never took one engineering class). These plates seem to make things even easier. AUGMENTED REALITY, PART 1: I dived into augmented reality for a story earlier this year and learned more about the tech in general (if only the general public could see beyond the 2016 fad of Pokemon GO) and some impressive companies, in particular. One of those companies was Vuzix, which is among the leaders right now in industrial smart glasses. The Rochester-headquartered company enjoyed a big Wednesday, first thanks to an Accenture story about how the company worked with Airbus to help the plane manufacturer help “operators reduce the complexity of assembling cabin seats and decrease the time required to complete this task” by “developing a state-of-the-art application for wearables … to improve the accuracy and reduce the complexity of cabin furnishing.”  This is reportedly the first industrialized use of wearable tech on the final assembly line for a major aircraft manufacturer. The second bit of Wednesday news for Vuzix was, in advance of the start of Hannover Messe this weekend, a partnership with three more European app developers: Finnish Augumenta, Italian Brochesia and German DOSCO. The move should afford Vuzix, which already has offices in Oxford in the United Kingdom, a bigger footprint in Europe. ROBOT OF THE WEEK: Robots are different in Japan than they are here, of course. We want our robots strong, productive and — maybe — able to help around the house. Across the Pacific, robots as companions, even friends, are far more common. The new Musio X and B, which officially hit the market Tuesday and is already sold out (for now) is both friendly and productive. Why? Because the social robot uses software and AI to teach English. “We listened to our supporters and customers, and realized what they want in Musio is personalized diagnosis and rich educational content for users in every learning stage,” AKA LLC chief strategy officer Brian Lee said. When the robot is available again, it will run from 98,000 yen to 128,000 yen — about $900 to about $1,200 — with a monthly AI service plan starting at about $9. Now … where’s the robot that will teach me Japanese? AUGMENTED REALITY, PART 2: Another player in the AR space has enjoyed a good month, too. Upskill, which recently changed its name from APX Labs, announced it had secured Series B funding from two of its largest customers — Boeing and GE Ventures — along with some other previous investors. Steve Norlund, VP for Boeing’s new HorizonX, said funding Upskill “was a priority investment” that “puts into action our desire to harness innovative technology to drive efficiency, reduce cost and improve quality in our manufacturing.” GE, meanwhile, has recorded several significant efficiency increases thanks to the Upskill Skylight software platform — a 46% increase in warehouse worker productivity during a first-time use at a GE Healthcare MRI manufacturing facility, a 34% productivity improvement notched by a technician installing wiring into wind turbine top boxes — and is deploying the software in seven different business units. Upskill cites an average performance improvement of 32% among its industrial workforce customers. QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “If you take one thing away with you from today, (it’s that) we’re making the camera the first augmented-reality platform.” — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Tuesday, during the Facebook F8 Developers Conference keynote. As Molly McHugh explains over on The Ringer, Zuck is throwing some serious shade here at Snapchat, the photo app giant he once tried to buy for $3 billion and now wants to pretty much wipe out with an ongoing cold war of photo filters and 3-D renderings. Zuckerberg has a lot going on right now, including his (not-really-political-campaign) tour of the country, but this battle could escalate in the months to come, and it could have some significant effect on AR — industrial and otherwise.

The formation is part of a unit of eight jets slated to arrive in England from the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, the U.S. Air Force’s first operational base for F-35s. This marks the first major overseas training deployment for the aircraft. A total of 215 pilots, maintainers and support personnel will train with NATO partners in the region for the next several weeks. “This training signifies a natural progression of the F-35 program,” said Gen. Tod D. Wolters, commander, U.S. Air Forces in Europe. “It allows the opportunity to demonstrate and obtain confidence in the operational interoperability characteristics of this system.” Col. David Lyons, 388th Fighter Wing commander, who has piloted F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Warthogs, said he would put the F-35 up against any other aircraft in the world. “It brings to the fight stealth, advanced avionics, sensor fusion, an incredible electronic warfare suite, and it enables all of the other airplanes around it. Their game is improved by the mere fact that the airplane (F-35) is on the battlefield providing information,” he told Stars and Stripes. The 5th-generation stealth fighter jet, likely the most expensive military procurement in U.S. history, has been criticized for cost overruns and alleged performance shortfalls. President Donald Trump has described the program as “out of control” and has asked Boeing to offer a price for the F-18 Super Hornet, a much older design, as a possible alternative. The arrival of the F-35s in Britain reinforces the existing relationship between U.S. and British forces. The Royal Air Force plans to eventually have 138 F-35s in its inventory. “We have pilots and aircraft operating at the moment in the United States,” said Air Marshal Stuart Atha. “We very much look forward to standing up 617th squadron back here at RAF Marham next year.” The F-35 program is estimated to create 24,000 jobs and generate about 3 billion pounds in business for British companies. The U.S. Air Force plans to station two squadrons of 54 F-35s at RAF Lakenheath by 2021. They will operate alongside the three existing F-15 squadrons. “They’ll be able to pair with 4th-generation aircraft and together the power of 4th-generation with 5th-generation is enormous,” Wolters said. “The future is bright.” howard.william@stripes.com   One of four U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II fighter jets takes off for the first time from RAF Lakenheath, England, Wednesday, April 19, 2017. A total of eight jets are slated to arrive from 388th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, the U.S. Air Force's first operational F-35A unit, for several weeks of training.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) prev next     comments CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — John Glenn's trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn's name emblazoned in space," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. "And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries," he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing's Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions — hundreds of rocket launches in all. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a "heck of a ride." "I couldn't do better if I'd been riding a rocket." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ Related Articles Ivanka's biz prospers as politics mixes with business US defense chief says NKorea 'recklessly tried to provoke' Arkansas inmates try variety of arguments to avoid death More On: National Aeronautics and Space Administration United States government John Glenn Share this Article Join the Conversation Herald Columnists Adriana Cohen Adriana Cohen: ISIS attack could spur France's Marine Le Pen Bob McGovern McGovern: Trauma study puts suit into play Kimberly Atkins Atkins: His ambitions flightless, Scott Brown lands amongst kiwis Lindsay Kalter Kalter: CTE test can’t fully account for killer’s behavior Howie Carr Carr: How’d anyone so dumb steal so much?

Transport Tanzania: Govt Invites Investors for Natural Gas Distribution South Africa: Some Pupils in Horror Taxi Crash Burnt Beyond Recognition - Paramedics Nigeria: NCAA Moves to Strengthen Economic Regulation South Africa: Minister Joe Maswanganyi - Release of 2017 Preliminary Easter Road Safety Figures On Wednesday, the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport resumed operation, six weeks after it was shut down for the repair of its runway. Kaduna Airport was used as alternative while the repair lasted. Industry sources put the cost of movement of flights to Kaduna, the preparation of the airport to serve as alternative, including associated projects and security at about N3.2 billion. The Kaduna airport witnessed flurry of activities during the given period when most of the domestic airlines and few international carriers operated at the airport. The temporary designation of the airport as alternative to Abuja galvanised economic activities, creating inevitable market around the airport, as businesses yearned to meet miscellaneous demands of passengers, from eateries to other services. But now that huge flight traffic has returned to the airport at the Federal Capital Territory, which has become beehive of activities since Wednesday as airlines, which battled with challenging logistics and initial low load factor and passengers that have to travel three hours from Abuja to Kaduna to board their flights, heaved a long sigh of relief. To effectively serve as alternative to Abuja, Kaduna airport was upgraded to Category 9 with improved fire cover, expanded and rehabilitated runway, improved instrument landing system and erection of the passenger terminal, which was literally abandoned when the airport remodeling progamme was terminated. The Voice Ominidirectional Radio Range (VOR) at the airport was repaired in addition to the repair of other navigational aids, air traffic personnel were deployed and airspace services and weather reports improved. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) was toying with security and perimeter fencing at the height of the period the airport served its purpose. Before it served as alternative to Abuja, Kaduna airport was receiving about two commercial flights a day, so it was never a busy airport and that explained why there was no hurry to rebuild its terminal as the hajj terminal was put in use for the lean number of passengers that travel through the airport. However, now that the airport facilities have been upgraded, THISDAY learnt that Arik Air, Medview and Air Peace may operate to the airport. Arik had been operating to the airport in the past. Industry observers while acknowledging the upgrade of facilities at the airport lamented that they would become underutilised now that traffic has moved back to Abuja. "From the road reconstruction to the deployment of security operatives, the Kaduna airport projects must have cost over N3.2 billion. They spent billion because all the vehicles from Abuja to Kaduna and vice versa were escorted by security operatives in their pick-up vans. So you can estimate how much that cost the federal government. When I travelled from Abuja to Kaduna to board flight to Lagos we were escorted by two policemen in Hilux van until we arrived. All the vehicles that left were escorted. They would put road safety (Federal Road Safety Corp) at the back; they would put police escort in front. The money spent on these activities is crazy," an inside source told THISDAY. THISDAY learnt that beyond serving as alternative to Abuja airport, there had been plans to upgrade the airport and make it a very active airport, operating international flights and also given it a prime place by government. To this end, there are indications that government will ensure that an international flight operates to the airport beyond Hajj flights, which operates at least twice every year. THISDAY authoritatively learnt that the Governor of Kaduna state, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai had written to the management of Ethiopia Airlines to continue its operation to Kaduna after it served as alternative to Abuja, promising to give it all the support it needs. Although Ethiopia Airlines has not replied the state government but it may give that request a serious consideration because of the good relationship between Nigeria and the airline. Indications show that although the state government made that request to the airline, it is tacitly supported by the federal government and the aviation agencies. "It has been part of the whole scheme when government announced that Kaduna would serve as alternative airport to Abuja while the runway in the later undergoes repairs. It was a scheme orchestrated to upgrade facilities at the airport, but what was done is not bad. We hope that government should show similar commitment to the upgrade of other airports. In case of emergency, Kaduna is the closest airport to Abuja, so a flight under distress after taking from Abuja has an alternative airport to land in. This is why we advised to ensure that all busy airports have airfield lighting and can operate in the night in case of emergency," a source remarked to THISDAY. But this is the reality check. Ethiopia Airlines said that it would designate the latest aircraft to come out of Airbus, Airbus A350 to Abuja airport. It landed at Abuja airport with 265 passengers onboard on Tuesday afternoon, a day before the reopening of the airport. The aircraft has about 343 passenger capacity. Ethiopia Airlines operates Boeing B777 to Lagos with about 350-400 passenger capacity; it also operates to Kano with Boeing B737-800 with about 140 passenger capacity; it operates to Enugu with Boeing 737-800 with similar 140 passenger capacity, so where will the passenger for Kaduna airport come from, considering the airports proximity to Kano and Abuja? But besides this reality, which seems to stymie the plan to have Ethiopia Airlines or any international operation beyond Hajj services in Kaduna, the Kaduna airport has all the necessary facilities to function as international airport. It has the largest remote parking space among the Nigerian airports. Now it has the most upgraded landing aids and runway. Government should not allow these facilities to be idle, so it should tinker ways to make the airport more functional. Allowing it to be underutilised will not justify the huge resources spent on its upgrade.

Trump's campaign plans for a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code — while maintaining the revenues flowing into the federal government — may have missed their chance in Congress. AP Listen Story audio 3min 47sec If you filed for an extension on your taxes this week, you're right in step with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. They've put off voting on their promised tax overhaul until after they take another whack at repealing and replacing Obamacare. That's got some Republicans concerned, including Stephen Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign. "You know, you've got a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut," Moore says. But Moore says that as of mid-April, President Trump has no legislative victories, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win and should push a tax right now. "Do something that's achievable," he says, pointing out that Trump ran on a corporate and business tax cut. "Get that done. This is taking too long and it's getting harder to do as each week goes by." Moore does have some skin in this game: He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Trump ran on during the election. But nearly 100 days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill already is having negative effects: Growth seems to be slowing, and the latest monthly jobs numbers for March were disappointing. When he talks to investors and businesses and asks why things seem to be slowing, they say they're getting nervous that Trump's tax cut may not happen. Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. "We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace," says Traub, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte. The biggest question, he says, is whether Trump will get behind the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan supported by House Republican leaders to overhaul the tax code. The proposal, a 20 percent tax on all imports, is attractive because it would raise a huge amount of revenue. The plan would simultaneously eliminate taxes on American exports. The proposal has divided the U.S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart that import products they sell, hate it. On the other hand, exporters like Boeing love it. "The president has given mixed signals on that issue," Traub says. "I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate." If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal budget deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax and a value-added tax (VAT); neither previously has had much Republican support. Traub says that "shows how desperate" the administration is to find a large source of revenue, "other than the border adjustable tax, as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates." Moore, the Trump campaign adviser, says it's time to stop worrying about whether tax cuts will add to budget deficits. And for now, Moore says, Trump should forget about doing a big complicated tax overhaul. "One of the lessons, hopefully, Republicans learned from the health care debate is, 'keep it simple, stupid,' " he says. "The fewer movable parts, the easier it is to get it through Congress." What would simple look like? According to Moore: • Allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of capital purchases, such as factories and equipment. • Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. • Have an even lower tax rate on money U.S. companies bring revenues back from overseas. • Require that some of that repatriated money be used to improve U.S. infrastructure. Moore and other prominent Republicans pushing these ideas, including publisher Steve Forbes and economists Larry Kudlow and Arthur Laffer, say even some Democrats might support them.

The A321neo is the largest member of the A320neo family of single aisle aircraft, seating up to 240 passengers in a single class layout. Virgin America will operate it in a 185 seat configuration. The Virgin A321neos are powered by CFM International’s LEAP-1A engines and add to the airline’s existing 63 Airbus A320 family fleet. “After Virgin America having been the first customer signing for the A320neo back in December 2010, we are today delighted to deliver the first A321neo to them,” Airbus chief operating officer Fabrice Brégier said. The future of Virgin America’s Airbus aircraft is in doubt however after the carrier’s takeover in December by Alaska Air Group which operates an all Boeing fleet. Virgin is expected to take delivery of five A321neos this year, but a further five and an order for A320neos is in doubt as Alaska reviews its aircraft needs post merger. Alaska has already announced that it will drop the Virgin America brand in 2019 and rebadge the airline as Alaska Airlines.

The estimated cost is $195 million. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on April 19, 2017. The Government of Canada has requested a possible sale of follow-on support for five (5) CC177 aircraft (Canada's designator for the C-17), including contractor logistics support (CLS) provided through the Globemaster III Integrated Sustainment Program (GISP), in-country field services support, aircraft maintenance and technical support, support equipment, alternate mission equipment, software support, spares, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering and logistics support services, publications and technical documentation, and major modification and retrofit kits support. The total estimated program cost is $195 million. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by sustaining the military capabilities of Canada, a NATO ally that has been, and continues to be, an important force for ensuring political stability and economic progress in the world, including through its involvement in military, peacekeeping, and humanitarian operations. The sustainment of Canada's C-17s will ensure the country's continued capability to rapidly deploy its forces, as well as the continued interoperability between the U.S. and Canadian Air Forces' C-17s. The proposed sale of defense articles and services is required to maintain the operational readiness of the Royal Canadian Air Force C-17 aircraft. Canada's current contract supporting its five (5) C-17s will expire on 20 September 2017. The Royal Canadian Air Force will have no difficulty absorbing this support. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. Sources of supply will award contracts when necessary to provide the defense articles ordered if items ordered are not available from U.S. stock or are considered lead-time away. The prime contractor will involve the following contractors: Boeing Company, Long Beach, California Boeing Company Training Systems, St. Louis, Missouri Lockheed Martin Corporation/MFC, Lexington, Kentucky There are no known offsets. Any offset agreements will be defined in negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to Canada. There is an on-going foreign military sales case providing C-17 sustainment services. There are currently 13 contractors from Boeing in-country providing contractor technical services support on a continuing basis. There will be no adverse impact to U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded. All questions regarding this proposed Foreign Military Sale should be directed to the State Department's Bureau of Political Military Affairs, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, pm-cpa@state.gov. -30- NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Target, Best Buy and Gap spent almost $3.2 million combined on lobbying during the quarter — up from $830,000 in the same period a year ago — according to federal lobbying disclosures filed Thursday. The retail industry’s top issue since President Donald Trump took office in January has been to defeat the border-adjusted tax that’s central to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s plan to overhaul the tax code. Trump himself hasn’t announced a position on the proposal, which would tax U.S. companies’ domestic sales and imports at 20 percent, while exempting their exports. Chains such as Target and Wal-Mart Stores, which rely on imported goods, have led the way in denouncing the measure. Both Target, which spent almost $1.3 million, and Gap, which spent $660,000, said in their filings that they had lobbied on the tax proposal. Best Buy, which spent more than $1.2 million, cited lobbying on “comprehensive tax reform” generally. Wal-Mart disclosed spending almost $2.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of $140,000 over the first quarter of 2016. Among the concerns it listed was the “House tax reform blueprint,” a document released in June that includes the BAT. Other concerns included prescription drug costs, the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory law and the food-stamp program. The opponents say the BAT would hurt their businesses while increasing prices for U.S. consumers. Supporters, which include General Electric, say the tax would create an incentive to make products in the U.S. Because the border-adjustment provision is estimated to raise more than $1 trillion over 10 years, supporters also say the BAT is key to paying for a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. In addition to the increases for the four retailers, the National Retail Federation, one of the industry’s main advocacy arms, devoted $2.3 million to lobbying during the quarter, a slight increase from the approximately $2 million it spent the same period in 2016. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, another major advocacy group involved in the tax reform battle, allocated $680,000, up $20,000 from 2016. The lobbying figures are for all activities, rather than tax reform specifically, but it’s clear that the BAT is the retailers’ top lobbying objective, given past statements and the impacts they say it will have on their businesses. “No other issue galvanized the industry like this one,” Brian Dodge, RILA’s senior executive vice president of public affairs, said earlier this month. “Until the sponsors declare it dead, we will continue to fight against it.” In addition to retailers, the public filings show that the lobbying arm of Koch Industries Inc., which spent $3.1 million on lobbying during the quarter, kept an eye on House Republican’s tax blueprint that contains the BAT proposal. Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who have been major supporters of Ryan, are working to defeat the border-adjustment proposal.

Dow spent more than $5.2 million on lobbyists during the quarter, up from nearly $4.8 million in the first three months of 2016. Supporters General Electric and Eli Lilly increased their spending slightly, while Boeing decreased the money it put toward its lobbying. In addition to companies’ in-house lobbyists, some third-party firms have also joined the tax fight. Less than two weeks into Trump’s term, NRF hired the American Continental Group to work on tax issues, among other things, according to filings. The firm’s president, David Urban, was one of the architects of Trump’s crucial electoral win in Pennsylvania. — Bloomberg’s Bill Allison contributed.

In recent weeks, the president has swiftly altered his position on a range of topics: the relevance of NATO, trade relations with China and Mexico, the Federal Reserve, and the value of the Export-Import Bank, which finances American companies doing business abroad. “As he nears 100 days in the White House, Mr. Trump has demonstrated that while he won office on a populist message, he has not consistently governed that way,” reports The New York Times. But to frame these changes as an ideological shift, from the right to the center, misunderstands this president and his approach to politics. He is not an ideologue. He has no fixed principles or goals, except to win, to make a deal, to enhance his own ego and reputation. As he has often made clear, his business experience taught him to be a pragmatist, to consider the world as it is, not as it should be. And that practicality is emerging as a core element of his presidency. That’s why he’s marginalizing advisers like Steve Bannon, a hard-eyed bomb-throwing nationalist who is clearly out of sync with Trump’s essential nature. And why he’s elevating business types like Kushner and former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, who share Trump’s basic worldview that you do what it takes to get the deal done. The president’s pragmatic streak alarms and even enrages true believers, who thought they were promoting a kindred spirit. As one Bannon ally told The Wall Street Journal: “We didn’t elect Kushner to bring a New York establishment mentality to Washington. The reason we worked so hard and gave so much money was because we were promised a nationalist revolution. We didn’t send him there to go native once he gets to Washington, D.C.” This is Bernieism, but on the right: the willful self-delusion that this is somehow a revolutionary country. In fact, thank goodness, this is a stable, centrist country that will celebrate the 241st anniversary of its last revolution this July. Sure, Trump keeps employing overheated rhetoric on issues like immigration and the media, but he’s never been a revolutionary – or even a Republican. He’s a Trumpian, and true Trumpians recognize reality. Take China. During the campaign, Trump bashed Beijing as a bad commercial partner and threatened a trade war to set things right. Once in office, the world looks very different. The president’s discovered that he needs China, so he’s offering a bargain: You rein in North Korea, I’ll ease up on trade demands. As Trump told the Journal after his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping: “Now, I did say – but you want to make a great deal? Solve the problem in North Korea. … That’s worth having not as good a trade deal as I would normally be able to make.” A “nationalist revolution” that’s not. Or take NATO. Trump called it “obsolete” during the campaign, but after meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, he declared, “It’s no longer obsolete.” Trump has now realized that for all his happy talk about Russia during the campaign, Moscow under Vladimir Putin remains an aggressive and expansionist power – and NATO exists for a very good reason: to check and balance that power. Once more, reality reigns. Another instructive example of Trump’s pragmatism is the Ex-Im Bank, which enjoyed bipartisan support for more than 80 years before tea party types started blasting it as an example of “crony capitalism.” Candidate Trump – he of no fixed principles – adopted the line as a handy way to burnish his populist credentials. But corporate executives like Dennis Muilenburg of Boeing have told him the truth: the Ex-Im Bank is a valuable asset to America’s job-creating companies that want to compete in the global marketplace. “So instinctively you would say it’s a ridiculous thing, but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money,” Trump conceded to the Journal. The president is still an impulsive, intemperate and unqualified leader, but his lack of fixed principles could turn out to be an advantage. He seems willing to listen and learn, at least on some issues, and that’s a positive sign. Steve and Cokie Roberts are national columnists for Universal Features Syndicate.

Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on January 5, 2017, in New York City. There's also about 190 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, an unusually high number in a one-week period. With the exception of a few high-profile misfires, Goldman Sachs for one, earnings are off to a good start. The range of sectors and companies reporting — from Alphabet to Exxon Mobil, Caterpillar and Bristol-Myers — should give much more context to what could be the best earnings growth in more than five years. French election Polls Friday showed that France's former economy minister Emmanuel Macron was neck and neck with far-right candidate Marine LePen. LePen has campaigned on taking France out of the euro, and it would spook markets if she looks strong enough after Sunday to win in the second round. Going into the weekend, many analysts expected Macron and LePen to emerge as finalists in the first round of the presidential election. The base case among many analysts is that Macron would likely go on to win the second round May 7, and that would be a positive. But if the outcome looks any different Sunday, there could be some real market turbulence with stocks and other risk assets selling off, and investors moving into the safety of bonds and gold. The other two leading candidates are leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon and mainstream conservative Francois Fillon, who markets also prefer over LePen and Melenchon. "There are more negative than neutral or positive scenarios," said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "If Macron does make it to the second round that should take some of the tensions out of markets. As long as he makes it, some of these other very negative scenarios go away," said Cabana. If Fillon wins instead and is pitted against one of the extremists, markets may take it badly. "Our European team thinks we have French spreads widen out pretty noticeably in that type of scenario and we could see the 10-year [Treasury] continue to rally," he said. Analysts say there could also be a risk-off scenario, where stocks and the euro sell off. Washington wild card President Donald Trump will have been in office for 100 days at the end of the week, and while he says the century mark is not a big deal, many in the markets have noticed that the legislative agenda has been light. Trump may have noticed as well, since he said he hoped to see a health care vote when Congress comes back in the coming week and he promises some type of tax reform announcement on Wednesday. "I think his hundred days is up, and from a symbolic standpoint, he's trying to get an outline out there within 100 days," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst with the Lindsey Group. While stocks have held most post-election gains, bond yields have fallen in recent weeks as investors increasingly discount the chances for Trump's pro-growth policies to become law this year. "We think the bond market is sending a very pessimistic signal," said Cabana. "We think markets are overly pessimistic on the odds of something ultimately getting done, and we do think there's a lot of will in Washington to try to deliver on some type of tax reform. How broad and sweeping it will be are fair questions." The White House plan on Wednesday will be scrutinized to see what it includes in terms of revenues to pay for the tax cuts. The White House has not thrown its support behind the border-adjustment tax which is in the congressional plan and would provide an estimated $1 trillion over 10 years. Congress was also counting on repealing Obamacare as a way to pay for some of the tax breaks, but the fate of the health-care plan is not clear. Nonetheless, Trump said Friday that the tax breaks he will propose are "massive." "The market's running out of patience, and they want to see some details. Now, when he talks "big" and "massive," he throws those words around way too loosely, and we don't know what they mean," said Boockvar. Even if Congress doesn't take on health care again in the coming week, it will have to deal with passing a continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down. Most analysts expect it to be extended but a battle could erupt over the debt ceiling later in the year. Tom Block, Washington policy strategist at FundStrat, said there's a 30 percent chance Congress will fail to pass the continuing resolution, though he does expect to see a short-term fix to be adopted while they work out the details. Such things as construction of the wall on the Mexican border and increased defense spending are part of the debate. Block said Republicans will need to get some Democratic support for the bill so there will be intense negotiations to head off a shutdown. "In the end, Trump doesn't want it. It happens on the anniversary of his 100 days. He's going to push very hard to find a compromise," said Block. Block said there was a reason Trump on Friday announced plans to discuss tax reform Wednesday. "He wanted to change the subject. They're going to have a lot of very bad headlines over the next week over the government shutdown," he said. Earnings and economy Besides the gusher of earnings news, there are a few important economic reports, including GDP for the first quarter Friday. It has been tracking at just under 1 percent, according to CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update. There are also durable goods on Thursday. As for earnings, earnings look set to grow by more than 11 percent in the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Thomson Reuters. Seventy-six percent of the earnings reports have come in above estimates. Sixty-two percent of companies beat revenue estimates, and revenues are expected to be up just under 7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.

News Week in review: Blackhawks swept, flyers' bill of rights, O'Reilly fired Photos from Game 4 of the Western Conference quarterfinals between the Blackhawks and Predators on April 20, 2017, in Nashville, Tenn. Chicago Tribune staff and wire reports Here are recaps of the week's top stories (Sunday, April 16 through Friday, April 21) to catch you up on what's been happening. Blackhawks bow out of playoffs meekly The top-seeded Blackhawks were bounced out of the Stanley Cup playoffs in the first round by the Nashville Predators, who skated circles around them in a four-game sweep, punctuated by Thursday night's 4-1 victory, reports Chris Hine. It was the first time the Hawks were swept in a playoff series since 1993. "We probably all thought it was going to go a different way," winger Patrick Kane said. "Especially with the regular season you have. Coming into the playoffs, I think we felt pretty confident. So it's disappointing. Shocked. I don't know. It's going to be a long summer, for sure." On Monday, the Blackhawks saw their season pushed to the brink when they blew a two-goal lead in the third period and lost to the Predators, 3-2, in overtime to fall behind 3-0 in the series, reports Chris Hine. The Blackhawks' offense could never get untracked in the series, managing only three goals against goalie Pekka Rinne. Coach Joel Quenneville blamed himself for the Blackhawks' lack of intensity: "There's a certain level come playoff time you have to get to, and we didn't find it. That's on me."

"It is probably going to look a lot like what Trump talked about in the campaign merged with the Republican House proposal, which was co-authored by the Trump people. So, we know Trump in the campaign talked about taking the 35 percent corporate rate down to 15 percent. That will go at least to 20, maybe to 15 — that could be the surprise next week. But at least to 20," Norquist said in an interview with "Power Lunch." "That makes us competitive with the rest of the world." On Friday, Trump is expected to sign several "financial related" executive actions. The president also remarked that he would release a tax reform package featuring a "massive tax cut." "It will also include something that both the House Republicans and Trump made a commitment on, and that is the business income," Norquist added. "A lot of business income is taxed at the individual level, through subchapter S corporations, partnerships and so on. Both of those rates will come down by 43 percent," he said. "It's not just General Motors and Boeing that finds this exciting. It's ten plus million self-employed people." Norquist also said that he would not be surprised if the border adjustment tax was still included in the plan.
