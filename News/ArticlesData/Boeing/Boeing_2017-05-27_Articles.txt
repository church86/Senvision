Known as the XS-1, the goal of the spaceplane is to get costs down to $5 million per launch, as well as flying at least 10 times per year. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager in a press release. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF OUTER SPACE?   Sponable added that DARPA is "very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight.” Below is a concept video of the plane: Boeing, which beat out Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems to build the XS-1, should be able to get the craft up to speeds of Mach 10 and "deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit." The second portion of the design process runs through 2019, when the design will be finalized and a propulsion system will be tested for flights. The third phase includes 12 to 15 test flights, scheduled for 2020, as well as having 10 flights on 10 consecutive days. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Advertisement Trending in Tech In an unexplored abyss, faceless fish swim Parents denied access to dead teen's Facebook account Two gigantic black holes spotted merging into one terrifying monster 5 ways to test your computer's security How to do a free online background check Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

(File Photo) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has approved the registration of three formal cases pertaining to the affairs of the civil aviation ministry under the previous Congress-led government. The First Information Reports (FIRs) relate to the purchase of 50 Boeing aircraft for the erstwhile Air India, the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, and handing over of lucrative international airline routes to private airlines, a source in the CBI told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former finance minister P Chidamabram’s son Karti. The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process, which experts believe led to the national air carrier bleeding financially. In January 2017, the Supreme Court had also asked the CBI to complete the probe on the same matter by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the Boeing purchase. “The Supreme Court had asked the Attorney General to look into the allegations in a time-bound manner. We examined the evidence and decided to register three separate cases. We will finish the investigation soon,” said a senior CBI official privy to the development. According to the CBI official who spoke to HT, the CBI director sanctioned the registration of a case on Saturday after it remained under the scanner since 2014. The other two cases—the merger and surrendering of routes—are part of a larger probe into the mismanagement of the national air carrier whose losses increased from Rs 63 crore to over Rs 7,000 crore in the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014 coinciding with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance rule. The FIR only mentions “unnamed official of civil aviation ministry”. The auditor, which covered the 2002-2010 period in its review, had said in its 121-page report that Air India was forced to buy aircraft from Boeing in a hurry. It also detailed events that led to the company’s ambitious $11-billion purchase on a paltry equity base of $34 million. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Former civil aviation minister Praful Patel told HT: “I am not aware of this. But if it is indeed true, I am happy. They should investigate and the truth must come out.” The first two decisions—purchase of aircraft and the merger—were decided by an empowered group of ministers headed by P Chidambaram, the then finance minister, and Pranab Mukherjee, the then external affairs minister. Patel was part of the group as civil aviation minister. The CAG report, however, pinned the responsibility on Patel’s ministry, “The erstwhile Air India was advised to revisit its proposal by “the aviation ministry” into expanding its requirement of aircraft. Whilst their earlier proposal for 28 aircraft had taken two years to prepare and submit, the revised long-term fleet for 50 aircraft plan was completed in four months,” the auditor had said. more from india Beneath an increasing green cover, a story of depleting forests Jun 05, 2017 07:18 IST J-K: Four militants killed by security forces as they attack CRPF camp in Bandipora Jun 05, 2017 07:38 IST Nurturing Recruitment-Ready Students Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Notice to Boeing Photo: TASS Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of Boeing and Airbus. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. “I’m sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he said.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus . Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how.

Torrance-based Simplehuman is going to occupy one of the buildings. Long Beach-based Human Touch is going to occupy another. The buildings are going to be finished at various times over this summer, starting around the first of June. Long Beach May 11, 2017. Photo by Brittany Murray, Press Telegram/SCNG A year and a half after the 279th — and last — C-17 military cargo plane took off from Long Beach Airport, Douglas Park, the former home of Boeing and Douglas Aircraft, is undergoing a renaissance. Once-bustling assembly lines for Boeing’s C-17s and 717 commercial airliners and Douglas’ DC-8 passenger jets — not to mention a long list of other famed aircraft — have disappeared into the horizon of history. But the former aerospace manufacturing hub at Lakewood Boulevard and Carson Street is fast becoming a hotbed of commercial and industrial activity, including for South Bay companies. “Douglas Park is an economic home run for Long Beach,” said Mayor Robert Garcia. City officials said they originally thought the 238-acre site, so named to honor its lofty past, would be finished by 2020. Now it appears the ambitious undertaking next to Long Beach Airport will be completed next year. When it’s done, Douglas Park will feature 4.1 million square feet of building space and offer 5,000 jobs, city officials said recently. That sounds like a lot. And it is. But it’s modest when stacked against the tens of thousands who gathered there for decades to assemble more than 15,000 passenger jets and warplanes. Still, what was terrible news for the economy — the loss of numerous high-paying blue-collar jobs — has morphed into something positive for densely populated, built-out Long Beach. “For a city that’s constrained by its footprint, this is an opportunity for it to find more than a little bit of space to grow,” said Robert Kleinhenz, economist and executive director of research for Beacon Economics in Los Angeles. “Now you’ve got some surplus space,” he said. “And it’s actually in a pretty good location because it’s close to the airport.” And it’s filling fast. Flying high Already, medical offices abound. Mercedes-Benz USA has its West Coast headquarters there, after taking over an abandoned million-square-foot plant in late 2015. That same year, Shimadzu Precision Instruments, maker of aircraft equipment, moved from Torrance to Douglas Park. And while planes aren’t being built anymore, rockets are. Virgin Orbit, a spinoff company from Virgin Galactic, has begun building rockets designed to blast small satellites into outer space. The plan is to hook its rocket, LauncherOne, to a wing of a modified Boeing 747 dubbed Cosmic Girl, then fire it like a missile into space while the plane is cruising at 35,000 feet. Advertisement Several other firms are getting ready to put roots down where backhoes are busy digging and workers in hard hats are scurrying about, in a construction campaign that spans several blocks. One of those is United Pacific, formerly United Oil, which owns 372 gas stations and convenience stores in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Colorado. Joe Juliano, president and chief executive officer, said United Pacific is bursting at the seams in its 17,000-square-foot Gardena facility. So, Juliano said, the gas-station operator is moving its headquarters, and 125 employees into a new 40,000-square-foot building at Douglas Park. The move-in date is Tuesday. Millennial talent He said the firm will use 90 percent of the building initially, leasing out 4,000 square feet. The extra space will provide room to grow. “We’re thrilled,” Juliano said. “We wanted our space to be ultramodern so that it will attract talent and, specifically, millennial talent,” he said, crediting DRA Architects of Irvine for the progressive design. “We have a lot of amenities that are Google-like, if you will.” He said United’s new digs will have a gym, game tables, large break room, indoor-outdoor terrace and lobby featuring a replica fuel pump. Human Touch, which employs about 50 people, is also getting ready to move its headquarters to Douglas Park. In its case, though, it’s just moving down the street. By the end of June, Long Beach-based Human Touch expects to make its new home a 110,000-square-foot building in the Pacific Pointe East development, said Victoria Lladoc, marketing manager. Their building is one of three totaling nearly 500,000 square feet at Pacific Pointe East, next to the Skylinks golf course. Torrance company leases building Another is the 220,000-square-foot building Simplehuman of Torrance has leased, according to the Sares-Regis Group of Irvine, Douglas Park’s primary developer. That will be completed in September, said Larry Lukanish, Sares-Regis’ senior vice president. Mia Fields, a spokeswoman for Simplehuman, said her company has no specific plans. “When the building is ready it will most likely be used as inventory storage,” Fields said in an email. “We currently have no plans to move our headquarters to Long Beach, but as the company grows, things could change.” Simplehuman designs products for use around the house. Shopping, too Douglas Park isn’t just industry and offices. A five-story hotel is coming. So is a shopping center — one with an aviation theme. Under construction southwest of Carson and Lakewood is 266,000 square feet of stores and restaurants, in what is to be marketed as Long Beach Exchange, or LBX, by developer Burnham Ward Properties of Newport Beach. A highlight of the plans is an airplane-hangar-like structure that will have an open-air marketplace, according to reports. Steve Thorp, Burnham Ward partner, said the center is on track to open in April 2018. Already, big retail names have committed to locating there, including Nordstrom Rack, Petsmart, T.J. Maxx, Orchard Supply Hardware, Dunkin’ Donuts and MOD Pizza, Thorp said. Others will be announced shortly, he said. But it won’t be just a shopping center. “It will have ties to the aviation and aeronautical world,” Thorp said. Rich history An open space feature will provide a place for people to gather, he said. There, he said, bronze sculptures of replica planes built earlier on the site will be displayed, with plaques detailing their history. “It’s meant to be interactive and engaging, and allow people to reflect on the significance of the site,” Thorp said, “because it does have a very rich history.” If one wonders what the center might look like, here’s another clue: Burnham Ward developed South Coast Collection, or SOCO, a high-end center in Costa Mesa. A little ways down Lakewood Boulevard, at The Terminal, there are plans for four two-story office buildings that will provide 100,000 square feet of space. Two are scheduled to be finished by September, with the others to open by March 2018, said Jeff Coburn, principal at Lee & Associates in Long Beach. ‘Hottest new thing’ Lee & Associates also is constructing a 32,000-square-foot building for MC2 of Torrance, which provides booths for automotive trade shows. That’s to be finished by November, he said. All of Douglas Park should be finished sometime in 2018, said Lukanish of Sares-Regis Group. For now, Douglas Park remains a beehive of activity. Shaun R. McCullough, a principal at Lee & Associates, summed it up this way: “It’s the hottest new thing in town.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reach the author at ddowney@scng.com or follow David on Twitter: @PE_DavidDowney.

The military awarded a major contract to build an unmanned space plane, the XS-1, to Boeing Wednesday. The XS-1 will help ensure the U.S. military’s dominance of space, which could mean the difference between victory and defeat in future conflicts. China and Russia are increasing threats to U.S. space assets, according to military officials. “We have space superiority, in the sense that we have better space assets than they do, but we also have a greater vulnerability, because we depend upon space assets more than they do,” Dr. Robert Zubrin, a rocket scientist who helped design NASA’s plan to send astronauts to Mars, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “They know this, which is why they are developing anti-satellite capabilities,” Zubrin said. China successfully destroyed one of its own satellites in 2007, and likely tested a ground-based missile launch system to destroy orbiting objects in 2013. “The Obama administration thought they could prevent such development by setting a ‘good example’ and not doing so ourselves,” Zubrin said. “This has not worked.” The Trump administration seems interested in maintaining space dominance. The U.S. Air Force requested $7.75 billion, a 20 percent increase, in their space budget from last year. Much of this increase will be spent on these five weapons, which could win a space war. 1: Boeing XS-1 Hypersonic Spaceplane The military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program is having Boeing build the X-1 spacecraft, which will be capable of lifting a payload into orbit and returning to Earth to land on a runway. The XS-1 can launch Department of Defense (DOD) satellites into low Earth orbits with only a few hours’ notice. Current rockets take months to launch satellites. “We need to have the capability to take out adversarial satellites, to protect our satellites from adversarial antisatellite vehicles to the maximum extent possible, and to quickly replace our losses,” Zubrin said. “Only thus can we maintain space superiority, let alone achieve space supremacy.” DARPA predicts that the XS-1 could operate with costs under $5 million per launch. In comparison, some of NASA’s Space Shuttle launches cost $1.5 billion, while the more modern Falcon 9 rocket created by the private corporation SpaceX costs $54 million per launch. If the program is successful, DARPA plans to develop commercial spin-offs. 2: Global Positioning System And Targeting Satellites  The U.S. military relies on a network of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to provide precision navigation, communications, weather monitoring and to find intelligence assets. But those satellites could be vulnerable to Chinese and Russian weapons, according to General John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command. “Despite world interest in avoiding militarization of space, potential adversaries have identified the use of space as an advantage for U.S. military forces, and are actively fielding systems to deny our use of space in a conflict,” Hyten wrote in a white paper published in July. “Securing our right to use space is simply an extension of an age old principle to guarantee use of global commons.” Zubrin said that the U.S. should work to maintain, if not expand, its satellite network and protect it from attack. “If they had a monopoly advantage of the 100-fold increase in accuracy afforded by GPS-guided munitions, then Poland’s 1000 tanks would be able to defeat an opponent possessing an armored force 10 times their size,” Zubrin said. “Only thus can Europe be made defensible.” 3:  Air Force’s X-37B Drone Spacecraft The U.S. Air Force is operating at least two X-37B space drones capable of remaining in orbit for years. It isn’t clear what the drones do in space since missions and payloads are classified, but a space drone fleet could change the strategic calculus. It would also allow the military to achieve space superiority over rivals with very few causalities. “The US is not going to go to nuclear war to protect Latvia, or Poland, or Taiwan, or Korea, or even Germany,” Zubrin said. “We need to be able to fight conventional wars against opponents who are prepared to take much heavier losses than Americans would consider acceptable. The only way we can do this is to have space superiority.” 4: Reconnaissance Satellites Intelligence and reconnaissance satellites give the US. military a big advantage over other countries, which would be a war-winning advantage. “If reconnaissance satellites had been exclusively available to the Axis during World War II, the Japanese would have won the battle of Midway by seeing the American fleet first, sinking our carriers with a first strike and then wiping out the rest of the fleet at their leisure,” Zubrin said. “The U-boats would have won the Battle of the Atlantic, so Britain would have been starved into surrender. All Soviet tank concentrations would have been seen on the steppe and wiped out from the air before they could attack. In short, the Axis would have won.” The Air Force pledged to invest $6.6 billion into protecting satellites over the next six years, but the service could spend upwards of $10 billion on space operations from combined public and classified budgets last year, according to The Air Force Times. “[We must] have low cost [and] quick launch capabilities to replace losses,” Zubrin said. “If we are fighting against serious opponents, we must be able to take and replace losses.” 5: Space Based Anti-Nuclear Interceptor Defense contractor Raytheon announced plans in December to develop a space-based defensive anti-missile weapon called a “Multi-Object Kill Vehicle” (MOKVs). Raytheon believes it can load several MOKVs onto rockets, then deploy them in space or launch them from the ground. MOKVs would have a steering and propulsion system to slam into an incoming nuclear weapon, destroying it with kinetic force. Raytheon and other defense contractors, like Lockheed-Martin and Boeing, have already received contracts from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to begin designing MOKVs. This method could destroy several incoming missiles in space with a single launch, making it more economical to defend against nuclear weapons than to attack with them. The Missile Defense Agency plans to conduct the firsts intercept test in 2019, according to Live Science. Follow Andrew on Twitter Send tips to andrew@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

Citing spec changes, Boeing abandons NAVAIR's search for a new over-the-horizon missile. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 27, 2017 at 10:13AM For at least two years now, the U.S. Navy has been trying to pick a new missile: long-range, affordably priced, and key to the Navy's new doctrine of "distributed lethality." The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is choosing among three separate systems to provide its Littoral Combat Ships with an over-the-horizon (OTH) ability to strike targets at long range. For at least two years now, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been developing a new missile to meet the Navy's needs -- a "Block II Plus Harpoon" missile. Carrying a 300-pound warhead roughly 60% the size of a standard Harpoon, and sporting a brand-new engine, the new missile boasts an advertised range of 134 nautical miles. That's twice the range of Boeing's preceding version of Harpoon, and a longer range than offered by a competing Naval Strike Missile (NSM) from Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), although it pales in comparison to Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), which also boasts a bigger warhead. Boeing's Harpoon missile has set sail aboard Navy warships for decades -- but for how much longer? Image source: NAVAIR. But here's the most serious impediment to Boeing winning the NAVAIR contract: Boeing has decided not to bid on it at all. Boeing takes ball, goes home As reported earlier this month on DefenseNews.com, Boeing has pulled its bid from the competition, citing "Navy changes" to the requirements for its new missile. Says Boeing, "every iteration of the [Navy's request for proposals cut] the top-level requirements" for the new missile. In particular, Boeing said the Navy is no longer requiring that contractors offer it an "all-weather" missile, nor one that is "net-enabled" such that it could be guided to target by units other than the one that fired it. This, says Boeing, means that in any review of its bid, the company would not receive "credit to the full capabilities of the" new Harpoon. "We've taken a hard look at that," lamented Boeing, and decided in the end "that at this point it doesn't make sense for the Boeing Company to bid on this." In other words, the Harpoon that Boeing designed for one set of Navy requirements now exceeds the revised requirements to such an extent that other bidders would likely undercut it on price by offering less capable weapons. If that's the case, Boeing could lose this game before it even begins -- so Boeing has decided not to play. What it means to Boeing That's a logical reaction, but it's still bad news for Boeing -- and maybe even worse news than many investors realize. If Boeing had succeeded in winning the OTH missile contract, the company could count on revenue from outfitting as many as 40 planned Littoral Combat Ships with missiles. (How much revenue will depend on how many OTH missiles can eventually be crammed onto each ship -- which currently aren't equipped to carry them. But it would probably run to the tens or hundreds of millions.) More important, though, in winning OTH, Boeing would very likely have been hired to upgrade existing Harpoon stockpiles (7,500 Harpoons have been sold around the world over the past four decades) to the new Harpoon configuration -- a project that could yield billions of dollars of new revenue. While these prospects haven't disappeared entirely, and Boeing says it still expects to sell surface-to-surface, as well as submarine-launched and air-launched variants of its newest Harpoon, the added boost to the new missile's popularity that an OTH win would have given Boeing will be sorely missed. What it means to Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Conversely, Boeing's exit from the OTH competition is very good news for its former rivals, Raytheon (and its Norwegian partner, Kongsberg) and Lockheed Martin. Here's why: Boeing may think that the Navy's changing requirements turned Harpoon into more missile than the Navy wanted to buy, and might have hurt the missile's ability to compete on price. But in fact, the numbers I'm seeing suggest that Harpoon would have posed a very real threat to both Raytheon's and Lockheed's offerings. Consider: Boeing estimated the cost of its improved Harpoon at $1.2 million, or roughly equivalent to a current-model Harpoon. For comparison, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates LRASM's cost at about $3 million per unit -- significantly more expensive than Harpoon. At the same time, other sources suggest that Raytheon's NSM would cost about half of LRASM's cost, implying a price tag of perhaps $1.5 million. Conclusion: Despite offering capabilities superior to what the Navy is now looking for, it appears that Boeing's Harpoon would still have cost less than offerings from Lockheed and Raytheon, and have had a good chance of winning the OTH competition -- had Boeing decided to proceed. Whatever the company's real reason for backing out, the fact that Boeing is backing out is very good news for its erstwhile competitors. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Courtesy of PR Department of Irkut Corporation/Handout via REUTERS 2/2 By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack Stubbs | MOSCOW MOSCOW Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said.

Elmer Haight Website Staff May 28, 2017, 1:38 p.m. Send to Kindle Buy this photo Photo provided Rev. Elmer Haight December 7, 1919 - May 18, 2017 Rev. Elmer Haight, 97, moved to heaven on May 18, 2017, while at home with his wife at his side. He was born December 7, 1919, to Elmer S. and Zetta (Dayley) Haight in Seattle, WA. Elmer started school in a little one-room rural school near Bend, OR. His family came to Wenatchee, WA, in August, 1928, to work in the fruit industry. For the next eight years they were migratory fruit workers, going from Wenatchee, after the apple harvest in the fall, to California, working their way back north until spring and the cherry harvest. They managed to save enough during the depression years to buy 200 acres of bare land on Stemilt Hill in 1936. In a few years, they were able to plant 30 acres of cherries. Elmer’s brother, Bruce, joined the local Navy Reserve unit and was called to active duty in 1940. In June of 1944, he and his flying crew disappeared, in their Navy PBY Catalina airplane, somewhere in the Alaska area. Elmer worked at Boeing Aircraft in Seattle from September, 1941 to April, 1942. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps Aviator Cadet program in June, 1942, and was called to active duty in December of that year. He was eliminated from the Cadet program after physical examinations, and was then sent to a new base in Marfa, TX, where he remained for two years. He was then moved around for a year, being discharged at Camp Beale, CA, in February, 1946. In August, 1947, he began working at the Grange Supply in Wenatchee, remaining there until July, 1956. He sold real estate for a year, then was employed by California Chemical Company at their office and plant in Wenatchee. He came to know the Lord Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior through a blind date (later his wife) and her family and the people organizing Faith Lutheran Church in East Wenatchee in 1955. Elmer married Dorothy Battermann on November 2, 1952. They were blessed with four children. In 1962, Elmer felt the call to serve his Lord as a pastor. He and Dorothy took their four young children and enrolled in Concordia Theological Seminary in Springfield, IL, in September, 1964. Elmer was ordained as a pastor in the LCMS Lutheran Church in September, 1968, and called to Vernal, UT, and Rangely, CO, where he served until moving to Othello, WA, in 1978. He retired from full-time service on January 1, 1985, and for the next 12 years served vacant churches in Utah and in the Wenatchee, Yakima and Okanogan valleys. After retiring again, he limited his time to helping on Sundays at some of the Central Washington LCMS Lutheran churches. Elmer is survived by his wife, Dorothy; two daughters: Terrisa (Mike Hibbett) of Wenatchee, WA, and Diane (Kevin Eilmes) of Yakima, WA; two sons: Robert E. Haight (Babette) of Peyton, CO, and Douglas Haight of Shoreline, WA; and four grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, Elmer and Zetta Haight; and his brother, Bruce. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that contributions be made to Faith Lutheran Church Stained Glass Fund. Arrangements are assisted by Telford’s Chapel of the Valley in East Wenatchee. “IF GOD BRINGS YOU TO IT, HE WILL BRING YOU THROUGH IT.” Questions about commenting?

According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Putin called Irkut Corporation President and Chief Designer of Yakovlev Design Bureau Oleg Demchenko and congratulated him, as well as the team of the enterprise and all employees of the industry on this significant event. The overall volume of sales of Russia's new MC-21 passenger plane is expected to amount to 1,000 pieces till 2037, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Sunday. "The fulfillment of the declared technical and economic characteristics, the creation of an effective modern system of integrated logistic support and after-sales service, and the formation of profitable financial sales models will allow the total volume of MC-21 deliveries to exceed 1,000 pieces in the period until 2037," Manturov was quoted as saying in the ministry's press release. The project will continue to receive systematic support for the promotion on potential markets, Manturov added. Manufacturers According to Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), the duration of the first MC-21 flight was 30 minutes at the altitude of 3,280 feet and at the speed of 186 miles per hour. "The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant. According to the program, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft," the UAC said in a press release. UAC President Yuri Slyusar said that the MC-21 aircraft was created in wide and active cooperation of Irkut with other UAC enterprises. "This is an important stage in the formation of the new UAC industrial model. According to our estimates, the global demand in the MC-21 segment will be about 15,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years. I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," Slyusar said as quoted in the UAC press release. High Export Potential Russia's state corporation Rostec, which is the integrator of numerous systems of the aircraft, considers that the export potential of MC-21 is big. "We have become the first and the largest customer to procure MC-21 aircraft, and we have signed a firm contract on 85 planes. Our subsidiary Aviacapital-Service has already signed an agreement to purchase 50 MC-21 aircraft for Aeroflot. Moreover, we consider that the export potential of the new jet is great, primarily among dynamically developing aviation markets — Southeast Asia, Latin America, India, the Middle East," Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov said. According to Chemezov, the creation of MC-21 is one of the key milestones, achieved by Russia's civil aircraft construction industry in the 21st century. Russia's state development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) Chairman Sergei Gorkov said Sunday that the bank had invested $90 million in the creation of the first copy of the MC-21 aircraft. "Part of this money will serve as the prepayment for the next planes," Gorkov said in a press release published on VEB's website. According to Gorkov, VEB's subsidiary VEB-leasing has ordered 30 MC-21 planes. ...

Photo - Courtesy of PR Department of Irkut Corporation/Handout via Reuters   Sharelines Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on ... #Russia squares up to #Boeing, #Airbus with #maiden jet flight #MS-21 Moscow: Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some Eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 per cent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. < Previous PageNext Page > STAY UPDATED Subscribe to our newsletter and be the first to know all the latest news Sign Up More in World Government plans to reinforce IT law to curb cyber crimes: Prasad BJP-RSS want to thrust one idea; opposition will defeat them: Rahul Comey to be pressed on whether Trump interfered with Russia probe Gallery Recommended for you British prime minister Theresa May says 'enough is enough' after London attackers kill seven Venezuela eyes assembly vote in July; man set ablaze dies PREVIOUS ARTICLE Militant attack kills six Pakistan police NEXT ARTICLE Was there a second assassin of Mahtama Gandhi: PIL in Supreme Court questions Oman #OmanPride Ramadan World Sports Opinion Business Technology Lifestyle Entertainment Advertising RSS Feeds Subscription TOO Apps Classifieds E Paper About us Blog Jobs Contact us Request a Quote Copyright © 2017 Muscat Media Group.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

"The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.

Laura Thomson and Sam Sciortino's dream Greek island wedding was due to take place on Sunday on idyllic Santorini, but due to IT problems British Airways faced over the weekend , their guests were stuck at the airport. The couple, from Woking, Surrey, flew out to the island earlier in the week but their family were forced to wait 13 hours on Saturday to catch a flight without their luggage, containing wedding suits and bridesmaid dresses. Writing on Facebook , heartbroken Laura said: "Well what can I say... I am just a shell of myself right now, my head is vacant, we are absolutely shattered. Thanks to all the suppliers out here we have managed to swap dates, without too much loss. "I have been in tears with our dream of how it should of been slowly fading away, knowing I can't share the day with my family the way I imagined, my sister in law and nieces no longer able to be bridesmaids, my brother no longer with his suit". Luckily the couple have managed to rearrange so they can wed on Monday, but the stress of re-planning the wedding at short notice has been exhausting, they said.

"I'm so sorry they have been through such hell at terminal 5 and all the worry and fear. "I just hope you all can enjoy Monday once it finally arrives and hopefully the topic of conversation on our special day isn't BA." The bride-to-be told the BBC she felt "so let down" by British Airways. The family have made it to the island but without their luggage (Photo: Facebook / Laura Thomson) She said: "We've been planning our big day for two years only to be forced to rush around and change everything to take place a day later. "My brother is one of the groomsmen, and my nieces and sister-in-law are my bridesmaids, so naturally I wanted them to share the day with us. "They booked with British Airways because they thought it was a reliable company. We feel so let down." British Airways says it is aiming to resume most flights by today after the crippling global IT crash . Luckily the wedding can go ahead but the couple had to change the date (Photo: Facebook / Laura Thomson) Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now The airline said its engineers were "continuing to work hard" to restore services hopes to operate a "near normal schedule" at Gatwick and the "majority" of flights from Heathrow.

"At Heathrow we plan to fly all of our long-haul services but the knock-on effects of yesterday's disruption will lead to delays. "I know this has been a horrible time for customers. Some of you have missed holidays, some of you have been stranded on an aircraft and some of you have been separated from your bags. On behalf of everyone at BA I want to apologise that you've had to go through these trying experiences." Thousands of passengers were left stranded after scores of planes were grounded by the major systems failure believed to have been caused by a power supply issue. Experts predict the disruption could continue for several days and BA is facing huge compensation costs after all its flights from Gatwick and Heathrow were cancelled on Saturday.

BA initially cancelled all flights before 6pm on Saturday but later announced that planes would be grounded for the rest of the day and warned passengers not to go to the airports. It is feared that it could take days for services to return to normal and clear the backlog of passengers. A BA spokesman previously said: "We are continuing to work hard to restore all of our IT systems and are aiming to operating a near normal schedule at Gatwick and the majority of services from Heathrow on Sunday.

The test is set for Tuesday, according to the announcement by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Reuters reported Saturday. Advertisement An interceptor from California’s Vandenburg Air Force Base will be used to neutralize an ICBM-like target over the Pacific Ocean, according to the Missile Defense Agency. There are 36 such bases in California and Alaska. If successful, it will be the first time the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system has been used to intercept an ICBM. In the past, the system, managed by Boeing, has been used to intercept other types of missiles. The test is being carried out because North Korea is continuing its drive toward developing an ICBM capable of reaching the continental United States. Last Tuesday, the head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Vincent Stewart, said at a Senate hearing that Pyongyang is still “years away” from being able to master such a goal, but that if left unchecked North Korea would nevertheless indeed be able to obtain a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching United States territory. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised the test of a new anti-aircraft guided weapon system on Sunday, according to a statement by the nation’s KCNA news agency. “Kim Jong Un … watched the test of a new type of anti-aircraft guided weapon system organized by the Academy of National Defense Science,” the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in its release Sunday. “This weapon system, whose operation capability has been thoroughly verified, should be mass-produced to deploy all over the country … so as to completely spoil the enemy’s wild dream to command the air, boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty,” the statement continued. Kim Jong Un was accompanied by Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of the Academy of National Defense Science, a weapons development and procurement center. Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman has warned that Israel could find itself in the line of fire between the United States and North Korea if the two engage in a military confrontation. North Korea has also continued to collaborate with Iran on weapons and nuclear technology, while Iran meanwhile continues to arm its proxy terrorist groups in the Middle East, all of which have vowed to annihilate the State of Israel, as has Iran itself.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Major Tech & Industrial Companies Race to Acquire AI Startups as the AI Revolution Draws Nigh | Main | Former Apple Creative Director who left to work at Huawei is now starting her own Company called 'Abalone' » May 28, 2017 Sharp's Future U.S. Plant will make Smartphone Displays in Addition to Specialized Displays for Boeing and Beyond   Yesterday Sharp's President and CEO Tai Jeng-wu confirmed that his company is in fact planning to build a factory in the U.S. that will make small displays. Tai told a small group of reporters at a Foxconn-owned shopping mall in Taipei that "These panels will not only be used on smartphones. It is possible they will be used in aeronautics as Boeing now uses Sharp's panels in its aircraft. Our panels can service governments and the defense sector, too   The Nikkei further reports that Tai did not say whether the panels would be offered to Apple, a key customer for both Sharp and its parent company, Hon Hai Precision Industry, better known as Foxconn Technology Group.   Further, Tai said Sharp have not decided on a location for the facility, though he wants construction to begin as soon as possible.   Tai's comments come one month after he and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou met U.S. President Donald Trump.   Further, Tai confirmed that Sharp, together with Foxconn, might inject more than 800 billion yen (US$7.2 billion) into new projects in the U.S.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz Why Russia and China Fear America's P-8 Poseidon Submarine Killer Sebastien Roblin May 28, 2017 TweetShareShare There is a decent chance you have already flown on one of the U.S. Navy’s key new aircraft—or rather, the 737 airliner it is based on. The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane may not be as sexy as an F-35 stealth fighter, but in some ways it is far closer to the forefront of international flashpoints in the Pacific Ocean. Maritime patrol planes are essential for tracking the movement of ships and especially submarines across vast oceanic waters—and potentially sinking them in the event of hostilities. Hunting submarines from the air, however, is an airpower-intensive job that requires numerous airframes spending thousands of flight hours flying long-distance patrol patterns over the ocean. Since 1962, the U.S. Navy has operated the P-3 Orion patrol plane, based on the four-engine L-88 Electra airliner. The turboprop-powered aircraft could spend a dozen hours flying low over the ocean to drop sonar buoys, scan the water for metallic hulls of submarines with its Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) and potentially launch torpedoes. After fifty-five years of able service, however, the P-3s have accumulated thousands of service hours and their hulls are growing fatigued. In 2004 the U.S. Navy selected the jet-powered Boeing P-8 Poseidon to succeed the aging P-3. Development proceeded relatively smoothly, in part due to the use of a preexisting airframe and the decision to phase in the P-8’s advanced systems in a series of increments rather than delivering them all at once. This led the P-8 unit costs to actually come in under budget, at $150 million per aircraft. The P-8 is based on the 737-800ERX short-to-medium-range airliner. It typically has a flight crew of three and boosts stronger power generators for its onboard electronics. The Poseidon reportedly offers a much smoother ride than the Orion, thanks to its broader-swept wings and flight computers. Orion crews were often nauseated by the strong turbulence their low-altitude flight operations required. While the P-8 does have a strengthened hull to operate at low altitude—though at reduced fuel efficiency compared to the P-3—it’s designed to perform most of its operation from high altitude, where the thinner atmosphere allows for greater fuel efficiency and a better vantage for some of its sensors. A Poseidon can loiter overhead at speeds as low as two hundred miles per hour, and can stay on station for extended times due to its in-flight refueling capability. However, with a maximum speed of 564 miles per hour, it can also dash two hundred miles per hour faster than the P-3 aircraft it is replacing. The Poseidon’s primary payload is its diverse array of sensors. These include an APY-10 multi-mode synthetic aperture radar, which not only can track the position of ships over hundreds of miles away, but possesses a high-resolution mode which can spot submarine periscopes poking above the waves and even identify different classes of ships. An MX-20 electro-optical/infrared turret provides a shorter-range search option, while an ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measure (ESM) derived from a system onboard the EA-18G Growler functions as an electromagnetic sensor, particularly useful in tracking the positions of radar emitters. A recent addition is the Advanced Airborne Sensor, a dual-sided AESA radar that can offer 360-degree scanning on targets on land or coastal areas, and which has potential applications as a jamming or even cyberwarfare platform. A number of key systems on the P-8 are designed to track submerged submarines. A rotary launcher system in the rear of the P-8 can dispense sonar buoys into the water. A recent upgrade allows P-8s to employ new Multistatic Active Coherent buoys that generate multiple sonar pulses over time, allowing for greater endurance and search range. The P-8 also has its own acoustic sensor, and even a new hydrocarbon sensor that can “sniff” for fuel vapor from submarines. However, the P-8 lacks the tail-mounted MAD sensor of the P-3 Orion, useful for detecting the metallic hulls of submarines while flying at low altitude. Various reasons have been offered for its removal: the MAD weighed too much at 3,500 pounds, it did not fit with the high-altitude search profile of the P-8, or the new sensors on the P-8 rendered it unnecessary. However, the U.S. Navy is reportedly developing a variant of the an air launched drone, called the High-Altitude Unmanned Targeting Air System, which can carry a MAD sensor and transmit its findings back up to the P-8. Five operator stations on the port side of the plane carry multifunction displays that can be configured to display whatever sensors and controls are most useful under the circumstances. The P-8’s computers are designed to fuse the data into a single coherent picture for the operators—and can then “push” that data to friendly ships and airplanes. This is a capability the U.S. Air Force has been struggling to integrate into its new E-3G radar planes. The P-3 is also designed to be especially compatible with Navy RQ-4N drones. In the event of hostilities, the Poseidon can carry five missiles, depth charges or torpedoes in a rotary launcher in the rear hull, and six more on underwing racks. While the P-3 had to fly low to deploy its torpedoes, the P-8 can use a special High Altitude Air Launch Accessory to transform its Mark 54 324-millimeter lightweight torpedoes into GPS-guided glide bombs that can be dropped from altitudes as high as thirty thousand feet. These shed their wings upon hitting the water and hone in on targets using onboard sonar. Poseidons can also carry Harpoon AGM-184H/K antiship missiles with a range of 150 miles.

EVERETT — Kevin Beavers’ title defense at the Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament didn’t get off to the start he was hoping for. But he more than made up for it as the round progressed. The two-time defending champion grabbed the first-round lead by shooting a 2-under par 70 Saturday at Legion Memorial Golf Course on the first day of the Snohomish County Amateur. Beavers was sitting at 4-over after four holes, but seven birdies over the final 14 holes gave him a two-shot lead over a crowd of players tied for second at even-par 72. “The first four holes were very ugly,” said Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer from Seattle. “But I ended up bringing it back.” The second round is Sunday at Harbour Pointe Golf Club in Mukilteo. The final round is Monday at Snohomish Golf Course. Beavers has known nothing but success at the County Am. He won the tournament each of the past two years, the only times he’s entered. But he found himself dealing with adversity early on as he struggled with mechanical issues in his swing. Yet he got himself back on track by making three birdies before making the turn. “It was sort of just kicking myself in the backside,” Beavers said about the source of his turnaround. “It was just never giving up. If I go out and shoot 85, so be it, but I’m going to try to at least shoot a good number. I’m working on some things in my swing, and when you’re coming out here and people expect you to play well because you‘ve done well in this event in the past, I was a little nervous on the first few holes. Then I just kind of put all that aside and was able to kind of calm myself back down.” Putting played a large role in the turnaround. “I putted really well today, I made a lot of putts,” Beavers said. “But I also hit a lot of good shots. I was 4-over after four and the three birdies I had on the front side were all kick-ins, they were all within four feet, so that helps. I made a few coming in on 15, 17 and 18 that were about 10-15 feet each. I didn’t make any bombs, but I made the ones that if you set up to it and like the look, you can make them.” The opening-round 70 puts Beavers in position to become just the second player to ever win three straight County Ams. The only other to accomplish the feat was Bob Burton from 1973-75. There was a logjam for second place, with six players shooting even-par 72. That included all three members of the Western Washington University men’s team — Chris Hatch, Cody Roth and Ethan Casto — who were last-minute additions to the tournament. Western qualified for the NCAA Division II men’s golf championships in Kissimmee, Florida, and ideally the trio would have been playing Friday. However, the Vikings didn’t qualify for the final eight in the team competition, meaning their tournament ended Thursday, thus freeing them up for playing at the County Am. “I called them from Dallas (during an airport stopover) and was like, ‘Hey, do you have room, think we can squeeze in there?’” Hatch said. “They were like, ‘Yeah, if you can get three guys to make it a threesome,’ and it worked out perfectly.” The group at even par also included 16-year-old Alvin Kwak, a sophomore at Kamiak High School who’s coming off finishing tied for 10th at the 4A state boys golf tournament earlier this week; Jacob Rohde, who finished tied for second at the County Am last year; and Ty Cannon. “I played really well today,” said Kwak, last year’s junior champion. “I was struggling out there, but I was able to keep calm, which is something I developed today. So it’s a new skill.” Said Rohde: “I had a lot of really good chances that I just didn’t capitalize on. The greens weren’t as good as I was expecting them to be, so it was really kind of rough to be aggressive with your putts because you didn’t know which way it was going to go. I think I could have been four or five shots better if I just could have trusted where the ball was going to go on the green.” Alex Stamey, seeking to become the first six-time winner of the County Am, sits three strokes off the pace after shooting a 73. He and David Hansen were tied for eighth. 2017 Snohomish County Amateur Saturday at Legion Memorial GC Flight 1 (+4.0 to 4.9) Gross scores, Par 72 (6,627 yards) Kevin Beavers, HP 70 Alvin Kwak, EGCC 72 Chris Hatch, HP 72 Cody Roth, HP 72 Ethan Casto, Sno 72 Jacob Rohde, LM 72 Ty Cannon, LM 72 Alex Stamey, EGCC 73 David Hansen, PGD 73 Chris Bae, LM 74 Sean Fitzpatrick, PGD 74 Stephen Lee, SR 74 Mick Stocker, EGCC 75 TJ Lewis, LM 75 Jerry Slind, Sno 76 Kale Reynolds, SR 76 Rowan Foxley, EGCC 76 Andrew Martin, EGCC 77 Connor Bayha, SR 77 Lance Kilbride, HP 77 Mark Strickland, HP 77 Michael Burlison, Sno 77 Tyler Spalti, EGCC 77 Andrew Kaemingk, Glen 78 Jason Calamaro, LM 78 Dominic VanDaveer, Sno 79 Patrick Boag, EGCC 79 Todd Tibke, Sno 79 Duane Diede, EGCC 80 Jordan Brajcich, MC 80 Drew Preston, Ced 81 Josef Koznek, LM 81 Ace Younggren, EF 82 Alex Raynor, BC 82 Ben Thacker, LM 82 Ken Harris, SR 82 Mark White, HP 83 Chris Giesker, WH 84 Mark Johnson, Jor 84 Tyler Stocker, EGCC 87 Matthew Kornegay, HP 90 Austin Duffy, LM WD Flight 2 (5.0 to 8.9) Net scores, Par 72 (6,111 yards) Brian Wimer, LM 66 Dan Frost, Jor 66 Martin Seguin, WH 68 Steve Laue, Lynn 68 Ethan Merritt, Sno 69 Nick Rothrock, Glen 69 Steve Maldonado, WH 69 Larry Montgomery, LM 71 Andrew Kephart, WH 72 Doug Barlow, EF 72 Eric Haechrel, Sno 72 Harrison Jewell, SR 72 Ian Johnson, WH 73 Nick Dammann, Sno 73 Ben Headland, LM 74 Brett Engstrom, WH 74 James Iazeolla, EGCC 75 Mike Nikolas, LM 77 Brandon Dale, WH 78 Steven Howell, Sno 78 Josh O’Connor, BC 86 Scott Chambard, SR DNF Flight 3 (9.0 to 19.0) Net scores, Par 72 (6,111 yards) Darrell Stubblefield, Sno 68 Christian Kim, EGCC 70 Paul Lill, LM 70 Silas Puetz, HP 70 Brendan Doheny, WH 71 Jerry Wabey, Jor 71 James McGuire, WH 72 Van Luu, LM 72 Greg Guest, WH 73 Bob Wallin, BC 75 David Forhan, LM 75 Jerry Browning, LM 75 Stephen Reed, Jor 76 Tom Desmarais, LM 78 Roman Catli, HP 79 Tom Douglas, EGCC 80 Floyd Gale, Sno 81 Key: BC—Battle Creek; EF—Echo Falls; EGCC—Everett Golf & Country Club; Glen—Gleneagle; HP—Harbour Pointe; Jor—Jorgensen; LM—Legion Memorial; Lynn—Lynnwood; MC—Mill Creek Golf & Country Club; PGD—Pro Golf Discount (Lynnwood); Sno—Snohomish; SR—SuperRange; WH—Walter Hall   Most Read Neighbors worried about development next to former Everett dump EVERETT — Two groups of homeowners are asking the Snohomish County hearing… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Noah Haglund 2 charged after scuffle over stolen meat and a stab in the eye MARYSVILLE — A Snohomish woman was indignant that a grocery store manager… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Diana Hefley Anchor Pub hosts nontraditional church services once a month EVERETT — Their beliefs are traditional, but not much else.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Commentary: Small business suffers without Export-Import Bank support for big deals  Jacquelyn Martin / AP A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (Jacquelyn Martin / AP) James TabbiGuest Columnist Privacy Policy A little-known government agency has been making the news lately. If you’ve never heard of it before, the Export-Import Bank of the United States provides financing for U.S. export sales when private market alternatives aren’t available. International buyers who use the Bank pay fees and interest for these services, generating more than $3.8 billion in profit for American taxpayers since 2009. It’s part of a multinational system of export credit agencies operating under well-established rules. More than 85 nations maintain fully functioning export credit agencies. However, because Ex-Im Bank requires a quorum on its Board of Directors to approve transactions over $10 million in size, it has been unable to fully support its mission. Forty deals worth $30 billion of U.S. manufactured exports currently are delayed, putting the jobs that depend on those deals at risk. James Tabbi is Site and Business Development Manager with Exxelia RAF Tabtronics LLC, an Exxelia Group company. James Tabbi is Site and Business Development Manager with Exxelia RAF Tabtronics LLC, an Exxelia Group company. Aerospace manufacturing is one of the greatest economic engines for job creation in the United States. My company, Exxelia Group, which has a subsidiary in Longwood, makes a variety of electronic and electromechanical parts and components for applications where high-performance, reliability and economy are essential. We have facilities across the United States, including New York, Florida and Washington state. We sell our products to companies like United Technologies, GE Aviation and Boeing, who then export their products around the world. In 2016, the U.S. aerospace and defense industry generated $146 billion in exports and a trade surplus of $90 billion, the largest of any sector. It doesn’t make sense to hold back this critical sector’s contribution to our national economic strength. But without Ex-Im support, many U.S. exporters and their suppliers have a hard time competing and winning in a fierce global marketplace. This directly affects my company’s ability to pioneer growth and manufacture here in the United States. Ex-Im critics call the Bank “corporate welfare” and suggest that only large corporations benefit from its support. However, nothing could be farther from the truth. The public needs to know that every Ex-Im backed aerospace sale enables thousands of small and midsized U.S. manufacturers like mine that supply midsized and big companies to thrive, grow and create new jobs. Our companies are essential to exports because, while our products and services may not be in public view, their critical content contributions are no less important. Each GE or UTC subassembly that ends up in a Boeing aircraft or satellite contains thousands of high-value parts from thousands of proud American manufacturers. Continuing to shackle Ex-Im Bank is equivalent to unilateral disarmament in the international marketplace, as foreign nations continue to provide loan guarantees in support of their home-team exporters. The inevitable result will be U.S. manufacturers and suppliers continuing to lose ground and experiencing permanent damage to their global market position. We’re encouraged that President Trump has started to put forward nominees for the Ex-Im Bank’s Board of Directors. We are especially grateful for the support of Sen. Bill Nelson in standing up for Florida jobs and securing the bank's reauthorization and hope that Sen. Marco Rubio will join him in the critical work needed to fully restore operations. We know that when American aerospace and defense companies can compete on a level playing field, we will win every time. It’s time for the Senate to restore a working quorum for the bank and let American exporters compete on quality rather than financing.

Gov. Jay Inslee recently signed the changes into law. (Dan Bates / The Herald) Retired Navy officer worked to change law to help vets Noah Haglund Wed May 24th, 2017 2:55pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Before Josh Dugan retired from a career in the Navy to work for Snohomish County, he often saw sailors run into problems when they left the military in search of civilian employment. Men and women serving under Dugan often had to wait months to apply for jobs, even after receiving discharge papers. That’s because their veterans benefits had yet to take effect. State law posed an obstacle as they sought jobs in law enforcement, firefighting or other government fields. “They started looking for a job, but they couldn’t claim veterans preference points until they were unemployed and out of a job,” Dugan said. “The standard definition of a veteran was kind of a barrier.” Dugan said the holdup may have pushed some vets to move out of state or into a cycle of unemployment. In his county job, he found a way to help. County Executive Dave Somers last year had tasked him with heading up military aspects of the county’s wider economic development strategy. Naval Station Everett is the county’s second-largest employer, behind the Boeing Co. Dugan sized up the situation many newly discharged veterans faced as they looked for work. He identified the employment barrier and suggested a fix. The idea led to a bill in the Legislature, House Bill 1369, which Gov. Jay Inslee signed on April 21. The law changed the state’s definition of who is considered a veteran. It’s now anyone who receives Department of Defense discharge papers or equivalent documents that attest to honorable service. Until now, a person was deemed a veteran only after formal separation, even if they had fulfilled all of their military obligations. Dugan said this often happens as people use up accrued leave after they’re no longer reporting for duty. It’s important, because status as a veteran confers a higher score in a competitive hiring process for state and local government jobs. The bill’s sponsors included state Rep. David Hayes, R-Camano Island, who is a Navy veteran, and state Sen. Steve Hobbs, D-Lake Stevens, who is an Army veteran and a National Guard member. The change is due to take effect July 23. It applies statewide to all branches of the military. As of late 2016, Washington had more than 44,000 active-duty service members across all branches of the armed forces, according to U.S. Department of Defense data. That includes Naval installations in Snohomish, Island and and Kitsap counties, Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Pierce County, the Army’s Yakima Training Center and Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, among others. Dugan calls it a triple win: for the newly discharged veterans, employers and the community as a whole. “The idea is to ease that transition and to bring in that talent,” he said. Dugan, 50, is a division manager at the county’s Department of Planning and Development Services, where he oversees areas such as code enforcement, inspections and transportation engineering. He retired from the Navy in 2015 as a command master chief, one of the most senior positions at Naval Station Everett. A military career took the upstate New York native to conflict zones around the globe. However, Dugan said he was fortunate to spend most of his nearly three decades based on or near Puget Sound. The father of four has long called Stanwood home. Somers gave him credit. Dugan “identified this problem and was the key in making this change for veterans and employers across Washington state,” he said. Nearly 56,000 of Washington’s more than 588,000 veterans call Snohomish County home. “What this law does is give credit where credit is due,” Dugan said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 27 May 2017 Bellew: MAS passenger bookings continue to rise Bellew: ‘The quarter saw a further rapid improvement in international business.’ – Bernama SEPANG: Malaysia Airlines (MAS) has managed to improve bookings despite a tough first quarter this year with issues like intensifying competition, currency and higher fuel prices. MAS group chief executive officer Peter Bellew said that Malaysia Airlines passenger bookings continued to accelerate in quarter one. “The quarter was tough with higher fuel prices and adverse foreign exchange impacting our performance. However, customers increased by 12.9% year-on-year to 3.57 million passengers and load factor at 79.4% versus 68.9% last year. “Yields were lower due to intense competition and a price war. The quarter saw a further rapid improvement in international business due to an equalisation of certain KLIA airport charges. “Malaysia Airlines continues to see strong bookings with a 45% improvement in forward bookings for the next six months (from June to November 2017) compared to the same period in 2016. “The network expansion is on track, with the second flight to Shanghai and Hong Kong (from the Boeing B737 to Airbus A330) showing immediate results. The airline is seeking more wide-body aircraft on short- to medium-term leases to facilitate growth,” he said in a statement yesterday. In terms of service quality, Bellew said that the airline’s customer service index continued to recover as product improvements were steadily introduced in the quarter. “We have introduced the ‘Golden Rule – treat customers as you would wish to be treated yourself’. “MAS will continue to offer great value all-inclusive business and economy fares while other carriers around the world continue to add extra charges and unbundle their fares.” With all the right strategies in place, the group is still on track to be sustainably profitable by 2018. Passenger load factors remained robust for the first quarter with Malaysia Airlines maintaining its fare despite competitors dropping theirs significantly. The rapid recovery in international business continued in the quarter with a load factor of 81.1% in 2017 versus 69.6% in 2016. Domestic business load factor also improved by 9.5% in the quarter. In terms of fleet, the airline is currently operating with 54 Boeing 737-800s, 15 Airbus A330-300s and six Airbus A380s. The rapid growth in international sales requires additional wide-body aircraft in 2018 and 2019 to address profitable demand. The group is exploring various options for wide-body craft delivery in 2018 and 2019. There is a good value in the current market for suitable aircraft in the airline’s delivery timetable. MAS existing A330-300 wide-body planes will require replacement and additional capacity from late 2019. Discussions are ongoing with Airbus on the A330neo and Boeing on the 787-9 for direct purchase or lease to enhance the fleet. Delivery is currently scheduled for six leased new A350 aircraft from Air Lease Corp. The first aircraft is planned to arrive at the end of 2017. The A350s will operate MAS flagship service to London Heathrow from second quarter of next year. Additionally, punctuality improved slightly from the previous quarter at 78%. Time performance was impacted mainly by consequential delays, external factors such as weather in Kuala Lumpur and air traffic control at international stations and technical delays. Customer satisfaction and experience will be key for the airline and Malaysia Airlines has returned to the Skytrax quality scheme this year. It aims to restore its previous high ratings by the end of 2018.

It was being too clever by half. First things first: Donald Trump didn’t reveal the location of U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines in his phone call with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Trump comes off as a braggart and bully in the transcript, but what he said about submarines is far less interesting than our reaction to it. It’s clear that whatever signal Trump was trying to send got fouled up. But that shouldn’t make us angry about the Trump administration’s clumsiness. It should make us wary about the overconfidence of all policymakers who think they can use the deployment of military forces to signal resolve to adversaries and allies without getting the rest of us killed. Trump did say a fair number of awful and stupid things to Duterte. He told him that his campaign of extrajudicial executions was working (it isn’t) and that North Korea’s missiles are crashing (they aren’t). But on the subject of submarines, Trump is blameless. Here is what he said in reference to North Korea: We have a lot of firepower over there. We have two submarines — the best in the world. We have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all. It is entirely unclear where Trump thinks “over there” is, but in recent days U.S. Pacific Command had announced two port calls for nuclear-powered submarines, one in South Korea and another in Japan. USS #Michigan, one of #USNavy's four Ohio-class Guided Missile Submarines (SSGN), makes a port visit to Busan, #SouthKorea. pic.twitter.com/opmkvZLwut — U.S. Pacific Command (@PacificCommand) April 25, 2017 USS #Cheyenne arrives in Japan; @PacificSubs’ port visits demonstrate #USNavy commitment to our regional allies. https://t.co/wIvccqDxua pic.twitter.com/csaGUNhaSC — U.S. Pacific Command (@PacificCommand) May 4, 2017 But then someone in the Defense Department freaked out. Three someones, actually. “We never talk about subs!” three anonymous officials told Nancy Youssef of BuzzFeed News. Oh, you don’t? Then maybe someone should tell the Navy — because it blabbers on and on about submarines. Contrary to the exclamations of the three anonymous officials, the Navy releases this kind of information all the time. Submarine Force Pacific even has a webpage on which it publicizes submarine port calls, including the two Trump referenced, as a matter of routine. I counted 20 announced port calls in Japan and South Korea alone in 2016 — plus additional calls in Singapore and Australia, among other locales. Last I checked, 20 a year is more than “never.” This is not surprising. Forward-deployed military forces, like a doomsday device, don’t provide much deterrence if you keep them secret. And, frankly, how secret is a 6,000-ton nuclear-powered submarine sidling up dockside and unleashing more than a hundred sailors on port call? (Like how I kept that G-rated?) Some of the reaction to Trump’s alleged indiscretion is a product of partisanship run amok — a kind of lefty version of the asinine “Hillary revealed nuclear launch procedures!” nonsense that sent Republicans into spasms of stupidity. But it’s important to remember that some of the reaction is probably also by design. Even before anyone knew about Trump’s phone call, U.S. Pacific Command was tweeting pictures and giving interviews about the submarines, explicitly stating that such port visits “demonstrate [the Navy’s] commitment to our regional allies.” Trump may have been showing off or hoping Duterte would pass the message along to Kim Jong Un. Either way, Trump wanted a reaction. Just not quite the one he got. Still, the reaction to Trump’s comments reveals a broader gullibility about how we collectively respond to the government’s public messaging about military deployments. As someone who studies nuclear weapons — and is deeply skeptical about using military forces to send messages to adversaries — the reaction to this nuclear submarine story is a cautionary tale. After all, ship deployments are planned long in advance, and these two submarines are probably no exception. The Navy keeps a schedule for deployments that takes into account crew rotations, needs for maintenance, and so on. While there is flexibility within that schedule, port calls at places like Busan and Sasebo aren’t usually a spur of the moment event. The U.S. military is conducting an enormous number of military exercises and operations around the world at any given moment. Instead of dramatically changing carefully planned schedules to chase one crisis or another, someone (more often than not, the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center in San Antonio) looks at the list of exercises, ponders the global situation, and decides how to “frame” existing deployments and exercises in terms of current events to send the right signal to adversaries and allies. And reporters eat it up. This year, the United States conducted a long-planned Minuteman III launch out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The headlines — “U.S. Test Fires Boeing’s $40M Missile in Message to North Korea” — predictably framed the test as a message to Kim Jong Un. Every reporter with whom I spoke about that event started by asking that same question. I responded by pointing out that Minuteman launches are scheduled 3-5 years in advance — long before the current crisis began — and the planning for a launch can take a year. But this time, they overdid it. The United States conducted a second Minuteman test a few days later, and, for whatever reason, the Air Force didn’t like the idea that two intercontinental ballistic missiles had been tested in a single week as a warning to North Korea. Officials dutifully explained to reporters that it was a coincidence that the two tests were so close to each other — the first test had long planned, while the other had been delayed from the fall due to a wildfire. None of which changed the headlines spurred by the initial “framing” of the initial launch. But that raises the question of why the public hasn’t learned its lesson. Why do we consistently fall for spin? The answer is that human beings have a bad habit of inferring causation from correlation. And so a missile test planned months ago can be sold as a response to events from last week, even though that is patently absurd. Similarly, the regular series of port calls by U.S. submarines in South Korea and Japan can be explained as an extraordinary response to a crisis. The funny thing is, there just isn’t much reason to think that these signals make much of a strategic difference beyond winning mostly friendly headlines. Defense experts, policymakers, and military officials are all confident that they can message like this effectively to deter adversaries and reassure allies. But I think the misreading of Trump’s remarks suggests that they aren’t nearly as good at messaging as they think. This is the second time that the Trump administration has clumsily tried to use naval forces to send a message to Kim Jong Un. And, like the public messaging about a change to the deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, it was a fiasco. The Barack Obama administration wasn’t much better. It fell in love with bomber overflights. In 2013, the Pentagon flew two B-2 bombers to South Korea. It was so pleased with this signal that it did a B-52 flight in January 2016. And then a B-1 in September. The Defense Department was doing so many bomber flights that South Korea proposed a permanent rotation of bombers and other assets. There was another bomber overflight in May — not that anyone noticed. It’s not surprising that these signals have little effect. The academic literature on signaling is too complicated to fairly represent in a few paragraphs, but a basic point is that fundamental capabilities and interests tend to matter more to crisis outcomes than bluffing. To the extent that signals matter, they need to be costly to the one sending them. And my own observation is that the best stories told by practitioners about great moments in the history of nuclear signaling usually turn out to be based on fairly tendentious interpretations of historical events. It would be nice to subject policymakers to the same data-driven scrutiny that has suggested that other traditional by-the-gut actors, like baseball managers or campaign gurus, tend to overstate their own impact on events. There is no reason to think the Trump administration is any more adroit at using military deployments to send signals than more competent White Houses. Which raises a thought — how about we stop trying to signal with forces and use words instead? We have diplomats, led by a secretary of state who I have been assured is still alive. So rather than pointing to a submarine, missile, or bomber, how about we simply say what we mean?

RwandAir launches its first direct flight to Europe The airline will fly to London three times a week and is expected to boost tourism and trade between the UK and Rwanda. FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE CYPRUS� Rwanda's national airline RwandAir has launched first direct commercial flight to Gatwick International Airport, London's second busiest airport. The airline's flight took off from Kigali International Airport on Friday afternoon en route to Gatwick International Airport, adding it to its network of 22 destinations worldwide. The new route will be operated by recently acquired brand new Airbus A330 aircraft that boasts of in-flight connectivity. The airline will fly to London three times a week and is expected to boost tourism and trade between the UK and Rwanda. Speaking to reporters shortly after launching London flight destination, the airline's deputy chief executive officer in charge of corporate affairs, Yvonne Manzi Makolo said that the airline has embarked on expanding its wings to far destinations in order to serve a large clientele of travellers to visit Rwanda. "It's great step for our country, because it will bring us closer to our trade partners and sources of tourists. Rwanda will be making a big impact as a must-visit country," she added. Last year, the airline acquired its first A330-200 and A330-300 Airbus planes, boosting its fleet to 11 aircraft and capacity to compete globally. It is also scheduled to take delivery of another brand new Boeing before end of May. This direct seamless long-haul flight is an important milestone towards improving trade relations between Rwanda, the European continent. RwandAir carried more than 650,000 passengers last year and projects to transport over three million in the next five years. The Rwanda aviation industry which has become one of the largest and most profitable airlines in East Africa has continued to spread wings across Africa and beyond. The airline has been growing at an average of 20 percent in the last six years and is currently positioning itself as the most efficient and reliable airline in the region, according to figures from the Rwanda's ministry of infrastructure. The airline has 11 aircraft and expects delivery of the 12th, a Boeing 737-800, in May. � (Xinhua) Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

Quora Contributor Newsweek 27 May 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Quora Questions are part of a partnership between Newsweek and Quora, through which we'll be posting relevant and interesting answers from Quora contributors throughout the week. Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Nicolas Nelson, advocate for human space development: Will we have landed on Mars in the coming 50 years? Trending: Donald Trump's Twitter Has Been Unusually Quiet, But Will It Last? It depends on five distinct entities that could lead the way and accomplish that goal. Each one has lots of supporters and certainly a number of detractors and resistance to overcome. The first three are government agencies: NASA, CNSA (Chinese National Space Agency), and ESA (European Space Agency). Fifty years is a long time: long enough for any of these slow-moving but highly capable agencies, each with human spaceflight capability (well, ESA is working on it, but it's only a matter of time now, and you're offering fifty years) to scale up to a human mission to Mars. They might even cooperate with one another or with other space agencies (Roscosmos is not going to take the lead but is an obviously strong partner; ISRO a less obvious but highly desirable one; there are plenty of others). nasa mars magnetic shield radiationMore The planet Mars is shown May 12, 2016, in this NASA Hubble Space Telescope when it was 50 million miles from Earth. NASA/Handout via Reuters Don't miss: Two Men Killed Trying to Stop Anti-Muslim Rant on Oregon Train The next two are private firms, SpaceX and Blue Origin, inspired and driven by their visionary owners/leaders Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Either of these firms could send a human mission to Mars long before any space agency can, if they want to do so and are not constrained by finances. Jeff Bezos has lots more money than Elon Musk, but Bezos is content to play the slow-and-steady turtle when folks talk of a “race” to Mars. His focus is on cislunar space development first, then Mars when the cislunar infrastructure is in place, at least to some degree. Elon Musk burns with a passion to colonize Mars (yay!) but he also isn't concerned with any sort of “race” to Mars. He'd be delighted to see others get to Mars first, and has openly said so, if only “others” would hurry up and get busy. But he faces financial constraints that slow down his R&D and rocket building efforts. Musk doesn't seem too concerned with cislunar space infrastructure, his plans are more similar to a Martin Marietta “Mars Direct” style of mission, pushing very quickly past “explore and do science” missions into full-steam settlement mode. But he's taking financial risks to do so, risks that may not pan out. If Tesla or the Gigafactory or the Boring Company flop badly, any one of them could pull all the others down, including SpaceX. The fate of rapid Mars exploration and colonization might rest on whether Tesla’s new trucks sell well in 2018! (Okay, maybe not quite that delicate a financial position, but you get the idea.) Most popular: As President Trump Returns to U.S., Efforts to Counter Russia Probe Fallout Intensify So: fifty years from now, Elon Musk will have sent humans to Mars or died/gone bankrupt in the attempt. If all goes well for SpaceX, they will have a crew of humans on the Red Planet in just ten or twelve years… but there's a lot that can delay this. Fifty years from now, if Elon has failed somehow, Jeff Bezos will have sent humans to Mars, but only recently, and all in good time. Thirty or forty years is about right, I imagine. Fifty years from now, a NASA/Boeing human mission may have visited Mars two or three times over a span of six years, left flags and footprints, taken a ton or two of geologic samples, and declared it all a success and gone home to Earth, all depending entirely on the notoriously fickle will of the American Congress and constantly-changing presidential administrations. Can this happen? Oh certainly. Is it likely? Certainly not. Read More Same goes for the ESA and the CNSA: assuming a sustained political will, and diplomatic success in both foreign policy and scientific cooperation, there's no reason either of them (plus any partner they recruit, optionally) could not send a human mission or two to Mars.

Police in Selmer, Tenn., arrested Lowery Thursday night after he was allegedly found walking naked along a street. Lowery has been charged with first-degree murder in St. Louis County. (St. Louis County Police Department via AP) The Associated Press Prosecutors in St. Louis and St. Louis County have charged Lowery with murder in separate fatal shootings that took place within 10 minutes of each other on Thursday morning. In the first incident, prosecutors allege that Lowery was responsible for a double shooting in the Baden neighborhood that left a woman dead and her boyfriend gravely wounded. Minutes later, authorities say, Lowery opened fire and killed a man at a gas station in north St. Louis County. Lowery lives in the 1100 block of Howell Street in St. Louis. That is one block from where his alleged rampage started Thursday. Police statements and interviews with relatives of one of Lowery’s alleged victims offered no explanation for what might have set him off. But court documents do give chilling details about the crimes and the alleged killer’s bizarre behavior. The gunfire started about 8:20 a.m. in an alley in the 1100 block of Canaan Avenue, the documents say. A utility worker, an electrician, was sent there to replace a burned-out street light in the alley. As the worker talked to the homeowner who had reported the burned-out light, Lowery approached and began talking to them. “At one point, the defendant, a stranger, hugged the utility worker,” the documents say. Lowery later shook hands with the homeowner and then pulled a gun and shot out the light, the documents said. He then turned and opened fire on the homeowner. The utility worker, unsure if the homeowner had been struck, drove a couple blocks away and called him, but got no answer, the documents say. Before the worker could call police, the passenger door of his truck opened and Lowery was standing there. He demanded the worker’s phone and then left. The homeowner’s adult son arrived at his home shortly after the shots were fired and the homeowner’s girlfriend answered the door. After neighbors told him about the gunfire, the son tried to call his father but got no answer. “A few minutes later he was standing in front of his father’s house when he heard more gunshots, coming from the area of the vacant lot,” the documents say. The son saw a man later identified as Lowery run to a blue pickup and drive away. Police later found the homeowner, 52, shot in the head in the alley and his girlfriend, Kevia Jones, 29, dead in a nearby vacant lot. The cellphone of the utility worker was found next to her body. The court documents say that, about 10 minutes after the shootings on Canaan, Lowery opened fire at a Conoco gas station parking lot near Dunn Road and Interstate 270 in north St. Louis County. St. Louis County police say that shooting killed Andre Jones, 28, of the 1600 block of Hudson Road in Dellwood. +6  Andre Jones, 28, was fatally shot Thursday, May 25, 2017, at a gas station in the 3600 block of Dunn Road. Photo provided by family. There is no indication that the victims are related. Asked about that Friday night, a St. Louis County Police spokesman said: “It’s all still under investigation.” A witness to the gas station shooting took photos that showed Lowery and the same pickup seen at the earlier shootings, the court documents say. The arrest A truck matching the description was seen about the same time blowing through several security check points at Boeing Co.’s sprawling plant in Berkeley shortly after 9 a.m., police said. At 11:30 a.m., Lowery was spotted at an ice cream shop in New Haven, a town in Franklin County about 60 miles west of St. Louis. He was armed at the time. About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, St. Louis County Police said in a news release that Lowery had been charged in the fatal shooting of Andre Jones, that he had been spotted in New Haven and that he should be considered armed and dangerous. Three hours later, Lowery was arrested near the town of Selmer, Tenn., where he was walking naked. Lowery eventually told Tennessee deputies his name and they learned he was wanted in Missouri. Lowery was charged with resisting arrest and indecent exposure in Tennessee. Back home, he is facing murder charges in the deaths of Andre Jones and Kevia Jones as well as assault and armed criminal action charges. Those charges add to a long criminal history that includes two pending 2016 counts of domestic assault — one felony, one misdemeanor — in St. Louis Circuit Court. He posted 10 percent of a $15,000 bail in February and was released with an order to be fitted with a GPS tracker, court records say. Four days after his Feb. 10 release, St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer issued an arrest warrant for Lowery’s failure to appear in court and raised Lowery’s bail to $25,000 cash because Lowery failed to get the GPS tracker, court records say. In March, after Lowery’s attorney filed a “notice of bond compliance,” Stelzer quashed the arrest warrant and ordered Lowery to submit proof of GPS monitoring. It is not clear if he did so. Lowery’s trial in the domestic assault case is set for July 3. Lowery also pleaded guilty to misdemeanor marijuana possession in the city in 2001, 2004 and 2007. He got a year’s probation for the most recent case; 30 days in jail in the 2001 case and 60 days in jail for the 2004 case. He also has pending 2015 cases in Scott County, Mo., for drug distribution, unlawful use of drug paraphernalia and speeding. He posted bail in 2015 and was released. Relatives of Andre Jones said they were mystified about why the father of three young daughters was killed. They said he was on his way to Vatterott College’s St. Charles campus, where he was enrolled in an automotive program, when he stopped at the Conoco gas station. His mother-in-law, Fay Alexander of Maryland Heights, said that the family was heartbroken by his loss and that she wished she could question Lowery. “I wish that I can ask that man why,” she said. “What made you do that to my son-in-law? He had a family.

By Louis Jacobson on Friday, May 26th, 2017 at 4:17 p.m. How valuable were the business deals struck by Donald Trump when he was in Saudi Arabia? Unclear. U.S. President Donald Trump talks with Saudi King Salman after a welcome ceremony at the Royal Terminal of King Khalid International Airport, May 20, 2017, in Riyadh. (AP) In a tweet from his first foreign trip as president, President Donald Trump touted his accomplishments on one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaign -- jobs. Trump traveled to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Brussels and Rome on a mix of business and diplomatic tasks from May 20 to May 27. "Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs," Trump tweeted. Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2017 Millions of jobs? That would be a massive shot in the arm for the economy. For a sense of scale, Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, has 2.3 million employees; the second-largest, Yum Brands, which includes Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, has about 500,000. The problem is, the White House has been cagey about exactly where this projection comes from. For starters, Trump’s use of the word "millions" represents a thousand-fold expansion from what Trump had said just days earlier, when he told the audience in a speech in Saudi Arabia: "Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia." Meanwhile, over two days of inquiries to the White House, officials were unable to provide us with full details of the $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which itself is just a portion of the $400 billion investment package Trump cited in his speech. When the Washington Post Fact Checker asked the White House for details about Trump’s tweet, a White House official responded that Trump was referring to "benefits to trade from the entire trip from Saudi Arabia to the G7" -- that is, including Trump’s meetings with the heads of other advanced industrialized nations in Europe toward the end of the trip. (It’s not clear what trade deals were discussed in the European portion of the trip.) In any case, assuming "millions" of jobs from unspecified investments is not justified, economists say. "There’s not enough information to substantiate his claims on millions of jobs," said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody’s. In the meantime, here’s what we know and don’t know. The arms deal The Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued a news release on May 20 saying that the United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to a $110 billion package on five main areas: border security and counterterrorism, maritime and coastal security, air force modernization, air and missile defense, and cybersecurity and communications upgrades. The release detailed six specific areas, with links to documents that offered a dollar amount. They were: • Munitions and support: $6.8 billion; • Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships: $11.25 billion; • Ammunition for the Royal Saudi Land Forces: $500 million; • Saudi Abrams Main Battle Tanks and HERCULES Armored Recovery Vehicles: $1.15 billion; • Chinook cargo helicopters: $3.51 billion; • Persistent Threat Detection System Aerostats: $525 million. That totals $23.74 billion, leaving $86 billion from the package unspecified. Using other available data, John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, told PolitiFact that he can estimate perhaps $50 billion in arms sales, "most of which was initiated under Obama," he said. Bloomberg calculations Reporters at Bloomberg have written several articles about the deals signed in the Saudi portion of the trip, focusing on agreements outside the $110 billion arms deal. They include: • Agreements signed by Saudi oil company Aramco: $50 billion; • Commitments by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to an infrastructure investment fund with the Blackstone Group. (Blackstone, Bloomberg reported separately, has close ties to the family of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.) $20 billion; • General Electric memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia: $15 billion; • Honeywell International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $3.6 billion; • McDermott International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $2.8 billion; • Jacobs Engineering Group memorandum of understanding: $250 million; • Rowan Companies memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for offshore drilling rigs: $7 billion; • Rowan memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.2 billion; • Nabors Industries memorandum of understanding on well and rig services on an existing joint venture worth $9 billion; • Nabors memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.6 billion; • Weatherford International memorandum of understanding: potential value of $2 billion. That works out to about $112 billion, coming on top of the $110 billion in arms sales. Bloomberg cited a few more items without specific dollar amounts, including a jet purchase from Boeing by SaudiGulf Airlines, and a joint venture between National Oilwell Varco and Saudi Aramco for the manufacture of drilling rigs and equipment. That leaves more than half of Trump’s $400 billion figure -- just for the Saudi leg of the trip -- undisclosed, to say nothing of what deals may have been struck in the European portion of the trip. And for now, the Washington Post reported that several key CEOs of companies that signed deals have been a lot more restrained than Trump about promising specific numbers of jobs. "There is absolutely zero chance that the trip created millions of jobs," said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. Even if jobs were created -- possibly in the thousands, not the millions -- "this may or may not lead to any net job creation, since the Fed could easily offset it with higher interest rates." Our ruling Trump said that deals struck on his first foreign trip as president created and saved "millions of jobs." We can’t know for sure how many jobs will be created or saved -- nor, despite the certainty of his language, does Trump -- but the evidence at this point is so thin and so premature as to be little more than puffery or wishful thinking.

These blades can survive temperatures above 1,250 Celsiusand pressures similar to the weight of a double-decker bus. Testing is ongoing and Siemens can't say when these blade will be commercially produced. But they say it reduces the design-to-testing time from years to months.

Only this time there is no defined threat the military is working against, although it is about "extraterrestrial combat". Space Aggressors is what the US military is calling them, a team of soldiers training at a warehouse near Colorado's Rocky Mountains. Their job is to act like the enemy during mock space battles to help US units prepare for a conflict that may one day extend to outer space. Trending: Has Hillary Step at the top of Everest collapsed or not, and why can't people decide? "We play the bad guys," Captain Christopher Barnes, chief of training for the 26th Space Aggressor Squadron told the Seeker. "We study threats to the space realm, either coming from space or based on land. If we can't directly replicate them with hardware, then we figure out if there's a software solution or some way we can train people to the point where they can fight through them, if they have to, in a conflict," he says. The elite military unit is being prepared to take on what US calls 'very real' threats from space powers like Russia and China. US intelligence chief Dan Coats recently told a Senate hearing that Russia and China are aggressively pursuing space warfare by building anti-satellite weapons, some of which in future could not only destroy US satellites but may even posses the capability to hit targets on land. Don't miss: Mystery of the disappearing star – how N6946-BH1 vanished without a trace Vice Admiral Charles Richard, deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command, had told a Washington conference in March that "China is developing an arsenal of lasers, electro-magnetic rail guns, and high-powered microwave weapons to neutralize America's intelligence, communications, and navigation satellites." Captain Barnes said some people think space is the Achilles heel for the US because of its heavy reliance on space assets for most everything, from launching missiles to directing warships across the seas. For instance, any damage to the Global Positioning System -- a group of 31 satellites owned by the US government and operated by their US Air Force -- could make the US military to fall back to outmoded tactics, greatly eroding its technological edge over an enemy.

'Extraordinary' claim lacks crucial evidence The army however, stresses that it is not space war yet but like any other unit of the military that has to be ready for any existential threats, a space threat is very real in today's scenario. "While we're not at war in space, I don't think we could say we're exactly at peace, either," says Vice Admiral Richard. "We must prepare for a conflict that extends into space."
