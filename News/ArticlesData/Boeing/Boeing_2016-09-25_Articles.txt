REUTERS/Jim Young/File PhotoMore By Leah Schnurr OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is assessing data from bidders to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets, a Boeing Co executive said on Monday. The country's Liberal government promised during last year's election that it would launch an open competition to replace Canada's CF-18 fighter aircraft. It pledged not to buy Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 jets, as the previous Conservative government had planned to do, calling them expensive and unnecessary. While the government has yet to release details on such a competition, it requested data this summer from five companies that have fighter aircraft in production or planned production, including Lockheed and Boeing, which wants Canada to buy its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. The government sought up-to-date information on areas including capabilities and economic benefits. "The focus on data was very clear, very strong," said Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, the unit which handles Boeing's strategy and operations outside the United States. "It gave all of the suppliers a chance to set down in black and white what it is their platform does." Since then, Boeing has been engaged in a "ping-pong" set of questions and answers with the government, said Allen. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has said the government foresees a growing capability gap in the 2020s and that there is an urgent need to replace the CF-18s. "They know it's imperative to solve that capability gap," said Allen. "They are moving in a way that says they understand that." Allen said ordinarily it can take multiple years from when an order is placed to when jets are delivered. The other potential fighter jet suppliers are Saab AB, Dassault Aviation SA, and the Eurofighter consortium , which includes Airbus Group. As Boeing campaigns to win the contract, it is citing the work opportunities that would be available to Canadian firms across the country if the federal government were to purchase the Super Hornet. Allen did not rule out giving work to struggling planemaker Bombardier Inc, noting that Boeing always works with its competitors. "We're not going to rule out anybody from the perspective of who would be a good partner," he said. Boeing earlier this month formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick the F-35 fighter jet over the Super Hornet, citing a flawed evaluation process. Allen said that was a very particular circumstance and that Canada's process was calibrated to ensure an accurate analysis.

Radical 'Vigilant' tiltrotor drone can transform between helicopter and plane Bell says radical new craft could be in service by 2023  Will 'combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft'  By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 17:35 EST, 26 September 2016 | Updated: 17:53 EST, 26 September 2016 e-mail 25 shares 4 View comments Bell has unveiled a radical new tiltrotor drone that could be launched from warships to carry out attacks automatically. Called the V-247 Vigilant, Bell says it will 'combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft'. It boasts the craft could be in service by 2023, and is able to take off from anywhere - even a dangerous ship's deck.  Scroll down for video  Called the V-247 Vigilant,Bell says it will 'combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft'. VIGILANT SPECS   Single engine tiltrotor unmanned aerial system  250 knots cruise speed; 180 knots endurance speed; >300 knots at maximum continuous power Combat range: 450 nautical miles mission radius Time on station: 11 hours  Can hold a combination of fuel, armament, and sensors, up to 13,000 pounds  Air-to-air refueling  'The Bell V-247 Vigilant is the next leap in innovation making the future of aviation a reality today – it's a testament to the power and versatility of tiltrotor flight,' said Mitch Snyder, president and CEO at Bell Helicopter.  'The unmanned tiltrotor is the latest example of how we are changing the way the world flies, taking our customers into the dynamic world of next-generation aircraft.'  The aviation giant says the UAS is designed to provide 'unmatched long-endurance persistent expeditionary and surveillance capability and lethal reach, as well as runway independence to operate successfully in maritime environments and locations without secure runway availability.' The bays on the Bell V-247 Vigilant are designed to carry high definition sensors, fuel, sonar buoys, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) modules, 360-degree surface radar modules, an MK-50 torpedo or Hellfire or JAGM missiles optimally.  With its signature blade fold wing stow design, it will fit inside a DDG hangar space, and two can be loaded on a C-17 aircraft.  'Leveraging lessons learned from our extensive history and experience with tiltrotors, we have found the best available solution to fulfill the Marine Corps need for a Group 5 UAS,' said Vince Tobin, vice president, advanced tiltrotor systems at Bell Helicopter.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Billionaire space battle takes to Twitter: Jeff Bezos takes...

The aviation giant says the UAS is designed to provide 'unmatched long-endurance persistent expeditionary and surveillance capability and lethal reach, as well as runway independence to operate successfully in maritime environments and locations without secure runway availability.' Two teams - Sikorsky-Boeing with their Defiant, and Bell Helicopter-Lockheed Martin with their V280, are also vying for the lucractive contract to create a manned version of the  'supercopter'. Both are set to take off for the first time next year in the final stage of the battle to replace the Black Hawk.   The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey  The Sikorsky-Boeing entry, called the SB-1 Defiant, is a compound helicopter design with co-axial rotors and a pusher-propeller COMPETITORS AT A GLANCE  The Sikorsky-Boeing entry, called the SB-1 Defiant, is a compound helicopter design with co-axial rotors and a pusher-propeller.   The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey.  The new tilt-rotor is smaller, faster and much more manoeuvrable than the Osprey and has a top speed of over 300 knots. The two prototype aircraft will be built and flown as part of a project called the Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstrator Air Vehicle, which will then inform the Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program to replace the long-serving Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64E Apache. The FVL program will also inform the US Navy's MH-XX program to replace the MH-60 Seahawk. Bell revealed this week it believes it's entrant could enter service in 2024.  'There's no real technology that needs to be further developed for us to be able to design and develop an aircraft that meets those requirements,' said Vince Tobin, Bell's vice president of advanced tiltrotor systems, according to DefenceOne.  'Our big push now is that, after we fly this and prove out that we can build this aircraft, that we are ready to go into engineering and manufacturing development.' The Sikorsky-Boeing team is also hoping to fly in 2017, said Doug Shidler, Sikorsky's program director for its Joint Multi-Role tech demonstrator. 'The intent of the JMR TD effort is to maximize the knowledge gain and risk reduction toward an anticipated Future Vertical Lift acquisition program,' said Dan Bailey, the Army's JMR/FVL program director when the two finalists were announced.  Two other teams led by Karem Aircraft and AVX Aircraft were not selected for continued development, but the service is still interested in their technologies. 'The Army will seek to continue technology development efforts with those teams based on resources and opportunities,' the service said. The Sikorsky-Boeing entry, called the SB-1 Defiant, is a compound helicopter design with co-axial rotors and a pusher-propeller.   The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey.  The new tilt-rotor is smaller, faster and much more manoeuvrable than the Osprey and has a top speed of over 300 knots. The Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is a program to develop a family of military helicopters for the United States Armed Forces.  The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey. The Bell V280 program completed its final design and risk review period in August, and construction has already begun. Four different sizes of aircraft are to be developed, and they will  share common hardware such as sensors, avionics, engines, and weapons.  It will eventually lead to replacements for the Army's UH-60 Black Hawk, AH-64 Apache, CH-47 Chinook, and OH-58 Kiowa helicopters. The precursor for FVL is the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) helicopter program, which will provide technology demonstrations planned for 2017.  Chris Gehler, director of Bell Helicopter's advanced tilt-rotor systems, said the V280 program completed its final design and risk review period in August. Spirit Aerosystems has completed building the fuselage in Wichita, Kansas, and shipped it to Amarillo just before AUSA. 'This is real. The aircraft is coming together now,' Gehler told Defense News.  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Seabed 'lifts' out of the water following NZ earthquake Watch video Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Watch video New Zealand earthquake transforms road into cliff Watch video Good pup!

The design will have a cruise speed of 250 kn (290 mph; 460 km/h), but less range due to using the 'old' T55 engine.  The SB-1 will be quick and nimble, with fast acceleration and deceleration, side-to-side movement, and hovering with the tail up and nose down. The Defiant demonstrator will be powered by the Honeywell T55, which powers the CH-47 Chinook. It will be slightly modified to better operate at slower speeds down to 85% rpm. 'We've got all kinds of pieces and parts, different technologies and things that are yielding today and starting to flow to Amarillo.' 'About this time next year,' he said, the aircraft will look ready to fly and the team will be running pre-flight checks, ground runs, shake tests and other reliability activities. The U.S. Army-led Joint Multi-Role Demonstrator (JMR-TD) program is the science and technology precursor to the Department of Defense's Future Vertical Lift program expected to replace 2,000 to 4,000 medium-class utility and attack helicopters.  The U.S. Army and Department of Defense are seeking leap-ahead capabilities and have identified a speed of 230+ knots as a key discriminating capability.  The U.S. Army's current helicopter fleet cruises at 140 knots.  BELL HELICOPTER/LOCKHEED MARTIN'S V280  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Seabed 'lifts' out of the water following NZ earthquake Watch video Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Watch video New Zealand earthquake transforms road into cliff Watch video Good pup!

(Stephen Mally/The Gazette) George C. Ford The Gazette More stories from George Sep 26, 2016 at 3:43 pm | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — Rockwell Collins has been awarded a contract to provide touch-screen flight displays for all five flight deck displays on the new Boeing 777X jetliner. It will mark the first time a commercial air transport aircraft will be equipped with this type of flight displays. The displays are expected to make the flight deck more intuitive for pilots and more efficient for flight operations. The 777X touch screen flight displays will be multi-touch, allowing two pilots can touch the same screen at the same time. The touch screens also will employ resistive technology, requiring a firm touch to avoid unintentional interaction with the displays. The bezel or frame surrounding the displays will provide bracing features for operating the aircraft during turbulence. As Boeing’s display supplier on all of its next-generation aircraft, including the 777X, 787 Dreamliner, 737 MAX and the 747-8, Rockwell Collins is providing a common graphical foundation for pilots across all the aircraft. The Cedar Rapids avionics, communications and information management systems provider was the first to certify touch screen primary flight displays for commercial aviation on a business aircraft. Boeing has 300 orders and commitments for the 777X, with first deliveries planned for 2020. Rockwell Collins previously was awarded contracts to provide weather radar, select flight controls, a secure server router and optional dual head-up guidance system for the Boeing 777X.

The 20-year-old man suspected of killing the five people with a rifle at a Macy's makeup counter had a string of run-ins with the law in recent years, including charges he assaulted his stepfather. (AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) SEATTLE (AP) — Five people were killed in a shooting this weekend at a Macy’s store in a mall north of Seattle. Authorities do not plan to make their identities public until Tuesday, but details about four of the victims have been reported by some of their employers and Washington state media. Here’s what is known about them: ___ SARAI LARA The 16-year-old high school sophomore was the youngest victim of the gunman who opened fire in the department store in the small city of Burlington. Lara survived cancer and was told by her doctor that she was doing well, her mother, Evangelina Lara, told The Seattle Times (https://goo.gl/YMQvxk ) through a translator. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai Lara was proud of her heritage, her mother said. She had a wide network of friends at school and helped at home, caring for her 5-year-old sister. Born in Mount Vernon just south of Burlington, the teen was described by her mother as bright, all smiles and her “right hand” at home. “It’s not fair what happened to her,” Evangelina Lara said. ___ CHUCK EAGAN Eagan was set to retire next year after working for decades as a maintenance worker for Boeing Co., his aunt Carol Thrush told The Associated Press. Boeing said in a statement that “we are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague.” Eagan worked for 41 years at the company’s commercial airplanes division in Everett, Boeing said. Thrush described Eagan, 61, as kind and generous with a beautiful smile. Her parents raised him in the tiny town of Unity in southeastern Oregon before they moved to the Seattle area when he was about 11. “He traveled with Boeing all over the world, doing repairs on airplanes,” said Thrush, 77. “He was an all-around great guy.” Thrush said her nephew told her that Eagan and his wife were eating dinner and shopping at the mall. They had made their way to Macy’s when the shooter opened fire. The couple ran, but Eagan’s wife fell down as she was trying to get away. Eagan was shot as he helped her, Thrush said. Eagan had two daughters and three grandchildren. ___ BELINDA GALDE Galde, 64, was a longtime probation officer with the Snohomish County District Court who dedicated her life to helping those “who stumbled along the way in life,” her colleagues said. In a statement, the court called Galde “a devoted and esteemed public servant.” She started working there in 1989. “She was an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her co-workers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live,” the court said. ___ SHAYLA MARTIN Shayla Martin, 52, of Mount Vernon, was working in the cosmetics department when the gunman opened fire, her older sister Karen Van Horn told The Daily Herald (https://goo.gl/PPA9ef ). Van Horn, who works at the newspaper, said her family received official word Sunday that Martin was among the dead. Officials said a body with Martin’s work name tag was found at the scene, Van Horn said. Martin was an avid reader, regularly devouring two or three books a week, said Van Horn, who described her sister as classy, sweet and independent.   Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Google Tumblr More Send to Kindle LinkedIn Pocket Like this: Like Loading...

Rachel Shuler of Burlington, Wash., takes a moment after placing a sign and balloons with her stepdaughter at a makeshift memorial on Sunday in Burlington. (Stephen Brashear / Associated Press) Associated Press Five people were killed in a shooting this weekend at a Macy's store in a mall north of Seattle. Authorities do not plan to make their identities public until Tuesday, but details about four of the victims have been reported by some of their employers and Washington state media. Here's what is known about them: Sarai Lara The 16-year-old high school sophomore was the youngest victim of the gunman who opened fire in the department store in the small city of Burlington. Lara survived cancer and was told by her doctor that she was doing well, her mother, Evangelina Lara, told the Seattle Times through a translator. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai Lara was proud of her heritage, her mother said. She had a wide network of friends at school and helped at home, caring for her 5-year-old sister. Born in Mount Vernon just south of Burlington, the teen was described by her mother as bright, all smiles and her "right hand" at home. "It's not fair what happened to her," Evangelina Lara said. :: Chuck Eagan Eagan was set to retire next year after decades as a maintenance worker for Boeing Co., his aunt Carol Thrush told the Associated Press. Boeing said in a statement that "we are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague." Eagan worked for 41 years at the company's commercial airplanes division in Everett, Boeing said. Thrush described Eagan, 61, as kind and generous with a beautiful smile. Her parents raised him in the tiny town of Unity in southeastern Oregon before they moved to the Seattle area when he was about 11. "He traveled with Boeing all over the world, doing repairs on airplanes," said Thrush, 77. "He was an all-around great guy." Thrush said her nephew told her that Eagan and his wife were eating dinner and shopping at the mall. They had made their way to Macy's when the shooter opened fire. The couple ran, but Eagan's wife fell down as she was trying to get away. Eagan was shot as he helped her, Thrush said. Eagan had two daughters and three grandchildren. :: Belinda Galde Galde, 64, was a longtime probation officer with the Snohomish County District Court who dedicated her life to helping those "who stumbled along the way in life," her colleagues said. In a statement, the court called Galde "a devoted and esteemed public servant." She started working there in 1989. "She was an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her co-workers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live," the court said. :: Shayla Martin Shayla Martin, 52, of Mount Vernon was working in the cosmetics department when the gunman opened fire, her older sister Karen Van Horn told the Daily Herald. Van Horn, who works at the newspaper, said her family received official word Sunday that Martin was among the dead. Officials said a body with Martin's work name tag was found at the scene, Van Horn said. Martin was an avid reader, regularly devouring two or three books a week, said Van Horn, who described her sister as classy, sweet and independent.

Win McNamee/Getty Images The conventional wisdom about Donald Trump is that on the debate stage and off, he’s unpredictable — so unpredictable that Martin O’Malley, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, told the Atlantic’s James Fallows that Trump is like “a monkey with a machine gun.” But the truth is that Trump’s 11 primary debates predicted his performance in the first presidential debate on September 26. In every debate appearance so far, he’s used a handful of tricks that, when they worked, did so because they aren’t the way politicians usually act. Trump approaches every debate like the world’s most high-stakes reality TV show, and the part he’s playing isn’t that of a US president, but of a winner. Trump creates catchphrases. He crafts narratives about heroes and villains. He sprinkles in commentary and asides to the audience. He stirs up interpersonal drama. And he appeared to firmly believe — like the reality TV contestants we love to hate — that he was the star of the show. It worked in the primaries, where he was able to stand out from the crowd, steamrolling opponents and flustering fact-checkers. But the same tactics that carried him to the Republican nomination faltered when Trump was confronted with a single opponent. He couldn’t fade into the background when the discussion turned to policy. He couldn’t rely on the fact that, eventually, the moderators would have to move on to someone else. Even worse, the fact that his reactions are repetitive and predictable made him easy to bait. To fare better against Hillary Clinton in Sunday’s second debate and in the third debate on October 19, Trump might have to develop some new tricks. But it appears to be difficult to him to abandon the formulas that got him this far. 1) Catchphrases: Trump speaks in memorable but meaningless three-word slogans Politicians have talking points. Reality TV stars, and Trump, have catchphrases. By now, you know his: “Build the wall.” “Bring jobs back.” “Take the oil.” “We don’t have a country.” “Make America great again.” At debates and at rallies, Trump returned to those themes like a band being asked to play “Freebird,” never straying too far from his greatest hits. Despite his reputation for being a man who would say just about anything on the debate stage, during the 11 primary debates he attended, he did the opposite. He strung the same catchphrases and stock vocabulary together into short, punchy, grammatically and syntactically unlikely sentences that were the opposite of political rhetoric. For example, here’s his closing statement from the fifth primary debate, in Las Vegas: I'm the most solid person up here. I built a tremendous company, and all I want to do is make America great again. I don't want our country to be taken away from us, and that's what's happening. The policies that we've suffered under other presidents have been a disaster for our country. We want to make America great again. During the primaries, Trump stuck out onstage because he didn’t sound like anyone else, and because his signature catchphrases stuck in your head. This was particularly true in the largest debates, when no one got much time to talk and other candidates’ answers tended to blend together. His penchant for short, simple, punchy sentences, though, contrasts with Clinton as well. The first presidential debate stayed away from some of Trump’s signature issues, particularly immigration. But Trump still responded, when possible, in his signature style: Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. Those aren’t all the same stock phrases Trump had previously used. But they rely on the same three-word rhythm. And when Trump could use a catchphrase or two, he seized on the opportunity, as when he was asked about crime: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. The problem is that in longer debates, Trump can’t only rely on catchphrases — and Clinton may very well embrace the contrast in their styles. 2) Mythmaking: Trump turns tough policy questions into simple stories Most politicians take a story about a specific example and then pivot to using that narrative to enforce a broader point. This is what Hillary Clinton was Trump does the opposite. He takes a broader point and boils it down to a specific story told in comic book terms about good and evil. Trump knows that people watch reality TV for the same reason they love sports and fairy tales. The easiest story to follow is a simple morality tale about heroes and villains. So when Trump was supposed to be selling a policy, he’d instead tell a story. Here’s his response during the sixth primary debate, in South Carolina, to the accusation that he was out of touch with conservative values because he was a New Yorker — something he’d already answered concisely by pointing out that William F. Buckley lived in Manhattan: When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it. And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. Though 9/11 turned into a story about heroes, mostly Trump’s stories from the primary debates were about villains. ISIS was cutting off heads and drowning people in metal cages. The families of the 9/11 attackers were tipped off before the fact and flew home (which did not happen). During the first presidential debate, his penchant for storytelling was most on display when discussing crime. Trump was asked how to heal the racial divide in America. Instead of reflecting on the question, he started telling stories about cities where things were going wrong: In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Particularly during the primary debates, Trump often wasn’t telling true stories. But the truth didn’t seem to matter so much as whether the story felt true. They have what Stephen Colbert calls “truthiness” or sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls the “deep story” — the stories are a way of explaining the world that feels true to Trump’s supporters. The story is a parable that’s meant to communicate a larger point — to his fans, fact-checking it is like asking the prodigal son’s father to show proof that he really killed the fatted calf. 3) The Gish Gallop: Trump’s endless parade of falsehoods The Gish Gallop, named after a believer in creationism, is a debate technique when you cite so much “evidence” that is misleading or wrong that your opponent can’t correct all of it and still make any of his or her own points. Trump is a master of this technique, and amplifies it by being unwilling to give an inch when challenged. During the fifth primary debate, nearly every substantive answer he gave included a wildly false claim: Trump claimed that people are “pouring across the Southern border.” (Border crossings dropped dramatically during the recession and have stayed at near-record lows since.) He alleged that among Syrian refugees and migrants, “tens of thousands of people” had “cellphones with ISIS flags on them.” (This came from a Norwegian newspaper report that an unspecified number of photos of executions and ISIS flags were found on migrants’ phones; the Norwegian police pointed out there might be benign reasons to have them, such as bearing witness to what they’d seen.) He claimed “numerous people … knew what was going on” before the San Bernardino attacks and that “they saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor, ammunition all over the place.” (There is no evidence this was true.) He claimed that before 9/11, “friends, family, girlfriends, were sent back … they knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.” (None of the hijackers even had family in the US before the attacks; this is an utterly false story.) And he repeated a falsehood he’s told many times since then: “I was totally against going into Iraq because you're going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly.” (Trump supported the Iraq War.) These falsehoods often go unchallenged. But even when they don’t, Trump utterly refuses to back down, as in this bizarre exchange from the third primary debate over whether he really persuaded CNBC to shorten its running time: TRUMP: Let me give you one quick example. These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours. I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30-second ad. I went out and said, it's ridiculous… Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad. JOHN HARWOOD: Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours. Sen. Rubio? TRUMP: That's not right. That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right. As PolitiFact explained, CNBC had planned for two hours of debate time, plus commercial breaks; the Trump and Carson campaigns demanded it be two hours including commercials, a marginal difference. But when Trump is challenged on his facts, he never backs down or even admits he’s exaggerating. During the first presidential debate, this was the technique Trump used when he was pressed on why he’d continued to publicly doubt whether Obama was born in the United States: But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce. This is a bizarre melange of insinuations and falsehoods. Clinton and her 2008 campaign were not involved in accusing Obama of having been born abroad. Blumenthal reportedly mentioned the rumor to someone at the McClatchy news service, but he did not “send a reporter” to check it out. Debunking all of this, though, would have taken up considerable time, and so most of it was allowed to stand. 4) Drama: How Trump riled up antagonists It wasn’t just policy questions that Trump reduced to heroes and villains. The debate stage, too, became a place for him to pick out an antagonist and engage in a dominance ritual with him (it was always a “him”), straining to shout him down or humiliate him. The sole point of many of these displays seemed to be to get attention. Often, they devolved into shouting matches over who was talking, as during the fifth debate: TRUMP: Am I talking or are you talking, Jeb? BUSH: I'm talking right now. I'm talking. TRUMP: You can go back. You're not talking. You interrupted me. BUSH: September 30, you said… TRUMP: Are you going to apologize, Jeb? No. Am I allowed to finish? Trump would also pick out one or two antagonists during any given debate — always some combination of Bush, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz — to try to take down. The point wasn’t to get them to concede a policy point to him, but to establish that Trump was the one who should be allowed to talk. Trump used personal insults and accusations of interrupting. He turned attacks against him; at the 11th Republican debate on Fox News, when Rubio criticized Trump University as a scam and a fraud, Trump retorted, “He scammed the people of Florida. He scammed people. He doesn't vote. He doesn't show up for the US Senate. He doesn't vote. He scammed the people. He defrauded the people of Florida.” Usually, nobody came out of these exchanges looking good. But Trump figured out that, in primary debates as on reality TV, the cameras love the contestant who knows how to get attention. And Trump is great at getting attention. Early in the first presidential debate, Trump was able to pull Clinton into some of these exchanges — and the first one ended badly for her: TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to... CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald... TRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it. CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state... TRUMP: Excuse me. CLINTON: And I have done a lot... TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion. “That is your opinion” is not, shall we say, a stinging comeback. As the debate went on, Clinton got pulled into fewer of these exchanges. Perhaps she realized that it’s very hard to win one head-to-head against Trump — and that both candidates involved just end up looking worse. 5) Running commentary: Trump lets the voters peek behind the curtain At nearly every primary debate, Trump would turn to what he considered the ultimate source of authority: his poll numbers. But this was part of a larger pattern of providing running commentary on the race, his opponents’ strategies, and sometimes his own — as if, having participated in the drama on the main stage, he was now filming the talking head segment where he turns to the camera for an interview about what just happened. Citing his poll numbers, which he did constantly, is part of this — appealing to what he considers the ultimate arbiter, popularity, to sum up his standings. But Trump also provides more running meta-commentary on the process of running for president, hinting that he’s letting the audience in on a big secret. For example, during the 10th primary debate, after he said that insurance executives didn’t like his proposal to repeal Obamacare in favor of letting insurers sell across state lines: I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He's not laughing so much anymore. Hi. Even if Trump is lying about everything else, his honesty about his own cynicism can come off as refreshing. But it’s another way that, as a showman, he understands how to get the public’s attention. During the first presidential debate, Trump didn’t rely as much on this strategy, perhaps because the polls haven’t been favorable to him. 6) Filibusters: Trump runs out the clock before he has to give details Politicians are experts at not answering the question they were asked. The classic move is to call it a “very good question” and pivot to a somewhat related subject on which they can speak more expertly. Trump’s version of this is a bit different, because he doesn’t seem to care if he sounds expert at all, so long as he’s eating up the clock and making it less likely that he’ll be pressed for details. During the primary debates, he often would ramble enough to fill up nearly all the time he was allotted, then throw out a catchphrase or generalization. From the second primary debate: JAKE TAPPER: What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria? TRUMP: So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero. Syria’s a mess. You look at what’s going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: we’re fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe — and I may be wrong, in which case I’d probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. We don’t get along with China. We don’t get along with the heads of Mexico. We don’t get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and every other way. We get along with nobody. I will get along, I think, with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable — stable world. This is the strategy Trump turned to when he was asked about cybersecurity during the first presidential debate. In the answer to a question and follow-up from moderator Lester Holt, he referred to the issue as “the cyber,” referenced his preteen son, suggested “someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds” could have hacked into the Democratic National Committee, and mentioned how many generals and admirals had endorsed him. He did not answer the question of who is behind the growing trend of cyber attacks, or suggest how he would fight it. And although moderators, at both the primary debates and on September 26, pressed Trump to actually answer the question, eventually, they had to give up and move on. These word-salad answers are not victories for Trump. But they play off his cast-iron resistance to embarrassment. Trump seems to think that as long as he’s talking, he’s winning. 7) Egomania: Trump only cares when the conversation is about him Donald Trump never appears to doubt that he’s the main attraction, the center of attention in every room he’s in. During the primary debates, this translated to Trump engaging quickly if he were personally named or insulted but fading into the background — and often appearing not to pay attention at all — when candidates turned to other topics. During the fourth debate in Milwaukee, several candidates had a spirited exchange about budgetary policy. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio scuffled over whether Rubio’s proposed child tax credit was conservative, then went on to debate military spending. Cruz piggybacked on Rubio’s point — that defending the US through military spending was a necessity — to name the programs he’d like to eliminate, and Carly Fiorina spoke up for zero-based budgeting. It was a dense, interesting conversation that exposed real differences among the candidates. Trump didn’t try to cut into it until he was called on, and then gave a vague answer that suggested he was paying the bare minimum of attention: “We all have a different tax plan. Some I don’t totally agree with. One thing we understand, each one of those tax plans is better than the mess that we have right now.” Trump not paying attention went beyond fading into the background. In Miami, at the final debate, Rubio went after Trump for saying he could save Social Security by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, correctly pointing out the math on that was ludicrous. In a minute-long answer, Rubio said Trump’s numbers “don’t add up” or “won’t add up” three times. CNN’s Dana Bash then turned to Trump, and he appeared to have missed the entire exchange: BASH: Sen. Rubio says that your numbers don't add up. What's your response, Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well, I don't know if he's saying that. Trump doesn’t seem to be joking; he doesn’t pause to wait for audience reaction. And it fits with his pattern of rarely responding to what other candidates have said unless they mention him by name. But Trump could count on a few certainties in those early debates: The conversation would have to move on. He could run out the clock with filibusters, give vague answers, and be confident that he’d face at most one or two follow-up questions. He would find an opponent willing to rise to his bait, participating in his version of testosterone-laden drama. If the debate turned to policy, he could fade into the background. In the first matchup with Clinton, these strategies didn’t work nearly as well. His attention and focus frayed after 30 minutes of intense back-and-forth, and there was no way for him to fade into the background. He was expected to answer a question beyond simply giving catchphrases. And his attempts to start personal fights with Clinton backfired as often as they succeeded. If Trump is going to perform better in the second and third debates, his track record so far suggests his usual tricks won’t be enough. Was this article helpful?

The airline’s last Boeing 747 commercial flight is scheduled for a round trip from Hong Kong to Haneda Airport in Tokyo on September 30. After the plane returns from Japan, Cathay’s 747 fleet will be officially replaced by the Boeing 777-300ER, which is slightly smaller but with more economical twin-jet engines. Hong Kong says farewell to giant of aviation The Boeing 747, dubbed the “queen of the skies”, is recognised as one of the most important inventions of the 20th century, making long-haul travel affordable for passengers. The double-decker jet can carry more than 400 passengers and has a flight range of 7,260 nautical miles compared to about 189 passengers and 5,750 miles by its predecessor, the Boeing 707. But current aviation trends seem to favour lighter and more economical jets. Tony Britton, an aircraft project manager at Cathay, said the company now flies to smaller airports, so ultra-large aircraft are no longer suitable. Britton added that the number of flights by the new 777s would be increased. “We now have five flights to London. We prefer connectivity and frequency now,” he said. Cathay has been retiring 747 passenger jets since 2005. But Britton said 23 freighter versions of the 747s will stay in service with the newest model expected to serve the company’s air freight business for another 25 years. Boeing is about to emerge a huge winner from China’s online shopping boom The retired 747s will be sent to the United States and United Kingdom to be disassembled with valuable components recycled. Cathay owned up to 25 such passenger jets in the early 2000s. Inflight service manager Monica Tong, who began her flight attendant career on a 747, said the plane also contributed to her profession. She benefitted from Cathay’s expansion as the arrival of the 747s in 1979 helped the airline quadruple its annual passenger volumes by 1995. “It was my dream to go beyond Asia and travel the world, and it was thanks to the 747 that I was able to do so,” Tong said. Her favourite memory of the 747 is its spiral staircase, which connected the two decks. “I remember kids used to play rock-paper-scissors on the stairs,” Tong said. “The winner of each round went up a step, and kids competed to get to the upper deck.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Cathay to retire 747 fleet as time flies   Most Popular Viewed 1 Barred Hong Kong localists vow to keep fighting after High Court decision 2 Game changes in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council after ban of two localist lawmakers 3 Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 4 Tycoon Joseph Lau reveals details of breakup with ex-girlfriend in full-page newspaper announcement 5 Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup Shared 1 Barred Hong Kong localists vow to keep fighting after High Court decision 2 Tycoon Joseph Lau reveals details of breakup with ex-girlfriend in full-page newspaper announcement 3 Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup 4 Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 5 Hong Kong’s disqualified localist pair vow to appeal and seek injunction to stop their Legco seats being declared vacant Commented 1 Independence advocates are putting Hong Kong on a dangerous path, former Jockey Club chairman warns 2 Watch: Local soccer fans chant ‘We are Hong Kong!’ during China national anthem before EAFF game against North Korea 3 A moment of madness: Hong Kong defenders go to sleep and concede soft goal in defeat by North Korea 4 Will China’s plan to get everyone in the country exercising make an impact on Hong Kong? 5 Take that Trump!

Avcorp announced the deal earlier this week. The contracts are for a variety of components – doors, panels and spoilers – for Boeing’s 737 MAX and 777X passenger jets. Avcorp, which is headquartered in Delta, has fabrication plants in Ontario and Los Angeles. The company has not yet decided where the bulk of the new work will be done. “Some of the work will certainly be done in Delta,” said Peter George, who was named CEO in 2014 as part of a management reorganisation. “I think we’ll make a final decision later this year on selecting the manufacturing sites for the majority of the contract that has just been announced. We will definitely have to add people to the company to execute these orders over the coming years.” Avcorp employs a total of 700 people, half of whom work in Delta. On large orders like the Boeing contract, the company typically takes several months in development before it starts production. George points out that large contracts like the newest one with Boeing are often extended with future orders. “What we’ve announced is just the firm contracted period, but it’s been customary for us to extend those contracts over and over again, especially with Boeing.” The Boeing contract isn’t the only large one that Avcorp has won in recent years. It also won a C$500 million (US 379.7 million) contract a few years ago to make components for the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 stealth fighter. There is some question, however, whether Canadian aerospace companies like Avcorp will continue to receive orders on the F-35 project if the federal government decides not to go with the F-35 as a replacement for Canada’s aging CF-18 fighter jets. Initially, the Trudeau government announced it was considering buying the F/A-18 Super Hornet, which is made by Boeing. George said the aerospace industry wants to see the decision base on an open competition. “I think there’s a consensus in Canadian aerospace that the best thing for Canada, because there’s so many factors to be considered, is just an open and competitive process,” George said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 2 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 3 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers 4 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 5 Xi Jinping warns Communist Party would be ‘overthrown’ if Taiwan’s independence push left unchecked Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 3 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 4 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers 5 The C-word: why Hong Kong localists have offended all Chinese Commented 1 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 2 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 3 Xi Jinping warns Communist Party would be ‘overthrown’ if Taiwan’s independence push left unchecked 4 Lock them up: localist thugs have brought things to a new low with their mindless violence 5 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers Promotions Your FREE copy of Home Essentials 2017 now!

Authorities do not plan to make their identities public until Tuesday, but details about three of the victims have been reported by Washington state media. Here's what is known about them: ___ SARAI LARA: A security guard working at the Cascade Mall places flowers at a makeshift memorial on Sunday, Sept. 25, 2016, in Burlington, Wash., to the five victims killed in a shooting at the mall on Friday.

(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) The 16-year-old high school sophomore was the youngest victim of the gunman who opened fire in department store in the small city of Burlington. Born in Mount Vernon just south of Burlington, Lara was described by her mother Evangelina as bright, all smiles and her mother's "right hand" at home for the family. The teen survived cancer and was told by her doctor that she was doing well, Evangelina Lara told The Seattle Times( https://goo.gl/YMQvxk) through a translator. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai Lara was proud of her heritage, her mother said. She had a wide network of friends at school and helped at home, caring for year 5-year-old sister. "It's not fair what happened to her," Evangelina Lara said. ___ CHUCK EAGAN: Eagan was a longtime Boeing Co. maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, his aunt, Carol Thrush told ( http://bit.ly/2cYDJn0 ) The Seattle Times. She said Eagan and his wife were out for a dinner and shopping at the mall. They had made their way to Macy's when the shooter opened fire. Thrush said Eagan and his wife ran, but his wife fell down as she was trying to get away. Eagan was shot as he helped his wife, Thrush said. Thrush said Eagan had two daughters and three grandchildren. He planned to retire from Boeing next year and hoped to travel. ___ BELINDA GALDE: Galde, 64, was a longtime probation officer with the Skagit County District Court. The court in a statement described Galde as "an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live."

up next: now reading: What It's Like to Debate Trump AP Photo/David Goldman What It's Like to Debate Trump By Rebecca Berg September 26, 2016 AP Photo/David Goldman X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton prepare to take the stage Monday for the first of three debates before the election, RealClearPolitics spoke with two veterans of the Republican primary about their impressions after having faced Trump in that setting. Michael Steel, a former senior adviser to Jeb Bush, and Frank Sadler, Carly Fiorina’s campaign manager, pointed to Trump’s debating style — confident, if vague on details — as his greatest asset. “I think it’s a combination of skills honed over his years as an entertainer — a combination of bravado and shamelessness,” said Steel. They agreed Trump has an unusually good ear for sound bites and confrontations that will capture the media’s attention, often to his advantage. Meanwhile, they noted his uncanny ability to dodge details, or even his own past statements, without consequence. Both were struck by a moment during the second GOP presidential primary debate, hosted by CNN at the Ronald Reagan Library, when conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump what his priority would be among the nuclear triad, meaning would he beef up the land, sea, and air missiles that can deliver nuclear warheads. Trump, apparently unfamiliar with the term, spoke for a few minutes about nuclear proliferation and the Iraq War, before concluding: “Nuclear is just the power — the devastation is very important to me." A response like that might have been damning for another candidate, but it did not stick to Trump — foreshadowing fundamental challenges on the debate stage for his GOP rivals, and now Clinton.  Michael Steel, former senior adviser to Jeb Bush: [Trump] managed to come up with words that sort of formed sentences, but [when] asked a very specific policy-based question, an important one, he had no response. He managed to string together words. He never gets that deer-in-the-headlights look, even when he clearly does not know what he’s talking about. I don’t remember him ever being flummoxed. At the North Charleston debate, he had an answer on Boeing and trade jobs that showed some preparation [Boeing is a major employer in South Carolina and there have been tensions over an attempt to unionize the workers. Trump said in the debate that these jobs could move to China.] It’s an obvious attack given the huge Boeing plant right up the road from that venue, that these are good-paying SC jobs that you’re essentially going to throw away. And he had a response about Boeing now having to do manufacturing in China. And what he said wasn’t accurate, but it had a kernel of truth to it and was based on a relatively recent news story, which suggested to me he was doing some kind of traditional debate prep, in the sense that that was an obvious attack given the location and he had a factual-ish response. Secretary Clinton needs to be prepared for Trump to say things that are wildly factually inaccurate. I think she needs to be prepared for the fact that he is most dangerous when he is on the defensive. If she feels like she lands a blow or is scoring points, that’s when they need to be most worried about him launching a personal attack or saying something outlandish. [A debate moderator needs to have] a big personality, because in addition to being completely fluid on the facts, [Trump’s] perfectly happy to walk over you. He’s got a lot of skills of an entertainer, of a television personality, that make it very difficult for traditional candidates to debate him. He hates being told he’s wrong, he hates being challenged factually or those kind of things, but I don’t recall him ever losing his temper. He’ll roll his eyes, he’ll interrupt, he’ll talk over people. Those are a lot of things that would not traditionally be considered presidential, but I don’t remember him hurting himself that badly. People expect him to be undisciplined, and I don’t recall him ever really having a bad moment like that. Trump does his worst when there’s that consistent focus on him. A strong, well-informed moderator and a single opponent is probably a much worse format for Donald Trump. Frank Sadler, former campaign manager for Carly Fiorina: Hugh Hewitt asked Donald Trump about the nuclear triad, which had a very specific answer to it. Trump doesn’t know the answer and gives his made-for-TV answer, and a lot of the people watching think it’s completely great. I know Hugh Hewitt knows the answer to the question. And I do remember feeling like, if that had been Mitt Romney and he had said that, things would have been a lot different. I was like, wow, that’s not the right answer, Hugh Hewitt knows it’s not the right answer, and yet it didn’t seem to matter at the moment. If the goal is, let’s really understand how these folks are going to tackle policy in the administration, if that’s really what you want, to get somehow a deeper dive into what they think about policy, then I think you probably have to handle the debate differently than if it were Mitt Romney there or John McCain. The expectation is that, yeah, Donald Trump is going to say something that probably isn’t politically correct, or sexist, or was a little off the cuff, but [viewers seem to let him off the hook and tell themselves] that’s not really what he means, he’s just not as articulate. With Mitt Romney, everything was scripted, so anytime he misspoke it was a much bigger deal. Absolutely to his credit, [Trump] has a very good grasp of how to handle the spotlight, how to handle the media. I don’t mean that in a condescending way to the media, but he’s very gifted at understanding how to take advantage of those moments. It’s different than how other people have done it, and he’s very astute at that. If the debate is not about diving deep into policy, really getting in the weeds on this stuff, I do think this is set up much better for Donald Trump than it is for [Clinton]. It’s weird to use this word, but he is authentic. You are seeing who he is, right? Take it or leave it, it is what it is. Hillary has been immersed in the policy world for 30 years. She’s incredibly studied. She knows this stuff. She’s brilliant when it comes to policy. I don’t agree with her policy stances, but I absolutely think that she’s given serious thought over the years to policy. If the debate is about how you make one policy decision over another, that’s fine, she’ll be great. I don’t suspect that’s what this is, and so this is about relating to the voter. I think being authentic is much more valuable than simply knowing all the right answers. She knows all the right answers, I just don’t think she’s particularly authentic. I do think he understands how to capture those 30 seconds or 90 seconds and not get hung up on what the press wants him to say, or what the policy wonks at [the] Heritage [Foundation] want him to say, or what I want him to say. I think he’s very gifted at understanding … the American people, and authenticity means more to them. He really is good at coming across as authentic. Debate prep doesn’t solve that, if that’s your problem. Rebecca Berg is a national political reporter for RealClearPolitics.

 An airline pilot reveals why the Boeing 757 is truly unique Benjamin Zhang, Business Insider Sep. 25, 2016, 11:13 AM 17,984 facebook twitter pinterest email copy link American Airlines Boeing 757.Flickr/Aero Icarus Twelve years after Boeing discontinued the 757, the long-time 'tweener in the company's lineup is still popular among U.S. airlines. American, Delta, and United all operate large fleets of the airplane. Even though the Renton, Washington-based plane maker booked more than 1,000 orders for the jet over its two decades in production, it was never a hot seller. By the early 2000's, sales of the 757 had all but dried up, and Boeing put the plane out to pasture in 2004. Although many of the planes are pushing 25 years of service, airlines are hanging onto their 757s. For instance, Delta, who has spent big bucks on a fleet of new jets, recently refurbished the cabins of its aging 757s instead of replacing them with newer planes.  So why are its customer's so loyal? Is the 757 that good? To get some answers, Business Insider recently spoke with author and Boeing 757 pilot Patrick Smith about the plane. "There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched," Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential, told Business Insider in an interview. "It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes." Delta Boeing 757.REUTERS/Tami Chappell During it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity — a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets.  Boeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 — called the MAX 9 —  as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity.  "Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement," Smith said, "In some respects it can and in some respects it can't." For instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757. According to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground.  "The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots," he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway. Furthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude.  Runway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform — trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload out of smaller secondary airports.  Boeing 737 MAX 9.Boeing "The 737 falls short when you're trying to fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much," Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, "there's is concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel." The reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform. "The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago," Smith told us. "It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for." As a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew. Unfortunately, the amount of room underneath the wings hasn't changed. Thus, Boeing has all but maxed out on the size of the engines it can mount on the 737 without completely redesigning the plane's under carriage.  Instead of a stretched 737, Smith believes Boeing should have gone for an updated version of the 757 at some point during its production run. "Somewhere along the way, had Being just re-engined the 757 with a new cockpit and new internal systems, it could have been a big hit," Smith told us. In a statement to Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson wrote: "The 737 MAX will extend the Next-Generation 737 range advantage with the capability to fly more than 3,500 nautical miles. That’s an increase of 340-570 nmi over the (current generation) 737NG which gives our customers the flexibility to open up new markets." Icelandair Boeing 757.Flickr/Eric Salard With that said, the 757 isn't a perfect plane. "It's a 6-across (seating) narrow body that's long and thin," Smith said. "And for passengers, it can take a long time to board and disembark."  In addition, the 757's cockpit is pretty old-fashioned when compared to modern airliners such as the 737 MAX. The controls of the 757 are also much heavier for pilots than its sibling — the Boeing 767. The 757 and 767 were developed at the same time and feature virtually identical cockpits.  Finally, the Boeing 757 leaves a massive amount of wake turbulence as it flies — forcing air traffic controllers to keep other planes far away from passing 757s.  "No one really knows why, but the 757 has really strong wake turbulence," Smith told us. "The early 757s had worse wake turbulence than the 747." Although Smith added that the addition of winglets on later 757s have greatly decreased the wake turbulence. The Boeing 757 is an aircraft that's come and gone. It's served its tour of duty with honor and distinction. Now, it's time for Boeing to find a replacement worthy of stepping into its shoes.  Read the original article on Business Insider. Copyright 2016. Follow Business Insider on Twitter.

Karen was born in Culver City, CA, to Henry and Lena Rosenberger on October 10, 1950. She graduated with high honors from Eastmont High School in 1969. She lettered in her favorite sport, tennis. Moving on to Western Washington State College, she received a degree in education. Karen decided not to pursue teaching, rather taking a civil service position in 1972 with the U.S. Air Force Plant Representative Office (AFPRO) at Boeing Plant 2, Seattle, WA. She began as a Procurement Clerk with the Minuteman Missile Program. She subsequently completed training and received her warrant as an Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO). Karen was ACO for the Minuteman program for a short time, and in 1984 she became ACO for the E-3 Sentry, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS). She was responsible for administering the U.S. Government contracts for the USAF, NATO, Saudi and Japanese AWACS programs. As the U.S. Government representative, Karen accepted delivery of each E-3 aircraft from The Boeing Company. During her time in this position, she was awarded numerous awards and citations for her work performance. Karen frequently travelled internationally representing the U.S. Air Force. The AFPRO later became part of the Defense Contract Management Agency, from which Karen retired on October 4, 2002. During her time at the Boeing facility, Karen met and married Lt. Col. Jack Pierson (USAF/Retired), who was also working at the Boeing plant. After retirement, she and Jack moved to the Sequim area, building their retirement place on 20 acres of land up on Blue Mountain. After Jack’s untimely death, Karen sold the house and moved down the mountain to her new home in Sequim. Oh, how she loved her new home. She made many trips over the mountains back to Quincy, WA, to see her family. We always looked forward to spending time with Karen. She was a huge supporter of many local events and artists in the Sequim area. Karen was a diehard 12 Seahawk fan, attending home games with her long-time friend, Jim Doherty. They attended Super Bowl XLIX and that result really upset her. She always flew a Seahawks flag at her home during the season. She loved watching her beloved Hawks, especially Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Russell Wilson. The Hawks have lost a true fan. Karen was preceded in death by her parents, Henry and Lena Rosenberger; her husband, Jack H. Pierson; her brother, Jim Rosenberger of Rock Island, WA; her niece, Gwen Taylor; and nephew, Mark Rosenberger of Quincy, WA. She is survived by her sister, Margy, Wenatchee, WA; brother, Ken, Wenatchee, WA; sister-in-law, Marilyn, Wenatchee, WA; brother, Gene and wife, Rhonda, Quincy, WA; nephew, Corey and wife, Taran, Quincy, WA; niece, Susie and husband, Bob, Covington, WA; nephew, Michael and wife, Stephanie, Salmon, ID; step-son, Barclay Pierson and wife, Lorri, Renton, WA; step-son, Graham Pierson and wife, Belen, VA; great-nephews and nieces, Ben and Cameron Williams; Zack, Moses and Titus Taylor; Hunter and Ashlyn Rosenberger; Caitlyn and Chase Schuler; Rachel and Stecker Pierson and Briana Pierson. Plans for celebrating Karen’s life will be announced at a later date. Please leave a memory for the family or sign their on-line guestbook, www.scharbachs.com.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 25, 2016 at 12:13PM Image source: Arianspace.  "Arianespace confirms its status as the most reliable launch services provider in the marketplace." -- Arianespace I have to admit, when Arianespace made this boast last week -- just days after I penned a column ranking the success records of the big three space launchers United Launch Alliance (ULA), Arianespace, and SpaceX, in that order -- my eyebrows raised a bit. At last count, United Launch Alliance -- the Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) joint venture -- had successfully launched 111 rockets into orbit, in a row, without any of them blowing up in the process. Airbus-controlled (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) Arianespace, on the other hand, with an enviable record of 73 straight successful Ariane 5 rocket launches, looked like the second "most reliable launch services provider in the marketplace" -- not the first. And yet, when you dig into the numbers, there does seem to be an argument to be made in Arianespace's favor. For one thing, Arianespace has been in business longer than ULA. (Prior to ULA's formation 10 years ago, Boeing and Lockheed operated as separate launch providers. Arianespace, which according to S&P Global Market Intelligence was established in 1979, thus had a head start on ULA -- and has operated without mishap for the last 13 years). All of which got me thinking: Now that SpaceX has blown up another rocket, and is temporarily sidelined from the "most reliable" race, could it be true that Airbus' spaciest subsidiary is more reliable than United Launch Alliance? And if that is true, then when combined with the lower prices Ariane charges for launch services, could this be bad news for ULA's business -- and for Boeing and Lockheed's profits? Digging into the numbers Ariane's press release boasts an impressive number of "firsts" and "mosts." Of course, it's largely a marketing document, so let's put a few of its claims to the test, starting with... Ariane: The biggest booster? In August 2016, an Ariane 5 launcher boosted 10,735 kg into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO -- a much higher orbit than standard low earth orbit, or LEO), its largest payload ever. That was an impressive accomplishment -- because according to Ariane's own website, the Ariane 5 is only rated to carry 10 tons of cargo (10,000 kg) to GTO. 10,735 kg is also nearly two tons more than SpaceX says its Falcon 9 rocket can lift. And yet, according to ULA's website, ULA's Delta IV heavy rocket is capable of launching more than 13,800 kg to GTO. Meanwhile, SpaceX's upcoming Falcon Heavy rocket will boast a 22,200 kg maximum... Ariane: Most prolific? Ariane has launched seven rockets so far this year, off a launch manifest of 11. That's a good start to the year. At last report, though, ULA had already launched eight times -- and planned to conduct as many as 15 Atlas V and Delta IV launches this year. SpaceX, too, notched eight successful launches before its September "anomaly." Ariane: Biggest backlog? Shifting from boasts of what it has done, to what it plans to do in the future, Ariane notes that it "has won a total of eight new contracts in 2016," and now has "an order book worth 5.3 billion euros" ($5.9 billion) for future launches. These are impressive stats. They may even be better than what United Launch Alliance can claim. Inquiring of the latter's total, I was informed that United Launch Alliance does not disclose the size of its order book because that information is "proprietary." SpaceX, on the other hand, is more than happy to tell investors how much business it has landed -- "over $10 billion in contracts," or nearly twice Ariane's tally. Ariane: Where are the profits? Left unmentioned in Ariane's press release is one fact that arguably matters most to investors (including, one imagines, Ariane's own majority shareholder, Airbus): Profits. In its April report on financial results for fiscal 2015, Ariane reported generating $1.6 billion. However, it earned only $4.5 million in profit on that revenue -- a fact that even Arianespace admitted meant it was operating at only "break-even." In contrast, ULA earned operating profits nearly 100 times as large last year -- $400 million. So what does this mean for investors in Boeing and Lockheed? Good news! Ariane is a superb company, boasting an admirable record of success on multiple launch platforms, launch prices that beat ULA with a stick, and -- once the Ariane 6 is built -- a decent chance of competing against SpaceX on price. Ariane is not, however, the clear winner in the space race. Indeed, the most surprising revelation to come out of this whole exercise is this: United Launch Alliance stacks up pretty well against Arianespace -- even in the areas where Ariane says it is establishing "performance records." And when it comes to profits, ULA stands head and shoulders above Ariane. Admittedly, this fact may itself be a factor of Ariane not charging as much on its launches as ULA does. But for investors, it's the bottom line that counts. And that's where United Launch Alliance, and by extension, its Boeing and Lockheed Martin owners, clearly win the race.

 An airline pilot reveals why the Boeing 757 is truly unique Benjamin Zhang, Business Insider Sep. 25, 2016, 11:13 AM 17,984 facebook twitter pinterest email copy link American Airlines Boeing 757.Flickr/Aero Icarus Twelve years after Boeing discontinued the 757, the long-time 'tweener in the company's lineup is still popular among U.S. airlines. American, Delta, and United all operate large fleets of the airplane. Even though the Renton, Washington-based plane maker booked more than 1,000 orders for the jet over its two decades in production, it was never a hot seller. By the early 2000's, sales of the 757 had all but dried up, and Boeing put the plane out to pasture in 2004. Although many of the planes are pushing 25 years of service, airlines are hanging onto their 757s. For instance, Delta, who has spent big bucks on a fleet of new jets, recently refurbished the cabins of its aging 757s instead of replacing them with newer planes.  So why are its customer's so loyal? Is the 757 that good? To get some answers, Business Insider recently spoke with author and Boeing 757 pilot Patrick Smith about the plane. "There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched," Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential, told Business Insider in an interview. "It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes." Delta Boeing 757.REUTERS/Tami Chappell During it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity — a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets.  Boeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 — called the MAX 9 —  as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity.  "Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement," Smith said, "In some respects it can and in some respects it can't." For instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757. According to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground.  "The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots," he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway. Furthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude.  Runway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform — trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload out of smaller secondary airports.  Boeing 737 MAX 9.Boeing "The 737 falls short when you're trying to fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much," Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, "there's is concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel." The reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform. "The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago," Smith told us. "It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for." As a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew.

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript It's only been a few months since the Boeing 787 Dreamliner flew off the ground after a three-year delay and already there is a concern. Boeing says it discovered a problem with the body of the plane known as the fuselage and is in the process of making repairs. The plane maker says there are no short-term safety concerns. Japan's All Nippon Airways, the first customer to fly the plane, says it has done reviews and the aircraft will fly as normal. But the plane is under scrutiny because it is the world's first commercial airplane made mostly of lightweight carbon composites, which increases fuel efficiency. Main rival Airbus recently had to deal with wing cracks on its A380 superjumbo jet. Boeing was quick to say the repairs will not impact the production schedule for the 787. The company is hoping to ramp up production to 10 a month by the end of next year, in hopes of making up for lost time after that multi-year delay. There are more than 800 orders for the new plane, but Boeing only gets paid with the planes are actually delivered to air carriers, and ready to go up in the air.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) Boeing exec says Canada looking at data in fighter jet purchase By Leah Schnurr Reuters Sep 26, 2016 (…) An F/A-18 Super Hornet sits on the flight deck of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman, off the coast of Florida, Sunday, Sept. 20, 2009. The ship was participating in a Joint Task Force Exercise in preparation for deployment to Afghanistan. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) OTTAWA • Canada is assessing data from bidders to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets, a Boeing Co. executive said on Monday. The country's Liberal government promised during last year's election that it would launch an open competition to replace Canada's CF-18 fighter aircraft. It pledged not to buy Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 jets, as the previous Conservative government had planned to do, calling them expensive and unnecessary. While the government has yet to release details on such a competition, it requested data this summer from five companies that have fighter aircraft in production or planned production, including Lockheed and Boeing, which wants Canada to buy its St. Louis-made F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. The government sought up-to-date information on areas including capabilities and economic benefits. "The focus on data was very clear, very strong," said Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, the unit which handles Boeing's strategy and operations outside the United States. "It gave all of the suppliers a chance to set down in black and white what it is their platform does." Since then, Boeing has been engaged in a "ping-pong" set of questions and answers with the government, said Allen. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan has said the government foresees a growing capability gap in the 2020s and that there is an urgent need to replace the CF-18s. "They know it's imperative to solve that capability gap," said Allen. "They are moving in a way that says they understand that." Allen said ordinarily it can take multiple years from when an order is placed to when jets are delivered.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring The other potential fighter jet suppliers are Saab AB, Dassault Aviation SA, and the Eurofighter consortium, which includes Airbus Group. As Boeing campaigns to win the contract, it is citing the work opportunities that would be available to Canadian firms across the country if the federal government were to purchase the Super Hornet. Allen did not rule out giving work to struggling planemaker Bombardier Inc., noting that Boeing always works with its competitors. "We're not going to rule out anybody from the perspective of who would be a good partner," he said. Boeing earlier this month formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick the F-35 fighter jet over the Super Hornet, citing a flawed evaluation process.

By Isaac Arnsdorf and Seung Min Kim 09/26/16 06:28 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Saudi Arabia is mounting a last-ditch campaign to scuttle legislation allowing families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the kingdom — and they're enlisting major American companies to make an economic case against the bill. General Electric, Dow Chemical, Boeing and Chevron are among the corporate titans that have weighed in against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which passed both chambers unanimously and was vetoed on Friday, according to people familiar with the effort. The companies are acting quietly to avoid the perception of opposing victims of terrorism, but they're responding to Saudi arguments that their own corporate assets in the kingdom could be at risk if the law takes effect. Story Continued Below Meanwhile, Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader who now co-leads Squire Patton Boggs' lobbying group, e-mailed Senate legislative directors on Monday warning that the bill could lead other countries to withdraw their assets from the United States and retaliate with laws allowing claims against American government actions. "Many foreign entities have long-standing, intimate relations with U.S. financial institutions that they would undoubtedly unwind, to the further detriment of the U.S. economy," reads one of the attachments, obtained by POLITICO. "American corporations with interests abroad may be at risk of retaliation, a possibility recently expressed by GE and Dow." Still, the Saudis and their agents face a significant uphill battle, with lawmakers loath to take a vote against victims of the 9/11 attacks right before an election. There was little public opposition to the bill as it made its way through the Capitol, and even now, efforts to tweak the bill haven't caught much traction. Senate to vote Wednesday on override of Saudi 9/11 bill By Seung Min Kim Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Monday that the Senate will vote Wednesday on a motion to override President Barack Obama's veto, and if override advocates are successful there, the House will take the same vote Thursday or Friday, a House Republican leadership aide said. But even if Obama receives the first veto override of his presidency, the story won't end there: the Saudis will seek a new bill to scale back the law in the lame-duck session or in the next session, after lawmakers are relieved from the heat of the campaign, people familiar with the plans said. "It's Washington at its finest," one of the people said. While the White House has emphasized national security to justify rejecting the bill, enlisting business interests could prove influential with lawmakers representing places where the companies have significant economic footprints. Companies could lose favored access to the Saudi market and see their own assets subject to seizure in lawsuits, just as Saudi holdings in the U.S. would be, people familiar with the situation said. "While I understand that the sponsors are well-intentioned, the bill potentially could have serious consequences for our country's critical relationships in the Middle East and with the rest of the world," GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt wrote in a Sept. 22 letter to McConnell obtained by POLITICO. "The bill is not balanced, sets a dangerous precedent, and has real potential to destabilize bilateral relationships and the global economy." In May GE committed to investing $3 billion in Saudi water, energy, aviation and digital projects, part of the country's push to diversify its economy from oil. One source familiar with Boeing's effort said the company wrote in the letter that the victims’ families deserve justice but argued that the economic consequences of the bill were important to consider. The letter warned of potential job losses, the source said. Dow Chemical is also lobbying against the bill, people familiar with the campaign said. Opposition bubbles in Congress to Saudi 9/11 bill By Seung Min Kim Dow has several facilities in Saudi Arabia and Boeing this year sent its first 787 jet to Saudi Arabian Airlines. Chevron, which has an oil field and chemical plants in the kingdom, reported lobbying on the bill last quarter, disclosure show. Several financial firms are also monitoring the legislation but not taking a stand on it. The Saudis are now spending more than $250,000 a month fighting the bill, retaining powerhouses Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Glover Park Group, Sphere Consulting and Squire Patton Boggs. Besides working with companies invested in Saudi Arabia, the lobbyists are directly contacting lawmakers, placing opinion articles and seeking support from think tank scholars. GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bob Corker of Tennessee are trying to hammer out a compromise that would soften the bill, bringing it in line with previously proposed versions rather than keeping the harsher language that just passed. A proposed amendment obtained by POLITICO — an effort that one person said was led primarily by Graham — suggests restoring an exemption for discretionary government actions, which the document says would prevent American interference in foreign countries' internal policies and vice versa. A Graham spokesman declined to comment on the language. Graham, who had voiced concerns about the legislation, said in an interview last week that discussions to address those issues were "not at the level I would appreciate." "We'll see," Graham said then. "Time will tell." GE declined to comment beyond Immelt's letter. Dow, Boeing, Chevron and the Saudi embassy didn't answer requests for comment.

Fly-by-wire refers to the electronic, semi-automatic system for controlling aircraft that replaces manual pilot controls. The Airbus A320 was the first fly-by-wire airliner to enter commercial service and the system has since been used on its newer planes, including the A330, superjumbo A380 and the latest airliner in the sky, the A350. Airbus Four of the world's largest airliners take off on spectacular formation flight.

Airbus family flight: A380, A350, A330 and A320. The A320 and A330 are among the most popular planes with airlines around the world. But despite initial success, the double-decker A380 superjumbo has struggled to sell in recent years. A greater success story has been the new A350 – Airbus' rival to the Boeing Dreamliner. Like the 787 Dreamliner, the A350 is also a lightweight aircraft. The A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials, helping airlines save on fuel. Sign up for the Two Minutes of Stuff newsletter Qatar Airways and Thai Airways are among the carriers flying the A350, while Qantas has indicated it is considering an ultra-long-range new version of the plane for its fleet in the future.

Photo / Getty Images The aviation industry is supporting a United Nations proposal to limit pollution from international flights even though the measure may cost companies US$24 billion (NZ$33 billion) annually. Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The outcome is far from certain. The deal has backing from at least 60 nations, including the US and most of Europe. Yet in recent days China, which had previously expressed support for the accord, issued a joint proposal along with Russia and India pushing to change key elements of the proposal. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 per cent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." Continued below. Related Content Mood of the Boardroom: Inequality big problem for NZ: Air NZ chief Jennifer Aniston's new friend aboard Emirates UN: Nations to work together on terrorism threat to air travel To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 per cent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy. We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change. Michael Gill, Air Transport Action Group "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. "It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it's a massive green-washing exercise." Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it's a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. In addition to the US and Europe, the agreement has garnered pledges of support from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Singapore and dozens of others nations responsible for most aviation emissions. "The Paris Agreement alone won't solve the climate crisis," President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. On the eve of the talks, however, China proposed broad changes to the accord through a joint statement with India and Russia, pushing to make airlines in the US and other wealthy nations responsible for offsetting the majority of emissions. The three nations argued that the current proposal would unfairly punish growing airlines in developing nations and drive them into bankruptcy. India and Russia have consistently been critical of the global aviation emissions deal. It is unclear whether the proposed changes mark a shift in China's overall position. This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry. Violeta Bulc, EU Transport Commissioner The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU's authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organization's largest assembly ever. Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 per cent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors -- including Brazil and India -- have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. "The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board," India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidize the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The US has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalize those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. "This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry," Bulc said during a Sept. 21 media briefing. "I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action."

The suspect, identified as Arcan Cetin, was arrested Saturday evening as he walked along a street in Oak Harbor. Cetin will be turned over to the Skagit County Sheriff's Office, according to Island County authorities. Cetin was identified as a suspect from tips and after police examined surveillance video from the Burlington mall and saw a car connected to him, Mount Vernon Police Department Lt. Chris Cammock said during a news conference late Saturday night. Skagit County authorities alerted the Island County Sheriff's Office, which arrested Cetin around 6:30 p.m., he said. Cammock said Cetin has not been charged. He will be booked into the Skagit County Jail, he said. He is expected to appear in Skagit County District Court on Monday. A man who answered the door at the home of Cetin's parents declined to comment on Saturday. Skagit County court records show Cetin has a criminal record that included three domestic-violence assault charges in both Burlington and Island County, with the victim identified as Cetin's stepfather. He also was arrested for drunken driving. Island County District Court records show that Cetin was told by a judge on Dec. 29 that he was not to possess a firearm. However, Cetin's stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was "going through a hard time" and that he couldn't help him with the order in place. Cetin's Facebook page says he was a 2015 graduate of Oak Harbor High School. A couple years ago, Marty Baldwin said he allowed the suspected gunman, who was homeless at the time, to move in with him and his wife. But Baldwin kicked him out a few months later after learning the younger man was using and selling drugs, he said Baldwin said he called 911 Friday night after recognizing the man he knew as "Frankie" on TV. Neighbors Jay Young and David Cole watched as police converged outside their apartment building Saturday and took the suspected gunman into custody on the sidewalk. "It was all cordial, would be the way to put it. From what I saw, it was textbook," said Cole of the arrest. "It didn't look like he did anything but obey the orders of the officers." Both men said once they saw the suspect, they recognized him from the mall surveillance photos. "I'm just glad they caught him," Young said. As police conducted the search that led to the arrest of Cetin, friends and family members mourned five people killed during the shooting rampage Friday night. Sarai Lara was the youngest of the victims, at 16. The Mount Vernon High School sophomore had survived cancer as a young girl, and was a happy, responsible, driven student, her mother said Saturday evening. Evangelina Lara said she was shopping at the mall with Sarai and her younger sister, but they split up to different stores. Sarai went to Macy's looking for pants, her mother said through a translator. News of the shooting spread through the mall, and Lara tried to get to her daughter but was blocked from Macy's. The next seven hours were filled with anxiety and dread, she said, until it was confirmed at 2 a.m. Saturday that her daughter was dead. She said nobody in the family had recognized the shooter in photos handed out by police. A family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother as victims of the shooting but declined further comment. KIRO identified the mother as Beatrice Dotson, 95. Another victim is believed by her family to be Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old from Mount Vernon who worked as a make-up artist at Macy's. Martin's sister, Karen Van Horn, declined to talk Saturday evening. "We're really having a tough time right now," Van Horn said in a brief phone call. Van Horn, an employee at The Herald in Everett, told that newspaper that family members hadn't heard an official confirmation that she was among the victims, but a witness told them that her sister was among the dead. Van Horn described her younger sister as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. "She was so sweet," Van Horn told The Herald. "She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn't want to rely on anyone else." Another victim was Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, said his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife were out for a dinner and shopping at the mall, and they had made their way to Macy's when the shooter opened fire. Thrush said Eagan and his wife began running, but his wife fell down as she was trying to get away. As Eagan helped his wife, he was shot, Thrush said. Thrush said Eagan, who had two daughters, was planning to retire from Boeing next year with hopes of doing some traveling. "He was just a wonderful person," Thrush said. About 50 people gathered at Central United Methodist Church in Sedro-Woolley Saturday evening to offer up prayers. At one point in the service, Pastor Cody Natland lit a candle for each of the five victims, then invited congregants to call out prayers to the people they were thinking about. "To the parents of the (young) victim and the parents of the shooter," one woman said. "To law enforcement and our first responders," said another. "To the students at the high school on Monday," a third woman said. "The small community of Darrington that lost two folks last night," a man said. Police said the suspect appeared to be a Hispanic male in his late teens to mid-20s with a close-shaved haircut. He used a long gun similar to a hunting rifle, Francis said. However, according to the Cetin's father's Facebook page, Cetin was born in Turkey. His father met and married Cetin's mother in Turkey and the family settled in Oak Harbor, according to the Facebook page. Cammock said he is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. "I don't know what his motivations were," said Cammock, commander of the Skagit Multi-Agency Response Team (SMART), said at a Saturday morning news conference. "But I certainly intend to find out." Cammock is leading the investigation of the shootings; Burlington's police department requested help from SMART due to the magnitude of the crime, he said. Cammock said the suspect walked into the mall apparently unarmed shortly before 7 p.m. and returned about 10 minutes later with a rifle. A rifle was recovered by police at the scene, he said. He did not disclose the caliber. Cammock, speaking at the Saturday night news conference, said detectives began receiving tips earlier in the day that pointed to Cetin. They also reviewed surveillance video and saw the vehicle that led to Cetin. Cammock said detectives do not know whether Cetin had a connection with any of the victims. Taleia Thurman, 23, called her mother from a bathroom inside Kay Jewelers, where Taleia and three co-workers hid amidst Friday night's gunfire. One of the coworkers had seen the gunman and sprinted from a kiosk into the store to warn the others, Kim Thurman said, recounting her daughter's story Saturday. "It was nerve wracking. They locked themselves in the bathroom -- they didn't even have time to roll the doors down," Thurman recounted. After the gunfire ended, Thurman cautioned her daughter to wait for police to arrive. "It was a security guard that came and got them and ushered them outside. She didn't have her keys, her purse or anything," Thurman said. Taleia was able to catch a ride to Lynnwood, where her mother met her and drove her home to Seattle. "She was an emotional wreck" and "just melted" when she saw her mother and got in her car, Thurman said. On Saturday, Thurman drove her daughter to the mall to retrieve her car, explaining Taleia's manager was allowed inside the mall to gather employees' personal belongings. "It was very emotional ... When we got up here, the bodies were still in the mall. Imagine those families," she said, her eyes welling with tears. "I'm just thankful I'm not one of the ones" who lost a family member. Skagit County Coroner Hayley Thompson began removing the victims' bodies from the mall Saturday afternoon. Burlington mayor Steve Sexton said the "the city of Burlington has probably changed forever, but I don't think our way of life needs to change," while speaking about the Cascade Mall shooting. (Jessica Lee / The Seattle Times) Family members who suspected their loved ones may be among the dead were sequestered Saturday with mental-health volunteers at His Place Community Church, which is about a block from the south end of Cascade Mall, which will re-open Monday. The church, acting as a family resource center, was packed Friday night as friends and relatives gathered to learn what scant information was being released, said Bill Overby, a volunteer with Skagit County's Department of Emergency Management. "These are very abnormal circumstances in a normal community with normal people and their reactions reflect that," Overby said of those who worried as they waited to hear about their loved ones. "There's a lot of uncertainty. People are obviously very concerned but there's not a lot of answers (yet), which is common." He said it was best to avoid speculation or wild guesses because to do otherwise "revictimizes everyone involved." The police investigation is proceeding deliberately, "but it needs to to get it right," Overby said. Lacey Shoemaker, the disaster program manager for the Northwest Washington chapter of the Red Cross, said five disaster mental-health volunteers were dispatched to Burlington Friday night and continue to work with families impacted by the mass shooting. Support officers also are on scene to "assist in the emotional care of the community," she said. Shoemaker said the community of about 8,400 is pulling together, with restaurants, churches and other organizations providing food and lending support any way they can. "It's hit the community on a very emotional level. It's a very small, tight-knit community. It's just kind of unbelievable something like this would happen here," she said. "I think there's a lot of mixed emotions ... It's weird when it happens in your own back yard. It digs a little deeper." Assistant Pastor Nick Harris was graceful in declining any praise for opening his church to the community. "I'm just the guy with the key. It's God's house so it's here for everybody," he said. At a vigil for the victims Saturday morning at Maiben Park in Burlington, Kelly Couture recalled what she heard as she left the mall's Target store Friday night. "Just sirens and people were yelling and running out of the building," Couture said. "It was kind of, like, chaotic. The amount of sirens and the amount of police cars was insane." Joanne Burkholder's experience was more frightening. "Security came into the room and said we need to evacuate immediately, and so we got into the hallway and there was, like, tons of people out there," she said at the vigil. "People were panicking, screaming down the hallway. We were terrified so we went outside and there was lots of security locking down the place." A 14-year-old girl named Christina said Saturday she was getting her nails done in a salon on the other side of the mall from the Macy's when the shooting occurred. She and her cousin, along with others in the salon, hid in a back room for about 10 minutes before fleeing the mall to an Applebee's restaurant nearby. "We just saw a whole bunch of people running out," she said, her voice trembling. "One of the workers said she saw him (the shooter) pass by. We all got freaked out and ran into the little back room they had. Then a cop came and escorted us out." Christina added, "I go there pretty much every weekend. It's just so strange that at a small mall like this, that would happen." Cammock asked members of the public to continue to stay away from the shopping mall. Map of the Cascade Mall area: Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said the city's "thoughts and prayers go out to the families" of the victims. "There are people waking up this morning and their lives are changed forever," Sexton said. "The city of Burlington is changed forever." The mayor called the shooting a senseless act, saying "the world came knocking on our doorstep and it came to our little community here." "Our support goes with them (law enforcement and investigators), to help them ... bring the son of a bitch to justice who did this to our community. Our community comes together in times of tragedy." The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent a team to help local law enforcement with the investigation, spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-William said. Washington State Patrol Sgt. Mark Francis gives an update about the victims of a shooting at the Cascade Mall in Burlington on September 23, 2016. (Rick Lund and Dean Rutz / The Seattle Times) Macy's on Saturday morning released this statement on its Facebook page: "We are devastated by the tragic events that occurred last night at Cascade Mall. Our hearts are with our Burlington store, the families and loved ones of the victims, and the entire community. We are working closely with local law enforcement authorities as the investigation continues to unfold. They will be providing updates as the situation develops." Cascade Mall had a similar message on its website: "We are deeply saddened by the tragic event that occurred Friday evening. Our prayers and condolences are with the victims and their families."

U.S. environmental regulators are moving to limit emissions from aircraft, ruling that jet engine exhaust is endangering human health by warming the planet. The Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it will use its authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate aircraft emissions. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) The aviation industry is supporting a United Nations proposal to limit pollution from international flights even though the measure may cost companies $24 billion annually. Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The outcome is far from certain. The deal has backing from at least 60 nations, including the U.S. and most of Europe. Yet in recent days China, which had previously expressed support for the accord, issued a joint proposal along with Russia and India pushing to change key elements of the proposal. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. "It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it's a massive green-washing exercise." Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it's a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. In addition to the U.S. and Europe, the agreement has garnered pledges of support from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Singapore and dozens of others nations responsible for most aviation emissions. "The Paris Agreement alone won't solve the climate crisis," President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. On the eve of the talks, however, China proposed broad changes to the accord through a joint statement with India and Russia, pushing to make airlines in the U.S. and other wealthy nations responsible for offsetting the majority of emissions. The three nations argued that the current proposal would unfairly punish growing airlines in developing nations and drive them into bankruptcy. India and Russia have consistently been critical of the global aviation emissions deal. It is unclear whether the proposed changes mark a shift in China's overall position. The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU's authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organization's largest assembly ever.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 percent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors -- including Brazil and India -- have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. "The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board," India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines Inc., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidize the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The U.S. has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalize those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. "This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry," Bulc said during a Sept. 21 media briefing. "I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business. Get twice-daily updates on what the St. Louis business community is talking about.

Ukraine and the West insist pro-Russian rebels blew the Boeing 777 jet out of the sky over war-torn east Ukraine on July 17, 2014, with a missile system likely supplied by Moscow. An international inquiry concluded last October that a Russian-made BUK missile fired from a zone held by pro-Russian separatists brought down the aircraft, but stopped short of saying who was responsible for killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. Russia and the rebels have consistently denied any role in downing the plane, releasing a series of sometimes contradictory claims that critics say are intended to confuse the issue. At a specially arranged briefing on Monday, Russia's defence ministry released what it claimed were radar images showing that no missile fired from rebel-held territory in the east could have hit the plane. "The fact that Ukraine has not yet released information from the radar station suggests that the location from which the missile was launched -- if it was a BUK -- was in territory controlled by the Ukrainian armed forces," Russian army commander Andrei Koban said. "If the Malaysian Boeing was hit by a missile launched from any area located east of the crash site, it would have been detected by Russia's primary radar," Koban said, without explaining why Russian radar did not cover the areas west of the passenger jet's flight path. The radar footage released by Russia on Monday appeared to directly contradict earlier claims by Moscow, made in the immediate aftermath of the incident, that a Ukrainian jet was spotted close to the doomed airliner. Initial results from a Dutch-led criminal probe into the downing of flight MH17 are due to be revealed on Wednesday. Investigators from the Netherlands -- where the majority of the passengers came from -- have said the results should shed more light on the type of missile used and exactly where it was fired from. The downing of flight MH17 ratcheted up international tensions over the conflict in Ukraine that started in April 2014 after pro-Russian gunmen took over towns in the country's industrial east, and has since claimed some 9,600 lives. The tragedy saw the European Union slap tougher sanctions on Russia -- blamed by the West for being behind the rebellion -- and the punitive measures remain in place as the fighting drags on.

At a specially arranged briefing today, Russia’s defence ministry released what it claimed were radar images showing that no missile fired from rebel-held territory in the east could have hit the plane.  “The fact that Ukraine has not yet released information from the radar station suggests that the location from which the missile was launched — if it was a BUK — was in territory controlled by the Ukrainian armed forces,” Russian army commander Andrei Koban said. “If the Malaysian Boeing was hit by a missile launched from any area located east of the crash site, it would have been detected by Russia’s primary radar,” Koban said, without explaining why Russian radar did not cover the areas west of the passenger jet’s flight path. The radar footage released by Russia today appeared to directly contradict earlier claims by Moscow, made in the immediate aftermath of the incident, that a Ukrainian jet was spotted close to the doomed airliner. Initial results from a Dutch-led criminal probe into the downing of flight MH17 are due to be revealed on Wednesday. Investigators from the Netherlands — where the majority of the passengers came from — have said the results should shed more light on the type of missile used and exactly where it was fired from.  The downing of flight MH17 ratcheted up international tensions over the conflict in Ukraine that started in April 2014 after pro-Russian gunmen took over towns in the country’s industrial east, and has since claimed some 9,600 lives. The tragedy saw the European Union slap tougher sanctions on Russia — blamed by the West for being behind the rebellion — and the punitive measures remain in place as the fighting drags on. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Cops detain Bersih 2.0 chairman, committee member ahead of rally More arrests on Bersih 5 eve, Maria and Mandeep may miss rally, Red Shirts leader missing Police road diversions in KL from 7am Now, DAP MP arrested for sedition, taken to Seremban High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Rafizi sentenced to 18 months’ jail, might lose MP seat Malaysian ringgit plunges in offshore markets, BNM locks spot in Do Malaysians trust the news they read?

This is not only the first long haul route originating in Xiamen with an end point in the United States, but also the first direct international service between Shenzhen and the U.S. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410761 The service will be handled by a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with three flights per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The flight numbers are MF845 and MF846. Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun said, "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders in 2015. On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." The Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is the sixth long haul and the first American route that Xiamen Airlines has launched. The existing services including Xiamen-Amsterdam, Fuzhou-Sydney, Xiamen-Sydney, Xiamen-Melbourne and Xiamen-Vancouver. The newly opened Seattle service is Xiamen Airlines' first long haul route with a stop at a city outside of the Fujian province. To complete the build out of a network that extends beyond Seattle, Xiamen Airlines has signed a partnership agreement with Alaska Airlines that enables passengers traveling to Seattle via Xiamen Airlines, to fly onward to 61 major and secondary destinations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico by connecting to an Alaska Airlines flight in Seattle. The launch of the route marks the first time the Xiamen Airlines fleet has had a chance to visit the home of their "birth", as Seattle, where Boeing is located, is where each member of the 165-strong fleet of aircraft was manufactured and first saw the light of day. As a loyal client of Boeing Co., Xiamen Airlines operates the largest all-Boeing aircraft fleet in China. Over the past 3 decades, Xiamen Airlines has taken delivery of hundreds of brand new Boeing airliners and, due to the low cost advantage of an all-Boeing fleet, Xiamen Airlines has continuously shown a profit for 29 years, the longest period of reporting uninterrupted profits in Chinese civil aviation history.

Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning on Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programmes. “We recognise that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change,” said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. “The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible.” To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavours. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it’s an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticise the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy “It’s peanuts,” said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. “It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it’s a massive green-washing exercise.” Outcome uncertain Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it’s a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. The agreement has garnered pledges of support from at least 60 nations responsible for most aviation emissions, including the US, China, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and a majority of European countries. “The Paris Agreement alone won’t solve the climate crisis,” US President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU’s authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalise the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation. More than 2 000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organisation’s largest assembly ever. Success is far from certain. Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 percent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors - including Brazil and India - have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. “The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board,” India’s environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidise the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The US has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. Integrity of offsets A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalise those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. “This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry,” Bulc said during a September 21 media briefing. “I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action.” * With assistance from Ewa Krukowska and Mathew Carr BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

AFP file photo mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:40 PM, September 26, 2016 NEW YORK — The aviation industry is supporting a United Nations proposal to limit pollution from international flights even though the measure may eventually cost companies US$24 billion (S$32.7 billion) annually. Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday (Sept 27), would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 per cent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. “We recognise that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change,” said Mr Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. “The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible.” To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavours. Airlines estimates the annual industry-wide cost may be as much as US$23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 per cent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it’s an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticise the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy “It’s peanuts,” said Mr Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. “It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it’s a massive green-washing exercise.” OUTCOME UNCERTAIN Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it’s a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. The agreement has garnered pledges of support from at least 60 nations responsible for most aviation emissions, including the US, China, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and a majority of European countries. “The Paris Agreement alone won’t solve the climate crisis,” US President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU’s authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalise the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organisation’s largest assembly ever. Success is far from certain. Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 per cent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors — including Brazil and India — have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027.

Boeing and Lockheed will also refine concepts and develop trade space models to support requirements generation ahead of the MQ-25 program’s engineering and manufacturing development phase, the Defense Department said Friday. The two companies are scheduled to complete work in October 2017. Both cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts were not competitively procured and the Navy used its fiscal 2016 research, development, test and evaluation to cover the full obligated amounts. In June, the U.S. Air Force renamed the Navy’s Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System as MQ-25A Stingray in a move to reflect the multimission functionalities of the latter’s future UAV platform.

The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The outcome is far from certain. The deal has backing from at least 60 nations, including the U.S. and most of Europe. Yet in recent days China, which had previously expressed support for the accord, issued a joint proposal along with Russia and India pushing to change key elements of the proposal.

And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy “It’s peanuts,” said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. “It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it’s a massive green-washing exercise.” Outcome Uncertain Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it’s a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. In addition to the U.S. and Europe, the agreement has garnered pledges of support from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Singapore and dozens of others nations responsible for most aviation emissions. “The Paris Agreement alone won’t solve the climate crisis,” U.S. President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. On the eve of the talks, however, China proposed broad changes to the accord through a joint statement with India and Russia, pushing to make airlines in the U.S. and other wealthy nations responsible for offsetting the majority of emissions. The three nations argued that the current proposal would unfairly punish growing airlines in developing nations and drive them into bankruptcy. India and Russia have consistently been critical of the global aviation emissions deal. It is unclear whether the proposed changes mark a shift in China’s overall position. International Effort The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU’s authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organization’s largest assembly ever. Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 percent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors -- including Brazil and India -- have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. Achieving Balance “The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board,” India’s environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines Inc., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidize the growth of smaller carriers.  Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The U.S. has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. Integrity of Offsets A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalize those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. “This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry,” Bulc said during a Sept. 21 media briefing. “I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Big moves are afoot on the federal military procurement file – and not a moment too soon. Of the dizzying array of rusted-out Canadian Forces gear that must be replaced with varying degrees of urgency, two big-ticket items have dominated; new ships for the Royal Canadian Navy and Coast Guard, and new fighters for the Royal Canadian Air Force. On both fronts, according to a senior defence industry source, the Liberal government is gearing up for moves it hopes will break the logjam. “They’re now where the former government was in June of 2015,” said the source. “Basically there’s a realization that what they’ve been doing isn’t working.” A procurement workforce that lost a huge amount of capacity during the 1990s grew only marginally during the 2000s, and was then hammered by Harper’s attempts to balance the books. At the same time, longstanding problems defining and communicating military requirements and costing projects persisted, and new, more onerous policies regarding investment planning and managing major projects were introduced, which meant that procuring military equipment took more time and effort. On tap are an open, international competition for the new fighter jet, nominally including the controversial F-35 despite the Liberal campaign pledge to rule it out, and a re-apportioning of some of the furthest-off planned naval and Coast Guard shipbuilding, perhaps to a contractor or contractors overseas. Both moves are long overdue. The selection and purchase of a jet to replace the 1980s-vintage Boeing CF-18s has been stalled since the former Conservative government’s sole-sourced purchase of 65 Lockheed-Martin F-35s went awry in late 2012, due to concerns over ballooning life-cycle costs, and the lack of an open competition. During last year’s federal campaign the Liberals pledged to scrap the F-35 deal once and for all, buy a less costly plane and re-apportion any savings to shipbuilding. There was speculation last spring that a purchase of Boeing Super Hornets was in the offing, which quickly sputtered after the Liberals were accused by the opposition of seeking to engineer their own sole-sourced fighter purchase. Meantime, at the Irving yard on the East Coast and Seaspan’s shipyard in Vancouver, work continues on a series of Arctic patrol boats and small Coast Guard vessels, respectively. Construction of a new fleet of naval frigates, two mammoth naval supply ships and a large three-season icebreaker for the Coast Guard is still some years off, given current building schedules. In a recent interview, Jonathan Whitworth, Seaspan’s chief executive, said the first of four smaller vessels for the Coast Guard is on target to be completed next year, with two more coming in 2018. He said he was unable to provide a schedule for completion of any further planned work by Seaspan, including the two supply ships and the three-season icebreaker, all much larger than anything the company has built to date. Whitworth referred questions about Seaspan’s longer-term federal work to a pending federal procurement review, which he said he expects to see by year-end. In the early going of the Trudeau government indications were that, beyond finding a new fighter (anything other than the F-35 to fulfill their election promise) not much would change on the procurement front, particularly with respect to the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy unveiled by the Tories in the fall of 2011. The waters were further muddied by the accession of Dominic LeBlanc, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s inner circle, to the post of Fisheries Minister, nominally responsible for the Coast Guard. LeBlanc, because of personal ties to the Irving family, has recused himself from dealings with federal shipbuilding. Industry insiders have expected the absence of an active minister’s hand on the Coast Guard rebuild would further slow decision-making. But the cabinet defence procurement committee, chaired by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, has apparently come around to the view that the status quo will not stand. It may have been spurred in this by numerous reports, including one last week from the Commons defence committee chaired by Liberal MP Stephen Fuhr, raising alarms about the rapid buildup of Russian military power in the Arctic. An open competition for the fighter jet procurement would necessarily include the F-35. But the statement of requirements, which likely will not be finalized until after the defence review currently under way is complete, may de facto preclude one plane, or several. The perennial likely competitors include Boeing’s Super Hornet, Dassault’s Rafale, The Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab’s Grippen, as well as the F-35. The timing of any aircraft rollout will be of the essence: The 77 CF-18s now flying are being refurbished to extend their lives to 2025. But that date is a hard cap, because of life-cycle expiry of the air frames. On the shipping side, the emerging thinking is that the current amorphous delivery timeline on the two supply ships and three-season icebreaker is too far off to be acceptable. Seaspan is deemed to have its hands full now with the four smaller Coast Guard vessels that are first in line to be built. A similar view was reached by senior figures in the former Conservative government, before it fell. Should part or all of the supply-ship and large-icebreaker work go elsewhere, the Western shipyard would likely be given an additional round of contracts on smaller Coast Guard cutters, which also will need to be replaced in the medium term, the senior industry source suggested.

Opinion 0 0 0 September 25, 2016 The Human Mission To Mars In The New NASA Budget: Onward To The Red Planet Or Just A Giveaway To The Aerospace Industry? Daniel Ketchum The following article is entirely the opinion of Daniel Ketchum and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. For fans of America’s space program, the news from Universe Today that the Senate has just passed a NASA fiscal year spending bill of $19.5 billion and that the principal focus is a human mission to Mars might seem like reason for celebration. But is this new budget really written to support exploration or is it designed to prop up the old, traditional aerospace industry at the expense of upstarts like SpaceX or Blue Origin? 3 new #astronomy posts about #orion #mars https://t.co/J1fnky7DMs — Topicly Astronomy (@topiclyastro) September 23, 2016 It’s not unreasonable to ask this question. For four decades now, the path that the Senate and Congress have laid out for NASA has been one where the concept of exploration has been shoved aside for other goals. The Space Shuttle and the International Space Station have provided enormous financial benefits for companies like Boeing and Lockheed, but they haven’t moved the human race one step further in the exploration of space. But they have consumed a sizable chunk of NASA’s budget. Neil Armstrong misquoted? His accent could've been to blame for us mishearing the moon landing speech https://t.co/mpw5uV5uty via @IBTimesUK — Rachel Middleton (@NewswithRachel) September 8, 2016 In less than 10 years in the 1960s, the United States went from having virtually no space program whatsoever to landing human beings on the surface of the moon. Although several Apollo missions followed the pioneering journey of Apollo 11, politicians in Washington largely lost interest in the space program once it was no longer useful as a propaganda tool in the Cold War. In the euphoria of the landing on the moon in 1969, many people felt there would be a human mission to Mars within a decade or so. But with the Shuttle and the International Space Station, the United States has done nothing but circle around the Earth thousands of times. Instead of exploring and colonizing another world, NASA has tried to make meaningless experiments in zero gravity seem important. The lone American astronaut in orbit may have to cast her presidential vote from the International Space Station: https://t.co/mtXuFgXSOp — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 25, 2016 But just why have we maintained NASA’s massive and extremely expensive infrastructure for such pointless experimentation in low Earth orbit? If it wasn’t to prepare for a human mission to Mars, what exactly was the purpose? A careful look at the way NASA contracts are doled out to the aerospace industry and how NASA facilities are spread across the country provides a clue to the answer to these questions. In short, for the last 40 years, NASA has served as corporate welfare to help maintain aerospace companies like Boeing, Lockheed, and Hughes. The space shuttle Atlantis rolls down Kennedy Parkway on its way to its new home at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. [Image by Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty image] Indirectly, NASA is providing funding to help maintain these companies so that the military can then benefit from their expertise in their own projects. But the principal reason for this largesse on the part of the United States government – and the Senate and Congress in particular – is that all of these major corporations provide jobs to their constituencies. And this is the reason – there is no logical rationale otherwise – for why NASA’s space missions are distributed far and wide across the United States. Rockets are tested in Alabama, launched from Florida and managed from Texas. As SpaceX has made clear with its own consolidation of its operations, the only reason to scatter these activities like this is political gain. Certainly, efficiency can’t be what they have in mind. Elon Musk and Buzz Lightyear, same ethos. https://t.co/eRT500GeAl — Ars Technica (@arstechnica) September 25, 2016 Speaking of SpaceX and the possibility of a human mission to Mars, it seems highly probable that long before the extremely vague 2030s date that NASA keeps putting forward for its own mission to Mars, Elon Musk will have already sent human beings to the red planet. Yes, Musk and his pioneering space company did suffer a recent setback due to a rocket explosion. But the benefit of being a private company instead of a governmental agency is that he can simply find the problem, solve it, and move forward. Every time NASA suffers a setback, the political figures – who often helped to create the problem to begin with – leap in to blame NASA and redirect the agency on yet another new course correction.

It seems clear it is designed to prop up obsolete aerospace companies in the face of stiff competition from SpaceX and others.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Michael Den Tandt: Liberal government mulling long-overdue moves on military procurement file Michael Den Tandt  09.25.2016 A partially built Arctic Offshore Patrol Ship at Irving Shipbuilding's Halifax Shipyard. ShareAdjustCommentPrint Big moves are afoot on the federal military procurement file – and not a moment too soon. Of the dizzying array of rusted-out Canadian Forces gear that must be replaced with varying degrees of urgency, two big-ticket items have dominated; new ships for the Royal Canadian Navy and Coast Guard, and new fighters for the Royal Canadian Air Force. On both fronts, according to a senior defence industry source, the Liberal government is gearing up for moves it hopes will break the logjam. “They’re now where the former government was in June of 2015,” said the source. “Basically there’s a realization that what they’ve been doing isn’t working.” On tap are an open, international competition for the new fighter jet, nominally including the controversial F-35 despite the Liberal campaign pledge to rule it out, and a re-apportioning of some of the furthest-off planned naval and Coast Guard shipbuilding, perhaps to a contractor or contractors overseas. Both moves are long overdue. The selection and purchase of a jet to replace the 1980s-vintage Boeing CF-18s has been stalled since the former Conservative government’s sole-sourced purchase of 65 Lockheed-Martin F-35s went awry in late 2012, due to concerns over ballooning life-cycle costs, and the lack of an open competition. During last year’s federal campaign the Liberals pledged to scrap the F-35 deal once and for all, buy a less costly plane and re-apportion any savings to shipbuilding. There was speculation last spring that a purchase of Boeing Super Hornets was in the offing, which quickly sputtered after the Liberals were accused by the opposition of seeking to engineer their own sole-sourced fighter purchase. Meantime, at the Irving yard on the East Coast and Seaspan’s shipyard in Vancouver, work continues on a series of Arctic patrol boats and small Coast Guard vessels, respectively. Construction of a new fleet of naval frigates, two mammoth naval supply ships and a large three-season icebreaker for the Coast Guard is still some years off, given current building schedules. In a recent interview, Jonathan Whitworth, Seaspan’s chief executive, said the first of four smaller vessels for the Coast Guard is on target to be completed next year, with two more coming in 2018. He said he was unable to provide a schedule for completion of any further planned work by Seaspan, including the two supply ships and the three-season icebreaker, all much larger than anything the company has built to date. Whitworth referred questions about Seaspan’s longer-term federal work to a pending federal procurement review, which he said he expects to see by year-end. In the early going of the Trudeau government indications were that, beyond finding a new fighter (anything other than the F-35 to fulfill their election promise) not much would change on the procurement front, particularly with respect to the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy unveiled by the Tories in the fall of 2011. The waters were further muddied by the accession of Dominic LeBlanc, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s inner circle, to the post of Fisheries Minister, nominally responsible for the Coast Guard. LeBlanc, because of personal ties to the Irving family, has recused himself from dealings with federal shipbuilding. Industry insiders have expected the absence of an active minister’s hand on the Coast Guard rebuild would further slow decision-making. But the cabinet defence procurement committee, chaired by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, has apparently come around to the view that the status quo will not stand. It may have been spurred in this by numerous reports, including one last week from the Commons defence committee chaired by Liberal MP Stephen Fuhr, raising alarms about the rapid buildup of Russian military power in the Arctic. An open competition for the fighter jet procurement would necessarily include the F-35. But the statement of requirements, which likely will not be finalized until after the defence review currently under way is complete, may de facto preclude one plane, or several. The perennial likely competitors include Boeing’s Super Hornet, Dassault’s Rafale, The Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab’s Grippen, as well as the F-35. The timing of any aircraft rollout will be of the essence: The 77 CF-18s now flying are being refurbished to extend their lives to 2025. But that date is a hard cap, because of life-cycle expiry of the air frames. On the shipping side, the emerging thinking is that the current amorphous delivery timeline on the two supply ships and three-season icebreaker is too far off to be acceptable. Seaspan is deemed to have its hands full now with the four smaller Coast Guard vessels that are first in line to be built. A similar view was reached by senior figures in the former Conservative government, before it fell. Should part or all of the supply-ship and large-icebreaker work go elsewhere, the Western shipyard would likely be given an additional round of contracts on smaller Coast Guard cutters, which also will need to be replaced in the medium term, the senior industry source suggested. • Twitter: @mdentandt Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Blog Long-Living Products Defy Conventional Wisdom Bill Schweber, Engineer, Author, Editor 9/25/2016 09:00 AM EDT  23 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Winning products can have viable production lifetimes of decades, despite our "here today, obsolete tomorrow" thinking. In the fast-cycle world of modern consumer electronics, many people assume that all products have short market lifetimes. Sure, there may be some folks who hang on and make do with those "old" devices, such as a PC or cell phone more than a few years old, but that model is certainly not being manufactured anymore, as it has been replaced by a newer, better, shinier model. Maybe that's the case for many items, but not for all. Two recent examples show us that a good product can continue to be manufactured for decades and more. Keysight Technologies, (formerly Agilent Technologies, and Hewlett-Packard before that), recently announced the end of manufacturing and availability of their classic model 34401A digital multimeter. Introduced in 1992, this DMM (Figure 1) has been used extensively on the test bench, in the field, in production test, and many other places. It's been so popular that Keysight produced the "Avoid the 34401A Apocalypse" Webcast to help those having 34401A "withdrawal" issues, to guide them on a smooth transition to its replacement unit, the 34461A (and note that they gave advance notice that this product was nearing its end back in 2013, see "Replacing a Workhorse"). Figure 1. The legendary Hewlett-Packard 34401A Digital Multimeter, subsequently rebranded as Agilent and then Keysight, is being discontinued 24 years after its introduction. On a much, much larger scale, The Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing said it might discontinue manufacture of the venerable 747 widebody jet this year or next, due to declining orders, "Boeing Considers Ending Production of 747". That classic aircraft was introduced in the late 1960s and they have sold over 1500 since then; they have "only" 21 orders for it at this point. You might assume that the sales history of this plane follows the usual trajectory of ramping up after introduction and widespread adoption, peaking, and then drifting down, but that's not the case. The Boeing-supplied data (Figure 2), shows the cyclical nature of its orders, which is unlike what we usually see for all-electronic products. Figure 2. The sales of the Boeing 747, introduced in the late 1960s, have not followed the classic simple rise, peak, and decline shape of most products (data from Boeing, image from The Wall Street Journal). Of course, an aircraft is not the same as a DMM. While there undoubtedly have been updates and upgrades to the 34401A, they certainly can't have been as extensive as those for the 747. Can you imagine the volume of ECOs (engineering change orders) on an aircraft such as this? The reality is that the experience gained during volume production and intensive operation over time contributes immensely to manufacturing efficiency, better flight performance, enhanced reliability, and fewer surprises. Today's 747 has many upgrades in airframe, engines, avionics, and more. For example, the now-standard FOG (fiber-optic gyro) for inertial navigation was only in its infancy in the 1970s, and supplemental GPS is now also installed (navigating on GPS alone is not a good idea, for many reasons). Still, many for the basic components are likely barely changed from the original, so tooling costs have certainly been amortized. This long-lived scenario applies to ICs, as well. Analog Devices manufactured, sold, and supported the AD574 12-bit A/D converter for more than 25 years, even re-designing the die for better performance and lower cost, and introducing new packages as well. If you wonder "why," the answer is simple: customers asked for it. In the analog world especially, once you have a part designed in, working, and its unavoidable idiosyncrasies understood and tamed, there's a great reluctance to change it. Other IC vendors have similar tales to tell about some of their winning products. Of course, keeping an IC alive and in production for years is far easier than doing so for a complex assembled product such as a DMM, or an aircraft with its BOM (bill of materials) that has millions of distinct parts and thousands of subassemblies. But it's important to keep in mind that the conventional wisdom that a product will be out of production after a few years may be incorrect, especially for the more technically sophisticated ones. That also means that the suppliers of the constituent components and materials need to keep their own production lines running, as even the simplest assembled product has many items on its BOM.

The DVD disc format refuse to die out but the codecs within it have evolved tremendously and old ones are no longer used are from the early 1980s. The Casio FX260 is the final version of the FX scientific calculators series which began in the 1970s.  It has nearly all the same key layout, strokes, functions, but now runs purely on solar, battery free. The plain jane Casio digital watches are unchanged from the early 1980s. Cristal bic ball pens are unchanged from 1950s and the single blade bic disposable razor are from the 1970s. The basic Mr. Coffee designed is from 1950s, and the basic Dremel rotary tool is from the 1930s.   The grand piano made today is essentially that which Steinway fielded in 1860, and except for ivory in the keys, is essentially unchanged from the 1950s [ when a more modern keyboard was invented.]  Should we talk about a Stradivarius violin from the 1700? Common medical instruments like the scalpel, and various forceps, where designed in the early 1900s.   single spout faucets, toaster, microwave oven, magnet compass, sextant, paper, slotted screws with its screwdriver, flat head nail and hammer?  Its very much the picture of modern civilization.

Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Money NAC board okays plan to procure 2 wide-body jets - SANGAM PRASAIN, Kathmandu The national flag bearer plans to add the first of the two proposed jets by Sept and another six months later Sep 25, 2016- The board of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) on Saturday unanimously approved its management’s plan to procure two Airbus A330-200 wide-body jets. The decision paves the way for the national flag carrier to formally begin the procurement process to induct first-ever long-range wide-body Airbus jets into its fleet. Under the Rs25-billion fleet expansion project, the state-owned airline plans to add the first of the two proposed jets by September 2017 and another six months later. “Saturday’s board has allowed the NAC management to begin the procurement process. And, it is all prepared for it,” said Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, joint secretary of the Tourism Ministry, who also sits on the NAC board. “The board was unanimous regarding the induction of the Airbus jets into the fleet.” The board’s move to allow NAC to buy the jets from the European aviation giant follows the management’s recommendation to switch to Airbus from Boeing as pursuing a one-family aircraft strategy would reduce maintenance and crew training costs. NAC plans to have an all-Airbus fleet in the near future. The management has already decided to phase out one of its two Boeing 757s. Currently, NAC flies five different types of aircraft—Boeing, Airbus, Twin Otter, MA60 and Y12e. Due to the diverse fleet, it needs to have different sets of pilots, engineers and spare parts. NAC purchased two Airbus A320-200 aircraft last year by borrowing Rs10 billion from the Employees Provident Fund in its first fleet expansion in 27 years. This time too, it plans to request the Employees Provident Fund and Citizen Investment Trust for loans. Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry had agreed to act as a guarantor on the loan NAC plans to take. Last January, the national flag carrier had unveiled an ambitious reform strategy that includes buying two wide-body aircraft over the next two years. The NAC board had agreed in principle to the corporation’s proposal. The Airbus A330-200 aircraft can accommodate up to 280 passengers in a two-class layout. The carrier has proposed procuring the long-range jets to serve destinations in North America, Japan, Australia and the UK as they have been identified as prospective markets for Nepal over the next 20 years. In 2015, NAC’s market share on international routes stood at 7.88 percent, up from 5.87 percent in 2014. Nepal Airlines saw the strongest passenger growth after it added two A320 aircraft to its fleet. The beleaguered national flag carrier flew 253,658 travellers last year, up 22.87 percent compared to the previous year. During its heyday, NAC used to fly to Amsterdam, Colombo, Dhaka, Frankfurt, Karachi, London, Osaka, Paris, Shanghai, Singapore and Vienna besides five Indian cities-Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Patna. It presently connects Kathmandu with Doha, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Delhi and Bangalore. The carrier currently serves eight international destinations, including three Indian cities, and plans to expand to Guangzhou, China, by this year.

Related News/Archive Samsung Note 7 recall to cost at least $5.3 billion 1 Month Ago Yahoo hack could reopen $4.8 billion Verizon deal 1 Month Ago Yelp now features Florida restaurants' health inspections and owners say it may cost them business 22 Hours Ago Trade groups representing United Continental, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks starting today, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, enginemakers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord starts in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimate the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the U.N.-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy. "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization.

How to join the network Much anticipation has been built around the future of the automotive and aerospace industries in the wake of recent advancements in 3D-printing technologies. But what’s often overlooked is the way 3D printing can also revolutionize the transportation infrastructure industry. Take for example the new technologies Stratasys demonstrated for the first time at the 2016 International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. One of the company’s new technologies is an “Infinite-Build” system that’s designed to print parts on a vertical plane, essentially making it possible to print parts of virtually any size. While the “Infinite-Build” technology is primarily aimed at the aerospace and automotive industries — as evidenced by the partnerships Boeing and Ford have both formed with Stratasys — the concept could also transform the infrastructure industry, especially when you consider bridges require much longer parts to construct than, say, a car or plane. Still, much more research and development must be completed before we can realistically expect to “print” any bridges with additive manufacturing. One particular challenge is figuring out how to embrace these advancements in technology and evolve them to include the materials required for large-scale structures. Specifically, we must determine how to accommodate concrete and steel, the basic materials we use to construct roads and bridges. Today’s infrastructure challenge lies in bridging today’s needs with tomorrow’s possibilities. We are already starting to see new variations of concrete being developed, which perhaps could be more amenable to 3D-printing capabilities. Indeed, a type of concrete that cures instantly — and has the strength and stiffness required to meet bridge design codes without rebar — will be key. I had the opportunity to learn from a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo of a 3D printer that printed in chocolate. The biggest challenge that had to be solved was instantaneous hardening or curing. Although different curing processes, it reinforces the point that “where there’s a will, there’s a way.” The benefits 3D printing could bring to the infrastructure industry are too significant to be overlooked, especially when roughly 75 percent of the infrastructure — our roads, bridges and tunnels — in the United States will either need to be renovated or rebuilt in their entirety by 2035, according to the Rockefeller Foundation. Today’s infrastructure challenge lies in bridging today’s needs with tomorrow’s possibilities. If utilized well, additive manufacturing would improve precision and quality control while reducing waste, costs and congestion during infrastructure construction projects. Think about the number of traffic lanes that are often closed during large-scale construction projects to accommodate the movement of massive construction materials. With 3D printing, you would be able to go on site and print large-scale structural components of transportation infrastructure in more confined spaces. This would translate to less interruption to commuters.

That’s because additive manufacturing makes it possible to use no more than the exact amount of materials necessary per project. Plus, whatever surplus of raw materials is left over could then be used for another construction project. Safety is another major potential benefit of using 3D printing to build infrastructure. On sites that are particularly difficult to access, autonomous 3D printing would ideally eliminate the need to have work crews situated in precarious positions during construction. That alone is a significant benefit. There is tremendous potential for 3D printing to revolutionize the way our infrastructure is built in the future. But in order to achieve this potential, there must be collaboration and further innovation of the engineering, construction, materials, technology and financial industries — in addition to leadership of federal, provincial and local governments.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst) In February 2016, China declared in its National Congress that there will be a battle for growth. This battle will consist of nation states fighting for global market share. As nations align themselves with the Eastern Eurasian cycle or the Western Trans-Atlantic cycle, the global playing field is changing into a full-scale economic competition. Recession and Disruption The global marketplace is shrinking. The transactions of the past are changing, as they are increasingly demanding better price, faster delivery, advanced quality, supportive aftermarket services, increased customer satisfaction, increasing shareholder returns, and more capable employees. The pressures on business to adapt are becoming intolerable. A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Oct. 15, 2014. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Training demands increase daily as obsolescence within the business and the marketplace haunts the CEO at every turn. A head in the sand approach doesn’t work anymore. Threat levels increase daily with hydra-headed disruption coming from all directions. Small nimble competitors are appearing from all directions, and startups with little or no experience are taking on global corporations from nowhere and fighting for an efficient transaction. Related Coverage Central Banks Are Close to Centralizing Everything The Only Sure Conclusion About the G-20 Summit The G-20’s Display of Irrelevance As the market shrinks, so does the need for employment. Employees can find themselves without a job overnight. This then leads to recession as buying power evaporates and large numbers of people find themselves without a stable income. This anger at the changing world economy leads to frustration and guilt, which turn to voter apathy, lethargy in leadership, and demands for change. This is why Donald Trump, the insurgent candidate, gained the Republican Party nomination. Battle for Growth In preparing for a battle for growth, China is getting ready for something that hasn’t appeared in the last 250 years. What the Chinese like to call the Dragon environment. All economies around the world are going to fight for growth in a decreasing transactional environment. Take TATA steel in the U.K. as an example of what the future will bring. The Chinese are clearly fighting an industrial war here. Dumped Chinese steel exports at ridiculously low prices are meant to kill any possibility of doing business with other companies. A Chinese works in a steel market in Yichang in central China’s Hubei Province, on April 25, 2016. (Chinatopix via AP) Because of the need to shore up shareholder value, there is constant pressure to cut costs. Any wrong move by a company competing with the Chinese may result in a loss in stock ratio, leading to a greater calamity of the share price falling. This is what the Chinese are hoping for. Related Coverage Globalization’s Toll—Tata Steel’s Expansion Dream Britain’s Steel Industry: Decline Isn’t Just Down to Tata China to Accelerate Steel Dumping in 2016 Once the Chinese sell to distributors at prices marked down because of excess inventory in the Chinese marketplace, they will be looking to either shrink down their competition or eliminate it completely. This will allow ease of entry into the market at a later date. Customers will have no choice but to buy from China because there won’t be any other competitors. The British know that when Tata steel closes down in the current crisis, imports of steel will have to be taken from outside the country. This then becomes something completely different, a matter of national security. Why? Because it takes decades to build up the infrastructure of an efficient steel industry, and once the foundation of these industries go, they never come back. This Has Happened Before You don’t have to go back too long to see these effects. The electronics industry in Silicon Valley, the motorcycle industry in the U.K., the automotive industry of Detroit, the aircraft industry and Boeing plant in Seattle, the textile mills of the past, the record industry of California. People speak of these changes as positive news, as if these jobs will go and better ones will come. Maybe. But these plants will not come back. Related Coverage China Could Control the Global Internet After Oct. 1 China Wants to Control What You Watch When Japan industrialized, it became a threat to the established U.S. brands in the 70s. The rest of the Asian economic tigers followed them in household goods production and automotive industry dominance. This time however, the situation is different. The sheer size of the industrial giant stalking the world’s market place makes us quake in our boots. This is not Japan who follows our rules, or other competitors who play by the rules. This is China, which has dominated the world economy for 18 out of the last 20 centuries. They are returning to the number one spot, and they intend to make the world in their own image, just like the Japanese and Germans have tried to do before them with their respective drives for manufacturing dominance over the world economy. The Battle for the Transaction Indeed, disruption has always happened throughout history, whether in scientific, military, innovative, or social ways. Disruption is just another word for change. The key thing to remember about disruption is that it is based upon two concepts, defense and attack of the existing transaction. The speed of the transaction in agriculture, manufacturing, and services is increasing. It’s not on-time delivery that matters any more, it’s now emotional delivery or instant delivery that matters. Can I get what I want with the swipe of my phone? Can I place one finger in the air and have a taxi turn up to take me where I need to go? Related Coverage Shadow Banking Increases the Risk of Another Global Financial Crisis China Calls on Credit Default Swaps to Spread the Pain Uber’s Next Disruption: Self-Driving Taxis Disruption means one thing, can you attack a competitor’s transaction and compete with them on the elements of the exchange of goods and services? This is what Uber, AirBnB, and the Chinese steel industry are doing now. They are disrupting the flow of finance from the customer to the supplier—in its basic form they are attacking supply and demand. You do this by analyzing exactly what makes up a transaction in its basic form and then you out qualify that transaction using whatever weapons in your arsenal you have designed, purchased, assembled, and created from scratch. Overnight, competitors are disrupted using the basic attack strategy of a better transaction. Everyone in the marketplace is thinking about it right now. General view of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) building in Beijing, China, on Jan. 13, 2016. (VCG via Getty Images) It’s open season among nation states as well. In a recent infamous battle between America and China, Britain was in the center. America wanted Britain not to join the AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese initiative that competes with the U.S.-dominated World Bank and International Monetary Fund), but Britain ignored the warnings and went ahead and joined anyway. And then Western nations followed them. The customers and countries flocked to the AIIB because they need to be involved in the economic development of Eurasia. Related Coverage Back to Square One: Why the Financial System Needs to Reset Understanding the Financial System Essentially, Britain disrupted the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund by joining AIIB, which took the wind right out of the sails of the two previous banking flagships. So suddenly, the IMF and WB found that they were disrupted and had to change the way they operate in order to survive. If they don’t change the way they do business and become competitive, they could easily lose out to entire countries, regions, and even continents as they become increasingly irrelevant to the smarter competitors who have attacked their previous nation of transactions with more value, capability and reach to the populations they intend to supply. The British people followed suit and voted for Brexit, reinforcing the employment independence of the British people and Britain’s own preparation for the battle for growth. Preparing for Battle So how do you prepare for battle in such an uncertain and unpredictable world, where a competitor can spring up from anywhere? Where a trusted ally will just abandon you in the blink of an eye? When time has no boundaries and time to prepare doesn’t exist anymore? What do you do when there are absolutely no geographic boundaries to business and no interests except short term interest because of the enormous pressure balance sheets and uncertainty brings in the marketplace? This is a very difficult proposition for every lawmaker, CEO, or shop floor employee who has pressures hanging over their head that they simply have not seen before. Each country, corporation, and enterprise will have to create their own plan to adapt to the world of disruption, depletion, and the rise of unrestricted warfare which everybody in the world is facing right now.

It is 'projected to enter service in the mid-2020s, building to a fleet of 100 aircraft.'  Scroll down for video  The US Air Force on Friday unveiled the first image of its next-generation bomber that will replace antique B-52s first developed during the Cold War. The all-black plane has a distinctive, zigzagging shape and a low profile designed to make it hard to spot on radar  WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT B-21 - The Air Force planning to introduce the aircraft in mid-2020s. -The all-black plane has a distinctive, zigzagging shape and a low profile designed to make it hard to spot on radar.  - The bomber was previously known as the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) - The latest name, B-21, recognises the aircraft as the military’s first bomber of the 21st century, - It is designed to be launch from the continental US and deliver airstrikes on any location in the world.  - While the new plane's specific capabilities are highly secret, it likely will be equipped with high-tech communications gear. -It will replace Air Force B-52 bombers, which have been flying for more than half a century - It will also eventually the B-1 bombers, when they retire sometime in the 2040s. The name was ultimately selected by James and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Dave Goldfein after a panel composed of staff from AFGSC and Headquarters Air Force determined the top-ranked selections from more than 2,100 unique naming submissions.  'The B-21 is intended to operate in both conventional and nuclear roles, with the capability of penetrating and surviving in advanced air defense environments,' The Air Force said. 'It will be capable of operation by an onboard crew or piloted remotely.'  Earlier this year the US Air Force unveiled the first image of its new stealth bomber when Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James provided the world with the first glimpse of the project using an artist's rendering. The rendering bears more than a passing resemblance to the Air Force's B-2 bomber, which is also made by Northrop Grumman.  However the new document reveals it may not be that accurate. 'The released rendering shows a flying-wing design not dissimilar to the B-2, although simpler in shape.  'It resembles early proposed designs that later evolved into the B-2.' The report also outlines the craft,s unmanned capabilities, saying 'Initial B-21s will be manned, with unmanned operation possible several years after initial operational capability (IOC).' Nuclear qualification will also take two years or so after IOC, the report says. It is designed to be launch from the continental US and deliver airstrikes on any location in the world.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Oxygen has been disappearing from the Earth’s atmosphere for...

Share this article Share 135 shares At an earlier event in Orlando, James revealed the plane - previously known as the Long Range Strike Bomber - would be called the B-21 until a new name has been agreed on, and she invited air crews to help. The designation B-21 recognises the aircraft as the military’s first bomber of the 21st century. 'This aircraft represents the future for our Airmen, and (their) voice is important to this process,' James told the Air Force Association's Air Warfare Symposium. The new bomber is a high Air Force priority because the oldest ones in its fleet — the venerable B-52s — have far outlived their expected service life. Even the newest — the B-2 stealth bombers (pictured) — having been flying for more than two decades The program has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception for fear of revealing military secrets to potential enemies. The military also wanted to avoid giving the losing bidders any details before their formal protest was rejected last week. The Air Force wants 100 of the warplanes, which will replace the ageing B-52s and the B-1 bombers that first saw action in the 1980s. Industry news reports say that while the new plane's specific capabilities are highly secret, it likely will be equipped with high-tech communications gear and other electronics that would allow it to perform a variety of missions, not just dropping bombs.  The new bomber is a high Air Force priority because the oldest ones in its fleet — the venerable B-52s — have far outlived their expected service life. Even the newest — the B-2 stealth bombers — having been flying for more than two decades.  A third bomber, the B-1, is used heavily for conventional strikes, but no longer is certified for nuclear missions. The Pentagon in October announced Northrop as the winner of the contract to build the bomber in a decades-long program that will likely end up costing in excess of $100 billion.  But work on the new plane was delayed for months while federal auditors reviewed a protest by Boeing and its key supplier, Lockheed Martin. Boeing has now told senior U.S. Air Force leaders that it will not take further legal action challenging the contract, Reuters said, citing two sources familiar with the decision. The B-21 bomber will replace Air Force B-52 bombers, which have been flying for more than half a century. Pictured is the B-52 Stratofortress entered service in the 1950s A pilot and co-pilot of a B-52 bomber in an image taken in 1972. These bombers are not out of date at the Air Force is looking to replace them with 100 B-21 bombers The Air Force, under pressure from lawmakers and retired Air Force officers, has promised to release more information about the new plane in March. And the program has now survived the legal protest process, it still faces hurdles in Congress. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain on Thursday said he would block the Air Force's use of a cost-plus type of contract for the long-range bomber since it holds the government responsible for cost overruns. The Air Force says that only the engineering and development phase of the program, valued at $21.4 billion, is structured as a cost-plus contract with incentive fees. Analysts say the program will be worth around $80 billion in total, providing a boon to Northrop and its key suppliers, but the Air Force has said only that it expects to pay $511 million per plane. John Michael Loh, a retired four-star U.S. Air Force general, has urged the Air Force to name Northrop's suppliers to shore up support in Congress, and avoid a re-run of the B-2 bomber program, which was scaled back from 132 planes to just 21, which drove the price of each plane sharply higher.  THE HISTORY OF THE B-2 BOMBER  The first operational aircraft, christened Spirit of Missouri, was delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, where the fleet is based, on 17 December 1993. Twenty one aircraft were built in the original B-2 fleet.  The B-2 has demonstrated its capabilities in several combat scenarios, including Operation Allied Force in Kosovo; Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and most recently, in Libya, during Operation Odyssey Dawn. The B-2 is the only U.S. aircraft that combines long range, large payload and stealth in a single platform, giving it the ability to project air power anywhere in the world.  It can fly 6,000 nautical miles unrefueled and 10,000 nautical miles with just one aerial refueling. The Air Force said it will buy 100 of the new bombers at a newly calculated average cost of $511 million each. Pictured is the a B-2A bomber from the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri With its ability to carry more than 20 tons of conventional and nuclear ordnance and deliver it precisely under any weather conditions, the B-2 also has the ability to change the outcome of a conflict with a single mission.  Today, the fleet consists of 20 aircraft, following the loss, in February 2008, of the Spirit of Kansas, which crashed while taking off from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, the only such incident in the B-2's more than 20 years of operation.  Nineteen B-2s are currently based at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., home of the 509th Bomb Wing, while one aircraft is assigned to flight testing at Edwards AFB, California to validate software and weapon systems upgrades. The idea is that the latest B-21 bomber, which is still on the drawing board will replace Air Force B-52 bombers, which have been flying for more than half a century. It will also eventually the B-1 bombers, when they retire sometime in the 2040s.

The event will take place during World Standards Week (WSW), a series of meetings and celebrations hosted annually by the Institute, coordinator of the U.S. voluntary standardization system. All ANSI members and interested stakeholders from government, industry, business, consumer groups, and academia are encouraged to attend and share their perspectives and expertise on integral industry news and updates that influence the standardization communities domestically and globally. The highly anticipated event will include ANSI's Annual Business Meeting luncheon, during which the Institute's president and CEO and Board chair will present updates on ANSI's recent activities, accomplishments, and strategic direction.  The day-long forum is free for all ANSI members, and will feature the following moderated panel sessions: "Drones and Unmanned Vehicles: Coming to a Standards Meeting Near You," will focus on how standards can alleviate the challenges related to technologies associated with drones, unmanned aircraft systems, and unmanned vehicles, as consumer demand for these systems rises. Panel representatives from the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), SAE International, and the U.S. Department of Transportation will participate, with more panelists to be confirmed. "Changing Landscape: How Will Standards and Conformance Look in 10 Years?" will explore how the standards development and conformity assessment environment will continue to evolve over the next decade, how to engage new stakeholders, and how standards and conformance programs will change. Moderated by a representative of The Boeing Company, the panel will feature the chairs of ANSI's Government Member Forum, (GMF), Company Member Forum (CMF), Organizational Member Forum (OMF), and the Consumer Interest Forum (CIF). "What is the True Impact of Standardization? A New Report from the International Trade Administration (ITA)," will investigate the relationship between standards and technical regulations and goods trade, as a recent report found that standards and global technical regulations potentially affect 93 percent of global exports and 92 percent of U.S. exports. Experts from ITA will walk ANSI members through the paper and its key findings in this informative presentation. "Services Initiative: Reaching New Sectors" will cover updates on ANSI's Board Task Group (BTG) on services standards, which focuses on five sectors: food safety, retail, transportation, recycling and waste management, and amusement and entertainment, with representatives from the American Dental Association, Inteleos, and additional panelists to be confirmed. "China Standardization Reform" will offer the latest insights on the overhaul of China's standardization system, which may have significant implications for U.S. stakeholders, particularly industry. Speakers are set to include representatives from the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), with a moderator from Corning Incorporated. The full agenda with speaker information is available here. The JMF meeting and Annual Business Meeting luncheon will be held at the FHI Conference Center, Washington, DC. The event will take place on Tuesday, October 26, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., including lunch. Registration is required by October 14, 2016, and is available via the ANSI WSW web page. World Standards Week, to be held this year on October 24-28, 2016, is an annual event where members of the standards and conformity assessment community come together in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration.

KING 6:24 PM. CDT September 26, 2016 Family members confirm Sarai Lara, 16, was killed in the Cascade Mall shootings in Burlington, Wash. (Photo: KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST BURLINGTON, Wash. -- The Skagit County coroner is expected to release more information about the five people killed in the Cascade Mall shooting on Tuesday, but KING 5 is learning more details about the victims. Family members say Sarai Lara, a 16-year-old Mount Vernon High School sophomore and cancer survivor, died when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Her mother and father were in the mall but did not go with her to Macy's, where the shooting happened. Family members confirm Sarai Lara, 16, was killed in the Cascade Mall shootings in Burlington, Wash.   (Photo: KING) "She was just a really beautiful lady. She was just really sweet to everybody," said Salvador Lara Jr., Sarai's brother. "She was a very caring young lady. She didn't deserve this." Her mother says her daughter survived cancer, and just last week her doctor told her everything was fine. She says she's saddened that her daughter had to die this way. She had also just applied for a job at Denny's and was going to start working to support the family. "She had a second chance to live her life. I guess God didn't let her live too long," said Salvador. "I have no words to express my feelings right now. I'm just speechless." Sarai's parents say they haven't seen their daughter's body yet and are desperate to hear from investigators. Probation officer and daughter among victims Belinda Galde and Beatrice Dotson, a mother and daughter, both died in the cosmetics section of the Macy's department store where the shooting occurred. Authorities say Galde was a probation officer. The Snohomish County District Court in a statement identified Belinda Galde as an employee with the court since 1989, reports the Associated Press. The statement says the 64-year-old Galde "was an amazingly kind and caring individual" who helped thousands of probationers find a better way to live. Macy's employee a 'giving, graceful and caring' soul  Other victims were Shayla Martin, 52, a Macy's employee, and Chuck Eagan, a Boeing employee who was just about to retire. Martin's daughter Tanya Young said Martin was a loving grandmother and mother, who always put others before herself. "My mother was the most giving, graceful and caring souls," Young wrote in an email. "Everyone that knew her was touched by her light. She was intelligent and full of class." Boeing employee 'sacrificed himself to save his wife' Chuck Eagan and his wife began running when the shooter opened fire. His wife slipped and fell. Eagan stopped to help her, but was shot. "Pam was able to roll under a table and hide at some point. I understand the gunman walked past her but didn't see her," said Allen Hicks of Marysville, a friend of Eagan. "He sacrificed himself to save his wife. That's the kind of person he was," Hicks added. "The hard part was picturing him around any act of violence, because that wasn't him." Hicks said Eagan made interiors for Boeing airplanes and spent 25 years at the aerospace company. "He talks slow. And a lot of times we'd be, come on Chuck. Get on with the story, get on with the story. But they were great stories," said Hicks. "I'm glad he came into my life and I knew him." Hicks worries about Eagan's wife, who was not hurt in the shooting. "I cannot imagine what she's going through...I don't want her to go through survivors guilt." Friends say Chuck Eagan died trying to protect his wife during the Cascade Mall shooting. (Photo courtesy Eagan Family)   (Photo: KING) Families seeking solace and understanding after Friday's deadly shooting attended Sunday service at Christ the King Church in Burlington. His Place Church, where survivors were reunited with their loved ones after the shooting, also held a vigil for the victims Saturday. Attendees prayed for the victims and connected with other community members seeking support. Community members in Skagit County gathered Saturday at Maiben Park to grieve and support one another. Organizers called it "Skagit Strong." “When people come together and share their hearts it relieves that stress,” said Patty, a "Skagit Strong" organizer. There will be a Light Up the Boulevard candlelight vigil Monday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m. to remember the victims. It will be in the Cascade Mall parking lot between Applebee's and Johnny Carino's.

Xiamen Airlines Rolls Out New Service: Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle Xiamen Airlines Rolls Out New Service: Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle ICT Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 26/09/2016 15:02 XIAMEN, SHENZHEN, China and SEATTLE, Sept. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Xiamen Airlines launched its Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service on Sept. 26 th, creating an air bridge connecting two of China's major special economic zones and an economic heavyweight on the U.S. West Coast. This is not only the first long haul route originating in Xiamen with an end point in the United States, but also the first direct international service between Shenzhen and the U.S. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410761 The service will be handled by a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with three flights per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The flight numbers are MF845 and MF846. Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun said, "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders in 2015. On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." The Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is the sixth long haul and the first American route that Xiamen Airlines has launched. The existing services including Xiamen-Amsterdam, Fuzhou-Sydney, Xiamen-Sydney, Xiamen-Melbourne and Xiamen-Vancouver. The newly opened Seattle service is Xiamen Airlines' first long haul route with a stop at a city outside of the Fujianprovince. To complete the build out of a network that extends beyond Seattle, Xiamen Airlines has signed a partnership agreement with Alaska Airlines that enables passengers traveling to Seattle via Xiamen Airlines, to fly onward to 61 major and secondary destinations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico by connecting to an Alaska Airlines flight in Seattle. The launch of the route marks the first time the Xiamen Airlines fleet has had a chance to visit the home of their "birth", as Seattle, where Boeing is located, is where each member of the 165-strong fleet of aircraft was manufactured and first saw the light of day. As a loyal client of Boeing Co., Xiamen Airlines operates the largest all-Boeing aircraft fleet in China. Over the past 3 decades, Xiamen Airlines has taken delivery of hundreds of brand new Boeing airliners and, due to the low cost advantage of an all-Boeing fleet, Xiamen Airlines has continuously shown a profit for 29 years, the longest period of reporting uninterrupted profits in Chinese civil aviation history.

Lifestyle Why phones, electronic devices can’t be used on board aircraft. September 26, 2016 0 121 Author: sunnewsonline Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Ever wonder why do airlines advise passengers to turn off all mobile phones and all electronic appliances prior to aircraft taking off and landing, and sometimes even while it is at a cruising altitude? I know you have as this is one question that almost any curious first time flyer on an aircraft or even regular flyers would like to get an answer to.   Sometimes you are still fiddling with the phone trying to make the last call or send perhaps a last SMS to a close friend or family members. It could be to alert that you are about to depart and to get the other person at the other end informed so that they can pick you up once you arrive. It could even be, particularly for those with a phobia to fly, a call for a prayer of supplication for a safe flight. Then from nowhere, comes the warning; it’s a voice from the aircraft public address systems.  “Please turn off your phones and any other electronic device”. For years, frequent flyers have complained about the inability to use their electronic devices on planes. Several people have questioned why they can’t make phone call from their cell phone during a flight? The reasons This reason has its basis in both practical applications of science and in the law. Cell phones and wireless devices such as laptops emit active transmissions on the electromagnetic spectrum, also found in devices that include phones, radios and Wi-Fi networks. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has the  jurisdiction over the use of electronic devices on airplanes and it has banned the use of electronic devices on planes for fear that the electromagnetic interference associated with their use could affect the delicately calibrated and critically important instruments used to help the pilot fly the plane. Had an electronic device given off a strong enough signal, it could have negative impact on the aircraft navigational equipment, garbled radio transmissions, or otherwise interfered with the plane’s instruments. Anyone who has ever set a mobile phone near a radio or television speaker and heard the effects which alters the sounds from the speaker will readily appreciate and understand the reason for this concern. Imagine what that sort of interference multiplied by the dozens or hundreds of passengers on a particular aircraft  all using electronic devices at the same time could amount to. It would be a real catastrophe. It could compromise the aircraft safety. American aircraft manufacturer, Boeing also investigated several cases in the 1990s where aircraft crews reported that laptop computers or gaming devices caused autopilot disconnects, uncommanded airplane rolls or instrument display malfunctions. Ban on Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Last Tuesday, Nigeria joined the United States of America, Australia, and other European countries to ban the use or even the charging of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 mobile phones on any airborne aircraft in the country. It will be recalled that Samsung has recalled over 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices it manufactured recently citing several reported cases of overheating and outright explosion by users. “ NCAA has directed passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft,” said the NCAA. . “In addition, these phones must not be stowed away in any checked-in baggage and importantly, all airlines are hereby advised to emphasize the prohibition of this devices on board during passenger briefings by the Cabin Crew,” the statement added. The saying that to be forewarned is to be fore warmed comes it handy here. If you are a passenger on an airline and are asked to turn off the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 or any electronic device for any reason, whether you believe it to be valid or not, please comply. Indeed, your compliance will ensure the safety of your flight and will also save you from facing serious  criminal charges from the NCAA. The same weight of the law applies to anyone caught smoking on board an aircraft. Domestic airlines to save N26.5bn annually from import duty waivers Domestic airline operators in Nigeria now have some reasons to smile as the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) has commenced the implementation of a new Federal Government duty free policy on imported aircraft parts. With the absence of a functional Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility as well as any aircraft spares manufacturing firm, Nigerian airlines rely entirely on importation of component parts of aircraft which have to be routinely changed in line with manufacturers specifications. The parts don’t come cheap either. The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) usually charge five percent duty on any aircraft imported into the country, as well as aircraft spares, engines, and other accessories.. And in recent months, operators have cited the huge cost of sourcing for foreign exchange (forex) to import these parts into the country as one of the reasons hurting the fortunes of the local airline industry. In response to their plea, the government in July this year granted an import duty waiver on imported aircraft parts and spares to commercial airline operators to ease their operations. Two months later, operators said the NCS had failed to implement the policy. Operators like First Nation had even cited their inability to get the NCS grant in waivers to import critical engine components into the country on time as part of reasons for delaying the maintenance work on one of its aircraft. Customs had cited the ambiguity in the policy and the fact that it had a automated software  that captures all imported items and their duty value and that it needed some time to re-programme its software to capture the waivers for commercial airline spares. Spokesman for the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Mr. Yakubu Dati, however said last week that the Minister of State for Aviation, Mr. Hadi Sirika, had waded into the issue and that Customs had now commenced the implementation of the policy. “This policy would save Nigerian domestic airlines that were paying at least 5 per cent import duty on every spare part, about N26.5 billion per annum,” said Dati. “This means the era of Customs holding on to airlines’ spare parts has become a thing of the past. One of the gains is that downtime will reduce because an airline can import an engine and within a day clear it with Customs and on the second day mount it on the aircraft and start operations, ” said one industry official.

Jamie McDonald / Getty Dubai’s Agility and Maersk lead way to cut greenhouse gas emissions The National staff with Bloomberg September 26, 2016 Updated: September 26, 2016 01:39 PM Related South Africa raids six of the world’s biggest shippers over anti-trust tip-off How Abu Dhabi is addressing climate change Maersk’s biggest ship is a captain’s dream come true – in pictures World’s biggest shipping line to split in historic shake up Agility logistics raises profit despite falling revenue Topics: Shipping Agility, the Dubai-based global logistics provider, has signed an agreement with Maersk Line, the world’s largest container ship operator, to cut CO2 emissions by 15 per cent per container transported on Agility shipments by 2020. The agreement is part of Maersk’s Carbon Pact Challenge, an initiative under which the ocean carrier and its customers work together to drive down emissions and reduce the environmental impact of shipping. As part of their agreement, Agility and Maersk will look for ways to cut emissions by shipping cargo on more fuel efficient ships, optimising shipping networks and routes, they said, and other steps to reduce CO2 emissions such as working on how to integrate CO2 emission indicators into the regular business information flow and procurement of ocean shipping. "Responsible companies are looking for innovative, commercially viable ways to reduce the impact of their business on the environment," said Cas Pouderoyen, the Agility senior vice president for Global Ocean Freight. "In Maersk, we have one of the most creative and committed partners in the shipping industry. Our Carbon Pact partnership with them will benefit Agility customers and the planet." The International Maritime Organisation says ocean shipping accounts for 10 per cent of global CO2 emissions for transport. Road vehicles (73 per cent) and air transport (12 per cent) are the top sources of the greenhouse gas. In a bid to address the aviation industry’s emissions, leading airlines are supporting a United Nations proposal to limit pollution from international flights – even though the measure may eventually cost companies US$24 billion annually. Trade groups representing United Continental, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning on Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The industry was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global airline routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programmes. "We recognise that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, the executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9bn by 2035, or 1.8 per cent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. The bid for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU’s authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalise the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organisation’s largest assembly ever. Success is far from certain. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines, Deutsche Lufthansa and other industry leaders to initially subsidise the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The United States has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would strive to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. "This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry," Ms Bulc said. "I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action." business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related South Africa raids six of the world’s biggest shippers over anti-trust tip-off How Abu Dhabi is addressing climate change Maersk’s biggest ship is a captain’s dream come true – in pictures World’s biggest shipping line to split in historic shake up More Shipping Topaz Energy and Marine profit hit by fall in offshore demand World’s biggest shipbuilder to split into four companies Korea Line picked to buy collapsed Hanjin Shipping’s Asia-US routes MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

Korea Threat Grows Anthony Capaccio ACapaccio September 25, 2016 — 7:00 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp North Korea's Nukes Keep Getting Stronger Test to shoot down dummy missile expected in first quarter Next U.S. president will see if troubled system is improving Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The Pentagon’s next test of its ground-based system to destroy missiles aimed at the U.S. is tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2017, providing the new president evidence of whether the troubled program could stop the nuclear weapons North Korea threatens to launch. With North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un escalating his efforts to develop warheads and missiles capable of hitting the U.S. -- along with his vows to use them -- a test failure would confront the next administration with difficult decisions about a system that the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has estimated will cost at least $39 billion. The planned test in early 2017 to shoot down a dummy target replicating the threat from an intercontinental ballistic missile will be the first since a successful interception in June 2014. And that, in turn, was the first success since a test in 2008, which was followed by two failures in 2010 and an extensive effort to fix flaws with the interceptor’s warhead. The next test of the Ground-Based Interceptor system managed by Boeing Co. will take advantage of major improvements to the hit-to-kill warhead built by Raytheon Co. and an improved booster from Orbital ATK Inc., Chris Johnson, spokesman for the Defense Department’s Missile Defense Agency, said in an e-mail. Real-World Threat It’s also the first time the U.S. will attempt an intercept using all of the system’s sensors and communications against a target representing the real-world threat that would be posed by an ICBM, Johnson said. The Missile Defense Agency is working closely with Pentagon testers and the intelligence community “to ensure the threat is accurately represented to the extent possible,” but “target details are classified,” Army Major Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department’s director of operational testing, said in an e-mail. “The reliability and availability” of the Ground-Based Interceptors that are already deployed at bases in California and Alaska remain low as the agency “continues to discover new failure modes during testing,” Cabiness said. The U.S. missile defense test will take place in the context of North Korea’s claims that it successfully tested a nuclear device this month that can be placed atop a long-range missile. U.S. Vice Admiral James Syring, head of the Missile Defense Agency, hinted during a budget briefing in February that the target for the defense system’s next test would replicate some projected characteristics of North Korea’s road-mobile KN-08 ICBM. The North Korean missile is thought by Pentagon officials and intelligence analysts to be capable of hitting parts of the U.S. mainland, although it hasn’t been flight-tested. While the test target “would be replicating the expected range and speed of an ICBM,” Syring said at the briefing that “we would be more concerned” with whether it replicates the KN-08. For a look at Clinton, Trump and a Nuclear North Korea, click here. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told an audience in Washington on Sept. 20 that “we have long assessed that the North Koreans have the capability to fit a nuclear weapon in a warhead on a missile.” Clapper singled out the KN-08, “which is judged to be” capable of hitting parts of the U.S. “Neither the North Koreans or we know if these will actually work” because a full missile system with a warhead, or re-entry vehicle, hasn’t been tested, Clapper said. “But in our business we kind of have to assume the worst.” Syring and other U.S. officials also have said the KN-08 is the projected threat that’s driving U.S. plans to increase the number of ground interceptors in Alaska and California to 44 by Dec. 31, 2017. Thirty-four are in silos today. Developing a missile able to destroy a high-flying ICBM is a tougher challenge than repelling incoming short or medium-range tactical missiles, the purpose of the Thaad defense system that the U.S. plans to deploy in South Korea over the objections of China and Russia. Unresolved Issues Questions persist about how well the U.S. system to stop an ICBM would work. The missile defense agency “has demonstrated partial capability” against “small numbers of simple ballistic missile threats launched from North Korea and Iran,” Cabiness, the spokesman for the Pentagon testing office, said in an e-mail. That assessment was based in part on the June 2014 intercept that demonstrated several software fixes and a partially successful non-intercept test this January that showed some improvements with other components. It’s not possible yet to predict the probability of a successful interception, such as an 80 percent confidence level, Cabiness said. Such a quantitative assessment requires “extensive ground testing” supported by accredited “modeling and simulation,” he said. Laura Grego, a missile defense analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an e-mail that the answers from the testing office raise “the important question: How good is partial? Or as most people would ask, ‘Does it work?’” For example, none of the intercept tests since 2010 have used targets representative of actual threats or complex countermeasures, she said. Since its inception, the system “has destroyed its target fewer than half the 17 times it has been tested, and its record is not improving over time,” she said. Since the 2004 deployment decision, “the system has a three-for-nine record,” said Grego, co-author of a July report titled “Shielded From Oversight: The Disastrous U.S. Approach to Strategic Missile Defense.” Johnson of the Missile Defense Agency said it continues to improve reliability by upgrading interceptors already fielded, by “implementing improvements in new production interceptors,” and by incorporating reliability improvements in future warhead designs. Asked why the next test will come more than two years after the mid-2014 exercise, Johnson said it’s “aligned with availability” of the new warhead and booster designs “after we completed rigorous ground testing on the new and modified components.” The agency “constantly demonstrates and evaluates” the system “by conducting complex war-games, ground tests and advanced computer modeling and simulation,” Johnson said.

The four planes are being inspected for any possible safety of flight issues on the ground at Robins Air Force Base, GA, home of the 116th Air Control Wing. Assembly of an independent review team is also underway which will be tasked to “inspect and validate quality assurance processes at the contractor’s depot,” according to a service spokesperson. Middle East & North Africa Backers of Syrian rebels fighting the forces of President Bashar al-Assad are to send new types of heavy weapons following the collapse of a week long ceasefire last week. However the new arms, which include Russian-made rocket launchers and artillery, are believed not to represent any major shift in support. The USA, alongside neighboring governments, looking to topple Assad for a more friendly regime have sent military support to militias fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army for the last number of years. Even Islamist and Jihadist groups have often benefited (either directly or indirectly) from Western-backed patronage as the ever shifting ground of alliances and players in the conflict continue to muddy the waters of an increasingly complex conflict. Africa Angola is to receive the first of their refurbished Mi-24P helicopters from Russia later this month. Work completed by manufacturer Russian Helicopters includes rotor blade and tail rotor blade replacements as well as engine, transmission unit and avionics repairs. Sudan, Mali, and Nigeria will also join Angola in receiving refurbished Russian attack helicopters after it was announced at this year’s Africa Aerospace & Defense (AAD) Expo in South Africa. Europe While the UK doesn’t look set to acquire Gripen fighters anytime soon, Saab are keen that their GlobalEye AEW&C platform would be an ideal replacement for the RAF’s current fleet of six Boeing E-3 Sentrys. The company believes that products such as its EyrieEye ER system – or a larger package like the Bombardier Global 6000-based GlobalEye – are still in the running in the UK market, even though London looks set to keep the E-3s operational until 2035. Until then, recent GlobalEye purchaser UAE may provide some operational reviews before the UK decides to go the full monty on GlobalEye. Leonardo-Finmeccanica could have their third consecutive head honcho face jail time as Italian prosecutors request a 16-year jail sentence for Mauro Moretti, the company’s current CEO. While Moretti’s predecessors’ main wrongdoings relate to 2013’s well publicized Indian helicopter bribery scandal (AKA Choppergate), Moretti’s troubles stem from his time as head of Italy’s railways. Prosecutors are looking to find top rail brass culpable for a 2009 crash of a cargo train carrying liquefied gas, which burst into flames and resulted in the deaths of 32 people. You can change your name, but the scandals follow. Asia Pacific Google are unwittingly getting themselves involved in geopolitics quite a lot recently. Following the recent hubbub over the apparent removal of Palestine from Google Maps, Taiwan has requested that the IT giant blur satellite images of their military installations on Taiping Island in the South China Sea. The latest Google Earth images of the island showed four three-pronged structures arranged in a semi-circular fashion on the beach next to an airstrip, unseen on previous images. A company statement states that the request is under review. Meanwhile, China frantically screencaps. It’s back to the drawing board for KAI’s KUH-1 Surion as the Korean-made utility helicopter failed a number of extreme climate tests in the USA. If successful, the testing would have given the Surion an international standard and boosted export chances. Several parts will now be redesigned to rectify the defects found during the testing, which puts the helicopter through very challenging humid and freezing temperatures. Well folks, it’s finally a done deal! France and India’s defense ministers inked contracts for 36 Dassault Rafale fighters on Friday, with pictures of French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and his Indian counterpart, Manohar Parrikar, surfacing on Parrikar’s Twitter account stating “Rafale will significantly improve India’s strike & defence capabilities.” Due to be delivered over the next six years, the Rafales are estimated to be worth $8.7 billion, haggled down from an original figure of $13.47 billion.

IAG boss sees place for A380 in Iberia and Aer Lingus fleets Tropic Air delivers international flights to Chetumal View All World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation World Routes News Header World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Posted 25 September 2016 21:00 Richard Maslen Editor, Routesonline LinkedIn Twitter Follow @routesonline 5,901 followers While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Peter Bellew. As market conditions continue to make it difficult to offload its redundant Airbus A380 fleet, Malaysia Airlines is developing an innovative project to keep its six aircraft flying through the formation of an exclusive Super Jumbo wet-lease business. Although it remains the airlines goal to try and sell the aircraft when it replaces them with new A350 equipment in 2018 and 2019, it believes an alternate option may be required. Speaking during a fireside interview at the World Routes Strategy Summit in Chengdu, China, Peter Bellew, chief executive officer, Malaysia Airlines said: “I don’t want to see them depart to the desert or remain parked in Kuala Lumpur.  We are working on a project to keep them flying.” Under questioning from Flightglobal’s vice president, markets, Mark Pilling, Bellew joked: “We are the proud owner of a spaceship”. However, he noted that although airlines may be reluctant to sign-up long-term to the aircraft, many operators have expressed an interest in using them in a niche capacity. “What we will have to do is be imaginative,” he said. “There is a clear opportunity for the aircraft from markets such as China, but airlines don’t want to buy the aircraft and are nervous of such an investment, yet they have routes that can clearly support the operation of the type on a wet-lease basis.” The tentative plan will see the formation of such a wet-lease operator that will be a sister business to Malaysia Airlines that could see the aircraft remain flying for charter work and third party contracts.  “We have all the infrastructure for the aircraft from training through operations to maintenance so can provide a one stop shop to any operator,” explained Bellew. “I really do think there is a business out there for such an offer.” The Super Jumbos are earmarked for scheduled retirement from 2018, when all six of the carrier’s new A350-900s are due to be delivered on leases from Air Lease Corporation. The A350s will directly replace the A380 on its only remaining scheduled route – Kuala Lumpur-London Heathrow– as well as to serve some stronger medium-haul markets in Asia and into Australasia. Bellew acknowledged that the aircraft will likely remain in Malaysia Airlines operation through to late 2018 to support Hajj and Umrah flying and could continue to play a role in this market. “The Hajj and Umrah is now a 9-10 month business and the Boeing 747-400s are getting towards end of cycle.  The A380, perhaps in a higher density arrangement to how we fly it, will be an ideal aircraft to support this market. I see a future for the aircraft doing this.  I think it could ultimately absorb 6 to 12 aircraft,” he said. The proposed project shows the modern business attitude at the Asian flag carrier. While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Bellew. “To be honest there was a lot to do around our network.  We had been flying routes that didn’t make sense, flying the wrong aircraft on services and at the wrong times.  We have worked to fix this now,” said Bellew. The realignment of its network and growth to an average aircraft utilisation of 12 hours per day is delivering 100 extra hours of capacity a day, the equivalent of six extra narrowbodies joining the fleet in 2017. “This can certainly be deemed ambitious growth for an airline of our scale,” he said. “We will redeploy capacity principally into China, Japan and South Korea. Our business to china is fantastic. When you consider that only 4% of the population has a passport and that is predicted to grow to 12% in ten years it creates a market for another 150 million international travellers. If I owned the airline myself I'd take the metal and point it all north.” Seasonality schedule changes should also free up capacity for the airline to add up to six or seven brand new routes. “We have some interesting plans,” he said. Watch the full Peter Bellew interview A recent commitment for up to 50 Boeing 737MAX airliners, arriving from 2019, will also enable the carrier to operate more competitively against its rivals. The deal comprises a firm C order for 25 MAX-8s and options for up to 25 MAX-8s or MAX-9s, which will be used not only to replace older equipment on short-haul routes but also to grow the airline’s network. Recently-appointed CEO, Bellew, describes the Boeing deal as “a gamechanger” for the airline, in terms of costs and efficiency, while it will also be able to fly the craft on longer routes of six to seven hours. This will open up new city-pair options out of Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia that are not commercially sustainable for widebodied equipment.  It will also provide flexibility for network growth with potential to retire or extend leases on its existing 737 Next-Generation fleet and although it better compete alongside low-cost carrier AirAsia in the local market. "If you want to fight a war, you need an enemy to fight," he said. In the short-term the airline is seeking to add three or four additional A330-300s to its fleet to meet the immediate need for additional capacity in some existing markets and to expand in China, Japan and South Korea. “I could deploy them overnight and be profitable immediately on routes to China, Japan and South Korea,” said Bellew. The airline recently retired the Boeing 777 from its fleet in its attempt to become a leader across its home region and capture the air traffic boom across Asia but now acknowledges that it has left the carrier a little short on capacity into markets such as Hong Kong, Delhi and others. While its transition continues, Bellew insisted the turnaround of the airline remains on track, with costs “under control” and the focus now being to “boost revenues”. The airline had a marginally profitable first quarter at operating level, driven by favourable fuel prices, operational improvements, and a strong February, and Bellew is confident the airline will breakeven from the fourth quarter 2017, be fully profitable by 2018, and could be listed on Bursa Malaysia as early as spring 2019. “Together with our shareholder we have set a goal of March 2019 to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.  It is an ambitious timescale and a real stretch, but is certainly an achievable goal,” concluded Bellew.

The only thing worse than the corporate welfare perpetuated by the Export-Import Bank with a three-member board majority would be a rule change allowing a two-member “quorum” on the five-member panel. That would clear the way for even less scrutiny. For more than a year the First Bank of Cronyism has been restricted to transactions of no more than $10 million because of three empty seats on its board. No quorum, no mammoth loans. But a policy rider foisted on a stopgap bill to keep the government funded after Oct. 1 would allow Ex-Im's diminished board to approve massive transactions “temporarily” — to help so-called “small businesses,” which typically means Boeing and General Electric. It's bad enough that this dated institution provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees — the need for which is spurious, at best — to foreign countries and companies to purchase U.S. products. Small businesses receive less than 20 percent of the bank's subsidies, according to one study. And major players like Boeing can afford their own financing. “This is cronyism working behind the backs of the American people to protect more cronyism,” said Club for Growth President David McIntosh. Just over a year ago Congress rightfully allowed the Ex-Im's charter to expire before liberals came to its rescue. What's proposed now is a rollback in its accountability, which will only make a bad situation worse.

Commercial photography is one industry that has benefited from advances in technology that have brought down the price of drones.

So far these stealthy units — long used by military forces for intelligence-gathering, surveillance and striking targets — have been powered by internal combustion engines or lithium polymer batteries. But now manufacturers are getting ready to replace those with more efficient and longer-lasting hydrogen fuel cells in a bid to accelerate the mainstream commercial adoption of drones — also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Amazon is working on a delivery system where drones would get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using drones, a commercial application that could benefit from advances in how the units are powered. (Amazon/Associated Press) Advancements in fuel-cell performance are being met by cost reductions and innovations on the drones themselves, says Thomas Jones, director of product development at EnergyOr, a Montreal-based company producing small- to mid-size, fuel-cell-powered drones. New technologies converge "We've got two new technologies that are converging at an exponential pace," says Jones. "It's exciting to be involved with … optimizing them together and riding this wave of technology development." Until now, fuel cells have been engineered for commercial use in cars and buses, and in stationary power systems like those that power some cellphone networks. Now that the drone revolution is disrupting a broad range of industries, manufacturers have set their sights on new, potentially lucrative markets. Boeing subsidiary, Insitu, says it hopes to roll out a commercial, hydrogen fuel-cell version of its ScanEagle drone, pictured here, in 2017. (Insitu) A recent study on the commercial applications of drones by consulting firm PwC, valued the emerging global market for business services using drones at more than $165 billion Cdn, with infrastructure, agriculture, transportation and security industries offering the most potential. Drones have come a long way in a short time0:49 One company looking to take advantage of these opportunities is Protonex, a subsidiary of Burnaby-based fuel-cell developer, Ballard Power Systems. Protonex recently delivered its proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells to Insitu, a subsidiary of U.S. aerospace giant Boeing that produces military- and industrial-grade, long-endurance, fixed-wing drones — the kind that look like little airplanes. Multi-rotor drones like this one used for aerial photography, will gain flight time from new fuel-cell technology. (Amiel De Guzman) PEM fuel cells produce electric power on board the drone by reacting hydrogen — in either liquid or gas form — with oxygen. With water as its only byproduct, fuel cells are a clean power solution. Insitu is now testing Protonex's system in the hope of rolling out a commercial, liquefied hydrogen fuel-cell version of its ScanEagle drone in 2017. This is one of the most widely used, high-end UAVs around, having logged miles on military missions from Iraq to the Somali coast. Insitu representatives say they believe that, for some users, the new fuel-cell-powered ScanEagle will bring advantages over its current internal combustion engine. Longer flight times Both power sources offer long-endurance capabilities — a necessity for the eight- to 12-hour flight missions required by Insitu's clients. But fuel cells offer lower noise levels and heat signatures, too, which are particularly compelling features for militaries using drones on clandestine missions. Fuel cells — with fewer moving parts — break down less often than internal combustion engines. They also vibrate less, says Andrew Hayes, director of advanced development at Insitu. That makes for greater stability, important to commercial clients keen to use the drone's sensors and cameras to collect clearer data and visuals, he says.  "Ultimately, … all the customer wants is that data," says Hayes. Some of the applications the company is eyeing include inspecting oil pipelines and railway tracks, fighting forest fires, and monitoring mine sites. San Diego Gas & Electric operator Teena Deering holds a drone as it prepares for takeoff. Site inspections in a range of industries are just one of the applications that drone manufacturers have in mind as they move into commercial markets. (Gregory Bull/Associated Press) For smaller, shorter-endurance, multi-rotor drones — those that look like small helicopters — fuel cells offer even greater competitive edges over the standard power source, rechargeable lithium polymer batteries. Currently, batteries offer flight times of between 15 and 30 minutes on a single battery charge. But hydrogen fuel cells can power drones for up to three hours and are quickly refuelled after landing. Hydrogen fuel cells have higher "energy density," meaning manufacturers can get a lot of energy on board for much less weight, says Jones of EnergyOr.​   "That translates into longer endurance — what it's really all about for us," he says.​ EnergyOr's hydrogen gas fuel cells are now being tested in joint projects with France's Air Force and Spain's National Guard. Regulators scramble to keep up But the rise of drones raises societal concerns, and regulators are only starting to get the legal frameworks in place for their safe and beneficial use. This summer, U.S. transportation and aviation authorities announced national guidelines for non-recreational unmanned aircraft under 25 kg. Transport Canada requires commercial drone operators to get a special flight certificate advising how the UAV can be used. As drones encroach populated areas and flight paths, the evolution of these rules will be critical. Recreational use of drones is on the rise in Canada, and this group seen racing drones at park in Edmonton is just one example. (Terry Reith/CBC) Drones are also getting more popular for recreational use in Canada, which does not require a flight certificate for drones under 35 kg. This paves the way for novices who may not understand the limitations of their drones' battery life, for example. And privacy issues still need to be addressed, as regulations don't cover what kinds of information drones can collect and how that information is used. Perhaps most concerning to the average person: drones can easily capture personal photos and videos. "Transport Canada does a good job ... when it comes to safety issues, but I think that there are other social issues that also need to be addressed," says Kristen Thomasen, a legal expert on drones and incoming professor of law and robotics at the University of Windsor. Thomasen says she believes that a pressing next step is for legal experts, engineers and the public to discuss the privacy implications and the nuisance of buzzing drones overhead. ​Despite these questions, Hayes, of Insitu, foresees fuel cell drones taking ​off in both the military and civilian markets. "I think the fuel cell technology is going to be one of the keys to unlocking that market in a way that we can't do today."

IAG boss sees place for A380 in Iberia and Aer Lingus fleets Tropic Air delivers international flights to Chetumal View All World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation World Routes News Header World Routes Interview: Malaysia Airlines plans possible A380 wet-lease operation Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Posted 25 September 2016 21:00 Richard Maslen Editor, Routesonline LinkedIn Twitter Follow @routesonline 5,901 followers While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Peter Bellew. As market conditions continue to make it difficult to offload its redundant Airbus A380 fleet, Malaysia Airlines is developing an innovative project to keep its six aircraft flying through the formation of an exclusive Super Jumbo wet-lease business. Although it remains the airlines goal to try and sell the aircraft when it replaces them with new A350 equipment in 2018 and 2019, it believes an alternate option may be required. Speaking during a fireside interview at the World Routes Strategy Summit in Chengdu, China, Peter Bellew, chief executive officer, Malaysia Airlines said: “I don’t want to see them depart to the desert or remain parked in Kuala Lumpur.  We are working on a project to keep them flying.” Under questioning from Flightglobal’s vice president, markets, Mark Pilling, Bellew joked: “We are the proud owner of a spaceship”. However, he noted that although airlines may be reluctant to sign-up long-term to the aircraft, many operators have expressed an interest in using them in a niche capacity. “What we will have to do is be imaginative,” he said. “There is a clear opportunity for the aircraft from markets such as China, but airlines don’t want to buy the aircraft and are nervous of such an investment, yet they have routes that can clearly support the operation of the type on a wet-lease basis.” The tentative plan will see the formation of such a wet-lease operator that will be a sister business to Malaysia Airlines that could see the aircraft remain flying for charter work and third party contracts.  “We have all the infrastructure for the aircraft from training through operations to maintenance so can provide a one stop shop to any operator,” explained Bellew. “I really do think there is a business out there for such an offer.” The Super Jumbos are earmarked for scheduled retirement from 2018, when all six of the carrier’s new A350-900s are due to be delivered on leases from Air Lease Corporation. The A350s will directly replace the A380 on its only remaining scheduled route – Kuala Lumpur-London Heathrow– as well as to serve some stronger medium-haul markets in Asia and into Australasia. Bellew acknowledged that the aircraft will likely remain in Malaysia Airlines operation through to late 2018 to support Hajj and Umrah flying and could continue to play a role in this market. “The Hajj and Umrah is now a 9-10 month business and the Boeing 747-400s are getting towards end of cycle.  The A380, perhaps in a higher density arrangement to how we fly it, will be an ideal aircraft to support this market. I see a future for the aircraft doing this.  I think it could ultimately absorb 6 to 12 aircraft,” he said. The proposed project shows the modern business attitude at the Asian flag carrier. While it might seem from the outside that nothing has changed, Malaysia Airlines has been completely reborn as a business over the last 18 months. Now, the carrier is planning a growth trajectory across south-east Asia under the stewardship of former Ryanair executive, Bellew. “To be honest there was a lot to do around our network.  We had been flying routes that didn’t make sense, flying the wrong aircraft on services and at the wrong times.  We have worked to fix this now,” said Bellew. The realignment of its network and growth to an average aircraft utilisation of 12 hours per day is delivering 100 extra hours of capacity a day, the equivalent of six extra narrowbodies joining the fleet in 2017. “This can certainly be deemed ambitious growth for an airline of our scale,” he said. “We will redeploy capacity principally into China, Japan and South Korea. Our business to china is fantastic. When you consider that only 4% of the population has a passport and that is predicted to grow to 12% in ten years it creates a market for another 150 million international travellers. If I owned the airline myself I'd take the metal and point it all north.” Seasonality schedule changes should also free up capacity for the airline to add up to six or seven brand new routes. “We have some interesting plans,” he said. Watch the full Peter Bellew interview A recent commitment for up to 50 Boeing 737MAX airliners, arriving from 2019, will also enable the carrier to operate more competitively against its rivals. The deal comprises a firm C order for 25 MAX-8s and options for up to 25 MAX-8s or MAX-9s, which will be used not only to replace older equipment on short-haul routes but also to grow the airline’s network. Recently-appointed CEO, Bellew, describes the Boeing deal as “a gamechanger” for the airline, in terms of costs and efficiency, while it will also be able to fly the craft on longer routes of six to seven hours. This will open up new city-pair options out of Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia that are not commercially sustainable for widebodied equipment.  It will also provide flexibility for network growth with potential to retire or extend leases on its existing 737 Next-Generation fleet and although it better compete alongside low-cost carrier AirAsia in the local market. "If you want to fight a war, you need an enemy to fight," he said. In the short-term the airline is seeking to add three or four additional A330-300s to its fleet to meet the immediate need for additional capacity in some existing markets and to expand in China, Japan and South Korea. “I could deploy them overnight and be profitable immediately on routes to China, Japan and South Korea,” said Bellew. The airline recently retired the Boeing 777 from its fleet in its attempt to become a leader across its home region and capture the air traffic boom across Asia but now acknowledges that it has left the carrier a little short on capacity into markets such as Hong Kong, Delhi and others. While its transition continues, Bellew insisted the turnaround of the airline remains on track, with costs “under control” and the focus now being to “boost revenues”. The airline had a marginally profitable first quarter at operating level, driven by favourable fuel prices, operational improvements, and a strong February, and Bellew is confident the airline will breakeven from the fourth quarter 2017, be fully profitable by 2018, and could be listed on Bursa Malaysia as early as spring 2019. “Together with our shareholder we have set a goal of March 2019 to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.  It is an ambitious timescale and a real stretch, but is certainly an achievable goal,” concluded Bellew.

The sides will accordingly discuss the legal aspects of the deals to precipitate their implementaiton, Akhondi told reporters, IRNA news agency reported September 24. The two aircraft manufacturers were authorized by the US Treasury earlier this week to sell their products to Iran, months after Iran signed deals with the companies. In January Iran and Airbus signed a deal over 118 airliners. But the company could not accomplish the deal as it was restricted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States in doing business with Iran. A similar deal between Tehran and Boeing had the same story. Iran plans to buy about 500 aircraft in 10 years to refurbish its aging fleet. Iranian airliners average 25 in age.

First designed in the 1960s at the height of the Cold War, the Minuteman nuclear weapons are starting to show their age, and replacement parts are difficult to find for the weapons designed in an analog age. Also ageing are their silos, many built in the 1950s and now rusting as water seeps through the decaying concrete. Over the next 20 years, the US Air Force will switch out the entirety of its Minuteman III  fleet with an as-yet-unnamed new missile known only as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Air Force estimates the cost of the GBSD, to be introduced late in the 2020s and phased in over the following decade, will be around US$86 billion (RM354.27 billion) over the missiles' life cycle of about 50 years. Critics point to the Defence Department's long history of projects going way over budget and say the cost of replacing the nukes and maintaining their launch facilities is not warranted, given the tactical threats the United States currently faces.  The Air Force “doesn't know how we are going to afford this,” said Laicie Heeley, a nuclear expert at the Stimson Centre, a nonpartisan anti-nuclear proliferation think tank in Washington. “Nuclear is crowding out more conventional systems that are (better suited to) the threats of today.” America's nuclear triad The Air Force issued requests for proposals in July for vendors to replace the Minuteman, named after colonial militiamen who eventually fought against the British in America's Revolutionary War. The prize will likely go to one of the three US defence giants: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and the new missile will be equipped with state-of-the-art electronics while being protected from any cyber threats. America's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are just one leg of its “triad” — a three-pronged nuclear attack force also comprising submarines and bombers. The Pentagon wants to replace or modernize all three legs of the triad, at a cost experts estimate will hit US$1 trillion over the next 30 years. “We flat can't afford it. And from a priorities standpoint, it's the wrong priority in the world that we face,” Democratic Congressman Adam Smith told a Washington forum last week, noting that the ICBM force is the part of the triad best suited for reduction. The lawmaker said countries like China are able to boast a “spectacular deterrent” with far fewer nuclear weapons. “What they have is enough to say 'Don't screw with us, or we will obliterate you,'” he said, adding that even if the United States were to enter a major nuclear fight, “we're pretty much all toast anyways.” The Pentagon insists it is imperative to push ahead with a complete overhaul of America's nuclear force. While the United States and Russia signed a treaty in 2010 to reduce the numbers of nuclear launchers, Moscow is modernising its own triad. “The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans are upgrading all of their systems,” an Air Force official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the nuclear programme.  “They are upgrading all of their legs of the triad — in that environment, I am not sure it makes sense” to do nothing. Another Air Force official said many of the vendors who first built or equipped the missile silos have long gone out of business, making it an arduous task to find replacement parts.  He said he'd heard anecdotes of colleagues scouring Ebay or other sites looking for antique components. The Minuteman fleet is currently dotted across locations in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana.  Defence Secretary Ashton Carter will tomorrow visit Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, where control centres for that state's nukes are located.  The Air Force has in recent years battled flagging morale among its “missileers” — airmen in charge of the land-based missile force.  A series of embarrassing revelations in 2014 described the state of the nuclear force, with dozens of airmen disciplined cheating on a test. Other investigations have probed drug use.  The trouble began after the demise of the Soviet Union, as the mission gradually received a lower priority and offered a less-promising career path. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump’s daughter Ivanka sits in on landmark Japan PM talks Thousands to rally against rising intolerance in Indonesia European leaders, Obama vow to hold fast to Nato 14 dead as Philippine army clash with Abu Sayyaf militants Chinese astronauts return to earth after longest space mission Trump and his aides plan next moves as protests spread (VIDEO) Tsunami hits New Zealand after series of strong quakes Trump considers seeking Bill Clinton’s advice Trump will get wake-up call when he takes office, Obama says Trump to lay out White House goals in prime-time interview Most Watched Now Week Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles European TV enjoys ‘halcyon’ days as home-grown shows push US series out of primetime World at ‘dangerous’ point as US-Russia tensions soar, Gorbachev says Lebanese shun pricey, polluted beaches for trips abroad Discovered in a dacha wall, a clue to a Cold War mystery BBC unearths video of infamous UK double agent discussing treachery Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

First designed in the 1960s at the height of the Cold War, the Minuteman nuclear weapons are starting to show their age, and replacement parts are difficult to find for the weapons designed in an analog age. Also aging are their silos, many built in the 1950s and now rusting as water seeps through the decaying concrete. Over the next 20 years, the US Air Force will switch out the entirety of its Minuteman III fleet with an as-yet-unnamed new missile known only as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Air Force estimates the cost of the GBSD, to be introduced late in the 2020s and phased in over the following decade, will be around $86 billion over the missiles' life cycle of about 50 years. Critics point to the Defense Department's long history of projects going way over budget and say the cost of replacing the nukes and maintaining their launch facilities is not warranted, given the tactical threats the United States currently faces. The Air Force "doesn't know how we are going to afford this," said Laicie Heeley, a nuclear expert at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan anti-nuclear proliferation think tank in Washington. "Nuclear is crowding out more conventional systems that are (better suited to) the threats of today." America's nuclear triad The Air Force issued requests for proposals in July for vendors to replace the Minuteman, named after colonial militiamen who eventually fought against the British in America's Revolutionary War. The prize will likely go to one of the three US defense giants: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and the new missile will be equipped with state-of-the-art electronics while being protected from any cyber threats. America's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are just one leg of its "triad" - a three-pronged nuclear attack force also comprising submarines and bombers. The Pentagon wants to replace or modernize all three legs of the triad, at a cost experts estimate will hit $1 trillion over the next 30 years. "We flat can't afford it. And from a priorities standpoint, it's the wrong priority in the world that we face," Democratic Congressman Adam Smith told a Washington forum last week, noting that the ICBM force is the part of the triad best suited for reduction. The lawmaker said countries like China are able to boast a "spectacular deterrent" with far fewer nuclear weapons. "What they have is enough to say 'Don't screw with us, or we will obliterate you,'" he said, adding that even if the United States were to enter a major nuclear fight, "we're pretty much all toast anyways." The Pentagon insists it is imperative to push ahead with a complete overhaul of America's nuclear force. While the United States and Russia signed a treaty in 2010 to reduce the numbers of nuclear launchers, Moscow is modernizing its own triad. "The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans are upgrading all of their systems," an Air Force official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the nuclear program.

(AP) "They are upgrading all of their legs of the triad -- in that environment, I am not sure it makes sense" to do nothing. Another Air Force official said many of the vendors who first built or equipped the missile silos have long gone out of business, making it an arduous task to find replacement parts. He said he'd heard anecdotes of colleagues scouring Ebay or other sites looking for antique components. The Minuteman fleet is currently dotted across locations in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter will on Monday visit Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, where control centers for that state's nukes are located.

Share story By Jessica Lee and Mike Baker Seattle Times staff reporters When Evangelina Lara heard commotion at the Cascade Mall on Friday evening, she feared the worst. Her 16-year-old daughter, Sarai Lara, was inside Macy’s and she could not get to her from across the mall. Seven hours later, her fears were confirmed. Lara, a Mount Vernon High School sophomore, was one of five people killed when a gunman opened fire in the Burlington department store. The victims ranged from Lara to a 52-year-old Macy’s employee to a 95-year-old woman at the mall with her daughter. “It’s not fair what happened to her,” Evangelina said of Lara, speaking through a translator Saturday evening in the family’s kitchen, surrounded by at least a dozen friends and family members. Born in Mount Vernon, the high-school sophomore was bright, smiley and her mother’s “right hand” at home with the family, Evangelina said. Sarai balanced a wide net of friends at school with helping at home, especially with her 5-year-old sister. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai was proud of her heritage, her mother said. In her free time, she enjoyed going out with friends, texting and shopping, Evangelina said. Family and friends remember her as “the perfect child.” “She was the most beautiful girl in Washington,” her mother said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.” “She was too young to get murdered like that,” said her 19-year-old brother, Salvador Lara. Another victim was Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, said his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife were out for a dinner and shopping at the mall, and they had made their way to Macy’s when the shooter opened fire. Thrush said Eagan and his wife began running, but his wife fell down as she was trying to get away. As Eagan helped his wife, he was shot, Thrush said. Cascade Mall Shooting Suspect in Cascade Mall shooting arrested in Oak Harbor Five people are dead after a gunman opened fire at Burlington's Cascade Mall on Friday night Victims’ families grieve the loss of loved ones at Burlington mall Man charged in Cascade Mall shooting was getting court-ordered mental-health treatment Police mistakenly describe Cascade Mall shooting suspect as ‘Hispanic,’ protests erupt on Twitter Seattle Sketcher: Tokens of support grace impromptu Cascade Mall memorial Cascade Mall shooting at a glance: the victims, the community, the suspect Other mass shootings in Washington state Opinion: ‘Inaction in the face of mass shootings is unacceptable’ Thrush said Eagan, who had two daughters, was planning on retiring from Boeing next year with hopes of doing some travel. “He was just a wonderful person,” Thrush said. Another victim is believed by her family to be Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old from Mount Vernon who worked as a makeup artist at Macy’s. Martin’s sister, Karen Van Horn, declined to talk Saturday evening. “We’re really having a tough time right now,” Van Horn said in a brief phone call. Van Horn, an employee at The Herald in Everett, told the newspaper that family members hadn’t heard an official confirmation she was among the victims, but a witness told them her younger sister was among the dead. Van Horn described Martin as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. “She was so sweet,” Van Horn told The Herald. “She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn’t want to rely on anyone else.” Blanca Mendoza, a co-worker of Martin, saw her earlier on Friday night in the cosmetics department. The cosmetics section was busy with customers, so Mendoza had gone to help — something for which Martin always expressed appreciation. “She thanked me for always coming when they call for help,” said Mendoza, 23. She recalled Martin as a sweet co-worker who would always say hello, strike up a conversation and joke that Mendoza should come work with her in cosmetics. Mendoza was inside the mall when the shooting happened, but was away on her break. Meanwhile, a family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother as victims of the shooting but declined further comment. KIRO identified the mother as Beatrice Dotson, 95. Galde worked as a probation officer out of Arlington for Snohomish County District Courts, according to the Washington State Courts website. The district court issued a statement late Saturday calling her death “an unimaginable and tragic loss.” “Belinda was a devoted and esteemed public servant for our court since 1989,” working to “ensure public safety and dedicated her life to assisting those who stumbled along the way in life,” the statement said. “She was an amazing kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live.” Times staff researcher Miyoko Wolf contributed to this report.

Washington State Patrol/Handout via Reuters. 3/3 By Tom James | MOUNT VERNON, Wash. MOUNT VERNON, Wash. There is no evidence showing that a man charged with five counts of first-degree murder after confessing to a shooting rampage at a shopping mall in Washington state over the weekend had contact with any known Islamic militant groups or individuals, a law enforcement official told Reuters on Monday. Turkish-born Arcan Cetin, a 20-year-old legal U.S. resident, was advised of the charges against him during a brief hearing in Skagit County District Court in Mount Vernon, Washington, on Monday and ordered held on $2 million bail. According to charging documents, Cetin admitted to police investigators that he brought a Ruger .22 caliber rifle into the Macy's department store at Cascade Mall in Burlington, about 65 miles (105 km) north of Seattle, on Friday evening and fatally shot five people. Skagit County District Attorney Richard Weyrich declined to discuss a motive for the shootings. But a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was nothing to suggest that Cetin had had contact with any known Islamic militants. However, the source said Cetin's motives for the attack were still unclear. Cetin walked into the Macy's shortly before 7 p.m. PDT (0200 GMT), gunning down a 16-year-old girl near a clothing rack, then opening fire on the other four victims in the make-up department before placing the gun on a cosmetics counter and walking out, prosecutors said in the court papers. Representative Rick Larsen said on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday that the slain girl was high school sophomore Sarai Lara, a cancer survivor. Also killed in the attack were Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old Macy's makeup artist, Boeing employee and father of two Chuck Eagan, retired probation officer Belinda Galde, 64, and her 95-year-old mother, Beatrice Dotson, Larsen said. Wearing red and blue jail garb and shackled at the waist, Cetin showed no emotion during Monday's court appearance and spoke only to respond "yes, your honor" several times to the judge. "It's a terrible, terrible thing and a terrible tragedy for the whole community," Weyrich told reporters after the hearing, adding prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek the death penalty against Cetin. The attack follows a series of violent outbursts at shopping centers across the United States, including the stabbing of nine people at the Crossroads Center in Minnesota on Sept. 17. The FBI has said it considers that attack a "potential act of terrorism." Cetin was taken into custody without incident Saturday evening after police spotted him near his home in Oak Harbor, 30 miles (48 km) southwest of Burlington. According to the charging documents, Cetin initially walked into the mall unarmed, through a Chuck E. Cheese family entertainment and pizza restaurant, then went back to his car to retrieve the rifle from the trunk, moving the car closer to Macy's. According to prosecutors, Cetin's father told them that he and his son had had a falling out recently. The father said he last saw his son at dinner at about 4:30 p.m. on the day of the shooting and that his rifle, which matched the description of the murder weapon, was missing along with ammunition.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Washington mall shooting suspect identified as an immigrant from Turkey September 26, 2016 by yalibnan 2 Comments The suspect in Washington mall shooting was identified as Arcan Cetin, 20, an immigrant from Turkey A suspected gunman believed to have killed five people at a Washington state mall was arrested Saturday, according to authorities. At a news conference, officials said they had not ruled out any possible motives for why 20-year-old Arcan Cetin allegedly shot four women and one man at the Cascade Mall in Burlington Friday evening. The suspect in Washington mall shooting was identified as Arcan Cetin, 20 Island County Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Hawley told reporters that he spotted Cetin near the suspect’s home in Oak Harbor, around 30 miles due west of the mall. Hawley said he immediately recognized Cetin as the suspect, turned his patrol car around and arrested Cetin without incident. “He said nothing,” said Hawley, who added that Cetin was unarmed and carrying a computer in a satchel when he was apprehended. “He was kind of zombie-like.” Mount Vernon Police Lt. Chris Cammock said Cetin had immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey and was a “legal permanent resident.” It was not immediately clear when Cetin came to the U.S. Hawley said Cetin had been arrested for simple assault last year, but provided no further details on the case. The Seattle Times reported that Cetin faced three domestic violence assault charges in both Burlington and Island County, with the victim identified as Cetin’s stepfather. The newspaper reports Cetin also was arrested for drunken driving. Court records show Cetin was told by a judge on Dec. 29 that he was not to possess a firearm, the newspaper reported. However, the stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time.” Cetin was arrested almost exactly 24 hours after his alleged victims were shot at the mall Macy’s makeup counter. The four female victims died in the store. The male victim died early Saturday as police finished sweeping the 434,000-square-foot building. Local media outlets had identified the victims as of early Sunday. One was 16-year-old Sarai Lara, a cancer survivor and high school sophomore. Her mother, Evangelina, told the Seattle Times that through a translator that she was shopping with Sarai and her younger sister, but they split up. She said Sarai went to Macy’s looking for pants. News of the shooting spread through the mall, and Lara tried to get to her daughter but was unable to do so. KIRO-TV identified two more victims as Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, 95-year-old Beatrice Dotson. The Seattle Times identified the other two victims as Macy’s makeup artist Shyla Martin, 52, and Chuck Eagan, a Boeing maintenance worker who was shot while helping his wife flee the store. DEVELOPING: Cascade Mall Suspect Identified By Friends As Arcan Cetin, A 20 Year Old Immigrant From Turkey – KIRO pic.twitter.com/WlEwOQIyrO — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) September 25, 2016 “There are people waking up this morning, and their world has changed forever. The city of Burlington has probably changed forever, but I don’t think our way of life needs to change,” Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said earlier Saturday. “This was a senseless act. It was the world knocking on our doorstep, and it came into our little community.” Surveillance video captured the suspect entering the mall unarmed and then recorded him about 10 minutes later entering the Macy’s with a “hunting type” rifle in his hand, Cammock said. The lieutenant said late Saturday that the rifle was apparently brought into the mall from a suspect vehicle. The weapon was recovered at the scene. “Probably one of the most difficult moments for us last night was knowing that there were family members wondering about their loved ones in there,” Cammock said. Burlington, a community of 8,600 people, is about 65 miles north of Seattle, too far to be a commuter town, but its population swells to 55,000 during the day because of a popular outlet mall, retail stores and other businesses. Burlington is the only major retail center within 30 miles in a region where agriculture is king, said Linda Jones, president of the Burlington Chamber of Commerce. Residents gathered Saturday to comfort each other at a community gathering in a city park. “It’s too scary. It’s too close to home,” said Maria Elena Vasquez, who attended the gathering with her husband and two young children. Joanne Burkholder, 19, of Mount Vernon, was watching the movie “The Magnificent Seven” in the mall’s theater when security guards came in and told them to evacuate immediately. Dozens of panicked moviegoers gathered in the hallway, and Burkholder heard screaming as the officers escorted them to safety in a parking lot. As she drove home later, she had to pull over because she was shaking so hard, she told The Associated Press. “I’m just very thankful for my life this morning. I’ve never been so terrified in my life,” she said Saturday, trying to hold back tears as she attended the community vigil. “You’d think it would happen in Everett or Seattle, but a small town of Burlington, I’d never dream something like this would happen.” People who believed they may have lost loved ones were being sequestered at a church three blocks from the mall, where counselors and a golden retriever therapy dog were present. Dozens of people attended a Saturday evening prayer service for the victims. The gathering was held at Central United Methodist Church in nearby Sedro-Woolley, Wash. The Rev. Cody Natland lit five candles on a table in front of the church, one for each victim.

BUSINESS Technology A hot market for IPOs shows itself — at least for a week Trade Desk Christopher Galluzzo / Nasdaq Employees and investors of the Trade Desk celebrated the company's initial public offering by ringing the closing bell at Nasdaq on Wednesday. Employees and investors of the Trade Desk celebrated the company's initial public offering by ringing the closing bell at Nasdaq on Wednesday. (Christopher Galluzzo / Nasdaq) Paresh Dave Ample free food and other perks are nice, but it’s stock options and lofty missions that often seduce people into joining tech start-ups. That’s why Jeff Green will never forget the excited expressions on employees’ faces last month when he told them their advertising software company would go public. It would open the door for them to cash in on their shares and signal that the company would aggressively chase its ambitions. “They couldn’t believe that day had actually come and that we had made the decision and chose to do it,” said Green, chief executive of Ventura-based the Trade Desk Inc. Few start-ups ever reach the point where they can list on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. But initial public stock offerings have been an even rarer sight this year, which could see the fewest IPOs since the Great Recession. New listings are down about 50% from last year, and experts don’t see the floodgates opening until next year. Companies have been scared off by financial crises in China and Europe and the unease surrounding the U.S. presidential election. They’re also getting pushed to achieve profitability before going public or accept a haircut in their valuation, investors say. And for most businesses, there’s been ample cash available to stay private longer. Green, 39, fought past those concerns because he has a fast-growing enterprise that’s making money. Wall Street will never lose its hunger for that combination, he said. Several other companies with healthy profit margins also made the leap in recent days, fueling the year’s busiest week for IPOs, according to money manager Renaissance Capital. Auto lubricant maker Valvoline had the largest of eight offerings, hauling in $660 million. The group, including cosmetics products maker e.l.f. Beauty and IT software firm Apptio, raised more than $1.2 billion and all saw their share prices shoot up in public trading. Investors say it’s a sign of a healthy appetite for risk, though much of the interest stems from persistent weak returns on other investment options. Many of the newly listed companies are trading at big premiums to peers that have been publicly traded for longer. All but a dozen of the year’s nearly 80 IPOs are trading above their starting price, according to research firm FactSet.  “There’s a lot of cash around, and the alternatives in bonds and elsewhere are not very attractive,” said Todd Morgan, chairman of fund advisor Bel Air Investment Advisors. Investors “are chasing the hot market. They expect all the IPOs will go up.” It certainly worked out that way for Trade Desk. The company raised more than $78 million from the stock sale on Sept. 20, when shares were priced at $18 each. Shares traded up 76% to $31.69 on their first day on Nasdaq and closed at $27.66 on Friday.  Getting to market required years of preparation and a month of sweating over whether to pull the trigger, Green said. “The day before we announced to employees a month ago, it felt like the day before marriage,” he said. “I’ll go to married or divorced in the future, but I’ll never be a single again. Life will be different in some way.” His previous start-up significantly influenced his decision. He had co-founded an advertising company that was sold to Microsoft in 2006, but the company got lost in the shuffle of the technology giant. His team lost its “vision and clarity,” he said. “I’m not sure if I would have the courage to go public if I hadn’t sold my last company,” he said. “We have all the fundamentals and mechanics working for us. Why would we risk messing that up?” The Trade Desk provides an online service that lets ad agencies and advertisers automatically place bids in auctions for ad space on websites and apps. The auctions last less than a second, and the Trade Desk’s fee is tied to how much a customer spends on each month’s digital ad buys. The system brought in $75.6 million in revenue and $6.6 million in profit during the first half of the year. Barely 1% of the money spent on ads worldwide each year is transacted through real-time digital auctions, which means the Trade Desk and rivals like AppNexus and Turn have plenty of room to grow, according to Green. “Because we’ve just started the transformation, we wanted a mechanism to be in there for the long haul,” he said. Going public changes life within a company. The Trade Desk’s 450 employees probably feel a bit richer, which may adjust their behavior. The Trade Desk’s bankers have the option to sell stock held by some investors and employees at the IPO price, providing an instant payout. But even those holding onto their shares or subject to a lock-up period in which they can’t sell can see daily price changes, making their wealth feel more real. “The only way I know to temper that and maintain the culture is talk about it,” Green said. “Money doesn’t define who we are. The hotels we stay in don’t define who we are. What people are looking for is making an impact.” Several more IPOs are in the works, though there’s unlikely to be a rush of offerings. Online accounting software developer BlackLine Inc. has filed confidentially to go public as soon as next month, with the 15-year-old company valued at more than $1 billion including its debt, Reuters reported last week, citing anonymous sources. A spokesperson for the Woodland Hills start-up declined to comment. Founded by Chief Executive and software programmer Therese Tucker, BlackLine’s service centralizes data storage, automates some accounting tasks and provides a layer of analytics to assist in decision making. It is used by companies such as Costco and Boeing. Inc. magazine reported the company generated $83.6 million in revenue last year. BlackLine could become the most lucrative listing ever of a venture-capital funded company founded or led by a woman in the region, according to financial research firm PitchBook. The bar was set only last week when emergency-alert software maker Everbridge Inc., co-headquartered in Pasadena and Burlington, Mass., raised $75 million in an offering valuing the company at $323 million, according to PitchBook. Among Everbridge’s co-founders and board members is Cinta Putra, who was CEO from 2002 through 2011. Everbridge lost $10.8 million last year. But CEO Jaime Ellerston has said the company went public in an effort to lend a stamp of legitimacy to its sales pitch. “We believe we can gain significant competitive advantage by being the first public company in our space,” he said. Everbridge started talking to investors a few weeks ago, with the earthquake in Italy and hurricane in Florida providing news to drive home the need for his company’s service. Company insiders cashed out to the tune of $15 million.

Airlines like Qantas, Singapore Airlines, and Malaysia Airlines are all making plans to reduce the amount of service they fly on the Airbus A380 jumbo-jet. Airbus, for its part, has cut production by 55%. The plane is currently flown by 13 airlines out of 57 airports. The routes average more than 4000 miles (6500 km—London to Miami, for example). There are shorter routes, like Emirate’s 45 minute hop from Dubai to Kuwait City and China Southern’s three-hour 1,000-mile trip between Chengdu and Beijing. A decline of service on the A380 isn’t just a bummer for traveling fans, it could inconvenience airports too. Upgrades were needed to be made all over the surface and buildings of airports to accommodate the larger and heavier plane. Without service from the A380 (or Boeing’s similarly declining 747) those improvements will sit idle. Stuffed full of economy seats, the plane can seat well over 800 passengers, though none use that configuration. Most airlines use the extra space on the two-level plane for large areas of plush business and first class seating. (Some have even installed showers and in-air cocktail lounges).

These two have certainly not held back on their jabs at each other, especially during the past couple of months as they inch closer to Election Day in November. So what are Clinton and Trump sparring about now ahead of the debate? Airline aesthetics. Last week, Trump called out Clinton on Twitter for “copying” his airplane rallies, after Clinton debuted  her “Stronger Together”–branded Boeing 737 earlier this month and invited the press corps on the tarmac and on board. While Clinton’s plane is a standard airliner with standard seating and a no-frills interior, Trump travels in his privately owned 757 model, tricked out with things like Rolls-Royce engines, 24-karat gold-plated seatbelts, and silk walls.  Two means of travel on two very opposite sides of the airliner spectrum; Clinton and Trump are polarizing even when flying the friendly—or, in their case, not-so-friendly—skies. So rest easy, Mr. Trump, your opponent isn’t being a copycat. In fact, presidential candidates have been inviting the press to hear them speak on the tarmac for decades. It’s all a part of the political show: a wave from the aircraft door, speaking at a podium with a big Boeing in the background, and, now, matching the campaign planes with the personalities of the candidates themselves. Ahead of tonight’s debate, a study in airline aesthetics, above, courtesy of Clinton and Trump.     Subscribe now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe In This Story: Holiday Travel Hillary Clinton Politics Share Tweet Add a Comment Tweet Subscribe Now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Recommended For You __title__ __category__ __title__ __category__ Vogue Fashion Runway Beauty Culture Living Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe VOGUE VIP Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Vogue Podcast Log In | Register Log Out Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides.com Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2016 Condé Nast.

A committee of experts constituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to look into the possibility of designing curricular structure for a bachelor-level degree programme in aeronautics has prepared a draft syllabus which has been sent to all universities for their comments and objections. In a notice to the universities, UGC Secretary Jaspal S Sandhu says that the "idea was to address the shortage of skilled manpower in the burgeoning sector of aeronautics that requires techno-scientific expertise for successful operation." Consultations and deliberations in the meetings by the experts revealed that the area of aircraft maintenance in the identified sector (aeronautics) is particularly affected by shortage of skilled human resources. "Thus, it merits urgent attention of institutions of higher education, which is why the committee decided to design the template of syllabus for a BSc Honours (Aircraft Maintenance) as a way of encouraging universities to come forward and offer this programme under the choice-based credit system (CBCS) introduced by UGC," Sandhu said. "There is a national need and it is a welcome. That said, they should not hurry into anything and compromise on the quality. Given that there is no aerospace degree programme in the country (there are engineering courses) this is better suited than a direct masters programme, which was also thought of earlier.," former Bangalore University Vice-Chancellor MS Thimmappa said. From aircraft structure and associated systems to flight navigation and from rotorcraft (helicopters) to gas turbine engine, the course will see over 17 chapters or sub-subjects that students will learn. Almost all these chapters will have four points for theory and two for practicals. In specific cases like Aviation Legislation and Human Factors, the chapters will have five points for theory, two for practicals and one point for tutorials. Former Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Chairman and Managing Director RK Tyagi said: "There is a huge potential. In the next ten years, we are looking at one aircraft being inducted every week in India only in the commercial segment. Whether it is by Airbus or Boeing I cannot say." Last year, industry experts had written to the civil aviation minister that if India exploited the market correctly the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) industry can be worth $700 million every year. Most of India's MRO's needs today are met by other South Asian countries, including Sri Lanka and Singapore. Most airlines spend nearly 15% of their revenues towards MRO and India's share in this business is only over 1%—with majority of airlines operating in India also forced to go to Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE et al. J Crasta, Chairman of CM Environs Private Limited which deals with aerospace and avionics and an executive member of industry bodies Ficci and Assocham said, pointed out that there has been a huge neglect in this field. "Imagine if even Air India is dependent on another country for its repairs. The potential is huge and the industry will be glad that the UGC is doing something to address the shortage."

Russia’s air route radar would have spotted any missile, should it have been launched at Malaysia’s flight MH17 east of the crash site, the chief of the radio-technical units of Russia’s Aerospace Force, Major-General Andrey Koban told a news briefing in Moscow on Monday. Read also Diplomat: Kiev must admit guilt for not closing airspace over area of MH17 disaster "Had the Malaysian liner been downed with a missile launched from any area east of the crash site, the Russian radar would have identified it," the general said. He pointed out that Russia’s means of impartial monitoring did not allow for making a conclusion whether a missile had been launched from territories south or west of the crash area. "Satellite images mentioned by the United States and Ukraine might have helped clear up the situation involving missile launches from the areas controlled by the Ukrainian military," he added.  The general has also emphasized that analysis of radar data shows that the missile could not have been launched at Boeing from Snezhnoye in Ukraine's Donetsk region:  "The analysis of primary radar data rejects the claims of the Ukrainian side and conclusions of the technical Dutch investigators the missile that downed the Malaysian Boeing could have been launched from an area of Snezhnoye."  The Ukrainian side has information on the air situation in the area of the MH17 crash both from civilian and military sources, Koban said, adding: "The fact that Ukraine has not made the radar data public allows making suggestions that the launch site of the missile, if this was a Buk missile, was on the territory controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces," he stressed.  Radar spotted no other aircraft east of ill-fortunate flight MH17 More news on Boeing 777 crash in Donbass © Zurab Javakhadze/TASS Those responsible for MH17 crash to be named by 2018 - Malaysia minister Half Russians believe MH17 was downed by Ukrainian military — poll Dutch embassy to hand Russia’s explanations over MH17 to Foreign Ministry Dutch ambassador in Moscow summoned to Russian Foreign Ministry over MH17 The deputy chief designer of the Utes-T air route radar, Viktor Meshcheryakov, said  Russia’s radar in the community of Ust-Donetsk recorded no other aircraft except for two civilian planes east of the ill-fortunate flight MH17 in the last moments before the Malaysian Boeing fell apart in the air over Donbass in 2014. "The radar spotted no other aircraft except for two civilian planes," he stated. The flight path of one of them had crossed that of MH17 long before the disaster, while the other at the moment of the plane’s loss was more than 30 kilometers away. "As the file is played further on up to the moment of the plane’s destruction we can see there are no other objects anywhere near the Malaysian liner," Meshcheryakov said while demonstrating the radar’s recording. "The Ust-Donetsk radar identified no other objects that might have caused the plane’s destruction," he stated. Russian defense ministry says Ukraine has something to hide It’s no coincidence that Kiev is concealing data that would allow determining the full picture of the MH17 crash in Ukraine in summer 2014, Russia’s Defense Ministry official spokesman Igor Konashenkov believes.  "It’s not by accident that the Ukrainian side is hiding data from the investigators, relatives, victims and the global community that would allow determining the full picture of the crash," Konashenkov said, reminding that the MH17 flight was controlled by the Ukrainian side. Read also Relatives of MH17 disaster victims ask Russia, Ukraine to provide radars data Kiev has not so far made public the information on location of its military surface-to-air units Buk on the day of the crash as well as the talks between flight data controllers, its radar data, the work of Ukraine’s air defense systems and evidence of witnesses, the Russian Defense Ministry's spokesman reminded.  "It is not accidental that the Ukrainian side conceals from the investigators, the relatives of victims and the world community any information that might have helped to piece together the full picture of the disaster," Konashenkov said. He recalled that Malaysia’s flight MH17 was on the screens of Ukrainian military radars. "Up to this day Kiev has not published any information concerning the whereabouts of its Buk missile systems on the day of the disaster, verbal exchanges among air traffic controllers, military ones in the first place, data from its radars, the operation of Ukrainian air defense systems and testimonies by witnesses," Konashenkvo said.  Russia will submit primary radiolocation data that disprove the conclusions on the possible rocket fire on the crashed Boeing to the Dutch side, Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman has assured:  "All the information will be handed over to Holland in due course." The Malaysian Boeing MH17, which was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, crashed over Eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board. The international commission has come to the conclusion that the aircraft was brought down by the Buk missile. The experts of the Russian arms producer Almaz-Antey have published the results of their own investigation.

Le fabricant d'armes a précisé que ce contrat n'avait jamais été intégré dans ses objectifs financiers. D'après Investor's Business Daily, ce contrat représente un montant compris entre 350 millions de dollars et plus d'1 milliard de dollars. AOF - EN SAVOIR PLUS Aéronautique - Défense Les constructeurs aéronautiques doivent affronter de nouveaux enjeux. Le Gifas souligne que l'essor des commandes nécessite une augmentation des cadences, à laquelle ont parfois du mal à répondre les équipementiers. Un surcroît d'investissements est donc crucial dans le secteur. De plus, les constructeurs doivent réduire leurs coûts pour affronter le recul de la branche aviation civile. Ainsi Boeing  prévoit de supprimer 4.500 emplois d'ici un an au sein de BCA (Boeing aviation commerciale) et il n'exclut pas d'autres réductions d'effectifs. Challengé par Airbus, le géant américain doit s'adapter. Il est également pénalisé par un dollar fort et les réductions de cadence de certains programmes. L'actualité en vidéo Réagissez !

Channel NewsAsia Return to Mobile Site Scoot and Tigerair integration: What it means for travellers News TV Premier Watch Live 0 My Playlist Sign In Menu News Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather MORE Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Live Shows News Schedule Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS Return to Mobile Site Singapore Scoot and Tigerair integration: What it means for travellers Merging Scoot and Tigerair is not a simple process, as there are many commercial and regulatory consider, CEO Lee Lik Hsin told Channel NewsAsia, but added that a decision won't take "years" to reach. By Linette Lim Posted 26 Sep 2016 19:26 Updated 26 Sep 2016 20:09 Budget airlines Scoot and Tigerair will come under a single brand by the end of 2017.  Enlarge Caption  Email More A A TOKYO, Japan: Long-haul flights to Europe, integrated transportation packages including land and sea transfers, and leveraging the Scoot-Tigerair network to move more people in and out of Southeast Asia – these are some plans Budget Aviation Holdings CEO Lee Lik Hsin has his eye on, since taking the helm four months ago. Announced in May, the integration of Singapore budget carriers Scoot and Tigerair under one holding company – Budget Aviation Holdings – is seen as a step towards an eventual merger of the two Singapore Airlines (SIA) subsidiaries. While SIA has said that the move aims to realise “commercial and operational synergies” between the two airlines, what does this translate to, in terms of benefits to travellers? CEO Lee Lik Hsin explained this, and more, to Channel NewsAsia in an exclusive interview on Monday (Sep 26). Q: It’s been four months since you took the helm at Scoot and Tigerair. What were your priorities, and are you happy with the progress? Lee Lik Hsin: The very first thing that we did was merge our reservation systems. That may sound like a backroom event, but it actually also made things more seamless for our customers. Previously… customers couldn’t buy a complete package on a Scoot and Tigerair connection. This is not so much for Singapore-based customers, but (it affected) customers in say, China, booking a Scoot flight to Singapore, and then booking a Tigerair flight to Bali or Phuket. They could buy the ticket but not the ancillaries – the baggage or the meals. So we’ve solved that now, and they can make the complete purchase in one transaction, saving them time. The other benefit is that we are able to manage our network between the two airlines. Why is this a benefit for the customer? As individual airlines we may make a decision to stop certain flights, which then mean the customer has less choice, in terms of flights. One good example is Hong Kong, where Scoot used to have just one flight, and Tigerair, three. Truth be told, the single Scoot flight was struggling, it was very difficult to sustain. Had we continue to be independent companies, Scoot probably would just have withdrawn the flight. But now we are able to substitute with a Tigerair flight instead. We are starting this later in the year, and so in terms of choice to the customer, there are still four flights to Hong Kong, from the group. Q: The integration of Scoot and Tigerair is seen as a step towards merger. When’s the soonest can you give an update? Lee: We need more time. We’ve said this from the start, ever since the announcement in May, that there are many considerations that we have to take into account, both commercial as well as regulatory. It’s not a simple process and it is our responsibility to go through the proper due diligence on every single aspect before we make any kind of decision. Q: Could this take years? Lee: I think I would safely say that it is not a very long-term objective, so – not “years”. Q: Scoot has been rapidly expanding new routes and flights in the last year or so. Which new geographies are you eyeing next? Lee: We are open to all possibilities. Our expansion is going to be fairly rapid, over the next few years. We have eight more aircraft coming into the fleet, over a period of three years – so that’s 20 aircraft in total, against the current 12 that we have. That’s a very, very high average growth rate. So we obviously will need to fly to new points in this timeframe. Our flights to Europe (starting with Athens) is basically the realisation of a dream. We started out saying we’re going to be a medium- and long-haul airline, but circumstances have restricted us to flying mainly medium-haul over the last four years or so. The introduction of the (Boeing) 787 into our fleet since 2015 and also the recent integration with Tigerair, has boosted our confidence in our ability to go long-haul. (This is) mainly because for long-haul travel, it will be very difficult to be just carrying passengers to and from a location to Singapore. This is where Tigerair’s short-haul regional network comes into play. We can now channel passengers from Europe to many, many points in Southeast Asia and vice versa. Q: Given that fares for full-service airlines are relatively affordable these days due to lower fuel costs, are you concerned about the competition on Singapore-Europe routes? Lee: We will be even more affordable. Our promotional rate for a return trip from Singapore to Athens is about S$600. Q: To better fulfil the role of moving travellers in and out of Southeast Asia, will you look into offering integrated transport packages, including land and sea transfers? Lee: We are looking to explore how we can allow our guests to seamlessly be able to book such transport options, through a single purchase, when they come onto our website. It is not directly related to the integration between Scoot and Tigerair per se. This is more (related to) partnership agreements, with possibly ferry services. But that is something that we are exploring. Q: Is this a trend among travellers, or something they would want because of the convenience? Lee: It will certainly be advantageous for us to be able to provide this. But at the same time, I think travellers today are very savvy and they can find options for themselves. So while we try to do it and make it more convenient, it’s not something that is necessarily a must-have in every single destination. Q: How do your plans tie in with the recently announced alliance between Asia-Pacific budget airlines, which Scoot and Tigerair are a part of? Lee: Basically the very first benefit of that alliance is the power of the individual airlines’ brands in their own markets. We in Scoot and Tigerair are obviously well-known in Singapore, but we’re not so well-known in the Philippines – Cebu Pacific is very well-known in the Philippines. So if we’re able to showcase our products on their website, we will gain from that strength of distribution. That’s the primary and most important aspect of the alliance. The second aspect is connectivity – being able to carry passengers from the alliance partners’ networks onto our networks. This could be a connecting flight – using Cebu again as an example – from a domestic point in the Philippines, through Manila, to Singapore. So this is more (to facilitate) connection outside of the Singapore hub.  - CNA/ll Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Greybull Capital is understood to be in discussions with Chinese firm HNA Group, the company behind Hainan Airlines, about a potential deal, with others thought to be waiting in the wings. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Monarch was forced to deny "negative speculation" over the weekend that it is in financial trouble, and sources close to the situation confirmed that the airline is in no immediate danger of going bust. A spokesman for Monarch said: "Over the weekend, there has been negative speculation about Monarch's financial health. Our flights are operating as normal, carrying Monarch passengers as scheduled. "To weather tougher market conditions and to fund its ongoing growth, Monarch expects to announce a significant investment from its stakeholders in the coming days." The spokesman added that the airline is "trading well" despite the "difficult period for the holiday industry" due to terror attacks, Brexit and the weakening of sterling. Greybull, which acquired a controlling stake in Monarch in 2014, is thought to be finalising details of a cash injection over the coming days. Part of the money is expected to go towards helping pay for a new fleet of 30 Boeing MAX 8s. The firm booked a £19.2 million pre-tax profit in the 12 months to the end of October 2015 following a £57.3 million loss a year earlier, according to accounts filed at Companies House. But aviation analyst Alex Macheras told the Press Association: "Out of all the carriers we have in the UK it wouldn't surprise me if Monarch were to declare bankruptcy, purely because we've known that they've been in such a fragile state for so long. "Even up until June, just a couple of months ago, they wanted to reiterate the fact that they are still in desperate times despite the profit that they're making." Air industry consultant John Strickland believed it is unlikely that an airline would go bust in September. He said: "It's pretty unusual that it would be in the peak summer season when traffic volumes are good, revenue flows should be pretty good and cash flows too. "It's not the depths of February when people are not going on holiday." Mr Strickland said the statement issued by Monarch "makes sense". He went on: "It has been a challenging market and it's certainly a very competitive market. "Many of the markets that they would have been active in and previously wanting to count on, like Turkey and Egypt, are now off limits because of terrorism scares." Monarch, which has its headquarters at Luton Airport, employs around 2,800 people.

The new high-wing aircraft made its first flight in February 2015 and is expected to enter service in 2018. With the launch of the KC-390, competition in the 20t air transport segment has intensified. Features of the KC-390 will be in compliance with the new National Defence Strategy and meet the needs of the FAB. The new aircraft will replace 22 Lockheed Martin C-130E/H and KC-130 that are currently a part of the FAB. Orders and deliveries National Aeronautical Enterprise Empresa Nacional de Aeronautica (ENAER) of Chile signed a contract with Embraer in August 2010 to jointly build the KC-390 aircraft for the Chilean Air Force (CAF). Approximately six KC-390 aircraft will be procured by the CAF. The Brazilian Air Force expressed its desire to acquire the KC-390 aircraft at the 47th Farnborough International Airshow held in the UK in July 2010 and signed the series production contract for the aircraft in May 2014. As part of the R$7.2bn ($3.3bn) contract, the company will supply 28 KC-395 aircraft over a period of ten years. The contract also includes a logistical support package, including spare parts and maintenance. Related Suppliers ISO Group - Spare Parts Logistics for Military Aircraft ISO Group, headquartered in West Melbourne, Florida, US, is a world leader... See all suppliers KC-390 technical details The twin-turbofan-powered KC-390 can be refuelled in flight and can be used for in-flight or on-ground refuelling of other aircraft. The new 20t jet is technically advanced and has fly-by-wire technology, which optimises mission results, thereby reducing pilot workload. It also helps increase the safety and capability for operating on short and rustic runways. "The KC-390 is a medium-weight military transport jet." The military aircraft will have a cargo bay equipped with an aft ramp similar to Hercules, and capable of transporting a wide variety of cargo (weighing up to 19t), including armoured vehicles. It will be outfitted with state-of-the-art loading and unloading systems for handling cargo. A study on the KC-390 (earlier named C-390) aircraft was presented at LAAD 2007. The research and development expenses of C-390 were $600m and shared among Embraer and various partners led by the FAB. The aircraft utilises computed air release point (CARP) technology integrated with fly-by-wire system to provide greater accuracy during air dropping, thereby reducing crew workload. The twin-engine jet-powered Embraer KC-390 also integrates the technological solutions developed for Embraer 190 commercial aircraft. It is expected to carry 84 military personnel and the cargo cabin will be configured for transporting the wounded or sick, on medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions. It will also be used for in-flight refuelling, search and rescue missions. KC-390 development The KC-390 is the largest and most complicated aircraft ever undertaken by Embraer. It will also be the Brazilian manufacturer's first new military product in more than a decade. It is expected to be assembled at Embraer's Gavião Peixoto plant in Brazil. "The KC-390 transport jet is the largest and most complicated aircraft ever undertaken by Embraer." Considering the delays in the production of Airbus A400M military airlifter and the time taken by Lockheed Martin to achieve full operational capability with the C-130J, both Embraer and its competitors say that developing KC-390 will not be easy. Although the Brazilian Government will be funding, any delay in the development would weaken Embraer's defence growth. Participation of other countries and companies in this programme is being evaluated in consultation with the FAB. FAdeA was awarded a partnership contract by Embraer Defence and Security (EDS) in April 2011 to build and supply spoilers, nose gear door, ramp door, flap fairings, tail cone and electronic cabinet. Boeing and Embraer signed an agreement to co-operate on the KC-390 aircraft programme in 2012. Rheinmetall is responsible for providing training devices for KC-390 aircraft, including cargo handling, procedure and maintenance trainers as well as flight and mission training systems. The FAB and Embraer concluded the critical design review (CDR) of the KC-390 aircraft in March 2013. The definitive aerodynamic and structural configurations, as well as the architecture and systems installations were confirmed for the immediate production of the first prototype aircraft. Avionics The avionics include two head-up displays (HUD), self-defence system and night-vision goggle (NVG). Rockwell Collins signed an agreement with EDS in May 2011 to supply its Pro Line Fusion avionics system for the aircraft. The system will render improved situational awareness and decrease the workload of the pilot. Embraer awarded a contract to BAE Systems on 27 July 2011 to supply and install flight control electronics in the KC-390 transport aircraft. Goodrich Corporation will design, build and supply primary flight control systems as part of an agreement signed with Embraer on 27 July 2011. It will supply electro-hydrostatic actuators, electro-backup hydrostatic actuators, actuator electronics and electrical controls. "The KC-390 is scheduled to enter service by 2018." Engines International Aero Engines (IAE) was chosen by Embraer on 25 July 2011 to design, develop, supply and install V2500-E5 powerplant in the KC-390 aircraft. IAE is a consortium comprising Rolls-Royce, United Technologies Unit, Pratt & Whitney and Japanese Aero Engine Corp. IAE delivered the first three prototype V2500-E5 powerplants for Embraer's new KC-390 aircraft in early 2014 and the remaining three in May of the same year. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the new engine model was granted in August 2014. Landing gear ELEB Equipamentos will design, manufacture and supply landing gear system for the aircraft as part of a contract signed with EDS in March 2011. It will build a rugged and reliable system that enables the aircraft to operate with heavy payloads and land even in semi-prepared airfields. The KC-390 will be equipped with a double chamber shocker absorber system and modern hydraulic systems. Performance The KC-390 can fly to a maximum altitude of 10,973m. Its maximum speed is 980km/h. The normal and ferry range of the aircraft are 2,590km and 6,000km respectively. The aircraft weighs around 23,600kg and its maximum take-off weight is 74,400kg.

Authorities carried boxes from a rear, upstairs apartment in the four-unit building. | Martha Bellisle/AP Martha Bellisle and Lisa Baumann | Associated Press Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter  Sign-Up OAK HARBOR, Wash. — The 20-year-old man suspected of killing five people with a rifle at a Macy’s makeup counter had a string of run-ins with the law in recent years, including charges he assaulted his stepfather. He was described by a neighbor as so “creepy, rude and obnoxious” that she kept a Taser by her front door. As investigators tried to piece together information on Arcan Cetin, who was arrested Saturday evening after a nearly 24-hour manhunt, a picture emerged of a troubled young man. Court records show more than a half-dozen criminal cases in Island County alone since 2013. Authorities said the gunman in the attack at the Cascade Mall in Burlington opened fire in the department store’s cosmetics department Friday night, killing a man and four females ranging from a teenager to a senior citizen. The killer then fled. Cetin said nothing and appeared “zombie-like” when he was taken into custody on a sidewalk outside his apartment complex about 30 miles away in Oak Harbor by a sheriff’s officer who recognized him as the suspect in the rampage, authorities said. Arcan Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor, Washington | Washington State Patrol Cetin immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey and is a legal permanent resident, officials said. As the surrounding area absorbed news of the arrest, critical questions remained, including the gunman’s motive. The FBI said early Saturday that there was no indication the shooting was terrorism, but local authorities said later in the day that they were ruling nothing out. On Sept. 17, a 20-year-old man stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall before he was shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Authorities said they are investigating the attack by Dahir Ahmed Adan as a possible act of terrorism. On Sunday, investigators searched Cetin’s vehicle and apartment complex and were seen carrying boxes from a rear, upstairs unit. The four-unit building was surrounded with yellow police tape. Detectives would not say what they found. Amber Cathey, 21, lived in an apartment next to Cetin for the past three months and said she was so frightened by him that she complained to apartment management and kept a stun gun handy. Cathey said she blocked him on Snapchat after he sent her a photo of his crotch. “He was really creepy, rude and obnoxious,” Cathey said. She said she would try to avoid him by walking the long way around to her apartment if she saw his car in the parking lot. The two were in high school together as well, and Cathey said he acted the same way then. The Seattle Times reported that court records show Cetin faced three charges of assaulting his stepfather. The newspaper said Cetin also was arrested on drunken-driving charges. It gave no details on when the arrests took place or how the cases may have been resolved. In the assault case, Cetin was told by a judge last December that he was not to possess a gun, the newspaper reported. However, the stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time.” Attempts to reach Cetin’s family for comment by phone and social media weren’t immediately successful. It wasn’t clear if Cetin had a lawyer yet. A man who came to the door Sunday morning at an Oak Harbor address believed to be where Cetin’s stepfather and mother live asked an Associated Press reporter to leave the property. On Sunday in Burlington, Washington, a security guard who works at the Cascade Mall places flowers at a makeshift memorial to the five victims killed in a shooting at the mall on Friday. | Stephen Brashear/AP Social media accounts apparently belonging to Cetin showed he had a fondness for the military and video games. A Twitter account showed, among other things, selfies, photos of him in younger years and pictures of Turkish food. He once participated in paintball and said he “can’t wait for Halo 5,” the first-person shooter video game. He also tweeted: “Shout out to the ROTC peeps.” A Facebook account showed he liked military-related sites. Cetin also appeared to have blogs on the site Tumblr that had not been updated in many months. They included seemingly random posts about serial killer Ted Bundy, a collection of selfies, the top-secret Area 51 Cold War test site and photos of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The two blogs linked back to each other and one of them linked to what appeared to be his Twitter page. Cetin took part in his high school’s ROTC program with former classmate Matthew McClimans, who described the suspect as “a pretty normal guy, but he was a little bit weird.” “Every once in a while he’d make inappropriate comments: Things that are rude or in bad taste,” McClimans said. Oak Harbor is a city of 22,000 on Whidbey Island with many military families associated with the nearby Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Hawley said he spotted Cetin Saturday from a patrol car and immediately recognized him as the suspect in the shooting rampage. “I literally hit my brakes, did a quick turn, I jumped out,” Hawley said No immediate charges were brought against Cetin, who awaited a court appearance Monday. Authorities do not plan to make the identities of the five people who died in the shooting until Tuesday, but details about three of the victims have been reported by Washington state media. Here’s what is known about them: SARAI LARA: The 16-year-old high school sophomore was the youngest victim of the gunman who opened fire in department store in the small city of Burlington. Born in Mount Vernon just south of Burlington, Lara was described by her mother Evangelina as bright, all smiles and her mother’s “right hand” at home for the family. The teen survived cancer and was told by her doctor that she was doing well, Evangelina Lara told The Seattle Times through a translator. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai Lara was proud of her heritage, her mother said. She had a wide network of friends at school and helped at home, caring for year 5-year-old sister. “It’s not fair what happened to her,” Evangelina Lara said. CHUCK EAGAN: Eagan was a longtime Boeing Co. maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, his aunt, Carol Thrush told The Seattle Times. She said Eagan and his wife were out for a dinner and shopping at the mall. They had made their way to Macy’s when the shooter opened fire. Thrush said Eagan and his wife ran, but his wife fell down as she was trying to get away. Eagan was shot as he helped his wife, Thrush said. Eagan had two daughters and three grandchildren, he said. He planned to retire from Boeing next year and hoped to travel. BELINDA GALDE: Galde, 64, was a longtime probation officer with the Skagit County District Court. The court in a statement described Galde as “an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live.” Baumann reported from Seattle. Associated Press writers Phuong Le in Burlington, Washington, Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Kimberlee Kruesi and Keith Ridler in Boise, Idaho, contributed to this report. # Washington Mall shooting Arcan Cetin Oak Harbor Washington Previously from Chicago News Three injured pit bulls turned away from city pound | Chicago Sun-Times Clock ticking for Rauner to sign $215M CPS teacher pension bill | Chicago Sun-Times Steinberg: 'History warns us . . . the best thing to do is leave' | Chicago Sun-Times Trump picks Sen.

The annual dinner marked its 25th anniversary at the Ritz-Carlton in Clayton, Mo., on September 22 at 6:30 p.m. The first Founders Day was held in conjunction with the inauguration of Chancellor Blanche M. Touhill on September 12, 1991. In 1993, Touhill shaped UMSL’s Founders Day into a week long celebration in honor of the founding of the campus. The purpose of the dinner is to honor exceptional faculty, alumni, staff, and contributors in the UMSL community. The dinner also acknowledges the anniversaries of 25-year faculty and staff members, the Chancellor’s Award for Excellence recipients, Distinguished Alumni awardees, the Auguste Chouteau Society, and Pierre Laclede Society donors. For the first time in UMSL’s history, donors Stan and Terry Freerks reached the $5 million dollar donation level to the university. In 2006, UMSL established the E. Desmond and Mary Ann Lee Medal for Philanthropy. This award was given this year to the Freerks’ for their support. They are the first UMSL alumni to receive this medal. Their donations can be seen in a variety of scholarships, the arts, capital campaigns, athletics, the College of Business, the College of Arts & Sciences, and St. Louis Public Radio, as well as helping with the reinstatement of the swimming program in 2014. Terry said, “If we were to take a pen and put, in two-inch letters, the names of all the people who have helped us through our lives and careers, we would fill up the walls of this room. Our wish is that we can help others and maybe someday, on their wall, our names will be there.” Joe Stieven, bachelor’s in finance, 1982, concluded the evening with an inspirational speech. “But equally as important as the great graduates we have, are the thousands of alumni who are leaders at every level in St. Louis and around the world,” Stieven said. “These leaders are charting new courses for success. Thus UMSL, via offering a great value in education is painting the horizon very bright and it has lots of color.” The first graduating class of UMSL, class of 1967, will be celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2017. Some of the class members were in attendance at the dinner celebrating as well. Jennifer Jezek-Taussig, associate vice chancellor for alumni engagement, introduced the Distinguished Alumni awards. Jezek-Taussig said, “I’m pleased to introduce five individuals who excel in their fields and make us all proud.

The teen survived cancer and was told by her doctor that she was doing well, Evangelina Lara told The Seattle Times through a translator. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai Lara was proud of her heritage, her mother said.

Photo: Washington State Patrol via AP FBI says it has no evidence the attack was terror-related; too early for motive, say authorities mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, September 26, 2016 SEATTLE — The authorities have arrested a Turkish-born man yesterday in connection with a deadly shooting at a mall in north-western Washington state the day before, which left five people dead including a teenage cancer survivor. Police named the suspect as Arcan Cetin, 20, a resident of the nearby town of Oak Harbor, and said he was arrested about 24 hours after the killings. The authorities, speaking at a news conference on Saturday night (US local time) said the suspect was taken into custody without incident about 6.30pm. Officials also said they had received numerous tips about the gunman and that surveillance footage had helped locate him. The Federal Bureau of Investigation office in Seattle said it had no evidence the shooting was terror-related. Charges were pending, said the authorities, who also said it was too early to say what led to the shootings. The attack at Cascade Mall in Burlington — about 105km north of Seattle — killed four women in the cosmetics section of a Macy’s department store, said the authorities. A man was critically wounded in the shooting and was taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he died. The gunman, who was armed with a rifle, left the scene before the police arrived. Officials said they recovered the weapon at the scene. They declined to give details about the weapon or to say how many rounds had been fired. Photographs of Cetin on a Myspace account showed him holding a handgun and a rifle. Sarai Lara was the youngest of the victims, at 16. The high school sophomore had survived cancer as a young girl. Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother Beatrice Dotson, 95 were also identified as victims of the killing. Another victim is believed by her family to be Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old who worked as a make-up artist at the department store. Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker was also killed. At the news conference on Saturday night, Mayor Steve Sexton of Burlington said the shooting happened at a time and in a setting that were ordinary: A Friday night at a mall. Referring to the shooting, he said: “They changed those families forever. It changed our city, I’m afraid to some extent, forever.” Security camera footage showed the man entering the mall without a weapon. Footage taken 10 minutes later showed him entering Macy’s with a rifle. At a news conference earlier on Saturday, the authorities described the tense moments after the shooting, as officers searched the roughly 440,000-square-foot mall for the attacker, finding only store employees and shoppers. Lieutenant Chris Cammock, the commander of the multi-agency response team conducting the investigation told The Seattle Times that Cetin has not been charged and would be booked into the Skagit County Jail. He also said the detectives do not know whether Cetin had a connection with any of the victims and had asked members of the public to continue to stay away from the shopping mall. The FBI said that it had “no information to suggest that additional attacks” were planned in Washington State, and that it was coordinating intelligence efforts with the local authorities. More than 200 officers from at least 26 agencies responded to the shooting, said the authorities. One woman, Ms Tari Caswell, told The Skagit Valley Herald that she had been in the Macy’s women’s dressing room when she heard four loud pops, followed by seven or eight more. “I just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didn’t feel right,” she said. “And it got very quiet. And then I heard a lady yelling for help, and a man came and got me and another lady, and we ran out of the store.” The attack was the seventh time this year in which at least four people were killed in a shooting in Washington, according to The Seattle Times. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most World READ COMMENTED ‘Zombie’ birds fall from sky in Moscow ‘You’re fat’ card prompts London police action ‘Wrong way down the highway’ driver arrested after US crash that killed six ‘Worse than loan sharks’, Pua says of 1MDB paying US$993m for US$3.5b bond guarantee ‘World’s longest flight’ lands in Auckland ‘Post-truth’ named Oxford Dictionaries word of the year ‘Depressed’ De Niro backs anti-Trump protests Zuckerberg sure fake news on Facebook did not sway election Zimbabwean anti-government activists shot at, beaten, abducted Zimbabwe's army chief says military has no role in Mugabe successor Zimbabwe court drops charges against hunter who helped kill Cecil the lion Yemeni government says not interested in Kerry's truce announcement Yemen's Houthis say they want to end war, form unity government Yemen air strike kills 14 in attack on fuel trucks: medics, residents Year-old Paris attack probe sights new suspect, but mastermind elusive Inside Today World Social media’s globe-shaking power Former U.N. chief 'deeply concerned' as Myanmar violence toll jumps U.N. council extends inquiry into Syria toxic gas attacks Tensions boil over in overcrowded Greek migrant camp Danish bishop’s 300-year-old poo offers whiff of history Business Trump opens doors for China in Latin America: Bloomberg View Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online Fantasy sports arch rivals DraftKings, FanDuel to merge Wall St. opens flat, indexes near record highs Exclusive: Glencore seeks $550 million to raise stakes in Kurdish oil game Sports Joseph Schooling is home, as packed week awaits From football’s whipping boys to regional heavyweights NZ surprises by hiring Scotsman as sevens coach Experienced defence the key in Lions’ Suzuki Cup bid Want to stay happy and positive?

November 18, 2016 0400 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:169292 Publish Date: Sun, 25 Sep 2016 22:21:40 GMT Service: Iran US air force renewing nukes keep up with China, Russia The US Air Force plans to spend billions of dollars to replace its aging arsenal of intercontinental nuclear missiles in order to keep up with Russia and China, a military official says. The force has nearly 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) mostly of the Minuteman family which were first designed in 1960s, American website Military.com reported Sunday. The decades-old missiles have reportedly been kept in silos built in the 1950s and are difficult to maintain due to a lack of replacement parts. “The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans are upgrading all of their systems,” an Air Force official told AFP on condition of anonymity. “They are upgrading all of their legs of the triad -- in that environment, I am not sure it makes sense" to do nothing, the official added. The air force has set aside an $86 billion budget to design a new missile known as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) which is said to have a 50-year life-cycle. The first GBSD is expected to enter service in late 2020s and the rest will be deployed in the following decade. Initial requests for proposals on the nuclear renewal were issued in July, when the air force asked major weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing to put forth their plans. ICBMs are only one part of America’s nuclear “triad,” which also includes submarines and bombers. Altogether, the Pentagon has planned to spend $1 trillion to overhaul its three-pronged nuclear attack force over the next 30 years. The extravagant approach has elicited bipartisan attacks among American politicians, who question the program’s feasibility. "We flat can't afford it. And from a priorities standpoint, it's the wrong priority in the world that we face," Democratic Representative Adam Smith told a forum in Washington last week. He said countries like China and Russia can boast a "spectacular deterrent" with far fewer nuclear warheads. “What they have is enough to say 'Don't screw with us, or we will obliterate you,'” he said, adding that in case of a major nuclear fight, “we're pretty much all toast anyways.”     KeyWords US air force Russia   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Japan beats Iran at Asian water polo meet Iran’s Emami wins stage 1 of Tour of Fuzhou Iranians snatch silver, bronze at World Taekwondo Junior Championships Iran beats Saudi Arabia in India oil supply drive OPEC moves closer to output deal as Iran gets new offer Tremor shakes western Iran Norway’s DNO to study key Iranian oil field Saudi-proposed anti-Syria resolution rewarding terror sponsors: Iran Iran rejects 'baseless' claims by Arab states Iran warns against Israel’s bid to erase al-Quds Islamic identity Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0757 sec

When he got on stage, that was his time’ Half a century after his big brother arrived in London to begin his short career, Leon Hendrix reflects on Jimi’s life and music Leon Hendrix sitting in the flat in which his brother, Jimi, first lived when he moved to London 50 years ago.

But of course, this is Leon Hendrix, the younger brother of the greatest guitarist of all time, and in London this weekend, 50 years since Jimi arrived in Britain in 1966 to launch his astonishing career. When Jimi Hendrix came to London, he changed the sound of music for ever Read more Leon Hendrix bounded up the stairs of the house in Brook Street, London W1 – which George Frideric Handel had also occupied two centuries earlier – to the top flat in which Jimi lived in 1968 and 69. It is now beautifully decked out to look exactly as it was, a museum and music centre called Handel & Hendrix in London, where Hendrix’s Little Wing is played on the harpsichord in Handel’s music room. Later on Saturday evening, Leon – born six years after Jimi – picked up his own guitar to play his brother’s, and his own, music at the Scotch of St James, the London club where Jimi had played. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Left to right, John Campbell, Daphne Guinness, Leon Hendrix, Mark Arnold and Kevin O’Grady at the Scotch of St James. Photograph: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images Leon is slender, intense, and enjoys the inevitable conversation about his brother rather than himself, in the room which Jimi called “the first real home of my own”. Everyone knows the Hendrix childhood was hardly that of a model family – a mother who left, and a father who drank more than he cared. “But Jimi looked after me,” recalls Leon. “For some reason, I never missed a meal. He looked out for me like an elder-brother-father; he made me what you English call ‘tea’ and made sure I was OK. And sometimes, we used to sneak off to Mom’s for dinner.” But where did the music come from? “It’s called inspiration,” says Leon, almost scolding. “As in ‘spirit’, as in ‘in-spirit-ation’. It’s in the wind. I was there when Jimi was a boy, and he’d play with a broom, his first guitar. And Pa would come home and see the straw and shit from the broom on the floor, because Jimi’d been doing acrobatics with his his broom-guitar, and Jimi’d get a whuppin’.” Jimi Hendrix's former London flat to open as a museum Read more According to Leon’s book, Jimi Hendrix: A Brother’s Story, Jimi’s first real instrument was a ukulele the boys found while cleaning out a neighbour’s garage. When he finally got a guitar, Jimi, says Leon, “used to take gold tassels from his Pa’s empty Seagrams 7 bottles and tie them to it. “But the music came from nowhere,” he says. “Music has no body, and I remember when Jimi was playing, he’d try to conjure up the sound with his fingers – where is it?” Once, “when we were little, Jimi took a radio apart, trying to find the music inside it. We lost the screwdriver behind the sofa and couldn’t put it back together, and that was another whuppin’.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kathy Etchingham, the former girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix, posing for photographs in his former bedroom, now a museum. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images Leon says, poignantly, of Hendrix’s soft vocal timbre: “It came from always being told to shut up as a kid. Jimi went inside with his music, and when he got on stage, that was his time”. There is genetic lineage, it turns out, as Leon imparts some new information “My mother’s grandfather was a musician. He was black, but looked so white he was allowed to play, down in Louisiana. He played orchestral music in the 1800s.” However, “my own children want nothing to do with music, they’ve seen what it did to us. My daughter’s in Mexico and my son wants to be a scientist, or a doctor. But I’ve got these grandchildren – and they’re mighty interested. ‘Hey, grandpa, play us that music by uncle Jimi!’ “But in one way”, reflects Leon, “Jimi’s just my brother. When I was little, I thought what he was doing was ordinary stuff. I didn’t even know we were poor, it was just life in the projects.” He remembers Jimi taking him to see Buster Crabbe in 15-minute Flash Gordon films, for a nickel – “that was Jimi’s nickname: ‘Buster’”. Leon has had an interesting life: taken into care at a foster home – where Jimi would visit him – short periods in jail for minor offences, drug problems for which he was successfully treated, and being taken on tour with his brother, during which he got “a share in the chicks backstage”. An accomplished artist, Leon went on to work with the Boeing aerospace company as an expert technical draughtsman. “I thought I was going to be drawing airplanes like Jimi taught me”, he says, “but it was nothing like that. You draw this bolt, or this nut and off it goes to some department and into a bit of machinery. So I quit.” Jimi Hendrix estate sues for return of guitar worth up to $1m Read more Leon was left out of his father Al’s will when he died in 2002, the estate going to Al’s adopted daughter in another marriage, Janie. Leon has initiated serial court cases staking a claim to his brother’s music, as far as the US Supreme Court, which upheld the will. However, another ruling in 2011 granted Leon “rights to his brother’s name and likeness” – though not his music – and there was an undisclosed settlement in 2015. Although the overall loser in this bitter and often sordid battle, Leon says, in his brother’s old flat: “It’s their problem. They’ve made their billions, but I’m happy. I am my brothers brother. So who’s the richest?” Leon launched his musical career “after the age of 50”, he explains, “and it got going after I separated from my Catholic-bird wife”. As the Leon Hendrix Band, he has released two albums, with another on the way, but for this special night at the Scotch, he joins other musicians from a band called Are You Experienced, whose lead guitarist, John Campbell from Birmingham, is not so much a cover or tribute artist as a devotee, says Leon, “whose antennae found my brother’s spirit”. Hendrix, The Who, and others played the Scotch back in the day, and on Saturday night Handel & Hendrix in London booked the now upscale nightclub for a special early-evening commemorative shift. “Let’s play it for Jimi,” said Campbell in broad Brummie, wearing the trademark military parade jacket and an orange sash around his head, launching into Machine Gun and Star Spangled Banner as appropriated by Hendrix. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Campbell and Leon Hendrix performing at the Scotch. Photograph: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images Leon introduced Bob Dylan’s All Along the Watchtower, saying: “Dylan picked up me and my Pa in his limousine, and called this one the song Jimi wrote!” Leon had some trouble remembering the lyrics, apologised, “Sorry Jimi” and confided to his audience: “I like to drink Jack Daniel’s.” So what, they said in the forgiving, happy crowd, it’s Jimi’s brother. Leon had said back at his brother’s flat: “I just move with the spirit, man – where it takes me, I go, and Jimi’s there. He’s my brother and he’s still lookin’ out for me.” And now, at the end of the evening: “God bless you Jimi, for all the times you sent me round the world, following the spirit.” Hendrix wrote his greatest ballad, Angel, for his mother, of whom he saw little. And of course, this was Leon’s mother too, of whom he saw even less. Which made for a cogent solo in Campbell’s rendering, during which Leon took his hands from his own rhythm guitar, removed his glasses and wiped a tear from his eye.

Courtesy of Kohl Children's Museum   By Samantha Nelson Daily Herald Correspondent Fall is here, bringing with it cooler and more unpredictable weather. Luckily these five local museums are helping ease the transition with new exhibits to give you ways to spend the day indoors. 'SpotHero Car Garage' Kohl Children's Museum, 2100 Patriot Blvd., Glenview, (847) 832-6600, kohlchildrensmuseum.org/ Hours: 9:30 a.m. to noon Monday, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday Admission: $12; $11 for seniors This month, the museum debuted "SpotHero Car Garage," a new version of its permanent "Car Care" exhibit. It not only keeps some of the most popular elements of the original, such as a car wash, pretend car and car ramp, but also adds space for kids to design and test their own cars. Or kids can take on the role of mechanic by checking a vehicle's engine and tires. The new exhibit has extra play cars so kids don't have to wait as long for a turn. Plus, the added components reinforce the museum's focus on science and technology and teaching kids to work together through pretend play. "The car exhibit was very, very popular," said Stephanie Bynum, vice president of programs for Kohl Children's Museum. "(It's) the first exhibit that you see when you come into the museum, and it was a good time to give it a facelift and add some improvements to it," From Wednesday, Sept. 28, to Dec. 30, kids can also visit "Animal Secrets," an exhibit developed by the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry that lets them pretend to be naturalists. They can explore woodlands, a meadow, a stream and a cave, all while learning about the animals that live there such as bats, bears, deer and chipmunks.   Kohl Children's Museum has added extra play cars to its new "SpotHero Car Garage" exhibit so more kids can get in on the action at once. - Courtesy of Kohl Children's Museum "It's a very immersive environment that really lets children connect with nature at a time of year when it's harder to connect with nature as the weather gets colder," Bynum said. "It actually is a great exhibit in the Midwest because there are animals the children will recognize as they're out on nature hikes."   The Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center's new exhibit, "Women Hold Up Half the Sky," highlights the struggles women face in other countries and at home. Here, women enrolled in Women for Women International's programs in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo try to better their situation. - Courtesy of Les Stone 'Women Hold Up Half the Sky' Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center, 9603 Woods Drive, Skokie, (847) 967-4800, ilholocaustmuseum.org/ Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday through Wednesday; 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, from Sunday, Sept. 25, to Jan. 22 Admission: $12; $8 for seniors and students; $6 for kids 5-11 Based on the book "Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide" by Pulitzer Prize-winning authors Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, the exhibit "Women Hold Up Half the Sky" (co-presented by YWCA Evanston/North Shore) explores the challenges women face in the developing world and close to home. Focusing on maternal mortality, sex-trafficking and gender-based violence, the exhibit shares stories of women from around the world. It also highlights the organizations and people who are working to help them such as a victim of human trafficking who became one of the board members of the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation. "One of our driving principles is that we want to educate people about the lessons of the Holocaust and how they relate to the present day," said Shoshana Buchholz-Miller, vice president of education and exhibitions for the Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center. "We want to shine a light on issues of oppression and inequality and atrocity and genocide in other places. We want to focus on women and girls and the inequity they experience, and how we, as a society, benefit when they have more opportunity."   Saima Muhammad's daughter Javaria is in school and ranked first in her class. Her father, once disdainful of girls, now says, "Girls are just as good as boys." Learn more about challenges women face in the developing world in the Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center's new exhibit, "Women Hold Up Half the Sky." - Courtesy of Nicholas D. Kristof The exhibit also provides opportunities for visitors to make a difference. It can be by sending postcards to their senator about legislation supporting victims of domestic violence, sharing what they've learned on social media, and giving money or time to help local organizations. "We really want people to look at this as an opportunity to be inspired to take action," Buchholz-Miller said.   Elmhurst Art Museum's "Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art" features artist Claire Ashley's "Thing Two." - Courtesy of Galleri Urbane Marfa + Dallas, Texas 'Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art' Elmhurst Art Museum, 150 Cottage Hill Ave., Elmhurst, (630) 834-0202, elmhurstartmuseum.org/ Hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday and Sunday; 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday, now through Nov. 27 Admission: $8; $7 for seniors; free for students and kids younger than 18 See the Midwest premiere of "Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art," which came to Elmhurst from California's Bedford Gallery. The exhibit shows how using air allows artists to create huge sculptures like Lewis deSoto's nearly 30-foot-long and 6.5-foot-tall self-portrait "Paranirvana" and Patrick Flibotte's 18-foot-tall superheroes. There will even be a life-size white elephant on display in the Mies van der Rohe McCormick House. "These are things that you could not explore three dimensionally with any other media," said Elmhurst Art Museum executive director Jenny Gibbs. "If you did it, it would be impossible to move it."   Billie G. Lynn's "White Elephant 1" makes an impression at Elmhurst Art Museum's "Blow Up: Inflatable Contemporary Art" exhibit. - Courtesy of the Elmhurst Art Museum The local version of the exhibit boasts an expanded version of Oak Park artist and School of the Art Institute of Chicago adjunct professor Claire Ashley's installation, with one of the museum's three galleries devoted to her work. "When people think of inflatables, you think of mass-produced vinyl, but she sews hers and they're made of children's backpacks," Gibbs said. "And she's a painter, so I think of these as her 3-D paintings. She's been on my radar for a while, so I'm really happy to have a chance to work with her."   The Museum of Science and Industry's new interactive "Above and Beyond" exhibit allows visitors to explore innovations in aerospace technology. - courtesy of the Museum of Science and Industry 'Above and Beyond' Museum of Science and Industry, 5700 S. Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, (773) 684-1414, msichicago.org/ Hours: 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily Oct. 4 to Jan. 8 Admission: $18; $11 for kids 3-11 Fly like a bird. Or just learn to appreciate the science behind flight at the museum's new interactive "Above and Beyond" exhibit. Presented by Boeing in honor of its 100th anniversary, the exhibit starts by sharing the technology that allowed for the first powered flights. It then explores new innovations and research in aviation and aerospace, from motion-sensing technology that simulates the flight of a flock of birds to an elevator that can take people from Earth to the edge of space. Visitors can create and race their own supersonic fighter jets and learn about ways to fly faster and higher. The exhibit also features a mosaic created by Chicago teens depicting the city's skyline and the past, present and future of Boeing aircraft. 'Drawing on Tradition' and 'Full Circle' The Field Museum, 1400 S. Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, (312) 922-9410, fieldmuseum.org/ Hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily Oct. 29 to Jan. 13 Admission: $29; $25 for students and seniors; $20 for kids The Field Museum has thousands of artifacts in its permanent Native American galleries. Soon, visitors can view the work of two contemporary Native American artists in the exhibits "Drawing on Tradition: Kanza Artist Chris Pappan" and "Full Circle/Omani Wakan: Lakota Artist Rhonda Holy Bear." Pappan provides a modern version of the ledgers Native American artists drew on in the 19th century when the buffalo hide they traditionally used for art became scarce. Some of his portrait work has also been made into decals that will be added to display cases within the museum's Native American hall. Meanwhile, Holy Bear uses intricately carved and beaded figures to depict 19th-century Plains life. Her work will be displayed alongside objects from the museum's collection that inspired her.

At a news conference, officials said they had not ruled out any possible motives for why 20-year-old Arcan Cetin allegedly shot four women and one man at the Cascade Mall in Burlington Friday evening.   Island County Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Hawley told reporters that he spotted Cetin near the suspect’s home in Oak Harbor, around 30 miles due west of the mall. Hawley said he immediately recognized Cetin as the suspect, turned his patrol car around and arrested Cetin without incident. “He said nothing,” said Hawley, who added that Cetin was unarmed and carrying a computer in a satchel when he was apprehended. “He was kind of zombie-like.” Mount Vernon Police Lt. Chris Cammock said Cetin had immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey and was a “legal permanent resident.” It was not immediately clear when Cetin came to the U.S. Hawley said Cetin had been arrested for simple assault last year, but provided no further details on the case. The Seattle Times reported that Cetin faced three domestic violence assault charges in both Burlington and Island County, with the victim identified as Cetin’s stepfather. The newspaper reports Cetin also was arrested for drunken driving. Court records show Cetin was told by a judge on Dec. 29 that he was not to possess a firearm, the newspaper reported. However, the stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time.” Cetin was arrested almost exactly 24 hours after his alleged victims were shot at the mall Macy’s makeup counter. The four female victims died in the store. The male victim died early Saturday as police finished sweeping the 434,000-square-foot building. Local media outlets had identified the victims as of early Sunday. One was 16-year-old Sarai Lara, a cancer survivor and high school sophomore. Her mother, Evangelina, told the Seattle Times that through a translator that she was shopping with Sarai and her younger sister, but they split up. She said Sarai went to Macy’s looking for pants. News of the shooting spread through the mall, and Lara tried to get to her daughter but was unable to do so. KIRO-TV identified two more victims as Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, 95-year-old Beatrice Dotson. The Seattle Times identified the other two victims as Macy’s makeup artist Shyla Martin, 52, and Chuck Eagan, a Boeing maintenance worker who was shot while helping his wife flee the store. “There are people waking up this morning, and their world has changed forever. The city of Burlington has probably changed forever, but I don’t think our way of life needs to change,” Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said earlier Saturday. “This was a senseless act. It was the world knocking on our doorstep, and it came into our little community.” Surveillance video captured the suspect entering the mall unarmed and then recorded him about 10 minutes later entering the Macy’s with a “hunting type” rifle in his hand, Cammock said. The lieutenant said late Saturday that the rifle was apparently brought into the mall from a suspect vehicle. The weapon was recovered at the scene. “Probably one of the most difficult moments for us last night was knowing that there were family members wondering about their loved ones in there,” Cammock said. Burlington, a community of 8,600 people, is about 65 miles north of Seattle, too far to be a commuter town, but its population swells to 55,000 during the day because of a popular outlet mall, retail stores and other businesses. Burlington is the only major retail center within 30 miles in a region where agriculture is king, said Linda Jones, president of the Burlington Chamber of Commerce. Residents gathered Saturday to comfort each other at a community gathering in a city park. “It’s too scary. It’s too close to home,” said Maria Elena Vasquez, who attended the gathering with her husband and two young children. Joanne Burkholder, 19, of Mount Vernon, was watching the movie “The Magnificent Seven” in the mall’s theater when security guards came in and told them to evacuate immediately. Dozens of panicked moviegoers gathered in the hallway, and Burkholder heard screaming as the officers escorted them to safety in a parking lot. As she drove home later, she had to pull over because she was shaking so hard, she told The Associated Press. “I’m just very thankful for my life this morning. I’ve never been so terrified in my life,” she said Saturday, trying to hold back tears as she attended the community vigil. “You’d think it would happen in Everett or Seattle, but a small town of Burlington, I’d never dream something like this would happen.” People who believed they may have lost loved ones were being sequestered at a church three blocks from the mall, where counselors and a golden retriever therapy dog were present. Dozens of people attended a Saturday evening prayer service for the victims. The gathering was held at Central United Methodist Church in nearby Sedro-Woolley, Wash. The Rev.

How did he get to the mall and how did he get back ‘near the suspect’s home’? How did the police know who he was and where he lived so fast? Especially when they said they were looking for a hispanic man! WHAT??? Island County Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Hawley told reporters that he spotted Cetin near the suspect’s home in Oak Harbor, around 30 miles due west of the mall. Hawley said he immediately recognized Cetin as the suspect, turned his patrol car around and arrested Cetin without incident. “He said nothing,” said Hawley, who added that Cetin was unarmed and carrying a computer in a satchel when he was apprehended. “He was kind of zombie-like.” How much you want to bet they tell us that the computer has all kinds of jihadi rhetoric and a manifesto as well. They have already shown us he put pictures of himself with guns on social media….sound familiar? This stinks to high heaven as a gov’t op.

More Tech Uber wants to fly you to your destination in a drone By Lee Mathews 09.26.2016 :: 2:17PM EST Tap a button on you screen and a four-wheeled Uber will come and drive you to your destination. In a few years, however, they may take to the sky after you step inside. Uber’s chief product officer Jeff Holden sat down with Recode’s Kara Swisher at the Nantucket Conference this week. During their chat, he told her that the company is looking into VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft to provide lifts to Uber customers. Uber has made no secret about their desire to start using driverless cars. They’ve been pushing in that direction for quite some time and recently launched a pilot project — a fleet of autonomous Ford Fusions — in Pittsburgh. Uber is not the only company out there looking to the skies for ways to revolutionize transportation. China’s Ehang showed off an advanced prototype earlier this year (that’s it pictured at the top of this post), and it looks very similar to the type of vehicle that Holland was talking about on stage. The eHang 184 has a range of about 10 miles, which would be plenty to accomplish a goal Holden mentioned — getting from Oakland to San Francisco. Right now, a bus can get you there in 10 minutes or so, and the eHang should be able to match that while transporting you in solitary bliss. Other companies are working on similar drones. Airbus has been for quite some time, and you’d have to assume that competitors like Boeing and Bombardier are, too. The sooner they make drone taxis a reality, the sooner Uber can start offering to fly you to your destination while all the luddites on the ground are stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Arcan Cetin stood calmly before a Skagit County District Court judge and said he understood the charges, each of which carries a minimum of 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $2 million. The packed courthouse about 60 miles north of Seattle included tearful family members of some of the victims. Cetin’s mother was visibly distraught. Cetin admitted to the shooting to detectives, according to court documents released Monday by the Skagit County Superior Court. Authorities said they had uncovered no motive for the Friday evening attack in Burlington. When investigators interviewed Cetin’s stepfather, David Marshall, about his son’s whereabouts, he told them he had dinner with Cetin earlier on Friday and also discovered that his Ruger rifle and ammunition were missing, according to court documents. Advertisement Continue reading “The only thing that we want to say at this time is that we both are totally devastated by what happened,” Marshall told reporters after the hearing. He said that Cetin had unspecified mental health problems. According to documents, detectives said surveillance video showed it took Cetin only about one minute to shoot all five victims – a teenage girl near some clothing racks, then four adults in the makeup department. After the shooting, Cetin left the Ruger rifle with a 25-round magazine on top of a cosmetics counter, then fled the mall in a vehicle, the documents said. A legal permanent resident of the United States who immigrated to this county as a young child from Adana, Turkey, Cetin graduated last year from high school in Oak Harbor, a rural community in western Washington about 30 miles from the mall where he is accused of opening fire. Sheriff’s deputies apprehended him Saturday evening as he was walking on a sidewalk hear his home, carrying a satchel with a computer inside. Oak Harbor is a military town on Whidbey Island, reached by bridge or ferry, where visitors are welcomed by two radar-jamming EA-6B Prowler aircraft. Gung-ho locals call the constant roar of Navy aircraft “the sound of freedom.” The manager at Anchor Pointe Apartments, where Cetin lived, said owners had told her not to talk about their tenant. “I’m as clueless as everyone else,” she said. His apartment on the second floor has a porch with an orange and brown lounger, a coffee cup with yellow tulips and a big red daisy clipped to the deck. His mother and stepfather help pay the rent, she told investigators, according to the criminal complaint, and had visited him there on Wednesday. Court records indicate a string of charges in which he’s accused of assaulting his stepfather and court requests for mental-health evaluations, as well as court requests for substance-abuse evaluations. It is not clear from the records how the cases were resolved. Advertisement Continue reading A Navy base spokesman confirmed to The Washington Post that Cetin worked at the commissary on the base between 2012 and 2013 when he was in high school. The spokesman said Cetin was a dependent of a Navy retiree but did not specify who that was. Because of that, he said, Cetin also had a dependent’s identification card that allowed him access to various facilities at the Naval base, including the gym, which Cetin used. Friends and neighbors described a young man who had gotten in trouble with the law several times, with three assault charges since 2015. Several of Cetin’s former classmates described him as a socially awkward teenager who later was given to inappropriately touching female students. Mehmet Ecder, an 18-year-old high school student who grew up with Cetin in Amana, Turkey, said Cetin came from a troubled family and was struggling to connect with American girls after he moved to Washington state. He liked living in the United States, but, “He says, ‘American girls hate me,’ ” Ecder said in an interview from Turkey. Cetin had mentioned a young woman who had rejected him, Ecder said. “He says he doesn’t know how to talk to girls,” said Ecder. Cetin is Muslim, said Ecder, but was never particularly observant. Arcan apparently worked at the Wendy’s on base. Taylair Graham, 16, said Monday that was quiet, “but he wasn’t really all there.” Bryce Atwood, 16, has a cousin who works with him at Wendy’s. Of Arcan, he said, “He was a pretty chill guy, and then he decided to just go . . . shoot up a mall.” — The Washington Post’s Abigail Haulohner, Julie Tate and Alice Crites contributed to this report. shooting-macys-1stld-writethru Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Police: Washington shooting suspect 'zombie-like' at arrest – Sep 25, 2016 Mall shooting suspect: 'Creepy,' multiple arrests, disputes – Sep 25, 2016 Police: Mall shooting suspect confessed, shot 5 in 1 minute – Sep 26, 2016 Things to Know about deadly shootings at mall in Washington – Sep 26, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Washington mall shooting suspect to face 5 murder charges Steph Solis, and Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY Sunday, 25-Sep-16 06:15:58 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest The man accused of fatally shooting five people at a mall in Burlington, Wash., was held without bond Sunday and faces five counts of first-degree murder, according to jail records. The suspect, Arcan Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor, Wash., was arrested Saturday night in Oak Harbor, about 29 miles southwest of Burlington, after a manhunt that lasted more than 20 hours. Cetin had not been formally charged in connection with the killings Friday night at Macy's inside the mall. Tips from the public helped police arrest Cetin after officials distributed blurry photos of the suspect. The suspect, who immigrated from Turkey with his family, "is a legal, permanent resident of the United States," said Lt. Chris Cammock of the Mount Vernon Police Department. No evidence pointed to terrorism, Michael Knutson, assistant special agent in charge of the Seattle FBI, said at a news conference late Saturday. Authorities suspect Cetin was the only gunman. The motive for  the shooting that killed four women and a man remained unclear. Cetin's ex-girlfriend used to work at the store but hasn't in several months and lives in another county. KING-TV, Seattle, reported that Cetin possessed three guns Friday night, all legally purchased, but Cetin stole them from a family member. The weapon used Friday night was a .22 Ruger, according to law enforcement, KING reported. Cetin has a criminal record that includes three assault charges related to domestic violence, his stepfather being the victim, the Seattle Times reported. Cetin also  was arrested on a drunken driving charge, the Times said. A judge told Cetin on Dec. 29 that he could not possess a firearm, according to the Times. His stepfather convinced the judge not to impose a no-contact order. He said his stepson was "going through a hard time." Lt. Mike Hawley of the Island County Sheriff's Office said deputies spotted Cetin's car near their office in Oak Harbor Saturday night, but no one was inside. “I saw an individual walking northbound on the sidewalk, and I instantly recognized that this is the person that I just viewed on my computer,” Hawley said. "He said nothing," Hawley said. "He was kind of zombie-like." More on the mall shooting:  What we know about Arcan Cetin, Washington state mall shooting suspect City ‘changed forever’ as police hunt gunman Washington mall shooting suspect Arcan Cetin was 'zombie-like' during arrest Raw video from the scene of the deadly shooting at mall in Washington state Surveillance footage from the mall shows the suspect entering the building late Friday without a weapon but walking into Macy's 10 minutes later with what appeared to be a hunting rifle. He fired in the makeup area, then fled on foot out of range of cameras. One of the victims was a 16-year-old girl who beat cancer, the Seattle Times and KOMO-TV reported. Sarai Lara was shopping for pants with her younger sister, her mother, Evangelina Lara, told the Times through a translator. They got split up. Belinda Galde and Beatrice Dotson, a mother and daughter, both died in the cosmetics section of the Macy's department store where the shooting occurred. Authorities say Galde was a probation officer. The Snohomish County District Court in a statement identified Belinda Galde as an employee with the court since 1989, the Associated Press reported. The statement says the 64-year-old Galde "was an amazingly kind and caring individual" who helped thousands of probationers find a better way to live. The Seattle Times reported other victims were Shayla Martin, 52, a Macy's employee, and Chuck Eagan, a Boeing employee who was just about to retire. Eagan and his wife began running when the shooter opened fire. His wife fell down. Eagan stopped to help her, and was shot. In a press conference Saturday night, Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said the five victims did what any other Burlington resident could have done on a Friday night — they went to the mall. "That was us in that mall last night," Sexton said. "Any one of us at any time."

Hammett and Amy R. Connolly   |   Sept. 25, 2016 at 10:04 AM Follow @upi Comments 1 of 2 BURLINGTON, Wash., Sept. 25 (UPI) -- A 20-year-old man who was found wandering the streets in a "zombie-like" state is being held on five counts of first-degree murder in the shootings death of five people at a Washington mall. Arcan Cetin is being held on no bail. He was turned over to the Skagit County Sheriff's Office, Island County authorities confirmed. Authorities have yet to identify a motive, said Sgt. Mark Francis of the Washington State Patrol. Cetin, booked in to the Skagit County Jail, will likely make his first court appearance on Monday. His family is cooperating with police, officials said. Using surveillance video and tips from the public, the Oak Harbor, Wa., man was arrested after authorities spotted him walking along a street, the Seattle Times reported. It was the result of a 20-hour manhunt. RELATEDMassive manhunt underway for Seattle-area mall shooter who killed 5 The shooter can be seen on surveillance video walking in to the mall Friday night unarmed about 10 minutes before the shooting, KOMO.com reported. Police believe he went back to the car to retrieve a rifle. Police and emergency medical personnel responded quickly, bringing bomb-sniffing dogs and a helicopter to surround the mall, but the suspect had already fled on foot. He was first reported to be a Hispanic male. The shootings occurred just before 7 p.m. local time Friday at the mall, about 65 miles north of Seattle -- and just 45 miles south of the U.S.-Canada border. When Cetin was spotted Saturday, police moved in. "As we were driving by, I see the fella walking across the street and I go, 'Oh, that's him,'" said Lt. Mike Hawley, of the Island County Sheriff's Office. "So, I whipped a real quick U-turn and hit the lights, pulled my gun and he was under arrest." Hawlin said Cetin was almost "like a zombie," and was unarmed. "I said, 'you're under arrest' and he didn't say much -- well, he didn't say anything at all," Hawley said. "He was carrying a little leather satchel with a computer in it and that's about it. He didn't say much at all." Cetin has a record of domestic violence against his step father and was told by a judge in December 2015 not to possess a firearm. He emigrated to the United States from Turkey when he was a child and was a local high school graduate, The youngest of the mall shooting victims, Sarai Lara, was 16. The Mount Vernon High School sophomore, known as a happy, responsible student who had survived cancer as a young girl, was shopping at the mall with her mother, Evangelina Lara, and a younger sister. They split up to go to different stores. Sarai went to Macy's, then the shooting occurred. Her mother said she tried to get to Sarai, but was blocked from entering the shooting scene. "I never expected this to happen to someone that I knew and that I cared about," said Sarai Lara's friend, Rachel Marsh. A family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, Beatrice Dotson, 95, also as shooting victims. Galde, a longtime probation officer, was remembered as a caring person. "She was an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live.," the Skagit County court said in a statement. Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old Macy's makeup artist, also was shot. Karen Van Horn, Martin's sister who is an employee at The Herald in Everett, described her as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. "She was so sweet," Van Horn said.. "She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn't want to rely on anyone else." Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, was also a victim, according to his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife had gone out to dinner and to the mall to shop and had made their way to Macy's when the shooter began his rampage. Thrush said Eagan and his wife began running, but his wife fell down as the two tried to get away. When Eagan stopped to help his wife, he was shot, Thrush said. People in the area gathered Saturday to mourn the victims. About 50 mourners gathered at Central United Methodist Church in Sedro-Woolley to pray. Pastor Cody Natland lit a candle for each of the five killed, then invited congregants to call out prayers to the people they were thinking about.

The shootings occurred just before 7 p.m. local time Friday at the mall, about 65 miles north of Seattle -- and just 45 miles south of the U.S.-Canada border. When Cetin was spotted Saturday, police moved in. "As we were driving by, I see the fella walking across the street and I go, 'Oh, that's him,'" said Lt. Mike Hawley, of the Island County Sheriff's Office. "So, I whipped a real quick U-turn and hit the lights, pulled my gun and he was under arrest." Hawlin said Cetin was almost "like a zombie," and was unarmed. "I said, 'you're under arrest' and he didn't say much -- well, he didn't say anything at all," Hawley said. "He was carrying a little leather satchel with a computer in it and that's about it. He didn't say much at all." Cetin has a record of domestic violence against his step father and was told by a judge in December 2015 not to possess a firearm. He emigrated to the United States from Turkey when he was a child and was a local high school graduate, The youngest of the mall shooting victims, Sarai Lara, was 16.

"I never expected this to happen to someone that I knew and that I cared about," said Sarai Lara's friend, Rachel Marsh. A family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, Beatrice Dotson, 95, also as shooting victims. Galde, a longtime probation officer, was remembered as a caring person. "She was an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live.," the Skagit County court said in a statement. Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old Macy's makeup artist, also was shot. Karen Van Horn, Martin's sister who is an employee at The Herald in Everett, described her as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. "She was so sweet," Van Horn said.. "She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn't want to rely on anyone else." Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, was also a victim, according to his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife had gone out to dinner and to the mall to shop and had made their way to Macy's when the shooter began his rampage.
