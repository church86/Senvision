The deadline for submitting bids ended on Wednesday. UK-based aircraft leasing company 12 Star Aviation and Bhutan Air have submitted proposals to lease aircraft, according to the corporation. “The documents submitted by the companies will be evaluated by management and tabled at NAC’s board for approval,” said Sugat Ratna Kansakar, managing director of NAC. The corporation had invited bids for the wet lease an Airbus A319, A320 or A321. It said that a temporary replacement was needed so the flight schedule would not be affected when the Boeing was sent for a long maintenance. The lease contract will begin on July 16 and last for 45 days, and it can be extended to 60 days, NAC said. The corporation plans to operate scheduled flights with the aircraft on the Kuala Lumpur, Doha, Delhi and Bangalore or other sectors.  On April 10, the corporation put one of its two Boeing 757s up for auction. However, it did not receive a single bid for the 30-year-old jet. The deadline for bids has been extended till June 12.  The minimum sale price for the 757 named Karnali and bearing registration number 9N-ACA has been set at $1.71 million. The aircraft has been sitting outside the NAC hangar at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) since April 2016 following the corporation’s policy to phase out its Boeing fleet. NAC decided to retire the aircraft after conducting a cost-benefit analysis. Based on the operational cost analysis, it does not make sense to fly the aircraft, it said. The Boeing 757 burns 4 tonnes of fuel per hour compared to 2.5 tonnes for new aircraft. The move is also part of the national flag carrier’s plan to have an all-Airbus fleet for its international operations. The corporation plans to retire its second Boeing 757 by 2019. The 9N-ACA arrived in Nepal in 1987 and flew on long-haul routes, displaying the national flag at world airports. The 757 holds 190 passengers. The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow body twin engine jet built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It debuted in the late 1980s and was in production until 2004. NAC currently flies two A320 and one Boeing 757.

American aerospace giant Boeing and France's Dassault Aviation are among the four entities that have responded to Indian Navy’s 'Request for Interest, (RFI)' to provide 57 multi-role carrier borne fighters, industry sources said. The other two are Sweden's SAAB and Rosoboronexport of Russia. While Boeing has pitched its F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault has briefed the navy on its Rafale. SAAB has offered the maritime variant of its Gripen single-engine fighter jet. Naval Chief Sunil Lanba confirmed the development. "We will examine the RFI and take it forward," he told this newspaper. The deal is valued at over Rs 50,000 crore. Sources say it is now mainly between Boeing’s FA-18 and Dassault’s Rafale, as the navy would prefer a twin-engine aircraft against SAAB’s single-engine Gripen. “While the navy did not specify a variant, there is a clear preference for a twin-engine model,” a senior industry executive said. As it had earlier done a deal with the Indian Air Force (IAF), Dassault is seen as having an upper hand. The government signed an $8.7-billion deal with France last year for 36 Rafale warplanes for the IAF. Dassault, defence ministry sources say, has argued it makes sense to equip IAF and navy with the same platform, for better logistics, maintenance and industrial support. "It would help in cost control like manpower training, pilot training, simulators and make it easier to get spare parts,” sources said. All the four companies refused to comment on queries sent to them. “Dassault with joint venture partner Reliance has a Make in India proposal already in place and envisages all 57 aircraft to be delivered from its facility at Mihan (near Nagpur),” a company executive said on condition of anonymity. The navy had on January 25 put out an RFI for the 57 fighter planes, giving manufacturers four months to respond. In the technical evaluation, the foreign companies had to answer queries on technical parameters, budgetary estimates, likely level of indigenisation, transfer of technology and schedule of deliveries after a contract is inked.

This is a monumental task. Many industries are dominated by two players — Microsoft and Apple, Coca-Cola and Pepsi — but the stranglehold Boeing and Airbus have on the aviation industry is hard to overestimate. The two companies account for a majority of the market share for single-aisle passenger planes. Their competitors, if the term even applies here, such as Bombardier and Embraer are very far behind.  Yet the new partnership is not shy about its intentions. Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corp want their new, as yet unnamed aircraft, to compete with the most successful passenger planes in existence. © AP Photo/ Xinhua, Chen Fei South Pole Bromance: China Interested in Cooperating With Russia on Antarctic Exploration Aware of its late entry into the race, Craic is looking to cut costs to compete. COMAC's assistant president, Guo Bozhi, has said that the new plane will have 10 percent lower operating costs along with an "advanced aerodynamic design" and "engines with low fuel burn." This might be encouraging if Boeing and Airbus did not pour billions into R&D of their own. A glance at Airbus' technology plans for the future turns up faster braking, low-noise, free glide approaches, using big data to streamline maintenance. Furthermore, the Craic plane is not scheduled to be ready for a decade. By then, aircraft advances will have moved on in leaps and bounds. The alliance will be developing an airliner while playing a long-term catch-up game.  But there is far more than engineering at stake here. It is understandable that observers have latched on to the above narrative. A new Chinese rival to Boeing and Airbus is a sexy story to write but the reality is different. As the US and Europe have their airplane giants, it makes complete sense for China and Russia to have their own. However, the building of a global supply chain, of reliable, long-term engineering and testing, of figuring out what added value to bring, are all tasks Craic needs to address immediately.  It has some advantages on its side. Some titans of the aviation supply chain collaborated on the C919, including General Electric, Honeywell, and Safran. Furthermore, even with a long-term approach, a new player with the money that Craic will be throwing around will stir the aviation industry.  The Chinese aviation market will become the largest in the world in terms of passengers by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. As the obvious breeding ground for any planes Craic cranks out, suppliers will want to bet in on the ground floor. While China's C919 has already taken to the skies, success will not come easily. Dominance in the aircraft industry comes with a backdrop of industry benchmarks, from active sales to a track record of safety. Building the plane is only step one out of 100.  This should be a long-term objective. The natural starting point is to convert the Russian and Chinese domestic markets to the C919 and its successors from within Craic.  There has been some international interest. In 2011, Ryanair signed a memorandum of understanding "to participate in discussions on the development" of the C919, with its CEO Michael O'Leary stating that "we are pleased that there is now a real alternative to Boeing and Airbus, and we are seriously interested in the development of a 200-seat variant of the C919 aircraft." This interest was confirmed after the aircraft's maiden flight, contingent on a 199-seat model of the plane being sold at a competitive price. © AP Photo/ Zha Chunming/Xinhua Russia, China Deepen Military Cooperation With 'Mutually Beneficial' Road Map  More competition is always good. But expectations need to be managed. It is all but impossible for Craic to disrupt the Boeing-Airbus twosome in the short or medium-term. If expectations are set in China and Russia for it to do that, good money after bad will be wasted and any plane the alliance produces will stall out of the gates. However, should Craic be given the time and finances to grow, it will have the opportunity to be what would truly benefit China and Russia: a long-term, reliable pillar of the aviation industry.

WTO ruled in its appellate body report that "the European Union established that the effects of the Washington State tax rate reduction are a genuine and substantial cause of significant lost sales of A320neo and A320ceo families". The U.S. tax break is also "a threat of impedance of imports of the A320ceo to the United States" and a threat of impedance of exports to the United Arab Emirates, the report said. Acting on behalf of Airbus, the EU requested consultations with the U.S. in December 2014, alleging that Washington's conditional tax incentives relating to the development, production and sale of Boeing's 777X jetliner were prohibited under WTO trade law. However, WTO rejected the EU's claims that the original adverse effects of the pre-2007 aeronautics R&D subsidies and some other subsidies continue as significant price suppression and lost sales for Airbus. Since more than a decade ago, Boeing and its European rival Airbus have been in a trade battle, in which each company accuses the other of taking billions of illegal state aid. The EU requested the WTO to establish a panel to probe into alleged U.S. subsidies of up to 19.1 billion U.S. dollars through tax and non-tax incentives by various municipalities to its largest aircraft maker Boeing in January 2006. The panel report over the case came out in March 2011. Both of them later on decided to appeal to the appellate body, which released its final report in March, 2012. The U.S. said afterwards that it intended to implement the recommendations and rulings in the Boeing case within six months. However, in October 2012, the EU requested the establishment of a compliance panel, after reviewing U.S. measures to comply with the rulings and considering that it maintained a series of subsidies.

(Xinhua/AFP) GENEVA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld on Friday its decision that Washington provided illegal tax breaks to aircraft maker Boeing in a trade ruling that favors European Union rival Airbus.

EVERETT — The U.S. International Trade Commission has green lighted Boeing’s complaint that Canadian airplane manufacturer Bombardier dumped its CSeries aircraft in America at cut-rate prices. The commission voted 5 to 0 Friday to proceed with an investigation into Boeing’s allegations that major public subsidies allowed Bombardier to sell its airplanes for less than they cost to make. Boeing claims that sales of its 737 have suffered as a result. Many industry watchers have criticized the aerospace giant’s legal action. However, Boeing’s top attorneys told The Daily Herald that the case is about a bigger principle: Ensuring fair play in the high-stakes jetliner market. The case is divided into two aspects — whether dumping occurred and whether the cost of imported CSeries should be increased with additional duties. The case is scheduled to be finished by Feb. 8.   Most Read Aerospace blog Boeing could commit to new airplane at Paris Air Show EVERETT — The Boeing Co. could make headlines later this month at… Jun 8th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Sullivan leads race for dollars in Everett mayoral contest EVERETT — Fueled by the check-writing of city firefighters, Brian Sullivan enjoys… Jun 8th, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield Everett teenager dies of flu; deaths at 45 in county EVERETT — An Everett teenager has died of the flu, the first… Jun 9th, 2017 by Herald Staff Petri Dish Talk and tension rise over collective bargaining reform OLYMPIA — Teachers in the Everett School District incited quite a stir… Jun 8th, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield Celebrate with Everett Music Initiative at 5th birthday party Everett Music Initiative, the folks who produce the annual Fisherman’s Village Music… Jun 8th, 2017 by Gale Fiege © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Air Force expects new Boeing tanker will be nine month late Dan Catchpole Fri Jun 9th, 2017 3:44pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — The Air Force says it expects Boeing to start delivering KC-46 tankers as late as June 2018, nine months behind the current schedule. The latest delay is caused by slow progress on certifying the new aerial refueling tanker with the Federal Aviation Administration and finishing the test flight program, the Air Force announced Wednesday. “Once Boeing receives the remaining design approvals from the FAA, they expect testing to proceed on a faster pace,” Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Emily Grabowski said. The company plans on clearing those hurdles in July, which will give the service a better idea of the delivery timeline, she said. The Air Force’s announcement followed its annual KC-46 Schedule Risk Assessment, which evaluates the development program’s progress and highlights potential delays. Boeing still plans to start tanker deliveries by the end of the year, company spokesman Chick Ramey said. The Air Force’s revised outlook is based on not addressing remaining risks, he said. The company expects to have 18 tankers with limited capabilities delivered by early 2018. Wing-mounted refueling pods, dubbed WARPs, from supplier Cobham are slated for delivery by October 2018, making the KC-46s capable of performing every task required by the military. The Air Force expects the WARPs will be delivered by then, Grabowski said. Boeing expects to find few faults in the testing and certification that remains, Boeing executive Mike Gibbons said in May. A Boeing vice president, Gibbons oversees the KC-46 program, which is based in Everett. Testing and certification was about 65 percent complete by early May. One of the program’s test aircraft recently has been conducting ground testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California and Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The tanker is an extensively modified version of Boeing’s successful 767 jet. Unlike earlier tankers, the KC-46 Pegasus can fly closer to combat and carry out far more missions, including evacuating patients, and hauling cargo and troops. It can even turn into a flying operating room. “Absolutely, just bolt the (surgery) module on the floor” of the main cargo deck, Robert Schoeffling, senior manager of global sales for Boeing Military Aircraft, told The Daily Herald in May. The plane’s large cargo door and wide-open main deck allow ground crews to quickly reconfigure the interior to fit the mission. The Air Force expects the Pegasus to be able to go from hauling troops to refueling fighters in flight in just a few hours. Boeing won the contract to develop and build the tanker in 2011. The contract originally set August as the delivery deadline for the first 18 combat-ready airplanes. However, supplier and design problems have dogged its development. The contract capped taxpayer costs at $4.9 billion. The delays and changes have cost Boeing roughly $2 billion in overruns. The Air Force plans to buy 179 KC-46s, including the 18 in production, over the next 10 years as it begins upgrading its aging tanker fleet. After handing over the first batch, Boeing plans on delivering 15 tankers a year. The U.S. has more than 400 jet tankers. Most are Boeing KC-135s, which were developed in the 1950s. McDonnell Douglas designed the bigger KC-10 in the 1970s. For now, “the Air Force will have to continue to sustain and rely on our legacy tanker fleet for our operations until the KC-46 delivers,” Grabowski said.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The United States International Trade Commission voted to continue its investigation into Bombardier Inc.’s trade practices on Friday, a decision that was largely expected and that could stall the company’s efforts to sell its CSeries jets in the U.S. market. After a 45-day preliminary investigation, the five members of the USITC panel all voted in the “affirmative,” deciding that there is “a reasonable indication” that the Boeing Company is threatened with material injury as a result of Bombardier’s alleged sale of subsidized jets for less than fair value. The U.S. aerospace giant filed the petition with both the USITC and the U.S. Department of Commerce, alleging that Bombardier had used illegal government subsidies and launched an “aggressive campaign” to dump its CSeries jets in the U.S. market. Related ‘First step in a long process’: Quick end to U.S. Bombardier probe unlikely, trade experts say ‘Risk profile goes down’: Bombardier says trade dispute not slowing CSeries momentum “Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan blasts Boeing in defence industry speech over trade spat with Bombardier” is locked Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan blasts Boeing in defence industry speech over trade spat with Bombardier Because of the USITC’s “affirmative determination”, the investigation into whether Boeing has been harmed by Bombardier and the Commerce probe looking at whether countervailing duties should be imposed will continue. The Department of Commerce will make a decision on what preliminary countervailing duties should be imposed on Bombardier’s CSeries jets on July 21, while an anti-dumping determination is due on Oct. 4. Bombardier is scheduled to begin delivering its CSeries aircraft to Delta in 2018. “Today’s preliminary decision was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process,” said Mike Nadolski, Bombardier’s vice president of communications, in an emailed statement. “Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing’s claim is without merit.” At the centre of Boeing’s petition are two order bids for Bombardier’s previously beleaguered CSeries aircraft, including Delta Air Lines’ purchase of 75 CSeries jets. The petition has pitted Boeing against Bombardier, Delta and the Canadian government, which all argued that the trade commission should dismiss the complaint and issue a negative determination. Delta said there was “no reasonable indication of threat of material injury” to Boeing, as the company never tried to sell new aircraft to the airline, and does not make an aircraft the size Delta wanted. Although Bombardier has yet to deliver one of its new aircraft to Delta, Boeing said its use of highly distortive pricing is an attempt to eliminate the 737 Max 7 from the 100 to 150-seat single aisle market home to the CSeries. The trade spat could have many immediate reverberations, for both Boeing and Bombardier. As the investigation continues, Boeing risks further straining its relationship with the Canadian government, which has suggested it may reconsider purchasing billions of dollars worth of Super Hornet fighter jets. Last week, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan suggested that the U.S. company can no longer be considered a trusted partner as a result of the petition. Boeing spokesperson Daniel Curran said the company values Canada as a customer and supplier partner for both its commercial and defence divisions. “Global trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules of the road, and that’s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United States, and our aerospace industry,” Curran said. “Regarding recent statements about our petition, this is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues. We are confident that our partnership with Canada will continue to thrive long after this commercial trade matter is resolved.” As for Bombardier, a lengthy investigation could hurt efforts to sell the CSeries in the lucrative U.S. market, even if the result of the probe is positive for the company. The timing of the investigation is also problematic, as the company is in the midst of a five-year turnaround plan, and is planning on ramping up production of the CSeries. A Department of Commerce document estimates that a final determination by the USITC could be made in February of next year. Bombardier’s stock fell seven per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange, closing at $2.37. Financial Post Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Boeing has revealed plans to develop planes that fly with no pilots, and intends to test the new technology next year. "The basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development, said at a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow which takes place later this month. The idea of air travel in an autonomous plane sounds scary, but, at the moment, jetliners can already take off, land and cruise using their computers. Planes are also fitted with flight management systems which determine the best flight path based on the flight plan inputted by the pilot. The number of pilots needed on flights has also dropped from three to two in recent years. Pilotless planes would help address the pilot shortage expected in the next few years. Sinnett said the company would begin to test the technology in a cockpit simulator over the summer before flying an airplane with “some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make,” next year. The technology to carry out pilotless flights is just the first step, though. Self-flying planes would have to pass safety standards, and regulators would need to figure out a way to certify the planes. Sinnett concedes he has "no idea how we're going to do that," but said “we’re studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." The planes would also need to be able to land safely, of course, and be as reliable as humans. “The machine has to be capable of making the same set of decisions, and if it can’t, we can’t go there,” Sinnett said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman EU secures another important win in the WTO Boeing Dispute Dispute settlement | Brussels, 9 June 2017 The World Trade Organization today found that the United States has continued to illegally subsidise aircraft manufacturer Boeing, causing significant harm to its European competitor Airbus. The WTO ruling confirms that the United States has taken no appropriate action to comply with its obligation to withdraw subsidies declared illegal by the WTO’s Appellate Body in 2012, or to remove their adverse effects. Today’s ruling backs the EU position, finding that the US has not only failed to remove the existing subsidies but has extended them and added significant new distorting subsidies, including incentives from South Carolina and a US Federal Aviation Administration R&D programme. The panel also found that US subsidies to Boeing continue to cause severe damage to Airbus in lost sales and market opportunities. ‘Today’s ruling is another victory for the EU, its industry and EU workers in this strategic sector. The panel agrees that the US has simply ignored existing WTO rulings and has continued to subsidise Boeing,’ said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström. ‘We will continue to firmly defend our industry to ensure we have a level-playing-field. EU companies must be able to compete on fair and equal terms. Today’s panel report is an important step in that direction.’ In 2012, the WTO ruled that the United States had granted massive subsidies to Boeing in violation of WTO rules. Between 1989 and 2006 Boeing benefited from NASA, US Department of Defense and Washington State/Kansas subsidies totalling over $5 billion. The subsidies allowed Boeing to sell its aircraft more cheaply, to the detriment of Airbus. The illegal subsidies include export support, direct grants, free access to facilities, technology transfer at no cost, and tax abatements. Today’s findings add to another WTO ruling of November 2016 in which – for the first time in the aircraft disputes – the WTO found the US guilty of providing prohibited subsidies to Boeing of around $5.7 billion. These subsidies by Washington State were conditional on the use of domestic over imported goods. Under WTO rules, these are the worst kind of subsidies and they caused further severe harm to Airbus’ market position For More Information History of the Boeing WTO case WTO dispute resolution   CategoriesUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Remarks by President Trump at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority Conference Next PostNext Continuous Extrusion Machine Market Analysis by Applications, Competitors and Forecast to 2021 Search Recent Posts Cold Rolling Embossing Machine Market Effect and Growth Factors Research and Projection 2021 Metal Rod Cold Rolling Machine Market Growth Forecast Analysis by Manufacturers, Regions, Type and Application to 2021 Nickel Sheets Shear Machine Market Competition Analysis by Type, Region Forecast 2021 Roll Forming Machine Market Analysis by Applications, Competitors and Forecast to 2021 Metal Etching Machine Market Research and Projections 2021 on Consumer Needs, Pricing strategy, Revenue and Growth Rate RSS Feed Subscribe RSS Feed (link) Proudly powered by WordPress

The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets as an interim purchase in the renewal of its fleet. The ITC probe could lead to steep duties on the CSeries, stoking investor fears that it will discourage future sales of the 110 to 130 seat jets, which have not secured a new order in about a year, said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said the ITC's decision was expected given the "low bar" for Boeing at this early stage, while a company executive recently dismissed suggestions that the probe could hurt CSeries sales. "Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing's claim is without merit," Nadolski said by email. A Boeing spokesman declined to say if the company was pleased with the ITC decision, instead emphasizing its support for Canada as a "customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defense businesses." Spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." Coupled with Canada's pledge to move ahead with an interim fighter purchase, Boeing's reaction indicates the careful path the U.S. planemaker must tread in challenging Bombardier while trying to preserve a lucrative military contract with the country.

By David Lawder, Lesley Wroughton and Allison Lampert WASHINGTON/MONTREAL (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission on Friday gave a green light to the U.S. Commerce Department to begin preparing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties against new jets from Bombardier Inc , sending the Canadian planemaker's stock down as much as 8 percent. The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets as an interim purchase in the renewal of its fleet. The ITC probe could lead to steep duties on the CSeries, stoking investor fears that it will discourage future sales of the 110 to 130 seat jets, which have not secured a new order in about a year, said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said the ITC's decision was expected given the "low bar" for Boeing at this early stage, while a company executive recently dismissed suggestions that the probe could hurt CSeries sales. "Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing's claim is without merit," Nadolski said by email. A Boeing spokesman declined to say if the company was pleased with the ITC decision, instead emphasizing its support for Canada as a "customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defense businesses." Spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." Coupled with Canada's pledge to move ahead with an interim fighter purchase, Boeing's reaction indicates the careful path the U.S. planemaker must tread in challenging Bombardier while trying to preserve a lucrative military contract with the country.

Related: Boeing complaint to US: Bombardier unfairly subsidized EVERETT — The World Trade Organization (WTO) gave the United States — and Boeing — a key victory Friday in a long-running legal fight with the European Union over subsidies for airplane makers. The victory, though, was not a final or complete win for the U.S. and Boeing. The decision followed on the WTO’s 2012 ruling that Boeing has received illegal subsidies. On Friday, a WTO panel determined that the U.S. has complied with nearly all parts of that earlier finding. However, the panel said, part of Washington state’s 2003 aerospace tax incentives is still illegal. Between 2013 and 2015, Boeing saved an estimated $325 million from the state’s business tax reduction, according to the WTO. The U.S. plans to appeal the WTO’s finding. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also urged the E.U. to settle the subsidy dispute. “The WTO report confirms what we have always said: The United States does not provide subsidies even remotely comparable to the uniquely large and uniquely harmful E.U. subsidies to Airbus,” Lighthizer said in a statement. “It is time for the E.U. to stop making excuses and instead to join us in negotiating a settlement to remove all WTO-inconsistent subsidies so that our world-class aircraft manufacturers can compete on a level playing field.” Boeing and Airbus both claimed victory after Friday’s ruling. “Today, the E.U. and Airbus suffered yet another resounding defeat in this decade-long dispute,” Boeing General Counsel Michael Luttig said in a statement. “It is finally time for them to comply with their global trade obligations and eliminate and remedy the $22 billion of launch aid and other illegal subsidies that are harming U.S. aerospace companies and American workers.” In September, the WTO ruled that Airbus had received massive public and illegal support from several European countries. The U.S. brought those charges in 2004. A short while later, the E.U. countersued, alleging Boeing received huge subsidies as well. The E.U. also filed a complaint in 2015, alleging that Washington’s tax incentives passed in 2013 to land the 777X also are illegal. After years of legal fighting, the two initial cases are inching closer and closer to final resolution. Until then, the state is sitting tight, said Tara Lee, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jay Inslee, who pushed for the 2013 tax package. With an appeal from the U.S. still pending, “it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the ruling,” she said.

(Remy de la Mauviniere/The Associated Press) A U.S. trade court allowed Boeing to continue pressing for tariffs against its Canadian competitor over the contention that Bombardier’s C Series jets are being sold at “absurdly low” prices thanks to unfair government subsidies in Canada. Share story By Andrew Mayeda Bloomberg News A U.S. trade court ruled that Boeing’s commercial jet business may have been harmed by sales of passenger planes by Bombardier Inc. at less than fair value. The court decision allows Boeing to continue pressing for tariffs against its Canadian competitor. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Friday that there’s reasonable indication that Boeing’s business may have been hurt or threatened by Bombardier sales in the U.S. of its C Series jets. The Commerce Department is investigating separately whether to impose duties on the Bombardier planes. A negative ruling by the ITC would have ended the two investigations. Before the U.S. imposes any duties, the ITC would still have to issue a final ruling on the question of how Boeing’s business was affected. Boeing has accused Bombardier of selling its C Series jets in the U.S. at “absurdly low” prices, while benefiting from unfair government subsidies in Canada. The U.S. planemaker asked the ITC in April to find that the company has suffered injury to its business at the hands of Bombardier and to recommend that the Commerce Department slap duties on the C Series.

Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said in an email that the company had expected the preliminary ITC decision given “the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process” and that a more detailed review will show Boeing’s claims are baseless. The allegations opened a new front in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, which have intensified since President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. earlier this year imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Canadian protections for dairy farmers. Talks to revamp Nafta are expected to start after mid-August. Following the ruling on Friday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government will defend Bombardier’s interests, adding that a review is underway over military procurement that relates to Boeing. Tariffs could hurt Bombardier’s efforts to win customers for its largest-ever jetliner. The last major firm order for the plane — Delta Air Lines Inc.’s for at least 75 jets — dates to April of last year. Boeing said that sale set a “new, low price ceiling” that was depressing its U.S. jetliner prices. The Atlanta-based carrier agreed to purchase the cutting-edge Bombardier jets for $19.6 million apiece, less than the $33.2 million cost of manufacturing the airplanes, Boeing said. Bombardier disputes the $19.6 million figure. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged C$372.5 million ($275 million) to Bombardier to finance two jet programs, including the C Series. Last year, Quebec’s provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner.

The commission said there is a “reasonable indication” that a U.S. industry is threatened with “material injury” due to the aircraft allegedly being sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the decision, the U.S. Department of Commerce will continue its investigation and disclose its preliminary countervailing duty determination around July 21 and anti-dumping duty decision around Oct. 4. Chicago-based Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission earlier this year alleging subsidies given to Bombardier have allowed the Montreal aircraft manufacturer to sell the CSeries planes at well below cost. Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has said Boeing is not behaving like a “trusted partner” and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. Ottawa has also issued a thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the aerospace giant values Canada as a customer and partner for its commercial and defence businesses. “It’s a relationship that has existed since 1919 and that will continue to thrive long after this commercial trade matter is resolved,” he wrote in an email. “Global trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules of the road, and that’s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United States, and our aerospace industry.” Bombardier (TSX:BBD.B) has rejected the accusations and argued that their CSeries planes never competed with Boeing in a key sale to Delta Airlines. “Today’s preliminary decision was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process,” spokesman Simon Letendre wrote in an email. “Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing’s claim is without merit.” Last year, the Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 per cent stake in the CSeries. Bombardier also shored up its finances by selling a 30 per cent stake in its railway division to pension fund manager Caisse de depot for US$1.5 billion. Meanwhile, Ottawa provided a $372.5-million loan earlier this year to help support Bombardier’s CSeries and Global 7000 aircraft programs. That’s on top of about $1 billion received in 2008 from Ottawa, Quebec and Britain to develop the CSeries. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Bombardier’s shares fell more than five per cent, losing 13 cents at $2.42 in afternoon trading.

"It's a relationship that has existed since 1919 and that will continue to thrive long after this commercial trade matter is resolved," he wrote in an email. "Global trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules of the road, and that's a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United States, and our aerospace industry." Bombardier (TSX:BBD.B) has rejected the accusations and argued that their CSeries planes never competed with Boeing in a key sale to Delta Airlines. "Today's preliminary decision was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process," spokesman Simon Letendre wrote in an email. "Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing's claim is without merit." Last year, the Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 per cent stake in the CSeries. Bombardier also shored up its finances by selling a 30 per cent stake in its railway division to pension fund manager Caisse de depot for US$1.5 billion. Meanwhile, Ottawa provided a $372.5-million loan earlier this year to help support Bombardier's CSeries and Global 7000 aircraft programs. That's on top of about $1 billion received in 2008 from Ottawa, Quebec and Britain to develop the CSeries. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Bombardier's shares fell more than five per cent, losing 13 cents at $2.42 in afternoon trading.

The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing's complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case could lead to steep duties on Bombardier's newest 110- to 130-seat jets. The Commerce Department must now determine any preliminary anti-subsidy duties by around July 22, with a deadline for preliminary anti-dumping duties around Oct. 3. The ITC will have a final say on whether to reject any duties. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said by email that the decision "was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process. Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing's claim is without merit." show chapters Bombardier takes part in India's infrastructure build    Tuesday, 14 Feb 2017 | 12:30 AM ET | 02:04 Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alex Lawrence reiterated that Canada would defend the interests of its aerospace industry and workers. "We are reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing," Lawrence said in an emailed statement. Boeing did not respond when asked if it was pleased with the ITC decision. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." Coupled with Canada's announcement that it is pressing ahead with stopgap fighter purchases, the reactions hint at the careful path Boeing must tread in attacking Bombardier while trying to preserve its defense and other aerospace relationships with Canada. Boeing has argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. It warned that Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of Boeing's best-selling 737. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate the 2016 sale of 75 CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines for what the American planemaker calls the "absurdly low" sum of $19.6 million each, despite the jet costing $33 million to build. Bombardier, which described Boeing's $19.6 million figure as "absurd," has countered that the 110-seat CS100 plane it sold to Delta does not compete with Boeing's smallest 737 model, the 130-seat 737 MAX 7. Bombardier recently dismissed industry suggestions that the dispute could slow efforts to accelerate sales of its CSeries jet. If the Commerce Department investigation finds that duties on the Bombardier aircraft are warranted, they would be aimed at offsetting any below-cost pricing or subsidies deemed unfair. In a separate ruling, the World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of unfairly supporting Boeing, but noted it had failed to withdraw a tax break in Washington state, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft.

The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets as an interim purchase in the renewal of its fleet. The ITC probe could lead to steep duties on the CSeries, stoking investor fears that it will discourage future sales of the 110 to 130 seat jets, which have not secured a new order in about a year, said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said the ITC's decision was expected given the "low bar" for Boeing at this early stage, while a company executive recently dismissed suggestions that the probe could hurt CSeries sales.

Spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." Coupled with Canada's pledge to move ahead with an interim fighter purchase, Boeing's reaction indicates the careful path the U.S. planemaker must tread in challenging Bombardier while trying to preserve a lucrative military contract with the country.

Marie-France Coallier / Montreal Gazette Share Adjust Comment Print In a new twist on their aerospace rivalry, Bombardier has joined Boeing to protest the awarding of a U.S. military aircraft contract to another company. The challenge comes as Bombardier finds itself the target of a Boeing complaint over the Quebec firm’s sales of commercial aircraft in the U.S. Boeing has accused Bombardier of receiving Canadian government subsidies that allowed it to sell its C-Series passenger planes at cut-rate prices. That, in turn, set in motion the Liberal government’s feud with Boeing over the purchase of Super Hornet fighter jets for the Canadian military. The new complaints by Boeing and Bombardier are focused on the U.S. Air Force plan to field a new electronic warfare aircraft. The air force selected L3 Technologies to integrate existing electronic warfare and mission systems on one type of aircraft on to a new plane. Under the U.S. air force deal, L3 would also select that plane, a move that prompted the complaints by Boeing and Bombardier. Both companies are concerned about the potential for conflict of interest as L3 has partnered in the past with aircraft manufacturer Gulfstream and could be inclined to select one of that firm’s planes. The U.S. Air Force leadership is standing by its decision to pick L3 to do both the integration of the equipment and the selection of the plane. “Boeing has announced their protest, and Bombardier has filed a protest as well,” Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch told journalists. “They are both in protest now, and we still remain committed, we believe we’ve got the right acquisition strategy, we remain committed to the strategy we’ve got, and we’re going to go to try to execute that strategy.” Both Boeing and Bombardier filed their complaints with the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Bombardier has promoted some of its aircraft, such as its Global 6000, as being ideal for carrying out special missions such as electronic warfare operations. Stéphane Villeneuve, Bombardier’s vice president of specialized aircraft, released a statement to media outlets Thursday noting that the firm deserves a chance to compete on the U.S. contract. The Government Accountability Office has 90 days to make a decision on the complaints. Bombardier and Boeing are embroiled in their own dispute. Boeing convinced the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Bombardier and allegations of government subsidies. Last week Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan requested Boeing drop its complaint but the firm declined. That has led to a stand-off on the Liberal government’s proposed purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets to fill a gap the Royal Canadian Air Force faces in its capabilities. The United States International Trade Commission voted to continue its investigation into Bombardier Inc.’s trade practices on Friday, a decision that was expected, but may stall Bombardier’s efforts to sell its CSeries jets in the U.S. market, Alicja Siekierska of the Financial Post reported. Sajjan suggested Boeing is no longer a trusted Canadian partner. As a result of the trade complaint, Canada is reviewing its military procurements with Boeing and is no longer meeting company officials on the Super Hornet purchase. Sajjan, however, says the federal government is still in discussions with the Pentagon over the acquisition of the aircraft. It is still unclear when the deal might proceed, or if it will be ultimately scuttled if Boeing does not withdraw its complaint against Bombardier. Boeing Company Bombardier Inc.

(Reuters) TOULOUSE, France: Airbus raised its forecast for deliveries by 6 percent to 34,899 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion over the next 20 years, creating jobs for more than a million pilots and technicians as China surges past the US to dominate air travel. The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world’s middle- class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said. But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 percent a year from 4.5 percent on Friday, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf. Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalization and a surge in private consumption. “It is the tyranny of large numbers,” Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world’s second-largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world’s fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036. The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market and supported their long-haul drive. “Low-cost long-haul will work,” he told a media briefing at the planemaker’s Toulouse headquarters. Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak. A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model. Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo for many missions targeted by Boeing’s proposed new mid-market jet. For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable. Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March. The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology have led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard. Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017 but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company’s finance chief was also achievable. TOULOUSE, France: Airbus raised its forecast for deliveries by 6 percent to 34,899 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion over the next 20 years, creating jobs for more than a million pilots and technicians as China surges past the US to dominate air travel. The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world’s middle- class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said. But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 percent a year from 4.5 percent on Friday, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf. Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalization and a surge in private consumption. “It is the tyranny of large numbers,” Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world’s second-largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world’s fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036. The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market and supported their long-haul drive. “Low-cost long-haul will work,” he told a media briefing at the planemaker’s Toulouse headquarters. Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak.

The ruling from a WTO panel was the latest blow in the decade-long clash between the titans of the civil aircraft industry, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way. The WTO ruled in March 2012 that billions of dollars of subsidies to Boeing were illegal and notified the United States to bring them to an end. But just a few months later, the European Union filed a new complaint with the global trade body, alledging that Washington was not complying with that order. In the ruling published Friday, WTO said it had concluded that the state of Washington had continued to dish out subsidies totalling $325 million in the form of tax cuts to Boeing between 2013 and 2015. It agreed with Brussels that the United States had not taken "appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or ... withdraw the subsidy." The EU hailed the ruling, saying in a statement that it confirmed "that the United States has taken no appropriate action to comply with its obligation to withdraw subsidies declared illegal ... Or to remove their adverse effects." "The panel agrees that the US has simply ignored existing WTO rulings and has continued to subsidise Boeing," EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in the statement. But the WTO ruling also rejected significant portions of the EU complaint, finding that Brussels had failed to demonstrate that US subsidies after 2012 to Boeing's research and development programmes were harming EU interests through lost sales and price cuts. Washington therefore chose to see the ruling as a victory, pointing out that the WTO panel had found that 28 of the 29 programmes it examined were in compliance. "The panel found only one state-level programme ... To be contrary to WTO rules," the US government said in a statement. "The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding," it added. The EU has also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing. In September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus. The WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales. The EU has appealed against that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had been discontinued. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer meanwhile insisted that Friday's ruling proved that "the United States does not provide subsidies even remotely comparable to the uniquely large and uniquely harmful EU subsidies to Airbus." The WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line.

"It's the tyranny of large numbers," Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world's second largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world's fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036. The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market, and supported their long-haul drive. "Low-cost long-haul will work," he told a media briefing at the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters. TWIN-AISLE DEMAND Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak. A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model. Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo narrowbody for many missions targeted by Boeing's proposed new mid-market jet. For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable. Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March. The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology has led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard. Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company's finance chief was also achievable.

The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case could lead to steep duties on Bombardier's newest 110- to 130-seat jets. The Commerce Department must now determine any preliminary anti-subsidy duties by around July 22, with a deadline for preliminary anti-dumping duties around Oct. 3. The ITC will have a final say on whether to reject any duties. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said by email that the decision "was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process. Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing's claim is without merit." Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alex Lawrence reiterated that Canada would defend the interests of its aerospace industry and workers. "We are reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing," Lawrence said in an emailed statement. Boeing did not respond when asked if it was pleased with the ITC decision. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." Coupled with Canada's announcement that it is pressing ahead with stopgap fighter purchases, the reactions hint at the careful path Boeing must tread in attacking Bombardier while trying to preserve its defense and other aerospace relationships with Canada. Boeing has argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. It warned that Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of Boeing's best-selling 737. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate the 2016 sale of 75 CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines for what the American planemaker calls the "absurdly low" sum of $19.6 million each, despite the jet costing $33 million to build. Bombardier, which described Boeing's $19.6 million figure as "absurd," has countered that the 110-seat CS100 plane it sold to Delta does not compete with Boeing's smallest 737 model, the 130-seat 737 MAX 7. Bombardier recently dismissed industry suggestions that the dispute could slow efforts to accelerate sales of its CSeries jet. If the Commerce Department investigation finds that duties on the Bombardier aircraft are warranted, they would be aimed at offsetting any below-cost pricing or subsidies deemed unfair. In a separate ruling, the World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of unfairly supporting Boeing, but noted it had failed to withdraw a tax break in Washington state, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft.

WTO ruled in its appellate body report that "the European Union established that the effects of the Washington State tax rate reduction are a genuine and substantial cause of significant lost sales of A320neo and A320ceo families". The U.S. tax break is also "a threat of impedance of imports of the A320ceo to the United States" and a threat of impedance of exports to the United Arab Emirates, the report said. Acting on behalf of Airbus, the EU requested consultations with the U.S. in December 2014, alleging that Washington's conditional tax incentives relating to the development, production and sale of Boeing's 777X jetliner were prohibited under WTO trade law. However, WTO rejected the EU's claims that the original adverse effects of the pre-2007 aeronautics R&D subsidies and some other subsidies continue as significant price suppression and lost sales for Airbus. Since more than a decade ago, Boeing and its European rival Airbus have been in a trade battle, in which each company accuses the other of taking billions of illegal state aid. The EU requested the WTO to establish a panel to probe into alleged U.S. subsidies of up to 19.1 billion U.S. dollars through tax and non-tax incentives by various municipalities to its largest aircraft maker Boeing in January 2006. The panel report over the case came out in March 2011. Both of them later on decided to appeal to the appellate body, which released its final report in March, 2012. The U.S. said afterwards that it intended to implement the recommendations and rulings in the Boeing case within six months. However, in October 2012, the EU requested the establishment of a compliance panel, after reviewing U.S. measures to comply with the rulings and considering that it maintained a series of subsidies.

The idea may seem far-fetched, but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000 (€892), “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available”, said Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Mr Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and “fly on an airplane next year with some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make”, he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don’t yet know how to certify such planes. “I have no idea how we’re going to do that,” Mr Sinnett said. “But we’re studying it right now and we’re developing those algorithms.” Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5m pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. However, a self-flying plane would also need to be able to land safely, as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the ‘Miracle on the Hudson’ in 2009 , Mr Sinnett said. “If it can’t, then we can’t go there.” A US Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Capt Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the jet to customers around 2025. READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS Boeing, Aeroplane, Plane, Pilot © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman WTO condemns Boeing’s non-compliance and new subsidies Toulouse, France, June 9th, 2017 – The United States has failed to comply with WTO rulings in the more than decade-long ongoing transatlantic battle over commercial aircraft subsidies. This was reported today by the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Compliance Panel in the DS353 dispute (EU vs U.S.), which relates to billions of dollars in subsidies granted to The Boeing Company.  In March 2012, the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body ruled that a number of subsides provided by the U.S. to Boeing were illegal, and were to be withdrawn within six months, or alternatively that their adverse effects were to be removed. In September 2012, the U.S. claimed that it had taken all necessary steps to achieve compliance. Today, the EU prevailed in demonstrating the continuing existence of a number of illegal subsidies, including R&D support provided by NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD), and the multi-billion dollar tax breaks from Washington State. The EU has also prevailed in demonstrating continuing adverse effects caused by some of those subsidies. For a further five years, and by failing to comply with the WTO rulings, the U.S. has continued to provide tremendous benefits to Boeing in the form of unfair and anti-competitive subsidies, resulting in an additional loss of sales of at least 300 aircraft, with an estimated value of US$ 15-20 billion.   In total, combining this with the WTO’s ruling at the end of 2016 in the DS487 dispute, addressing the illegal subsidies for the 777X, as well as prior rulings in DS353, the total impact of the subsidies is estimated to add up to US$ 100 billion in lost sales to Airbus.   Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus, stated: “The amount of money involved completely distorts trade. There is absolutely no place for these unfair and anti-competitive practices in today’s modern and dynamic global marketplace, and the WTO should make it clear that no government or company can escape from their international responsibilities”.  Enders added: “I salute the EU for what again is a great victory for fair trade in commercial aviation. The clarity provided by the WTO in continuous rulings over a decade is impressive and far reaching: First, the WTO stated that the US subsidy system provides largely for illegal grants while the European reimbursable launch investment system based on loans is principally compliant with international trade law. Today, the WTO panel has demonstrated how Boeing continues to seek the benefits from this extensive illegal support, at the great expense of a level playing field in the worldwide aviation industry.”  After the original ruling was published in 2012, the U.S. further increased their subsidies to Boeing, with measures such as the provision of incentives for the production of the 787 in South Carolina, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration funded R&D programmes, increased tax reductions from Washington State, and the award of additional NASA and DOD R&D funding and support. Today, the Panel agreed with the EU that it was correct for these additional measures to be included within the scope of the proceedings. The Panel found that the non-withdrawn subsidies continue to cause adverse effects in the form of significant lost sales for Airbus. In particular, the Panel found that the B&O tax reductions from Washington State caused Airbus to lose at least US$ 16 billion worth of sales to Boeing. This finding could ultimately lead to the imposition of billions of dollars worth of trade sanctions against the U.S.  It is expected that today’s ruling will be appealed. However, there is no indication that U.S. arguments will be any different from the ones advanced before, despite the clear position of the WTO. With the additional time the U.S. will be buying with any such appeal, the harm to Airbus caused by subsidies will only continue to increase.  Fabrice Bregier, COO of Airbus, commented: “Over the course of this seemingly never-ending dispute with Boeing, it has become very clear that Boeing is using these cases for PR and Lobbying purposes rather than enabling a serious discussion on a level playing field in the commercial aircraft sector. That is not only regrettable but will soon be seen as a shot in their own foot in light of the current and future competitive environment in our industry.”  The first half of 2017 has seen the large commercial aircraft market move into unchartered territory. While we saw the first flights of new market entrants C919 and MC-21 took place, Boeing filed a local trade remedies petition at the US International Trade Commission against Bombardier, with the intention to exclude the C Series from the U.S. market.  “It seems to be clear that Boeing is doing all it can to maintain the status-quo from which it has illegally profited for all these years. Airbus looks forward to the day that this ridiculous dispute can be put to bed and we can focus our full attention on investing in further innovation and engaging in healthy competition,” Bregier added. Airbus would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the European Commission and the governments of France, Germany, the UK, and Spain for their continued success at the WTO.  Airbus is extremely grateful for the inordinate number of man-hours and immense effort which have been invested in this dispute so far.

Business U.S. trade panel rules Bombardier sales may hurt Boeing business Ben Stansall / AFP/Getty Images The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Friday that there's reasonable indication that Boeing's business may have been hurt or threatened by Bombardier sales in the U.S. of its C Series jets.

(Ben Stansall / AFP/Getty Images) Andrew MayedaBloomberg A U.S. trade court ruled that Boeing's commercial jet business may have been harmed by sales of passenger planes by Bombardier Inc. at less than fair value. The court decision allows Boeing to continue pressing for tariffs against its Canadian competitor. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Friday that there's reasonable indication that Boeing's business may have been hurt or threatened by Bombardier sales in the U.S. of its C Series jets. The Commerce Department is investigating separately whether to impose duties on the Bombardier planes. A negative ruling by the ITC would have ended the two investigations. Before the U.S. imposes any duties, the ITC would still have to issue a final ruling on the question of how Boeing's business was affected. Boeing has accused Bombardier of selling its C Series jets in the U.S. at "absurdly low" prices, while benefiting from unfair government subsidies in Canada. The U.S. planemaker asked the ITC in April to find that the company has suffered injury to its business at the hands of Bombardier and to recommend that the Commerce Department slap duties on the C Series. The allegations opened a new front in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, which have intensified since President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. earlier this year imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Canadian protections for dairy farmers. Talks to revamp Nafta are expected to start after mid-August. Tariffs could hurt Bombardier's efforts to win customers for its largest-ever jetliner. The last major firm order for the plane -- Delta Air Lines's for at least 75 jets -- dates to April of last year. Bombardier has called the Boeing allegations "absurd," saying it complies with the laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates. "The industry wants innovation, they want competition, and Boeing's actions are completely the opposite of that," Fred Cromer, president of commercial aircraft at Bombardier, said in an interview before the decision. Boeing said a 2016 sale of Bombardier jets to Delta set a "new, low price ceiling" that was depressing its U.S. jetliner prices. The Atlanta-based carrier agreed to purchase the cutting-edge Bombardier jets for $19.6 million apiece, less than the $33.2 million cost of manufacturing the airplanes, Boeing said. Bombardier disputes the $19.6 million figure. The tussle echoes longstanding U.S.-Europe disputes stemming from the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus. Canada has vowed to vigorously defend Bombardier. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged C$372.5 million ($275 million) to Bombardier to finance two jet programs, including the C Series. Last year, Quebec's provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner.

The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets as an interim purchase in the renewal of its fleet. The ITC probe could lead to steep duties on the CSeries, stoking investor fears that it will discourage future sales of the 110 to 130 seat jets, which have not secured a new order in about a year, said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said the ITC's decision was expected given the "low bar" for Boeing at this early stage, while a company executive recently dismissed suggestions that the probe could hurt CSeries sales. "Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing´s claim is without merit," Nadolski said by email. A Boeing spokesman declined to say if the company was pleased with the ITC decision, instead emphasizing its support for Canada as a "customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defense businesses." Spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." Coupled with Canada's pledge to move ahead with an interim fighter purchase, Boeing's reaction indicates the careful path the U.S. planemaker must tread in challenging Bombardier while trying to preserve a lucrative military contract with the country. Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alex Lawrence reiterated that Canada would defend its aerospace industry. "We are reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing," Lawrence said by email. Boeing has argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. It warned that Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate the 2016 sale of 75 CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines for what it calls the "absurdly low" sum of $19.6 million each, despite the jet costing $33 million to build. Bombardier, which described Boeing's $19.6 million figure as "absurd," has countered that the 110-seat CS100 plane it sold to Delta does not compete with Boeing's smallest 737 model, the 130-seat 737 MAX 7. The Commerce Department must now determine any preliminary anti-subsidy duties by around July 22, with a deadline for preliminary anti-dumping duties around Oct. 3. The ITC will have a final say on whether to reject any duties. In a separate ruling, the World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of unfairly supporting Boeing, but noted it had failed to withdraw a tax break in Washington state, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse 09 Jun 2017 11:43PM (Updated: 10 Jun 2017 12:45AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail WASHINGTON: The U.S. International Trade Commission on Friday gave a green light to the U.S. Commerce Department to begin preparing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties against new jets from Canada's Bombardier Inc based on claims by U.S. rival Boeing. The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case could lead to steep duties on Bombardier's newest 110- to 130-seat jets. The Commerce Department must now determine any preliminary anti-subsidy duties by around July 22, with a deadline for preliminary anti-dumping duties around Oct. 3. The ITC will have a final say on whether to reject any duties. Advertisement Advertisement The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said by email that the decision "was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process. Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing’s claim is without merit." Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alex Lawrence reiterated that Canada would defend the interests of its aerospace industry and workers. "We are reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing," Lawrence said in an emailed statement. Boeing did not respond when asked if it was pleased with the ITC decision. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget Coupled with Canada's announcement that it is pressing ahead with stopgap fighter purchases, the reactions hint at the careful path Boeing must tread in attacking Bombardier while trying to preserve its defense and other aerospace relationships with Canada. Boeing has argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a US$2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. It warned that Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of Boeing's best-selling 737. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate the 2016 sale of 75 CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines for what the American planemaker calls the "absurdly low" sum of US$19.6 million each, despite the jet costing US$33 million to build. Bombardier, which described Boeing's US$19.6 million figure as "absurd," has countered that the 110-seat CS100 plane it sold to Delta does not compete with Boeing's smallest 737 model, the 130-seat 737 MAX 7. Bombardier recently dismissed industry suggestions that the dispute could slow efforts to accelerate sales of its CSeries jet. If the Commerce Department investigation finds that duties on the Bombardier aircraft are warranted, they would be aimed at offsetting any below-cost pricing or subsidies deemed unfair. In a separate ruling, the World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of unfairly supporting Boeing, but noted it had failed to withdraw a tax break in Washington state, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# Mandsaur ICC Champions Trophy 2017 James Comey Cow Slaughter Exam results 2017 News World News WTO says US failed to fully comply in Boeing subsidies dispute Shares0 Fri, 9 Jun 2017-10:17pm , PTI The World Trade Organization said today the United States had not fully complied with a 2012 ruling ordering it to halt subsidies to Boeing, in a partial victory for rival aircraft maker Airbus and the EU. The ruling from a WTO panel was the latest blow in the decade-long clash between the titans of the civil aircraft industry, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way. The WTO ruled in March 2012 that billions of dollars of subsidies to Boeing were illegal and notified the United States to bring them to an end. But just a few months later, the European Union filed a new complaint with the global trade body, alledging that Washington was not complying with that order. In the ruling published Friday, WTO said it had concluded that the state of Washington had continued to dish out subsidies totalling $325 million in the form of tax cuts to Boeing between 2013 and 2015. It agreed with Brussels that the United States had not taken "appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or ... withdraw the subsidy." The EU hailed the ruling, saying in a statement that it confirmed "that the United States has taken no appropriate action to comply with its obligation to withdraw subsidies declared illegal ... or to remove their adverse effects." "The panel agrees that the US has simply ignored existing WTO rulings and has continued to subsidise Boeing," EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in the statement. But the WTO ruling also rejected significant portions of the EU complaint, finding that Brussels had failed to demonstrate that US subsidies after 2012 to Boeing's research and development programmes were harming EU interests through lost sales and price cuts. Washington therefore chose to see the ruling as a victory, pointing out that the WTO panel had found that 28 of the 29 programmes it examined were in compliance. "The panel found only one state-level programme ... to be contrary to WTO rules," the US government said in a statement. "The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding," it added. The EU has also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing. In September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus. The WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales. The EU has appealed against that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had been discontinued. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer meanwhile insisted that Friday's ruling proved that "the United States does not provide subsidies even remotely comparable to the uniquely large and uniquely harmful EU subsidies to Airbus." The WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line.

(Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) Related Stories Liberals halt contact with Boeing on Super Hornets as trade dispute escalates Defence minister calls on Boeing to withdraw trade petition against Bombardier Boeing says trade complaint against Bombardier designed to prevent larger CSeries In Bombardier fight, Boeing sees ghost of Airbus ascent Ottawa reconsiders Boeing purchases amid accusations against Bombardier The U.S. International Trade Commission has voted to continue its investigation into the trade practices of Bombardier Inc. "There is a reasonable indication that a U.S. industry is threatened with material injury by reason of imports of 100- to 150-seat large civil aircraft from Canada that are allegedly subsidized and sold in the United States at less than fair value," a release from the commission said. Boeing, Bombardier's rival, filed a petition with the USITC in April asking it to consider anti-dumping and countervailing duties against the Canadian company's CSeries passenger aircraft. More doubt cast over Super Hornet sale as Liberals break contact with Boeing Cross-border aircraft rivals Bombardier, Boeing clash in trade hearing The unanimous decision by the five commissioners follows hearings last month. A report on the ITC's finding of injury will be made public after July 10. Friday's vote means a separate investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department will continue.  A preliminary determination on countervailing duties is expected on or about July 21. A decision on anti-dumping duties will follow in early October. This chain of decisions leads to a final levy set against the Canadian aircraft. Boeing is calling for countervailing duties of 79.41 per cent and anti-dumping duties of 79.82 per cent. The U.S. company accuses Bombardier of running "an aggressive campaign" to dump its civilian aircraft in the U.S. 'Without merit' In its search for a major American airline to purchase its new plane, Bombardier is alleged to have set its pricing below cost to squeeze out competitors. But Bombardier does not believe its aircraft compete with Boeing's 737 planes. Instead, this action is seen as an attempt to block the CSeries from the U.S. market. "Today's preliminary decision was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process," spokesman Simon Letendre wrote in an email to The Canadian Press. "Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing's claim is without merit." Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland announced last month that the Canadian government is reviewing its procurement contracts with Boeing in light of the U.S. company's trade complaint against Bombardier. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) "The U.S. has its own process and they're going through the process," Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Friday in an interview with CBC Radio's The House.  "We absolutely reject this complaint. We think it is absolutely groundless." Controversial government support In February, the federal government announced a loan package for Bombardier's aircraft worth over $370 million. Last year, the Quebec government invested $1 billion US in the CSeries program in exchange for a 49.5 per cent stake. The invisible handout from taxpayers helped create Bombardier's billions: Don Pittis ​Bombardier's strange chokehold on the public purse: Neil Macdonald In the face of this trade action, Canadian military and federal government officials have suspended discussions with Boeing on a previously announced "urgent" purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets to fulfil what the Liberals called a "capability gap" in its military fleet. After hearings on the Bombardier complaint at the U.S. Commerce Department last month, Freeland said Canada would defend its aerospace industry and review its military purchases from Boeing. She repeated Friday that future government procurement from Boeing is under review. "We've also pointed out to our U.S. partners that the aerospace industry in Canada and the United States is a highly integrated industry that supports jobs on both sides of the border," she said. Her office told CBC News that components for the CSeries are supplied by American companies from Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, Washington, New York, Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the aerospace giant values Canada as a customer and partner for its commercial and defence businesses. "It's a relationship that has existed since 1919 and that will continue to thrive long after this commercial trade matter is resolved," he wrote to The Canadian Press in an email.

The ruling added another page to an exhausting 13-year-old battle between the transatlantic plane giants just as a U.S. tribunal agreed separately to investigate Boeing's concerns about alleged price-dumping by Canada's Bombardier. The WTO said the United States had failed to remove aid for Boeing, as alleged in a trade complaint brought by the European Union, but ruled that few of the subsidies hurt EU interests. It found that one U.S. subsidy programme, a business tax rate reduction in the state of Washington, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft, had "adverse effects", involving customers from the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Iceland. Both sides claimed victory after the ruling, which is about whether Boeing complied with a 2012 decision that it had received billions of dollars of subsidies including aid from space agency NASA and tax breaks from Washington State. "The panel found only one state-level program, which had an average value of $100-110 million in the 2013-2015 period, to be contrary to WTO rules. The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding," the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. European planemaker Airbus insisted the United States had not complied with the WTO's earlier decisions in the case and claimed it had suffered $100 billion of harm when combined with a follow-up complaint. "The amount of money involved completely distorts trade ... and the WTO should make it clear that no government or company can escape from their international responsibilities," Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement. The WTO said Boeing had failed to comply with part of the earlier 2012 ruling relating to tax breaks in Washington state. Those tax breaks are now the subject of a new case, having been extended to cover Boeing's newest wide-body jet. In November, the WTO defined the tax break to help Boeing develop its new 777X jet as a prohibited subsidy. That decision, contested by the United States, is now working its way through the WTO's appeals tribunal. The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual accusations of support for Airbus and Boeing. Bickering over financing for the $120 billion a year civil aerospace industry has widened in recent months as Brazil took Bombardier to the WTO and Boeing asked a faster U.S. tribunal to deal with its pricing complaint against the same company.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman EU secures another important win in the WTO Boeing Dispute The WTO ruling confirms that the United States has taken no appropriate action to comply with its obligation to withdraw subsidies declared illegal by the WTO’s Appellate Body in 2012, or to remove their adverse effects. Today’s ruling backs the EU position, finding that the US has not only failed to remove the existing subsidies but has extended them and added significant new distorting subsidies, including incentives from South Carolina and a US Federal Aviation Administration R&D programme. The panel also found that US subsidies to Boeing continue to cause severe damage to Airbus in lost sales and market opportunities. ‘Today’s ruling is another victory for the EU, its industry and EU workers in this strategic sector. The panel agrees that the US has simply ignored existing WTO rulings and has continued to subsidise Boeing,’ said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström. ‘We will continue to firmly defend our industry to ensure we have a level-playing-field. EU companies must be able to compete on fair and equal terms. Today’s panel report is an important step in that direction.’ In 2012, the WTO ruled that the United States had granted massive subsidies to Boeing in violation of WTO rules. Between 1989 and 2006 Boeing benefited from NASA, US Department of Defense and Washington State/Kansas subsidies totalling over $5 billion. The subsidies allowed Boeing to sell its aircraft more cheaply, to the detriment of Airbus. The illegal subsidies include export support, direct grants, free access to facilities, technology transfer at no cost, and tax abatements. Today’s findings add to another WTO ruling of November 2016 in which – for the first time in the aircraft disputes – the WTO found the US guilty of providing prohibited subsidies to Boeing of around $5.7 billion. These subsidies by Washington State were conditional on the use of domestic over imported goods. Under WTO rules, these are the worst kind of subsidies and they caused further severe harm to Airbus’ market position.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Boeing Thanks U.S. Trade Representative for Winning Major WTO Compliance Ruling CHICAGO, June 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Boeing (NYSE: BA) today commended the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) for achieving another significant win in the long-running dispute between the United States and the European Union (EU) over aerospace subsidies. „Today, the EU and Airbus suffered yet another resounding defeat in this decade-long dispute. It is finally time for them to comply with their global trade obligations and eliminate and remedy the $22 billion of launch aid and other illegal subsidies that are harming U.S. aerospace companies and American workers,” said Boeing General Counsel J. Michael Luttig. The World Trade Organization (WTO) confirmed that the United States has complied with virtually all of the WTO’s decision in the counter-case the EU filed against the United States in 2006. The EU and Airbus claimed in this case that Boeing benefitted from tens of billions of dollars of subsidies and focused their arguments on research and development contracts that Boeing received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense. „The WTO again categorically rejected Europe’s and Airbus’ claims. The WTO originally dismissed 80 percent of the allegations the EU first made, and today stated unequivocally that the United States has complied with virtually all of the WTO’s findings on the remaining amount,” Luttig said. In addition to holding that the U.S. had complied with its prior ruling concerning various U.S. government research and development contracts with Boeing, the WTO today also dismissed EU claims against the investment incentives Boeing received in South Carolina, other older state and local tax incentives, the FAA CLEEN program, and seven of eight tax incentives from Washington State.  „Today’s ruling on U.S. compliance stands in sharp contrast to the WTO’s finding last September that the EU had done virtually nothing to comply with the WTO’s decision against the illegal, market-distorting launch aid subsidies provided to Airbus for 40 years. On top of that, the WTO also found that the EU has continued to make even more illegal subsidies to Airbus by providing launch aid to yet another product, the A350,” Luttig continued. „The United States and Boeing are committed to abiding by WTO rules and proving it with action. It’s time now that the EU and Airbus step up to their WTO obligations – or face significant U.S. sanctions in the year ahead,” he said. Under WTO rules, tariffs for non-compliance are levied based upon the harm the subsidies are causing annually, which USTR in this case estimates is in the $7-10 billion range. „Airbus and its government sponsors have come to the end of the road. The WTO has now said the EU has provided Airbus $22 billion in illegal subsidies and they have refused to eliminate or remedy those illegal subsidies, as they are required to do. The WTO has also now said that the US is virtually in full compliance with its obligations and the WTO’s rulings. It is past time for the EU and Airbus to comply with the WTO’s rulings,” Luttig said. Luttig also stressed the vast difference in the WTO subsidy findings against the United States versus Europe. The sole remaining investment incentives found to be inconsistent with the WTO rules—a reduction in Washington state’s business and occupancy tax rate for aerospace—amount to a cut in the tax to be paid of around $100 million a year. In contrast, the WTO has found repeatedly that Airbus has benefitted from $22 billion in illegal EU subsidies.

The court decision allows Boeing to continue pressing for tariffs against its Canadian competitor. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Friday that there’s reasonable indication that Boeing’s business may have been hurt or threatened by Bombardier sales in the U.S. of its C Series jets. The Commerce Department is investigating separately whether to impose duties on the Bombardier planes. A negative ruling by the ITC would have ended the two investigations. Before the U.S. imposes any duties, the ITC would still have to issue a final ruling on the question of how Boeing’s business was affected. Boeing has accused Bombardier of selling its C Series jets in the U.S. at “absurdly low” prices, while benefiting from unfair government subsidies in Canada. The U.S. planemaker asked the ITC in April to find that the company has suffered injury to its business at the hands of Bombardier and to recommend that the Commerce Department slap duties on the C Series. Bombardier’s widely traded Class B stock tumbled 7.1 percent to C$2.37 at the close in Toronto, the most since June 27, 2016. Boeing was little changed at $190.03. Planemaker Disputes The tussle echoes longstanding U.S.-Europe disputes stemming from the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus SE. A World Trade Organization panel found Friday that billions of dollars in government subsidies that flowed to Boeing now comply with international rules, except for tax breaks from the state of Washington that continue to disadvantage Airbus. “The ITC and WTO ruling are scaring people but I don’t buy that,” said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co. “Ultimately it’s not going to prohibit the commercial success of the C Series, as I see it.” Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said in an email that the company had expected the preliminary ITC decision given “the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process” and that a more detailed review will show Boeing’s claims are baseless.

Sign Up The allegations opened a new front in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, which have intensified since President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. earlier this year imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Canadian protections for dairy farmers. Talks to revamp Nafta are expected to start after mid-August. Seeking Customers Following the ruling on Friday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government will defend Bombardier’s interests, adding that a review is underway over military procurement that relates to Boeing. Tariffs could hurt Bombardier’s efforts to win customers for its largest-ever jetliner. The last major firm order for the plane -- Delta Air Lines Inc.’s for at least 75 jets -- dates to April of last year. Boeing said that sale set a “new, low price ceiling” that was depressing its U.S. jetliner prices. The Atlanta-based carrier agreed to purchase the cutting-edge Bombardier jets for $19.6 million apiece, less than the $33.2 million cost of manufacturing the airplanes, Boeing said. Bombardier disputes the $19.6 million figure. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged C$372.5 million ($275 million) to Bombardier to finance two jet programs, including the C Series. Last year, Quebec’s provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner.

2017, 11:14 ET Share this article CHICAGO, June 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing (NYSE: BA) today commended the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) for achieving another significant win in the long-running dispute between the United States and the European Union (EU) over aerospace subsidies. "Today, the EU and Airbus suffered yet another resounding defeat in this decade-long dispute. It is finally time for them to comply with their global trade obligations and eliminate and remedy the $22 billion of launch aid and other illegal subsidies that are harming U.S. aerospace companies and American workers," said Boeing General Counsel J. Michael Luttig. The World Trade Organization (WTO) confirmed that the United States has complied with virtually all of the WTO's decision in the counter-case the EU filed against the United States in 2006. The EU and Airbus claimed in this case that Boeing benefitted from tens of billions of dollars of subsidies and focused their arguments on research and development contracts that Boeing received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense. "The WTO again categorically rejected Europe's and Airbus' claims. The WTO originally dismissed 80 percent of the allegations the EU first made, and today stated unequivocally that the United States has complied with virtually all of the WTO's findings on the remaining amount," Luttig said. In addition to holding that the U.S. had complied with its prior ruling concerning various U.S. government research and development contracts with Boeing, the WTO today also dismissed EU claims against the investment incentives Boeing received in South Carolina, other older state and local tax incentives, the FAA CLEEN program, and seven of eight tax incentives from Washington State.  "Today's ruling on U.S. compliance stands in sharp contrast to the WTO's finding last September that the EU had done virtually nothing to comply with the WTO's decision against the illegal, market-distorting launch aid subsidies provided to Airbus for 40 years. On top of that, the WTO also found that the EU has continued to make even more illegal subsidies to Airbus by providing launch aid to yet another product, the A350," Luttig continued. "The United States and Boeing are committed to abiding by WTO rules and proving it with action. It's time now that the EU and Airbus step up to their WTO obligations – or face significant U.S. sanctions in the year ahead," he said. Under WTO rules, tariffs for non-compliance are levied based upon the harm the subsidies are causing annually, which USTR in this case estimates is in the $7-10 billion range. "Airbus and its government sponsors have come to the end of the road. The WTO has now said the EU has provided Airbus $22 billion in illegal subsidies and they have refused to eliminate or remedy those illegal subsidies, as they are required to do. The WTO has also now said that the US is virtually in full compliance with its obligations and the WTO's rulings. It is past time for the EU and Airbus to comply with the WTO's rulings," Luttig said. Luttig also stressed the vast difference in the WTO subsidy findings against the United States versus Europe. The sole remaining investment incentives found to be inconsistent with the WTO rules—a reduction in Washington state's business and occupancy tax rate for aerospace—amount to a cut in the tax to be paid of around $100 million a year. In contrast, the WTO has found repeatedly that Airbus has benefitted from $22 billion in illegal EU subsidies.

The WTO ruling confirms that the United States has taken no appropriate action to comply with its obligation to withdraw subsidies declared illegal by the WTO's Appellate Body in 2012, or to remove their adverse effects. Today's ruling backs the EU position, finding that the US has not only failed to remove the existing subsidies but has extended them and added significant new distorting subsidies, including incentives from South Carolina and a US Federal Aviation Administration R&D programme. The panel also found that US subsidies to Boeing continue to cause severe damage to Airbus in lost sales and market opportunities. ‘Today's ruling is another victory for the EU, its industry and EU workers in this strategic sector. The panel agrees that the US has simply ignored existing WTO rulings and has continued to subsidise Boeing,' said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström. ‘We will continue to firmly defend our industry to ensure we have a level-playing-field. EU companies must be able to compete on fair and equal terms. Today's panel report is an important step in that direction.' In 2012, the WTO ruled that the United States had granted massive subsidies to Boeing in violation of WTO rules. Between 1989 and 2006 Boeing benefited from NASA, US Department of Defense and Washington State/Kansas subsidies totalling over $5 billion. The subsidies allowed Boeing to sell its aircraft more cheaply, to the detriment of Airbus. The illegal subsidies include export support, direct grants, free access to facilities, technology transfer at no cost, and tax abatements. Today's findings add to another WTO ruling of November 2016 in which – for the first time in the aircraft disputes – the WTO found the US guilty of providing prohibited subsidies to Boeing of around $5.7 billion. These subsidies by Washington State were conditional on the use of domestic over imported goods. Under WTO rules, these are the worst kind of subsidies and they caused further severe harm to Airbus' market position.   For More Information History of the Boeing WTO case WTO dispute resolution IP/17/1591 Press contacts: Alexander WINTERSTEIN (+32 2 299 32 65) Kinga MALINOWSKA (+32 2 2 295 13 83) General public inquiries: Europe Direct by phone 00 800 67 89 10 11 or by email Side Bar Footer Last update: 20-02-2017 15:02:20 Version2.10.2-247 Top

Top executive have offered strong hints that Boeing has made detailed plans for the launch of an all-new 797 jet -- built in a radically different way that will be "transformational" for the company and could have big ramifications for Washington state.(Eric Piermong/AFP/Getty Images) By The Seattle Times SEATTLE -- In a business that plays out over decades, the attention of Boeing's leadership is unshakably fixed on two key future jet programs that will be critical to this region. In briefings before this month's Paris Air Show, Boeing executives showed that the complex refashioning of its Everett manufacturing facility for the forthcoming 777X has made rapid progress since December. It all needs to come together perfectly for the large new jet to successfully enter service in 2020. And a top executive offered strong hints that Boeing has made detailed plans for the future launch of an all-new 797 jet — built in a radically different way that will be "transformational" for the company and could have crucial ramifications for Washington state. New automated production methods for both jet programs are central to Boeing's thinking. In his first appearance before journalists, new Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said Boeing will look to technology — both on its airplanes and in its factories — to differentiate itself from European rival Airbus as well as the Canadian, Chinese and Russian contenders that have newly entered the large commercial jet business. "We have a very formidable competitor and we have emergent competitors," said McAllister. "We can never stand still." Heavy 777X investment A near-term glut of widebody aircraft has depressed orders for the biggest jets and forced Boeing to slash 777 jet production in Everett — and to cut more than 8,400 local jobs in the past year. Yet despite that near-term pain, Boeing remains confident in the long-term trend of air-traffic growth and is prepping now for a brighter future. So it has invested heavily in new, automated 777X manufacturing equipment in Everett. The first preproduction test parts have been produced, the system is being fine-tuned and engineers are gearing up to start building parts for the first airplane, which will be assembled next year and tested to breaking point on the ground. Inside the vast Composite Wing Center, robotic "automated fiber placement" machines — designed and built by Mukilteo-based engineering firm Electroimpact — are days away from laying down the carbon fiber to begin making the long single-piece composite spars for the first airplane. Other carbon-fiber lamination machines build the composite wing skins and the long stiffening rods called stringers. Boeing steps up production at Gresham parts plant During a tour led by Eric Lindblad, vice president of 777X, the massive high-pressure oven called an autoclave was baking a set of stringers while nearby another automated machine was trimming and drilling a lower wing skin. In an adjacent building, two production lines of equipment are primed and ready in the next few months to take the freshly baked 777X spars and add the major fittings that will support the movable surfaces of the wing as well as the landing gear. Another robot — this one supplied by Spanish engineering firm MTorres — will drill and fasten the rib posts and stiffeners to the spars — each of them 105 feet long, 6 feet wide at the inboard end and a foot wide at the outboard end. In three subsequent stations, mechanics manually add the bigger complex fittings. Inside the main Everett assembly building, Boeing has set up the stations where the wings will be assembled. This equipment is another Electroimpact design, virtually identical to one it built for the Airbus A350 wing-assembly factory in Broughton, Wales — "but the next generation, with more capability," said Jason Clark, vice president of 777/777X operations. The front and rear spars of each wing are loaded lengthwise into the station along with crisscrossing metal wing ribs made in Frederickson, Pierce County, to form a ladderlike structure. Then a wing skin is placed on top or underneath and robots drill and fasten it all together. Lindblad said Boeing in the coming months will load a practice right-hand wing, one with the full geometric structure but without the internal systems installed, which it will use to make sure all the automated equipment works as it should. Changing everything All of this 777X-specific equipment is the relatively straightforward part of the project. Much trickier is that Boeing is simultaneously changing how it makes the current 777, so that the same final assembly equipment will handle either a current 777-300ER with a metal wing or a much bigger 777X with a carbon-fiber wing. It aims to seamlessly switch from one model to the next, with both current and next-generation versions going down the same line during the transition. But that entails completely changing everything. The wing's electrical, hydraulic and fuel systems are now installed with the wings laid flat on the factory floor, each wing sitting on jacks, instead of the former way of working on it as it hung vertically inside a four-story fixed jig. And those computer-controlled jacks move in unison to transport the wings along the floor to the center fuselage, where the wings are joined to the body. Whether it's a 777 wing or a 777X wing, which has a different sweep and meets the fuselage at a different angle — only the software instructions change. Since December, Boeing has successfully made 10 777s using this body-join system, which it continues to refine. The construction of the barrel-shaped fuselage sections is also completely changed. The large aluminum panels that arrive from Japan are now stitched together by robots instead of being manually fastened by mechanics as the panels are held in fixed jigs. Last year, this new robotic fuselage assembly was causing quality problems, with many fuselage barrels arriving at final assembly full of temporary fasteners or with mis-drilled holes. Now the fuselages built by robots are noticeably free of temporary fasteners. And the scaffolding that still surrounded them in December as mechanics struggled to fix the problems is gone. Brad Zaback, 777 deputy vice president and general manager, said fuselage robots are now producing every forward fuselage, every center fuselage and every other aft fuselage for the current 777s being built. He said the aft fuselage work will switch entirely to the robots later this year. Already, he said, the robotic-fuselage facility is producing high quality work, "as good as we've ever had" under the former fixed-jig assembly system. One 777 final-assembly mechanic agreed that the general quality of the robotic work had increased immensely since last year. Yet nothing in a factory setting is always perfect. When the aft fuselage barrel destined to be part of a 777 for Saudi Arabian Airlines arrived in the final-assembly bay last weekend, its circumferential joins were studded in temporary fasteners — a sign of significant unfinished work that was the result of a problem in fitting the floor. That was one of the aft sections built the old way in the fixed jigs, not by the robots, said Boeing spokeswoman Karen Crabtree. The 797 is coming The 777X transformation requires major construction and remodeling in 5 million square feet of Everett's factory space, even as production of the current planes continues. Clearly, it takes nerves of steel to undertake such a project. As if that were not difficult enough, Boeing's backroom engineers are getting ready for a further-out, all-new project. Though prosaically dubbed inside Boeing variously as the Middle of the Market (MOM) or New Mid-market Airplane (NMA), it's referred to already by outsiders as the 797. Boeing first publicly announced that it was studying this idea at the 2015 Paris Air Show. Two years on, Boeing has talked it over with 57 different airlines and clearly the project is much closer to reality. Mike Delaney, Boeing's vice president of new-airplane development, described the concept as a twin-aisle airplane seating 220 to 270 passengers with a medium range of 5,500 to 5,700 miles. This is a plane significantly bigger than the single-aisle 737. And though it has much less range than a 787 Dreamliner, it has enough to make it easily a transatlantic airplane. Boeing head of sales Ihssane Mounir said there's no airplane today fitting this specification, and many airlines are excited at the concept because it would allow them to open up entirely new and unserved routes — just as the 787 did in the ultralong-haul market. He cited Washington, D.C., to Budapest as an example. Such a plane could potentially entice low-cost carriers to open regional international flights such as routes around Southeast Asia or transatlantic. It might also replace many single-aisle jets flying the highly congested routes between China's three largest cities — Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. "I'm bullish about it," Mounir said. In his news briefing, new-airplane development chief Delaney made clear that the 797 study is far advanced. Most intriguingly, he said that the composite wing of this aircraft will look much like a smaller version of the tremendously slender and aerodynamically efficient 787 wing — but it will be built in a new way. "It's a radically different set of parts and assembly sequence and technology that is significantly lower cost," Delaney said, the result of what Boeing has learned from designing the 787, the first all-composite airplane, and then the composite wing of the 777X. He recalled that Walt Gillette, the lead engineer on the development of the 787, used to say that Boeing's first carbon-fiber composite airplane would be the most inefficient and heaviest composite jet that the company would ever build. "How right he was," said Delaney. "People don't understand the payback on investment we got on the 787 and how much we harvested on the 777X." Delaney added that the same learning curve applies to the airplane's fuselage, which suggests that Boeing may have in mind an all-composite design for the entire airframe. He hinted that he may reveal a few more details in Paris. Speaking about the potential 797, CEO McAllister said that details on who will build the pieces of it, and which sections Boeing will make itself rather than buy from a supplier, remain undecided — and may in the end diverge from what's been done in the past. "All of us are focused on the production-system transformation, on new engineering tools, new manufacturing tools," he said. He said Boeing has held detailed discussions on the proposed plane with the three major jet-engine makers but has not yet talked to any of its airframe-supplier partners. "We're taking a hard look at where the right competitive supply chain will be," McAllister said. "We're looking at make (versus) buy more strategically." Boeing's future in the Puget Sound region depends on the outcome of that hard look. As reassurance, McAllister cited the company's huge 777X investment here and the "great capability" in the local workforce. But he was also clear that Boeing must change, and nothing is guaranteed. He said that growing up in Bethlehem, Pa., "I remember very early in my life what happened when Bethlehem Steel lost the competitive advantage." He's hung a painting of that steel mill in his Boeing office. "It's a reminder that we have to reinvent ourselves every day," McAllister said. -- The Seattle Times View Comments About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

Following a slow start to 2017, Airbus is still playing catch-up to Boeing’s year-to-date firm order* totals. As of May 31, Airbus has 110 new orders booked, compared to Boeing’s 200, or $18.6 billion in sales versus Boeing’s $27 billion. The two manufacturers are more closely aligned on the delivery front, with Boeing’s delivery total as of May 31 at 268 commercial aircraft, compared to Airbus’ 241. Boeing delivered 55 aircraft in May and reported new firm orders for 13 commercial aircraft, valued at $3 billion. Additionally, Scandinavian leisure carrier Primera Air was unidentified as the customer behind an order for eight 737 MAX 9s originally placed in April, valued at $954 million. Airbus received two blockbuster orders in May with China Southern Airlines’ May 10 order for 20 A350-900 XWBs, valued at $6.2 billion, followed by a May 11 order by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines for 30 A321ceos, valued at $3.5 billion. Additionally, two undisclosed customers ordered five A320ceos and four A320neos during the month, respectively. Boeing posted a major order early in the month with a booking for 10 787-9s from Canada’s second-largest airline, Calgary-based low-cost carrier (LCC) WestJet, valued at $2.7 billion. Boeing booked one other firm order during the month—an undisclosed customer’s order for three 737-800s, valued at $294 million. Airbus delivered 59 aircraft to 32 airlines and eight lessors in May. The company’s major deliveries included four A320 family aircraft to Singapore-based lessor BOC Aviation (three A320ceos, bound for China Eastern Airlines, Indonesian LCC Citilink and Indian domestic carrier Vistara Airlines, respectively, and one A321ceo bound for Finnair); and three aircraft each to Indonesian LCC Lion Air (all A320ceos bound for its subsidiary Batik Air), Hanoi-based LCC VietJet (all A321ceos), Hong Kong-based China Aircraft Leasing Group (CALC) (two A321ceos for Moscow-based Nordwind Airline and one A320ceo for Shanghai-based LCC Spring Airlines), and US-Irish lessor GECAS (two A320neos bound for Air India and Avianca Brazil, respectively and one A321neo bound for Virgin America). Airbus delivered five A350-900 XWBs in May, including two to Singapore Airlines and one each to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, Taiwan-based China Airlines and Doha-based Qatar Airways. Additionally, all three of the major Gulf carriers—Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways—received a new A380 during the month. Boeing delivered a total of 55 aircraft to 31 airlines, six lessors and one unidentified customer in May. Dublin-based LCC Ryanair again topped the monthly delivery tally with seven 737-800s received. Norwegian received three 737-800s. Significant for Boeing in May was the first delivery of its re-engined 737 MAX aircraft as two 737 MAXs, a -8 and a-9, were delivered to Indonesia-based Lion Air Group. Malaysian carrier Malindo Air, a subsidiary of Lion Air Group, took delivery of the MAX 8 on May 16, and Lion Air Group took delivery of its MAX 9 on May 23. The delivery came a day after Boeing resumed flights of 737 MAX aircraft using CFM International LEAP-1B engines unaffected by an issue that prompted a suspension of all MAX flying the previous week. Boeing had suspended all 737 MAX flights May 10 after being informed by CFM, a GE Aviation/Safran Aircraft Engines joint venture, of a potential issue with the aircraft’s LEAP-1B engine. The suspension was implemented “out of an abundance of caution,” Boeing had said at the time. Boeing delivered six 777-300ERS to six customers during the month (China Eastern, Emirates, Kuwait Airways, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, and an unidentified customer). Additionally, the company delivered three 787-8s (one each to Spain’s Air Europa, Ethiopian Airlines and Singapore Airlines’ LCC subsidiary Scoot) and nine 787-9s (two to Air Canada and one each to Etihad Airways, China’s Hainan Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Vietnam Airlines, German travel and tourism company TUI Group, Los Angeles-based lessor International Lease Finance Corp. [ILFC] and the formerly US-based lessor CIT Aerospace, now owned by Chinese conglomerate HNA Group). *Note: ATW does not count military, government or private customer orders or deliveries in its commercial aircraft tallies.

Don't Freak Over Boeing's Self-Flying Plane—Robots Already Run the Skies Subscribe business culture design gear science security transportation photo video Search business culture design gear science security transportation photo video Photo Video Magazine Wired Insider Get Our Newsletter WIRED's biggest stories, delivered to your inbox. submit Author: Jack StewartJack Stewart transportation 06.09.17 02:01 pm Don't Freak Over Boeing's Self-Flying Plane—Robots Already Run the Skies Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images Share share tweet comment email Author: Jack StewartJack Stewart transportation 06.09.17 02:01 pm Don't Freak Over Boeing's Self-Flying Plane—Robots Already Run the Skies Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images Boeing just got into the autonomous aviation game, with the goal of building jetliners that fly themselves, no pilots required. “The basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development, said ahead of the Paris Airshow. The prospect of a pilotless passenger plane may strike you as crazy, even terrifying. But developing computer systems sophisticated enough to pull it off is well under way. Autopilot technology already does most of the work once a plane is aloft, and has no trouble landing an airliner even in rough weather and limited visibility. Boeing wants to take another step toward taking humans out of the equation by developing artificial intelligence capable of making even more of the decisions pilots make. Sinnett says Boeing plans to test such a system in a simulator this summer, and in a real plane next year. The State of Autopilot Autopilot is, at the most basic level, pretty simple: It uses the pilot's input to adjust and maintain the airplane's heading, altitude, and speed. The pilot doesn't use the yoke or pedals, but provides all of the commands that the computer executes. Airlines started using this tech decades ago. Over time, commercial aircraft added another layer of automation called the FMS, for flight management system. Once the pilot enters the flight plan, the flight management system determines the most efficient way of following it. The computerized system relies on a sophisticated network of sensors throughout the airplane to continually assess and adjust the speed, rate of climb, and other factors. At that point, the pilot can, for all intents, relax. “Legally we’re not allowed to go to sleep,” says Douglas M. Moss, an aviation consultant with AeroPacific Consulting who flies the Boeing 757 and 767. “But there are long times of what some people might consider boredom.” Pilot Still Required Pilots are still need to monitor the wind and weather conditions, track fuel consumption, and take control during turbulence and other situations. Autopilot can do the job, but humans do it better. “Every pilot can think of probably a dozen times, when you know the plane needs to go down, you think the plane knows it needs to go down, but for some reason the autopilot and the FMS have a different idea,” says Moss. Just how much the pilot does depends, in part, on where you are. In the US, airlines require pilots to maintain manual oversight and control. Asian carrier require pilots to use autopilot as much as possible. “Asiana prohibits the first officer from landing the plane by flying it, it must be automated,” says Moss. “The captain is prohibited from manually flying above 3,000 feet.” The type of plane plays a role, too. Airbus tends to rely more heavily on automation, giving the computer control unless the pilot overrides it. Boeing favors letting the human make the final decision with automated systems guiding and assisting, but not dictating. “Both have advantages and disadvantages,” says Clint Balog, a former test pilot who researches human performance, cognition, and error at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. “Airbus tries to avoid human error; Boeing tries to take advantage of human capability.” Either approach carries the risk of giving pilots less practice in real-world conditions, which could leave them less prepared for an emergency. Investigators saw this with Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June, 2009, killing the 228 people aboard. They attributed the crash to the sudden failure of the Airbus A330’s autopilot system. “In the minute that followed the autopilot disconnection, the failure of the attempts to understand the situation and the de-structuring of crew cooperation fed on each other until the total loss of cognitive control of the situation,” the official report notes. In other words, the cockpit crew didn't know what to do. “AF447 is the quintessential example of what can go wrong with automation,” says Balog. The flight crew didn’t understand the automation system, they simply trusted it. The captain could have saved the flight with a few simple actions, but made exactly the wrong decisions. The Human Stays Full autonomy promises to make flying even safer by removing the risk of human error. But many challenges remain. “We’re not at the point where some master machine can control the plane for the entire flight,” says Moss. For now, humans still beat computers when it comes to dealing with a medical emergency, security incidents, or a quick mechanical fix. But automation has already allowed airlines to cut the typical long-haul flight crew from three to two. As global air travel continues to grow, the pilot shortage will surely deepen. That provides the industry with a solid incentive for developing an AI that can take control with one human overseer in the cockpit. The biggest challenge may be convincing the public this really is safer. So you can add human nature to the list of challenges facing companies like Boeing as they race toward an autonomous future. For that reason, you'll probably see this technology deployed in cargo planes first, where cutting the size of the crew reins in operating costs. Rest assured, fellow travelers—you'll remain under the watchful eye of an actual pilot, as well as an autopilot, for the foreseeable future.

BOEING By DiversityInc Staff / June 9, 2017 Boeing (a DiversityInc Noteworthy Company) will deliver the U.S. Navy’s first deployable P-8A Poseidon trainers, allowing aircrew and operators to improve their mission readiness even while serving away from home. Under a recently signed contract, Boeing will provide seven Deployable Mission Readiness Trainers (DMRTs) to the Navy, starting in 2019. “Training ensures the Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance community is proficient in anti-submarine warfare. By using these trainers, crews are trained without adding flight hours to the aircraft,” said CDR. John Thoe, P-8A training systems integrated product team lead. “DMRTs will fulfill these important requirements by providing high-fidelity, crew-based training to deployed squadrons.” The proposed DMRT design is portable with low-power requirements and includes Boeing’s Weapons Tactics Trainer system, which incorporates sonobuoy and ocean acoustics modeling. The U.S. Navy trains P-8A Poseidon aircrews at naval air stations in Jacksonville, Fla., and Whidbey Island, Wash. Seventy percent of the training for P-8A aircrews takes place in simulators and other trainers; the remaining 30 percent uses the actual aircraft. Boeing is also under contract to deliver a complete P-8A training system to the Royal Australian Air Force, beginning in 2018. For more about Defense, Space & Security, visit www.boeing.com.

The teaming, which will leverage design and production facilities in California, Virginia and Florida, to expand the autonomous paradigm for UUV's for the Navy's Advanced Undersea Prototyping program. "This partnership provides the Navy a cost-effective, low-risk path to meet the emergent needs that prompted the Navy's Advanced Undersea Prototyping program," said Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a press release. "We are combining Boeing's preeminent UUV maritime engineering team with our nation's leading shipbuilder and Navy technical services company to get operational vehicles to the Navy years ahead of the standard acquisition process." Boeing is currently testing a large UUV, Echo Voyager. The vehicle is designed for multiple missions and could include a modular payload bay of up to 34 feet. It is fully autonomous, requiring no support vessel for launch or recovery.

The military branch continues to believe that Boeing will meet the required assets available deadline in October 2018. RAA calls for the firm to hand over 18 KC-46s and nine air refueling pods to the Air Force, the report added. Breaking Defense also reported that Boeing remains optimistic that it can deliver the first tanker aircraft by December. “The majority of developmental testing is complete, which reduces risk to the certification and verification testing,” Caroline Hutcheson, a spokeswoman for Boeing, said in an email. “Additionally, we recently added a 6th aircraft (the second low-rate initial production plane) to the flight test program, which will help with test efficiency and improve our ability to complete ground and flight test points going forward.” Hutcheson noted that the firm has not identified any technical risk after the aircraft logged 1,700 flight test hours, the report added.

A statement issued in Accra by Mrs Hanna Atnafu, Manager Corporate Communications, Ethiopian Airlines said the Airline also took the opportunity to take delivery of yet another B787 aircraft from Boeing. It said Ethiopian and Boeing have synergized with Conscience International (CI), Horn of Africa Neonatal Development Services and Seattle Alliance Outreach (SAO) organisations for the deliveries. Mr Tewolde GebreMariam, Group CEO Ethiopian Airlines said: 'For us, fulfilling our corporate social responsibilities is as important as our focus on pure business performance.' He said this round of their humanitarian delivery was a continuation of their commendable collaboration with Boeing that had served as a source of vital service for our community and neighbouring countries as well. 'Moreover, we are pleased to name our 18th B787 after Mother Teresa, who is always remembered as an icon of philanthropy. As a responsible corporate citizen, Ethiopian will continue to contribute on the socio-economic development of the country by relentlessly delivering on its corporate social responsibilities, 'he added. He said 'On the other hand, pursuant to our fleet modernization plan and to further meet the ever growing demand of our customers, we are in bold move of modernising and expanding our fleet, networks and facilities.' He said this move would further ensure unmatched combination of operational flexibility, efficiency and passenger comfort that would allow Ethiopian to achieve its goal to be the leading Aviation Group in Africa and a leading global airline. Currently, Ethiopian has 18 B787 in operation, deployed on its long haul passenger routes, and will receive the 19th by the end of June, ferrying medical equipment and supplies for St Paul's Hospital.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori) Aerospace blog Boeing complaint to US: Bombardier unfairly subsidized Dan Catchpole Fri Jun 9th, 2017 3:07pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Related: Trade organization rejects most European claims against Boeing EVERETT — Boeing’s top lawyers say the aerospace giant’s trade dispute with Canada’s Bombardier is about ensuring fair play in the high-stakes world of jetliner sales. Boeing accused Bombardier of selling its new single-aisle CSeries airplanes to Delta Air Lines at cut-rate prices, which it could only do thanks to massive cash infusions since last year from the Canadian and Quebec governments. Boeing says it would have to sell 737s at a loss to compete with the low-ball prices. In April, Boeing filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, accusing Bombardier of dumping its airplanes in the American market, and asking the federal government to slap price penalties on CSeries airplanes imported into the United States. Boeing alleged that Delta agreed to buy the planes at $19.6 million apiece, well below the $33.2 million Boeing estimates it costs to build one of the aircraft. Bombardier has rejected the claim, saying the CSeries does not directly compete with the larger 737s and that the price Delta agreed to pay is higher than asserted by Boeing. The commission ruled Friday that Boeing may have been hurt by the Delta deal. The trade panel now must determine how Boeing’s business was hurt or affected by Bombardier sales. Part of the case is handled by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is investigating whether to impose duties on imported CSeries. Boeing wants the price increased by nearly 80 percent. A preliminary decision from the Commerce Department is scheduled for July. The commission handles cases quickly compared to other legal venues, and a final decision for Boeing’s complaint is scheduled in February. Either side can appeal the outcome to a special federal district court in New York, called the U.S. Court of International Trade. The complaint is about the big picture, John Demers, a vice president and assistant general counsel at Boeing, told The Daily Herald. As with Boeing’s subsidy dispute with Airbus in the World Trade Organization, “we are trying to establish and elaborate the rules that will govern government support for aerospace.” Boeing doesn’t “want to be in a position of competing with government subsidies,” Demers said. The action against Bombardier is “frankly just a continuation” of Boeing’s fight with Airbus, in terms of taking on market-skewing subsidies, he said. While the WTO legal fight grinds on, the international trade forum has determined that both Airbus and Boeing have received illegal public support, and that Airbus benefited much more from that money. Airbus continues to lead Boeing in current orders, especially in the biggest slice of the jetliner market: single-aisle airplanes — the workhorses of commercial air travel. Boeing upgraded its 737 with the 737 MAX in 2011, but it still trails Airbus’ A320neo, which launched in 2010, in orders. Bombardier squeaked into the single-aisle market with its CSeries, which it started taking orders for in 2013. Prior to that, the company had focused on regional jets, which typically hold fewer than 100 passengers. The CSeries has two versions: the CS100 and the slightly larger CS300. Other companies want to break into the lucrative single-aisle market, as well. The Chinese-built Comac C919 recently had its maiden flight, and Russia’s Irkut is developing its MC-21. Both planes seat more than 150 passengers, the market segment with the most demand. Neither is expected to sell into Western countries, but both have picked up orders in their home countries. China is expected to buy more airplanes in the coming decades than any other country. With competition only increasing, Boeing decided it could not ignore Bombardier, said Robert Novick, a co-managing partner at WilmerHale, which represents Boeing in the case. “It’s a big problem,” he said. Bombardier can use the public bailouts it got to crack into the single-aisle market, and then build a bigger airplane, picking up more orders, he said. It is similar to how Airbus broke into the jetliner market in the 1970s, he said. Boeing must make it clear to Bombardier “and maybe others around the world that also need a message that this won’t be tolerated,” Novick said. The complaint has left many industry watchers scratching their heads. Going after Bombardier seems to offer limited reward — price protection limited to the U.S. and for an airplane that is a sliver of Boeing’s order book. At the same time, the move raises plenty of risks, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at the Teal Group, a consulting firm based in Northern Virginia. The dispute could cost Boeing billions of dollars worth of business from Canada’s military and from Delta Air Lines, the world’s second biggest air carrier. After Boeing filed the complaint, Canada stopped negotiating to buy 18 F/A-18 Super Hornets from Boeing. Delta is expected later this year to shop around for about 70 single-aisle airplanes. Boeing’s antidumping complaint could give Airbus an edge in that competition. To win the trade commission case, Boeing must show that it will be hurt by Bombardier’s deal with Delta for up to 125 CSeries jets. Boeing claims that the low sales price has undermined its ability to sell its smallest 737s — the current 737-700 and its successor, the 737 MAX 7, which is in development. Scott Hamilton, an aerospace industry expert based on Bainbridge Island, maintains Boeing’s problem is an inferior product, not Canada. “The 737 MAX 7 is undermining the 737 MAX 7,” he said. The original design came up short against the CS300, so Boeing increased its size, making it more economical for airlines to fly. However, the airplane is largely seen by industry analysts as a niche product for airports with short runways or at high altitude. Boeing has only a handful of orders for the plane. Bombardier has not picked up any more orders since winning the Delta competition in 2016. Russia and China have given far more direct government support to their fledgling airplane makers. Neither Novick nor Demers ruled out the possibility of legal action in those instances in the future. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

Responsibility for the success or failure of the new initiatives falls to a relative newcomer: Kevin McAllister, a 27-year General Electric Co. veteran. On the job a little more than six months, he’s the first outsider to run Boeing’s US$65 billion (RM277 billion) commercial airplanes division. The multibillion-dollar bets he’s guiding represent Boeing’s response to the sales boom Airbus has enjoyed by inexpensively updating older jet programmes. The riskiest gamble is on an all-new Boeing aircraft family to cover the gap between the biggest narrow-body planes and smallest wide-bodies. Another is for a larger 737 Max, expected to launch later this month, to take on Airbus’s hot-selling A321neo. Both members of the global jetliner duopoly also have to contend with aircraft-development programs in Russia and China. That takes McAllister back to the painting in his office depicting the heyday of the steel works in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, his hometown. The memory of the now-shuttered mills helps provide perspective, he said, that success isn’t assured for the titans of US industry — not even for Boeing, the country’s largest exporter. “It’s a reminder that as a company we have to reinvent ourselves every day,” McAllister, who now works out of a Seattle-area office park, said during his first meeting with reporters June 2. Max 10 The first of the new planes likely to hit the market is the 737 Max 10, which would be the largest version of Boeing’s workhorse single-aisle plane. The company is in discussions with about a dozen potential buyers of the Max 10, which is aimed at curbing the A321’s appeal, said Ihssane Mounir, Boeing’s chief airplane salesman. Development costs Development costs for Boeing will probably be less than US$1 billion (RM4.26 billion) for the plane, with other suppliers footing more of the bill, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. The aircraft will be five feet longer than the Max 9, and feature a taller, semi-levered landing gear borrowed largely from Boeing’s 777 wide-body jetliner. “It’s a relatively minor development programme for us to do,” McAllister said. While the Boeing plane is comparable in terms of seating, it’s expected to burn about 5 per cent less fuel than the heavier Airbus rival. As McAllister learns Boeing’s culture and walks the floors of its factories, he and his team are also meeting weekly on a more ambitious project Boeing has long been studying: its first all-new jetliner family since the 787 Dreamliner a decade ago. It won’t be cheap. Development could cost US$10 billion to US$15 billion based on past programmes, Aboulafia said. And that’s if the process goes smoothly. The Dreamliner’s engineering changes, cost overruns and supplier stumbles saddled the company with nearly US$30 billion in deferred production costs following a soaring investment in development. New Markets The goal of the new airplane concept — dubbed the 797 by aircraft-leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy — is to generate new travel markets when the planes debut in the mid-2020s. The twin-aisle, oval-shaped jets would link cities that can’t be efficiently served by current aircraft models on medium-length flights, said Mike Delaney, a Boeing vice president and general manager for airplane development. Boeing sees an underserved market for planes seating between 220 and 270 passengers. They would fly about 5,000 nautical miles, connecting Chinese cities to Southeast Asia, crossing the Atlantic or joining the US to destinations deeper into Latin America. “We’re going to do exactly in that market what we did with the 787,” Delaney said. “Put in an airplane that’s able to fly about 30 per cent more city pairs.” The strategy aims to mirror the more than 140 new routes pioneered by the Dreamliner, without the 787’s troubled start. Boeing has studied and changed its engineering and development process after the first carbon-fiber jetliner fell years behind schedule. Boeing is using a processing capability, called the “digital twin,” to design parts and configure the production system around the new aircraft’s architecture, from automation to tooling. Following a process that has been honed with the 737 Max and 777X should lessen engineering error and disruption in the factory, Delaney said. Airbus plan The proposed jets would also replace the Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft that dominated the market spanning the largest narrow-bodies and smallest twin-aisle planes. Airbus has been chipping away at that by adding new engines to the A321 narrow-body and smallest twin-aisle A330neo model. The US planemaker was slow to respond earlier this decade when Airbus began marketing the redesigned A321neo as the heir to the out-of-production Boeing 757. The Airbus plane became a surprise bestseller, garnering more than 1,400 orders. Boeing executives were averse to “moonshots” after the 787’s costly development process and “it wasn’t clear that the A321neo was going to gather strength,” Aboulafia said. “They’ve got to hope this new plane will unlock a new point-to-point strategy.” The European planemaker is looking at expanding the A321neo, which can seat as many as 240 people, Airbus’s chief salesman John Leahy told reporters this week. “It’s not just the threat itself,” he said in reference to Boeing’s new plane. “We listen to our customers.” ‘Row 65E’ Delaney insists Boeing’s twin-aisle jet would be superior to an even longer Airbus single-aisle plane. “I certainly wouldn’t want to be in row 65E, waiting to get off,” he said. Boeing is working with 57 potential customers as it hones designs, range and potential fuel savings, McAllister said. It’s not sufficient to identify a market opportunity. The real challenge lies in developing a business case that will win the approval of Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and company directors. “We have to bring Dennis and the board a dog that hunts,” he said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit expected to trade cautiously next week Stock bulls tested as Nasdaq rout exposes market’s vulnerability Extended consolidation, rotational play expected next week China condemns EU for new steel anti-dumping duties EU antitrust regulators to investigate US$38b Qualcomm, NXP deal Ringgit slightly higher against US dollar in early trade Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week Safitex has not made payment since FY15, says FGV board Bursa to be firmer next week Qatar crisis draws mediation effort as Saudis tighten screws Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Boeing said to woo United, Lion in bid to buttress Max 10 launch Boeing must get 737 MAX engine approval to fly again Boeing profit jumps 19pc, full-year target lifted 11 things I never knew about flying… until I became a flight attendant Boeing, aerospace manufacturers back US tax overhaul Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Strear’s inflammatory, factually errant missive claims the Brandeis-Bardin camp community is “under assault” by community members and organizations who support the full cleanup of nuclear and chemical contamination at the Santa Susana Field Lab located directly above the camp. The cleanup to which Strear objects is required by agreements voluntarily signed by the state Department of Toxic Substances Control, NASA and the Department of Energy. In fact, the community is under assault by those agencies, Boeing Co. and AJU, who are now working together to break the cleanup agreements. If they prevail, they will sentence the community to perpetual risk from hazardous SSFL contaminants that migrate off site. Strear parrots SSFL polluters’ claims that there is no off-site migration, when in fact off-site contamination is documented in numerous reports (except those referenced by Strear, which were mostly produced by Boeing). Strear grossly mischaracterizes the multi-year, independent, federally funded study conducted by UCLA’s Yoram Cohen, claiming it differs from a 1999 “study” by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. In fact, what ATSDR produced in 1999 was only a brief overview to determine if more detailed study was needed. It concluded affirmatively, and ATSDR subsequently paid Cohen and his team to conduct that comprehensive study. Strear also repeats Boeing’s absurd claims that the SSFL cleanup is somehow worse than the contamination. In fact, most of the cleanup will occur in areas previously defiled by decades of sloppy environmental practices, and cultural resources are explicitly protected by the cleanup agreements. Strear’s outrageous attacks on scientists and cleanup advocates indicate frustration that AJU’s considerable efforts to deny off-site SSFL contamination haven’t made its problems go away. If AJU truly wants to assure the public that its property is safe, it should support, not attack, a full cleanup of SSFL. Only then can we be certain that contamination will not migrate further. Communities near SSFL, as well as Brandeis-Bardin workers and visitors—mostly children—deserve better.

Leadership in the balance amid Tory fury Donald Trump to file legal complaint against James Comey © Reuters Boeing’s new 737 MAX 9 aircraft is seen during takeoff on its first flight in Renton, Washington, U.S., April 13, 2017. REUTERS/Craig Larsen-Boeing Handout Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. © REUTERS/Alwyn Scott Kevin McAllister chief executive of Boeing's jetliner business is seen at a briefing in Renton Washington Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and "fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make", he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes. "I have no idea how we're going to do that," Sinnett said. "But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the "Miracle on the Hudson," Sinnett said. "If it can't, then we can't go there." A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. "This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors'" he said, referring to rival Airbus. "It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?"

According to The Tide source, the agreement was signed on Monday, in Lagos, by Mrs Tokunbor Fagbemi, Managing Director, Springfountain and Mr Larry Tolliver, Head of Sales, West and Central Africa, the Boeing Company. Speaking at the ceremony, Fagbemi said the proposed investment would be carried out through the African Aircraft Leasing Company (AALC), OEM Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Centre, African Aircraft Spare Parts Company (AASC) and Aggregated Services Solutions. Fagbemi said it would cover aircraft leasing, maintenance, repair and overhaul, spares logistics and supply, as well as aggregated services solutions. She noted that the absence of such facilities and services in Africa were some of the major challenges faced by the Nigerian airlines and the aviation sector. Fagbemi said : “We, as dynamic Nigerians and as patriotic citizens of this great nation have made Nigeria our first port of call to situate, subject to provision of all the necessary enabling environment, free of the risk of expropriation. “We believe that through this venture, we would have added our quota to ensure that Nigeria does not lose out, as African aviation is gathering momentum and countries within Africa are repositioning, developing culture, business, economy etc, around aviation and increased intra-continental air connectivity.’’ According to her, the facilities and services will require the local skills in diverse fields ranging from piloting, aviation engineering, aviation economics and aviation law, thereby creating employment opportunities for Nigerians. She, however, appealed to the Nigerian government to make travelling affordable and convenient for the Nigerian masses, noting that the country only had 15 million domestic and foreign travellers, out of a population of 180 million. “We want to work with government and the aviation industry to bring brand new aircraft which hopefully will bring down the cost of operations for operators and bring down the cost of airfare for passengers in Africa. “We, therefore, call on government to facilitate the implementation of the Yamoussoukro Declaration (YD) and the African Union Declaration 2063,’’ Fagbemi said. She also urged the government to create an enabling environment for the projects to take off by way of policies and waivers, as well as investment in aviation education, skill building and skill development. Also speaking, Tolliver said the partnership was aimed at improving Boeing’s services to its clients, adding that Springfountain had demonstrated sufficient commitment towards making it a success. On his part, Minister of State, Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, congratulated Springfountain on the attainment of the strategic relationship with Boeing. Sirika, represented by  Director of Operations, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Capt. Sidi Abdullahi,  said the partnership was expected to bring in innovative solutions that would assist in solving major issues bedeviling the Nigerian aviation industry.

For illustration only. Boeing in tie-up for unmanned undersea vehicles WASHINGTON, 1 days ago Boeing and Huntington Ingalls Industries are teaming on the design and production of Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in support of the US Navy’s Extra Large UUV programme. “This partnership provides the Navy a cost-effective, low-risk path to meet the emergent needs that prompted the Navy’s Advanced Undersea Prototyping program,” said Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works. “We are combining Boeing’s preeminent UUV maritime engineering team with our nation’s leading shipbuilder and Navy technical services company to get operational vehicles to the Navy years ahead of the standard acquisition process.” Boeing is currently testing its newest and largest UUV, Echo Voyager, off the Southern California coast. The vehicle is designed for multiple missions and could include a modular payload bay of up to 34 feet, offering enhanced endurance and increased payload capacity over traditional UUVs. Echo Voyager is fully autonomous, requiring no support vessel for launch or recovery, enabling operation at sea for months before returning to port. “We look forward to a long relationship with Boeing as we embark together to field this unmanned force-multiplier for the Navy,” said Andy Green, executive vice president of Huntington Ingalls Industries and president of the company’s Technical Solutions division. “I am confident this team will continue redefining the autonomy paradigm for UUVs.” – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | More Industry, Logistics & Shipping Stories DP World unit buys Spanish maritime services operator Sadara starts BGE production at Saudi plant FGB picks Durapipe for new Abu Dhabi HQ Etihad Cargo, Royal Air Maroc to increase cooperation APM Terminals Bahrain welcomes largest vessel Alba sees solid jump in N America exports Cardtek, NXP in UAE mobile wallet partnership Batelco unveils special Ramadan offers US mulls expansion of electronics ban to 71 airports Electric vehicles hit record 2m cars in 2016 Dubai group joins IFS channel network EK Kanoo unit launches calibration service Clarksons Platou opens its fourth largest office in Dubai Signtrade to showcase key solutions at SGI Dubai Siemon launches bulk packaging options for optics Luxury brands ‘continue growth in ME markets’ Global superyachts market set for 7pc growth Empower in new payment deal with ENBD SR Technics, VAS Aero Services ink repair deal UAE ministry, Jafza to develop pharma sector Siemens wins Jordan power plant order Workz ranked world's largest scratch card producer Bosch Middle East sales hit $490m in 2016 Top ME ports ban chokes Qatar's commodity trade Iran growth to slow to 4pc in 2017: World Bank ArcelorMittal JV buys Italy's largest steel company EGA opens new head office complex in Abu Dhabi Tawuniya rolls out insurance programme for SMEs RAK Ceramics partners with American University in Dubai Siemens lands $462m Dewa maintenance contract Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

As predicted, the service’s latest tanker will miss its projected September deadline, said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Emily Grabowski. “The top issues slowing progress are achieving the [Federal Aviation Administration] airworthiness certifications and completing the flight test program,” she said in an email. “Once Boeing receives the remaining design approvals from the FAA, they expect testing to proceed on a faster pace.” Grabowski said Boeing believes it can deliver an aircraft by December and establish a set of equipment and procedures for airmen by October 2018, as planned. Related content: KC-46 Refueling Tanker Faces More Delays, Auditors Say How Many Fighter Jets Does the Air Force Need? Military.com Equipment Guide: Aircraft The Air Force “will continue to support Boeing’s efforts to execute the program” but believes the  first delivery will be “beyond” those dates: late spring of 2018, Grabowski said. The delivery push comes as no surprise after the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, issued a report in March disclosing that testing on the tanker might further delay the program. “GAO’s analysis shows there is risk to the current delivery schedule due to potential delays in Federal Aviation Administration certifications and key test events,” the report’s analysis reads. “Boeing must also complete over 1,700 test points on average for each month from February to September 2017, a level that is more than double what it completed in the last 11 months,” it said. Boeing was supposed to deliver the initial 18 aerial-refueling planes by August 2017. With ongoing snafus throughout the program — which began in 2013 — such as initial design problems with its refueling boom, Boeing and Air Force officials earlier said the first delivery could be delayed to February 2018. The GAO noted it was more likely to be October 2018 — if that. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, the Air Force’s military deputy for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Acquisition at the Pentagon, told reporters Wednesday that he isn’t frustrated with the setback. “Well, I don’t like delays,” he said after a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. “Boeing is throwing resources and doing everything they can to pull it back; they’re doing everything they can to try to execute. That’s the part I’m very upbeat about. “We’re all for that. We would welcome that, and we will provide them the resources we can to make that happen,” Bunch said. The Air Force awarded Boeing a fixed-price $4.9 billion contract in 2011. The company is responsible for any cost overruns.

The roster of potential buyers of the largest-ever 737, which is expected to launch this month, spans the globe. Initial sales prospects include Indonesia’s Lion Mentari Airlines, the aircraft-leasing arm of China’s development bank, Jet Airways India, SpiceJet and Copa Holdings, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The U.S. manufacturer is seeking a groundswell of orders to demonstrate the Max 10’s market appeal and strike back at the A321neo, Airbus’s largest narrow-body jet, which is capturing trans-continental routes once dominated by Boeing’s out-of-production 757. The Max 10 talks aren’t final and Airbus could still try to thwart the sales ahead of the Paris Air Show later this month. A spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing declined to comment on the talks. Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, declined to comment on a potential order, as did CDB Aviation Lease Finance, the Chinese aircraft lessor, Jet Airways and SpiceJet. Lion and Panama City-based Copa didn’t immediately comment. The newest 737 Max would seat about 220 passengers in a single-cabin layout popular with budget carriers while burning about 5 percent less fuel than its similarly sized Airbus rival, according to the U.S. company. The Boeing jet isn’t slated to enter the commercial market until 2020. Airbus delivered the first A321neo earlier this year and has garnered 1,416 total orders, according to the company’s website. “We aren’t looking to simply build something on par with the A321neo,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing. “We’re bringing a better airplane to the market — and that’s our focus.” Airbus sales chief John Leahy dismissed the competitive threat in comments to reporters this week, saying the U.S. plane maker was responding to the A321neo only because the Airbus plane outsold the Max 9 by a four-to-one ratio. The Max 10’s frame would be five feet longer than that of the Max 9. Boeing doesn’t break out its Max sales by variant. Boeing is “flailing about, trying to come up with some answer to it that doesn’t cost them a fortune,” Leahy said. “Usually those things in aviation don’t work successfully.” United Continental Holdings is studying whether to convert 61 orders for the 737 Max to the 10 version, while taking a handful of Boeing 777-300ERs, the largest twin-engine jetliner currently flying, some of the people said. The carrier gained the production slots last year after it converted an earlier order for the Boeing 737-700 to the Max. The Chicago-based airline is also considering an A321neo order, the people said.

PHOTO: BOEING Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world’s biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,” said Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and “fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make”, he said. Airbus unveils modular, flying car concept Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don’t yet know how to certify such planes. “I have no idea how we’re going to do that,” Sinnett said. “But we’re studying it right now and we’re developing those algorithms.” Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the “Miracle on the Hudson,” Sinnett said. “If it can’t, then we can’t go there.” Airbus offers a peek at its flying taxi A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. “This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies – not by ours or our competitors'” he said, referring to rival Airbus. “It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?” Read more: aviation , Boeing , Latest Read full story Recommended Stories World's largest plane unveiled Project backed by billionaire Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen Made-in-China jet takes maiden flight Plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on imported aircraft Non-stop flights from Australia to London almost a reality As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Most of us will gripe as we dart from one air-conditioned space to the next. Such tough, first-world problems. How on Earth did our ancestors keep their cool before 1902, when Willis Carrier invented a contraption that would "condition the air"? A Mental Floss story explains how people coped, when they weren't wading into their favorite lakes. They slept on porches, used ceiling fans, only staying in upper rooms at night. They slept in their basements, which stayed comfortable. A few tormented souls slept in refrigerated sheets and kept underwear in the freezer. I have to try that, and hope my wife doesn't freak out. Expect mid-90s today with a heat index near 100F. Heavy T-storms sprout Sunday, keeping us noticeably cooler. I see another surge of 90s Tuesday before midweek T-storms mark the approach of cooler, less humid air. A heat wave builds across the USA in the coming weeks, but a series of cool puffs from the Canadian Provinces will take the edge off our heat. A free Minnesota cool front by late June? Frozen undies optional. Life Before Air Conditioning. Here's an excerpt of the Mental Floss story I referenced in today's column. Our ancestors were tough - no question. I fear we've gotten soft: "...Ceiling fans accentuate the effect by pulling air up during the summer, and pushing warmer air down in the winter. Older homes with more than one story took advantage of the stack effect, as open stairwells vented heat upstairs. That's why upper floors were only used at night, with the windows open. Some houses even had a tower or turret to act as a windcatcher or heat exhaust vent. Shade trees planted on the east and west sides of a home block the summer sun before it warms the home exterior. They also cool down breezes slightly before they enter the porch area. Awnings and window overhangs provide the same effect, and let more sunshine in during the winter, when the sun hangs lower..." Heat Advisory Posted. The combination of heat + humidity will create a heat index close to 100F by mid-afternoon. Take it easy out there. Details from the Twin Cities National Weather Service. 100-Degree Heat Index Today? It doesn't seem like much of a stretch if the sun stays out most of the day, meaning at least mid-90s with a dew point well up into the 60s, making it feel like 100F from the Twin Cities metro to Mankato and Fairmont/Albert Lea by 3 pm or so. Excessive Heat Predicted for the Coming Week Could Affect Your Medication. Not only the heat, but sunlight can impact the efficacy of certain medications. Dr. Marshall Shepherd explains at Forbes: "...According to information on the Baystate Health organization website, there are standards for storing medications that have been set by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention. The guidance on the website One of the standards established by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention is to keep medications stored at room temperature, which is defined as between 68 to 77 degrees F. However, most pharmacists will agree that they are still safe between 58 to 86 degrees F. Medications can also be affected by direct sunlight. Excessive heat or direct sunlight can render some medications less potent. Baystate Health organization experts suggest that medications taken for diabetes and heart disease are particularly vulnerable...Other particularly heat sensitive medications include those used to treat the thyroid and for birth control. Medications with hormones, albuterol inhalers, diazepam, and lorazepam are also listed..." Hot Start to June. After a minor cooling correction in May June is trending warmer than average again. Here's a clip from this week's Minnesota WeatherTalk, courtesy of Dr. Mark Seeley: "After a cooler than normal May, June has begun much warmer than normal, with most southern and western communities reporting multiple daytime highs in the 90s F so far. Places like Browns Valley and Milan have already reported highs of 96 degrees F, and temperatures will go higher than that this weekend in many places. Observers across the state are reporting average temperatures for the month so far that are from 5 to 8 degrees F warmer than normal. Also unlike last month, bright sunny skies are dominant, and the landscape has dried out quite a bit. Many areas are in need of a good rain. In fact portions of northwestern and north-central Minnesota have seen deficits in precipitation since March 1st. Some are as much as 5-7 inches below normal in precipitation since that date. As a result the Drought Monitor shows these parts of the state to be in moderate drought..." Dress for Hot Weather Success. Although survival is probably a good place to start. Thanks to HealthTalkUMN at the University of Minnesota. Severe Flooding in Wyoming. All that snow that fell is now melting in a hurry, confirming official's worst fears. The language used in the warning above underscores the gravity of the situation in Wyoming and  much of the western USA. Avoid a Heat-Related Vehicle Disaster. Keep in mind your vehicle quickly becomes an oven, a hyper-local greenhouse effect during the summer months. According to NOAA studies an outside air temperature of only 80F can translate into 99F after only 10 minutes; 109F within 20 minutes. Don't even think about leaving a child (or pet) in a car or truck. Pitchers More Likely to Hit Batters in Hot Weather. Yes, hot weather seems to have all of us on edge, according to a post at Yale Climate Connections: "...That’s Rick Larrick of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. He studies decision-making, and says hot weather has been linked to more aggressive behavior. He studied baseball statistics and found that pitchers are slightly more likely to retaliate when it’s hot. He speculates it’s because people are already on edge. Larrick: “Once you are uncomfortable and irritable, you are just more easily agitated, and the same kind of insult or offense seems bigger...” Photo credit: "Rick Larrick at the Cardinals Hall of Fame in St. Louis." Spring Was 8th Warmest, 11th Wettest. NOAA NCEI has details on spring weather across the USA in relation to a 123 year weather record: "The spring (March–May) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 53.5°F, 2.6°F above the 20th century average, driven in large part by warmth during the early and middle part of the season. Much-above-average spring temperatures were observed in the Rockies, Southern Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. The May average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 60.6°F, 0.4°F above average, and ranked near the middle of the 123-year period of record. Parts of the West and Southeast were warmer than average with near- to below-average temperatures in parts of the central and eastern U.S..." Starting Hurricane Season Without Leaders of NOAA and FEMA Should "Scare the Hell Out of Everbody". CNN.com has details: "...The two agencies that protect the country's coast lines and its residents, NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are still without leaders -- positions that must be appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate. "That should scare the hell out of everybody," retired US Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré told CNN. "These positions help save lives." Honoré knows all too well the value that leadership plays during a crisis, as he commanded Joint Task Force Katrina. He coordinated military relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré talks to his soldiers at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, on September 8, 2005. Despite concerns, FEMA and NOAA say they are prepared for the hurricane season and the aftermath of any storms that make landfall and cause damage..." (File image of Hurricane Dennis: NASA). 2016 State of U.S. High Tide Flooding. With slowly rising seas many cities no longer require a major storm for storm surge flooding as reported by NOAA NCDC: "...This month's State of the Climate report includes an annual update of the state of coastal high tide flooding. Sometimes called nuisance or sunny day flooding, this type of flooding occurs when water levels measured at a NOAA tide gauges exceed locally established heights associated with minor impacts, such as water on low-lying streets or infiltration into storm-water systems. Such coastal flooding is increasing in frequency, depth and extent in many areas of the U.S. due to on-going increases in local relative sea level. Decades ago, coastal flooding mostly occurred during strong storms. Today, it occurs more frequently during high-tide cycles and calmer weather. Though high tide flooding today is rarely life threatening, it is a serious concern in several communities, such as Norfolk, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina and Miami, that are not protected by flood control structures that cities like New Orleans have in place. Several cities experienced more than a month (30 days) of daily flooding in 2016: Wilmington, NC (84 days); Charleston, SC (50 days); Honolulu, HI (45 days); Annapolis, MD (42 days); Savannah, GA (38 days); Washington D.C. (33 days); and Port Isabel, TX (31 days) due to a combination of low-lying coastal topography and high sea levels during 2016..." U.S. Coastal Cities Will Flood More Often and More Severely, Study Warns. More perspective at InsideClimate News: "...Oppenheimer says he's most concerned about chronic, but less-extreme flooding along the East Coast, including the south shore of New York's Long Island, the low country around Charleston, S.C., and south Florida, where tidal flooding already has become an everyday occurrence. "These areas have terrain that's gently sloped," Oppenheimer said. "South Florida is really in trouble. Not only are they having a lot of nuisance flooding, but they sit on limestone, which makes it extremely difficult to build coastal defenses. These places really have to get on the ball and decide what they have to protect." But adapting for the risk takes time, political will and money..." Map credit: Nature Climate Change. Science Says: Weather Forecasts Improve, Under the Radar. It's far from perfect, but the weather forecast continues to improve over time, according to new data highlighted in an Associated Press story: "Make fun of the weatherman if you want but modern forecasts have quietly, by degrees, become much better. Meteorologists are now as good with their five-day forecasts as they were with their three-day forecasts in 2005. Both government and private weather forecasting companies are approaching the point where they get tomorrow’s high temperature right nearly 80 percent of the time. It was 66 percent 11 years ago, according to ForecastWatch , a private firm that rates accuracy of weather forecasts..." Report: National Weather Service Meteorologists "Fatigued" and "Demoralized" by Understaffing. Just in case you missed this from Angela Fritz at Capital Weather Gang: "The employees of the National Weather Service are demoralized, according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office. They are understaffed and spread thin, covering shifts and positions beyond what they were hired to fill. The weather never sleeps, and apparently neither does the Weather Service. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of vacant staff meteorologist positions increased 57 percent. In the same time, management vacancies decreased by 29 percent. The mission of the Weather Service — to protect lives and property — is critical, so the employees are completing the tasks. But it comes at a cost. The GAO used some pretty gloomy language to describe the employees’ current state of mind..." Florida Tech Study Confirms Lightning More Powerful Over Water. Here's a clip of another article that caught my eye, courtesy of Florida Tech: "...Nag and Cummins found that with strikes over water in western Florida, the median stepped-leader duration was 17 percent shorter over ocean than over land, and in eastern Florida the median durations were 21 and 39 percent shorter over two oceanic regions than over land. Using a relationship between leader duration and lightning peak current derived in this study, the authors estimate that lightning with peak currents over 50 kilo amperes is twice as likely to occur in oceanic thunderstorms. These findings suggest that people living on or near the ocean may be at greater risk for lightning damage if storms develop over oceans and move on-shore. This new understanding of the nature of lightning could inform how off-shore infrastructure and vessels are to be built to minimize the risk of super-powerful lightning bolts from thunderstorms formed over the sea..." The Forecast for D-Day and the Weatherman Behind Ike's Greatest Gamble. James Martin Stagg. Not exactly a household name in the USA. But he should be. A fascinating article at HuffPost explains what may be the most consequential weather forecast in history: "...When Royal Navy and Met Office forecasters predicted stormy weather for the date originally set for D-day, USSTAF meteorologists adamantly disagreed. Circumventing Stagg, they pressed their case with General Carl Spaatz, U.S. Army Air Force commander in England, who attempted to bring their views to Ike’s attention. Had Ike listened to his countrymen’s predictions and launched D-day on June 5, it would have failed with catastrophic consequences for the Western Allies and world history. Instead, he held the invasion in abeyance for 24 hours, and as rain and high wind pounded his advanced headquarters on the night of June 4, just as Stagg had predicted, he listened to his chief meteorologist report that the weather would clear, and gave the word to “go” for June 6, 1944." (File image: army.mil). Intense Storms May Diminish Protective Ozone in Central U.S. Are super-sized thunderstorms doing more than increasing flash flood risk? Here's a clip from Daily Climate: "More frequent, powerful storms in the Great Plains are penetrating deep into the atmosphere, risking ozone loss and increased dangerous UV radiation, scientists warn...Harvard researchers found that this stratospheric ozone layer above the central U.S. gets depleted during the summer, most likely as intense storms send water vapor into the atmosphere. The vapor can cause the types of chemical reactions that have spurred ozone loss in Arctic and Antarctic regions.  The stratosphere, which extends from about 7 miles above the surface to nearly 30 miles above the ground, is one of the most “delicate aspects of habitability on the planet,” the researchers wrote in the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week. The Great Plains' more frequent and violent storms get that extra energy in large part from warming waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The Harvard study shows that, in addition to storm damage, the loss of ozone threatens food security and human health..."

A number of converging factors are in play, as explained at Plaquemines Parish Coastal Erosion: "Louisiana contains 30% of the total marshland within the lower 48 U.S. states, but unfortunately leads in coastal erosion and wetland loss, making up 90% of coastal marsh loss. Currently Louisiana has lost 1,900 square miles since the 1930's and continues to lose an estimated 70 square kilometers/year, or a football field of land every 38 minutes, due to a combination of natural processes, such as storms, sea-level rise, and subsidence, as well as man made alterations to the Mississippi River and wetlands over the past 200 years, i.e. the construction of levees and canals, and the development of the oil and natural gas industry..." "Coal is Dead" and Oil Faces "Peak Demand", Says World's Largest Investment Group.

BlackRock, the world’s largest investment group, with $5 trillion in assetsâ—âmore than the world’s largest banksâ—âhas begun to bet on clean energy. Why? “The thing that has changed fundamentally the whole picture is that renewables have gotten so cheap,” said Barry.

Here's an excerpt of an artlce at Fortune that made me do a double-take: "Boeing is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years..." India's First Solar Satellite Television Service Brings "Magic" to Villages. Reuters reports: "An Indian social business has launched the country's first solar satellite television service, bringing clean energy powered entertainment to households and businesses through a pay-as-you-go payment scheme. Simpa Networks, which began operations in 2011, is one of thousands of social enterprises in India tapping into the renewable energy market in a country where one-fifth of the 1.3 billion population has no access to electricity. With the majority of those without power from poor communities in countryside, the company focuses on selling solar powered products such as LED lights, phone charging points and fans on financing to rural homes and shops in northern India..." Even Tesla's Elon Musk Makes Mistakes. Here's a clip from an article at Fortune: "...The CEO said he made the decision to significantly pare down the configurations for the Model 3—Tesla's most affordable vehicle yet, starting at $35,000—after learning from mistakes he made with Tesla's SUV known as the Model X, which Musk called "hubris extraordinaire." "The big mistake we made with the X, which primarily was my responsibility, was having way too much complexity right at the beginning. That was very foolish," Musk said. "It had way too many cool things in it that really should have been rolled in with version 2, version 3," he continued. "We got overconfident and created something great that probably will never be made again, and perhaps should not be..." How to Fall To Your Death and Live to Tell the Tale. It's not the snow and ice - it's the slipping, sliding and falling that strikes fear into people, especially older Americans. Here's an excerpt of an eye-opening story at Mosaic: "...Falls are one of life’s great overlooked perils. We fear terror attacks, shark bites, Ebola outbreaks and other minutely remote dangers, yet over 420,000 people die worldwide each year after falling. Falls are the second leading cause of death by injury, after car accidents. In the United States, falls cause 32,000 fatalities a year (more than four times the number caused by drowning or fires combined). Nearly three times as many people die in the US after falling as are murdered by firearms. Falls are even more significant as a cause of injury. More patients go to emergency rooms in the US after falling than from any other form of mishap, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly triple the number injured by car accidents. The cost is enormous..." Fortune 500 CEOs Still Optimistic About the Future. The greatest concern? The pace of technological disruption and AI, artificial intelligence. Here's an excerpt of a post at Fortune: "...Only a few chief executives see the global economy turning worse next year. More than one-third anticipate that it will improve, and over half are expecting things to be about the same. The good news for workers? A strong majority of CEOs say they expect to boost hiring over the next couple of years. As for the Trump effect: not much so far..." Tornado Hits House As Kids Make First Video.

Dayton Signs Into States' Climate Goal Alliance. Rochester's Post Bulletin has details: "Minnesota's governor is committing the state to upholding the Paris climate change accord by joining an alliance set up by other states with the same goal. Gov. Mark Dayton says he signed onto the U.S. Climate Alliance which was formed after President Donald Trump announced last week that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement reached by 195 countries last year. California, New York and Washington started the alliance. Minnesota, Puerto Rico and eight other states signed on Monday. Alliance members pledge to reduce emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels..." File photo: U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Pittsburgh and Paris Join Over 200 Cities and States Rejecting Trump on Climate. Here's an excerpt from The Guardian: "...Yesterday, the mayors of Pittsburgh and Paris co-authored a New York Times editorial rejecting Trump’s efforts to pin the two cities against each other on climate change. Additionally, 12 states (California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia) plus Puerto Rico created the US Climate Alliance, committed to upholding the Paris accord. These states represent 97 million Americans – 30% of the national population.

I remember going on business trips to Pittsburgh with my dad, and white dress shirts turning orange from all the grit in the air. Street lights were often turned on at high noon. Sometimes we fail to grasp how far we've come. Here's a clip from Atlas Obscura: "...Conditions were so bad, white-collar workers often had extra pairs of shirts to change into during the day. And when Frank Lloyd Wright was asked how to fix the city, he glibly said, “Raze it and start over.” In 1946, the newly elected mayor proposed a less extreme plan to clean up the city and improve the standard of living. Over the next two decades, the surfaces of buildings were cleaned, new, cleaner industries slowly came up, and the level of pollution dropped by nearly 90 percent. But some buildings wanted to keep a reminder of the city’s smoky past to warn future generations about the consequences of filthy air, and the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was one of them..."

Here's a clip from The Guardian: "Americans are “under siege” from disinformation designed to confuse the public about the threat of climate change, Nasa’s former chief scientist has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Ellen Stofan, who left the US space agency in December, said that a constant barrage of half-truths had left many Americans oblivious to the potentially dire consequences of continued carbon emissions, despite the science being unequivocal. “We are under siege by fake information that’s being put forward by people who have a profit motive,” she said, citing oil and coal companies as culprits. “Fake news is so harmful because once people take on a concept it’s very hard to dislodge it...” Why Conservatives Have Always Distrusted Science. Not all conservatives. And there's a place for both, faith in absolutes and the scientific method; they are not mutually exclusive. Here's an excerpt from Bloomberg View: "...If "technology becomes the god by which we live," warned the National Review columnist Frank Meyer, then the Communists would win, because their system pursued "to its logical conclusion the positivistic glorification of control and power as the end of man’s existence." To go down that route was to worship the false god of "scientism," the philosopher Eric Voegelin wrote, and to make mathematics and physics "substitute for the religious order of the soul." After all, it was the scientific method, what Friedrich Hayek called the "religion of the engineers," that had created the gas chambers in Nazi Germany and the planned economy and labor camps in Stalin’s Russia..." File image: Catholic World Report. Politics, Culture or Theology? Why Evangelicals Back Trump on Global Warming. Here's a snippet from Religion News Service: "...In an interview with RNS, Schwadel explained that on environmental concerns, party affiliation played as large a role in influencing the views of Americans overall as did their religious beliefs, and both those factors outstripped every other variable, such as education, sex, income, race and geography. But when comparing evangelicals to some other religious groups, the evidence indicated that religious views were far more important for evangelicals than for other Christians. The chief theological marker of their beliefs, he said, is that evangelicals tend to have a literal view of the Bible – they believe that in Genesis the “earth was given to them to do as humans will” and that the prophecy at the end of the New Testament that Jesus will return in glory to rapture his followers is soon to be fulfilled..." Your Country is Flooding? Tough Luck. There will be blowback. Here's an excerpt from Bloomberg: "...The irony of U.S. antipathy to funding climate projects overseas is that withdrawing from those efforts hurts Americans. Matthew Kotchen, a Yale economics professor who represented the U.S. on the fund’s board under Obama, says that higher emissions overseas mean worse storms, floods, and wildfires at home. Just as important, natural disasters in poor countries, caused or amplified by climate change, lead to increased conflict and migration. “Trump himself, and maybe many of his supporters, believe that focusing on just your own national interest is sufficient,” Kotchen says. “There isn’t a recognition that we actually depend on other countries and other people for our security, stability, and prosperity.” While that debate continues, the problems that the climate fund is meant to address get worse. A recent study found that the number of people exposed to storm surges has increased more than 20 percent since 2000, to 162 million. More than 1 billion people are exposed to floods, the vast majority of them in the developing world..."

Extreme Warmth Has Dominated U.S. Weather Records Since 2010. This Is Climate Change. Jason Samenow reports at Capital Weather Gang: "If it seems as if America’s record heat is in the news much more so than record cold in recent years, it is not a media conspiracy to ignore extremely cold weather. There is a simple and scientifically sound reason for it: Record warmth is happening much more often. Record-warm weather has occurred five times as frequently as record cold in U.S. cities since 2010, according to a new analysis. The imbalance represents a striking example of climate change affecting the nation’s extreme weather in a clear and tangible way..."

The farmers I've talked to may not want to mention "climate change", but almost to a person they describe big changes in their fields over the last generation. Here's a clip from NPR: "...Clayton is a Midwesterner and agricultural policy editor at DTN/The Progressive Farmer. He's also the author of The Elephant in the Cornfield: The Politics of Agriculture and Climate Change, which describes in detail how farmers and farm lobbyists have dealt — or, more often, refused to deal — with a changing climate. It has sometimes put Clayton in an awkward spot, as he acknowledged when I reached him this week in his office in Omaha, Neb. Does it make you nervous, as a reporter at a farm publication, talking about climate change? All the time. I feel like the guy who has to tell people things they don't want to hear. But if I simply ignore the topic or ignore the issues, am I doing anybody any favors?..."

Federal News Radio has details: "...The Defense Department is revising its unified facilities code to adjust to climate change issues. In addition, the Navy is writing into its policies and construction code that all new buildings take into account the possibility of sea level rise, said Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Fleet Readiness and Logistics Vice. Adm. Dixon Smith during the June 6 hearing. “We are taking sea level rise into consideration in our projects. We started this a few years ago as we realized it is changing. So now whenever we design any project that’s within the 100 year flood plain we look at it and analyze ‘Do we need to make adjustments to a standard project to accommodate for [sea level rise],’ said Smith said. Dixon said the Navy’s fueling depot on Craney Island in Norfolk, Virginia was built 10 feet higher to account for climate change effects..." (File image: AP). Climate Change is Here to Stay - So Deal With It. We're already dealing with it - and there's no question that adaptation has to be part of the equation. Here's an excerpt from Axios: "Everyone who wants to keep pushing climate policies in the vacuum of Washington leadership should start thinking more about how to adapt to a warmer world instead of focusing most political will on ways to stop it. Why it matters: The chances of reversing climate change are slim regardless of U.S. involvement in the Paris agreement. Countries, companies, U.S. states and cities and non-governmental organizations pursuing policies to address climate change should refocus their high-level political efforts on ways to prepare for the impacts that are already here and those still to come..." Graphic credit: Lazaro Gamio / Axios. Unfriendly Climate. Kudos to climate scientists (and evangelical Christian) Katharine Hayhoe for swimming upstream and trying to frame climate volatility in a way that resonates with a more conservative audience. Here's a clip from Texas Monthly: "...But the most revealing part of her talk centered on why Christians should care about climate change. To lead into this subject, Hayhoe flipped to a slide with a quote from John Holdren, President Obama’s science adviser: “We basically have three choices: mitigation, adaptation, or suffering. We’re going to do some of each. The question is what the mix is going to be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.” Suffering, Hayhoe said, is not a word often deployed by scientists. “As scientists we don’t know a lot about suffering, but as Christians we do. And we know that part of the reason we’re here in this world is to help people who are suffering.” And that suffering will not be meted out proportionally: if global warming continues unchecked, the poor—whether they’re in Houston’s Fifth Ward or in low-lying areas of Bangladesh—who have contributed least to carbon emissions will feel the most pain, from enduring more-intense heat waves to paying the higher food prices that will accompany failed crops..."

Print Story X Print Story Business June 10, 2017 Share Advertisement Airbus predicts $5.3 trillion jet demand, trims traffic outlook TOULOUSE, France: Airbus raised its forecast for deliveries by 6 percent to 34,899 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion over the next 20 years, creating jobs for more than a million pilots and technicians as China surges past the United States to dominate air travel. The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world´s middle class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said. But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 percent a year from 4.5 percent on Friday, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf. Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalisation and a surge in private consumption. "It´s the tyranny of large numbers," Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world´s second largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world´s fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036.The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market, and supported their long-haul drive. "Low-cost long-haul will work," he told a media briefing at the planemaker´s Toulouse headquarters. Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak. A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model. Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo narrowbody for many missions targeted by Boeing´s proposed new mid-market jet. For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable. Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March. The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology has led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard. Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company´s finance chief was also achievable.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory Pakistan becomes full SCO member British elections: Theresa May fails to maintain majority NA witnesses uproar over Khursheed Shah’s speech 12 British Pakistanis elected to UK parliament No govt or court can proceed merely on suspicions, says Hussain View more... see all opinions Opinion Babar Sattar Rule of law on trial Khalid Bhatti The Corbyn factor Saleem Safi Coalition options for Pakistan Murtaza Shibli The glorious Indian cow Dr Naazir Mahmood On the verge of war Philip Luther 50 years of oppression see all opinions Newspost Betrayed Traffic jam Alternative site The broken road The Paris agreement View more... see all opinions Editorial Voice of the many The KP budget View more... see all opinions National Gulf conflict worsens as Doha, Riyadh stick to their guns I will become more dangerous for PM in the time to come: Imran Razing historical school building: Sindh chief secretary told to act against SSP RLNG price hike hits industrial sectors Ex-CJP demands security of SC judges, JIT members View more... see all opinions World Catalonia announces October independence vote N Korea says launch tested ‘new type’ of cruise missile Gulf crisis grows as Saudi, allies place Qataris on ‘terror list’ China cracks down on online peddlers of celebrity gossip Erdogan approves troop deployment to Qatar View more... see all opinions Sports Pakistan exhibit intensity in Cardiff training session Kane reveals Ballon d’Or dream Oval and Lord’s reveal expansion plans Smith focused on England despite Australia pay row Mossadek rocks NZ in must-win clash View more... see all opinions Business Remittances up 21.36 percent to $1.867 billion in May World Bank keen to lend $100 million for Green Pakistan Program Islamic banking assets increase to Rs1.885 trillion in first quarter ADB to extend $86.41mln for KP canal project Pak exporters may face hardships on Qatar situation View more... see all opinions Karachi Opposition boycotts PA session as govt denies cold-shouldering KMC in budget Mayor leads march on assembly for LG powers Farooq Sattar acquitted in three cases, gets bail in two more Sale of toy guns banned to curb street crime Rangers’ programme for rehabilitating errant youths starts yielding results View more... see all opinions Lahore Stabbing accused plea against daily hearing dismissed Humidity follows rain in City Man arrested for fraud Media role sought in child rights protection ‘Strategy to eliminate hepatitis’ View more... see all opinions Islamabad Rs37.971 billion CDA budget approved Ministry declares 17,563 persons successful in ballot for Haj Kidney tests NPOs reject excessive taxation on non-profit sector QAU honours high-achievers View more... see all opinions Peshawar KP govt raises special force for security of foreign nationals Govt urged to review Expo Centre construction plan at Tarnab Farms PTI to stand by institutions: KP minister New UET vice-chancellor takes charge Workers Welfare Board employees file contempt petition View more... see all opinions Advertisement PRIVACY POLICY | CONTACT US | BACK ISSUES © 2017 THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL Back To Top

Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson disclosed during congressional testimony on Tuesday that the service was planning to fly its fifth X-37B mission on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. “ULA did not have the opportunity to bid for the Air Force’s fifth X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV) mission which was recently awarded. ULA remains fully committed to continuing to support America’s national security missions with world-class launch services,” the company said in a statement. Only United Launch Alliance and SpaceX are certified to launch U.S. military satellites. The Air Force on Friday declined to confirm that it awarded the contract to Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, without soliciting other bids. It also declined to say when the contract was awarded or how much it is worth. Advertisement Advertisement Four previous X-37B missions were launched by United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets. SpaceX’s first publicly disclosed launch contract for the Air Force was awarded last year for a next-generation Global Positioning System satellite flight in 2018. A second GPS launch contract was awarded in March. The contracts are valued at US$83 million and US$96.5 million respectively. United Launch Alliance did not bid for the first GPS launch contract but did compete and lost the second. In May 2016, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office disclosed it had hired SpaceX to launch a spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9. The mission, which was arranged through an intermediary, Ball Aerospace, took place last month. SpaceX is owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Musk, who is also chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc . sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget (Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) Source: Reuters Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail More stories for you More information about Channel News Asia jump to top of page Sections Asia Pacific Singapore World CNA Insider Business Sport Lifestyle Technology Health Commentary About Us About Channel NewsAsia Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Advertise with us Contact Sales Online Advertising TV Advertising Get the news that matters in your inbox every morning!

A screenshot from Boeing’s virtual tour of its Renton facility shows 737 jets being built. Hot spots on the image are linked in the application to videos, photos and other goodies. (Boeing Photo) More than 5 million guests have toured Boeing’s airplane factory in Everett, Wash., which ranks as one of the Puget Sound region’s top attractions – but far fewer tourists have been inside the area’s other Boeing assembly plant, south of Seattle in Renton. A new multimedia presentation is aimed at evening the score, at least virtually: “Incredible: The Story of the Boeing Renton Site” combines mouse-controlled 360-degree views, videos and photo galleries to show how Boeing builds the world’s best-selling commercial jetliner, the 737. The tour starts with a 360-degree video shot outside the assembly building. As trucks drive by and workers stroll past, a narrator explains what you’re seeing – and invites you to look inside. Clicking on the menu label lets you get a view of the 737 assembly line from above, or from the floor. Yet another 360-degree view puts you on Renton Field’s flight line as a Ryanair Next-Generation 737 takes its first-ever flight. The next-next-generation 737 MAX also gets its share of screen time. It’s been 75 years since the Renton factory was built to turn out airplanes for the U.S. military during World War II – principally the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Since then, the facility has played a role in building the Dash 80, the KC-135 Stratotanker, the 707, 737, 757, 767 and the Navy’s P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft. Renton is arguably busier than ever: This year, its 737 production rate is rising to 47 planes a month. Boeing says it takes just 10 days to turn a fuselage delivered by train from Wichita, Kan., into a finished airplane. Now, thanks to Boeing’s virtual tour, it takes just 10 minutes to get an inside look at the process.

Chicago-based Boeing accuses Bombardier of violating antidumping and anti-subsidy laws by selling planes at below fair prices. On Friday, the U.S. International Trade Commission voted 5-0 that there is enough evidence of harm to the U.S. aviation industry to let the Commerce Department go ahead with its investigation. The Commerce Department is expected to have final decisions over the next four months. It could impose duties on Bombardier CSeries jets that hold 100 to 150 passengers. Boeing argues that the new planes rely on illegal government subsidies, which allowed Bombardier to sell 75 jets to Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines at below-cost prices. Bombardier said Friday that it was confident Boeing's claims will be rejected after more detailed review by U.S. officials. Last month, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland warned that Canada could cancel a planned $2 billion purchase of 18 Boeing military jets over the dispute. Boeing said "trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules," and it predicted that its business with Canada "will continue to thrive long after this commercial trade matter is resolved."

COMMENTARY Are you prepared for a contract cancellation? You should be By Darrell Hineman, Brian Courtney Jun 09, 2017 Going back to his campaign pledges, President Trump promised to cut government waste in conjunction with cutting corporate tax rates. As part of this, the president threatened to terminate contracts with the two largest government contractors: Lockheed Martin’s F-35 and Boeing’s Air Force One programs. A surge in contract terminations could be in the offing as federal agencies align their goals with White House intentions. With this in mind, preparing for the possibility of a contract termination is a defensive strategy that contractors should undertake now. Here are three key steps you should consider immediately: Plan ahead. Never consider your contract as “termination-proof.” Fully understand the contract termination process Learn how to calculate and submit your Request for Equitable Adjustment or settlement proposal. The possibility of a contract termination should be incorporated into every government contractor’s business continuity plan. Implementing safeguards and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of a termination will limit the impact it has on your organization’s operations. Ask yourself, “Does my organization have procedures in place to deal with cure notices, customer complaints, and quality issues? What about monitoring subcontractors?” If you are still reading this article, you probably are not as well prepared for a contract termination as you should be. Most contract terminations have a root cause and are not solely due to the government no longer requiring the items or services. Here are some common contract termination causes and how to prevent them: Failure to immediately address government concerns Whether a complaint or “suggestion” is received verbally or in writing from the government, there should be a process in place to respond immediately. Often, we hear from clients that their program personnel were in the process of addressing a government issue (but apparently not in real-time). Now, they are dealing with a cure notice for many items to be corrected in two weeks. Incorporate the handling and response to government communications and complaints/concerns into your program management policy and procedures. All complaints/concerns should be documented and tracked from the initial problem to the eventual solutions. Regular communication with the government is also critical in staying ahead of potential contract issues and preventing a termination. The contractor program manager should routinely relay project status to the government in writing – even if not required under the contract terms. We recommend weekly communications but, depending on the project, monthly communications may suffice. Failure to evaluate change orders for potential effect on cost or schedule Sometimes, trying to fully please the client can actually lead to a termination. A contractor has only 30 days from the date of receipt of a written order to assert its right to an adjustment. Often, accepting changes without evaluating the impact on scope, cost, and/or schedule can lead to project delays and cost overruns. These may ultimately result in missed delivery/performance dates. As a preventative measure, create a standard procedure to evaluate the impact of any change request on the scope, cost, and/or schedule of a project. Share this required procedure with the customer: “Yes, we can make changes, but we first need to evaluate the scope, cost, and schedule to identify any project impacts.” Subcontractor performance issues Many contractors focus on complying with the requirement to issue subcontracts and neglect their associated responsibility for managing subcontractors under FAR 42.202(e)(2), Assignment of Contract Administration. Prime contractors often assume, without oversight or verification, that their subcontractors will meet prescribed performance and deliverable requirements. When a subcontractor fails to deliver, the prime contractor is ultimately responsible for addressing the issue, or may face termination. Therefore, you should ensure that you flow down the proper terms and conditions to your subcontractors, including the prime contract termination clauses and deliverable dates. Another step we recommend is to create a post-award subcontract administration procedure to address the risk. Ensure that adequate and comprehensive subcontractor oversight is built in to your procurement and project management processes. Any issue that can affect contract performance/delivery must be escalated quickly for resolution. Bidding on unprofitable work Today, when lowest price, technically acceptable typically beats out best value (though recent legislation directs more limited use of LPTA procurements), contractors often estimate their cost to fit the price they want to bid and what they think the government is willing to pay. Instead, you should be focusing on the actual cost required to address the government’s mission-stated requirements. Even though you may know that the “price to win” is too low to perform the work adequately, the proposal development organization might not want to deviate from that winning number. To avoid bidding on unprofitable work, you should develop a comprehensive estimating manual and system so that your estimated costs are based on real costs/prices currently in the marketplace. As part of this, build and encourage a corporate culture that incentivizes employees for more profitable work as opposed to contract wins exclusively. As no contract is termination proof, the key is to always be prepared and have a defense strategy in place at all times.

The court decision allows Boeing to continue pressing for tariffs against its Canadian competitor.

The Commerce Department is investigating separately whether to impose duties on the Bombardier planes. A negative ruling by the ITC would have ended the two investigations. Before the U.S. imposes any duties, the ITC would still have to issue a final ruling on the question of how Boeing’s business was affected. Boeing has accused Bombardier of selling its C Series jets in the U.S. at “absurdly low” prices, while benefiting from unfair government subsidies in Canada. The U.S. planemaker asked the ITC in April to find that the company has suffered injury to its business at the hands of Bombardier and to recommend that the Commerce Department slap duties on the C Series. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said that the company had expected the preliminary decision given “the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process” and that a more detailed review will show Boeing’s claims are baseless. The allegations opened a new front in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, which have intensified since President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. earlier this year imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Canadian protections for dairy farmers. Talks to revamp NAFTA are expected to start after mid-August. Following the ruling on Friday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government will defend Bombardier’s interests, adding that a review is underway over military procurement that relates to Boeing. Winning Customers Tariffs could hurt Bombardier’s efforts to win customers for its largest-ever jetliner. The last major firm order for the plane -- Delta Air Lines Inc.’s for at least 75 jets -- dates to April of last year. Boeing said that sale set a “new, low price ceiling” that was depressing its U.S. jetliner prices. The Atlanta-based carrier agreed to purchase the cutting-edge Bombardier jets for $19.6 million apiece, less than the $33.2 million cost of manufacturing the airplanes, Boeing said. Bombardier disputes the $19.6 million figure. The tussle echoes longstanding U.S.-Europe disputes stemming from the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus SE. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged C$372.5 million (US$275 million) to Bombardier to finance two jet programs, including the C Series. Last year, Quebec’s provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner.

(AP) Airbus raised its forecast for deliveries by 6 per cent to 34,899 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion over the next 20 years, creating jobs for more than a million pilots and technicians as China surges past the United States to dominate air travel. The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world's middle class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said. But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 per cent a year from 4.5 per cent on Friday, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf. Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalisation and a surge in private consumption. "It's the tyranny of large numbers," Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world's second largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world's fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036. This means hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the planemaker said, estimating the need for 530,000 more pilots and 550,000 new maintenance engineers. The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market, and supported their long-haul drive. "Low-cost long-haul will work," he told a media briefing at the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters. Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak. A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model. Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo narrowbody for many missions targeted by Boeing's proposed new mid-market jet. For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable. Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes. Chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March. The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology has led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard. Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company's finance chief was also achievable.         Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Aviation Wanted: 530,000 pilots for 35,000 new planes Airbus raised its forecast for deliveries by 6 per cent to 34,899...

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/files By David Lawder, Lesley Wroughton and Allison Lampert | WASHINGTON/MONTREAL WASHINGTON/MONTREAL The U.S. International Trade Commission on Friday gave a green light to the U.S. Commerce Department to begin preparing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties against new jets from Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), sending the Canadian planemaker's stock down as much as 8 percent. The ITC, as expected, voted to continue an investigation on Boeing Co's (BA.N) complaint that Bombardier dumped its CSeries jet below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair subsidies. The case has fueled trade tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor, with Canada calling on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge and threatening to scrap plans to buy the company's fighter jets as an interim purchase in the renewal of its fleet. The ITC probe could lead to steep duties on the CSeries, stoking investor fears that it will discourage future sales of the 110 to 130 seat jets, which have not secured a new order in about a year, said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said the ITC's decision was expected given the "low bar" for Boeing at this early stage, while a company executive recently dismissed suggestions that the probe could hurt CSeries sales. "Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing’s claim is without merit," Nadolski said by email. A Boeing spokesman declined to say if the company was pleased with the ITC decision, instead emphasizing its support for Canada as a "customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defense businesses." Spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing's near century-old relationship with Canada "will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved." Coupled with Canada's pledge to move ahead with an interim fighter purchase, Boeing's reaction indicates the careful path the U.S. planemaker must tread in challenging Bombardier while trying to preserve a lucrative military contract with the country. Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alex Lawrence reiterated that Canada would defend its aerospace industry. "We are reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing," Lawrence said by email. Boeing has argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. It warned that Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate the 2016 sale of 75 CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) for what it calls the "absurdly low" sum of $19.6 million each, despite the jet costing $33 million to build. Bombardier, which described Boeing's $19.6 million figure as "absurd," has countered that the 110-seat CS100 plane it sold to Delta does not compete with Boeing's smallest 737 model, the 130-seat 737 MAX 7. The Commerce Department must now determine any preliminary anti-subsidy duties by around July 22, with a deadline for preliminary anti-dumping duties around Oct. 3. The ITC will have a final say on whether to reject any duties. In a separate ruling, the World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of unfairly supporting Boeing, but noted it had failed to withdraw a tax break in Washington state, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft.

The commission said there is a "reasonable indication" that a U.S. industry is threatened with "material injury" due to the aircraft allegedly being sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the decision, the U.S. Department of Commerce will continue its investigation and disclose its preliminary countervailing duty determination around July 21 and anti-dumping duty decision around Oct. 4. Chicago-based Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission earlier this year alleging subsidies given to Bombardier have allowed the Montreal aircraft manufacturer to sell the CSeries planes at well below cost. Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has said Boeing is not behaving like a "trusted partner" and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. Ottawa has also issued a thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the aerospace giant values Canada as a customer and partner for its commercial and defence businesses. "It's a relationship that has existed since 1919 and that will continue to thrive long after this commercial trade matter is resolved," he wrote in an email. "Global trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules of the road, and that’s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United States, and our aerospace industry." Bombardier (TSX:BBD.B) has rejected the accusations and argued that their CSeries planes never competed with Boeing in a key sale to Delta Airlines. "Today's preliminary decision was expected given the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process," spokesman Simon Letendre wrote in an email. "Going forward, we are confident that a detailed review and analysis of the facts will demonstrate that Boeing's claim is without merit." Last year, the Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 per cent stake in the CSeries. Bombardier also shored up its finances by selling a 30 per cent stake in its railway division to pension fund manager Caisse de depot for US$1.5 billion. Meanwhile, Ottawa provided a $372.5-million loan earlier this year to help support Bombardier's CSeries and Global 7000 aircraft programs. That's on top of about $1 billion received in 2008 from Ottawa, Quebec and Britain to develop the CSeries. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Bombardier's shares fell more than five per cent, losing 13 cents at $2.42 in afternoon trading.

REUTERS/Jim Young/Files REUTERS/Jim Young/Files By Tom Miles GENEVA, June 9 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of maintaining unfair support for Boeing Co , but said it had failed to withdraw a tax break in its main planemaking state that continues to cause trade fireworks. The ruling added another page to an exhausting 13-year-old battle between the transatlantic plane giants just as a U.S. tribunal agreed separately to investigate Boeing's concerns about alleged price-dumping by Canada's Bombardier. The WTO said the United States had failed to remove aid for Boeing, as alleged in a trade complaint brought by the European Union, but ruled that few of the subsidies hurt EU interests. It found that one U.S. subsidy programme, a business tax rate reduction in the state of Washington, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft, had "adverse effects", involving customers from the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Iceland. Advertisement Both sides claimed victory after the ruling, which is about whether Boeing complied with a 2012 decision that it had received billions of dollars of subsidies including aid from space agency NASA and tax breaks from Washington State. "The panel found only one state-level program, which had an average value of $100-110 million in the 2013-2015 period, to be contrary to WTO rules. The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding," the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. European planemaker Airbus insisted the United States had not complied with the WTO's earlier decisions in the case and claimed it had suffered $100 billion of harm when combined with a follow-up complaint. "The amount of money involved completely distorts trade ... and the WTO should make it clear that no government or company can escape from their international responsibilities," Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement. The WTO said Boeing had failed to comply with part of the earlier 2012 ruling relating to tax breaks in Washington state. Those tax breaks are now the subject of a new case, having been extended to cover Boeing's newest wide-body jet. In November, the WTO defined the tax break to help Boeing develop its new 777X jet as a prohibited subsidy. That decision, contested by the United States, is now working its way through the WTO's appeals tribunal. The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual accusations of support for Airbus and Boeing. Bickering over financing for the $120 billion a year civil aerospace industry has widened in recent months as Brazil took Bombardier to the WTO and Boeing asked a faster U.S. tribunal to deal with its pricing complaint against the same company.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You GUWAHATI: National carrier Air India today said it will not place any order for new aircraft till there is clarity on its future course, including possible privatisation. The airline, however, said all the existing orders will be respected and new aircraft are being added to the fleet. "Whatever has been ordered in the past, that is there," Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani told reporters here, adding that no fresh orders will be placed right now. Ordering of new planes is a long-term process by Air India and it usually takes 6-9 months, he added. Asked how long the company would go without placing fresh orders, Lohani said: "We do not know. We have to keep on running the airline. There is no decision on that." He, however, denied reports that some old orders have been cancelled. "No, not right. Whatever the orders, these were ordered before. These will be coming," Lohani said. Giving details of Air India's order list, the CMD said: "We are adding 10 ATRs. We have placed order for 29 Airbus on lease. They have started coming now. But we are also grounding old aircraft. We have lot of old aircraft. So the net addition will be only about 15 Airbus." Besides, the airline is procuring wide-bodied Boeing aircraft to its fleet to strengthen the international route. "Also, seven more wide-bodies (Boeing) will be added in next 6-7 months. We are starting lots of international flights," Lohani said. The state-owned carrier has a total of 103 planes, of which 42 are wide-bodied Boeing 777s, 747s and 787s, while 61 are narrow-bodied Airbus 319s, 320s and 321s. Its low-cost subsidiary Air India Express has 23 Boeing 737s at present. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has proposed privatisation of Air India and the Civil Aviation Ministry is looking at all options to make the airline strong and viable. A Cabinet note in this regard is likely to be prepared shortly, according to Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha. The development came against the backdrop of NITI Aayog submitting its suggestions on the future course for the airline. Air India has piled up over Rs 50,000 crore of debt, mainly because of high maintenance costs and lease rent. Since the merger of Indian Airlines with itself, Air India has been in the red. However, it posted an operational profit of Rs 105 crore on account of low fuel prices and increased passenger numbers in 2015-16.

Todd Campbell, Rich Smith, and Dan Caplinger (TMFEBCapital) Jun 9, 2017 at 11:09AM LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are three dividend-paying stocks that shrewd investors might want to add to their portfolios. All three companies have proven they know how to grow their businesses through thick and thin, and importantly, each pays a dividend yield that's north of the S&P 500's yield. So if you're looking for a savvy investment to add to your income portfolio, read on to see if one of these stocks is right for you.  This hardheaded business refuses to overpay for growth Rich Smith: (LCI Industries): Shrewd... adjective... "Marked by clever discerning awareness and hardheaded acumen." IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. That's how Merriam-Webster defines shrewd. And when I read that definition, I think back to one of the first stocks pointed out to me by Motley Fool co-founder Tom Gardner -- Drew Industries, now known as LCI Industries -- way back in 2005. LCI isn't a "sexy" company. But it's a shrewd business operator. Supplying components to manufacturers of recreational vehicles and manufactured homes, LCI avoids the dilemma of having to be the most popular brand name in RVs, or in housing. It supplies parts to everyone, and profits no matter which of its customers ends up winning the RV market. What I like most about LCI Industries, though, and the reason I own LCI stock today, is its shrewd approach to growing its own market share. Specifically, the company has a strict list of criteria it follows when considering acquisitions of even complementary businesses, insisting that such purchases be "immediately accretive" to its own bottom line, promising to be "disciplined and patient" in its purchases, and most crucially, promising not to pay more than "6 times" earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for any purchase. (For context, LCI's own EV/EBITDA ratio is 9.0.) Unless it can find an acquisition cheap enough to meet this standard, LCI prefers to invest its money in building its own business through organic growth. I admit -- I've cribbed that "6 times EBITDA" standard for use in my own investing on the assumption that, if management as smart as LCI thinks 6x EBITDA is a safe price to pay for a business, then it's probably safe for me to use, as well. And while I maintain my own investing "discipline," patiently waiting for opportunities to invest at 6x EBITDA to emerge, I'm also happily cashing my market-beating 2.2% dividend checks from LCI. You might want to do the same. Time to look past the noise on this big-cap drugmaker Todd Campbell (Bristol-Myers Squibb): I don't know about you, but buying one of the most innovative big-cap pharmaceutical companies at a 30% discount to its price last summer seems pretty shrewd -- especially given that the sell-off in its shares has boosted Bristol-Myers Squibb's dividend yield by about 1%, to nearly 3%. Last year, Bristol-Myers' share price fell after it reported disappointing results for Opdivo as a first-line lung-cancer treatment. Opdivo, a checkpoint inhibitor, has been a major source of the company's growth, and if successful, the trial could have expanded its use to even more patients. Certainly, some discouragement is warranted, but I can't help but think the sell-off was overdone. After all, there are still dozens of studies underway that could expand Opdivo's use, including studies that could still make it a go-to first-line lung-cancer drug. Opdivo's sales won't grow as quickly this year as they might've, but we're still talking about a drug that racked up $1.1 billion in first-quarter sales, up 60% year over year. Opdivo isn't Bristol-Myers' only source of growth, either. A 50% jump in sales of the anticoagulant Eliquis helped propel first-quarter revenue up 12.9% from a year ago in Q1. And Bristol-Myers Squibb's profit is still climbing, too. First-quarter earnings per share (EPS) were $0.84, up 14% from last year, and exiting the quarter, management increased -- not decreased -- it's full year EPS outlook to at least $2.85 from $2.70. Bristol-Myers has plenty of cash flow coming in and a dividend that's likely to keep growing. Therefore, I think picking up shares on sale is incredibly shrewd. Fly higher with this stock Dan Caplinger (Boeing): The best dividend stocks are those that are also growing at a healthy clip. Boeing has been a huge beneficiary of the recovery in the airline industry, as its airline customers have been flush with cash and looking to spend it on upgrading their fleets. Boeing's many new designs for the commercial aerospace industry offer more efficient operations and new features that older aircraft lack, and the aircraft manufacturer has done a good job of holding its competitors at bay and cashing in on lucrative sales. Boeing's next growth story could come from its defense business. The company is a leading defense contractor in the industry, and investors expect calls to increase the defense budget to play to Boeing's strengths. Even though the Trump administration has called out Boeing on the cost of some projects, like its Air Force One contract, the defense industry has nevertheless seen new opportunities to make money, and that will inevitably lift Boeing's business higher. What's surprising for many investors is that Boeing is a dividend giant, with a yield of 3% despite dramatic gains in its stock price over the past year. With the prospects for future dividend growth, as well, Boeing is worth a closer look for income investors looking for growing businesses. Dan Caplinger owns shares of Boeing.

By James Billington June 9, 2017 13:08 BST Boeing's Echo Voyager is the latest unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and is currently being tested off the south California coast.Boeing Boeing's giant underwater military drone programme has been given a boost after it announced a partnership with the US's largest shipbuilding company Huntington Ingalls, which will see the development of a fleet of futuristic unmanned vehicles. As part of the Navy's Advanced Undersea Prototyping programme, Boeing is already working on the Echo Voyager – a giant sub-like drone with the ability to fire missiles or stay underwater for months at a time to collect data. Huntington Ingalls is expected to join the project of the 51-foot drone and will continue to collaborate on new undersea drones and vehicles. "This partnership provides the Navy a cost-effective, low-risk path to meet the emergent needs that prompted the Navy's Advanced Undersea Prototyping program," said Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works. "We are combining Boeing's preeminent UUV maritime engineering team with our nation's leading shipbuilder and Navy technical services company to get operational vehicles to the Navy years ahead of the standard acquisition process." As the landscape of warfare is rapidly changing with the advent of autonomous technology, militaries around the globe are working on robotic offensive and defensive solutions, which is why the partnership with Huntington Ingalls is significant as it will boost the timeline to have products ready for action sooner. Aside from the Echo Voyager there were no hints as to what else the duo has in development, yet the partnership will aim to revolutionise the autonomous underwater vehicle sector. "We look forward to a long relationship with Boeing as we embark together to field this unmanned force-multiplier for the Navy," said Andy Green, executive vice president of Huntington Ingalls Industries and president of the company's Technical Solutions division. "I am confident this team will continue redefining the autonomy paradigm for UUVs." Boeing has been pumping significant resource into autonomous vehicle technologies as of late and just revealed plans to test pilotless jetliners in 2018 with AI taking over the controls for the entire flight.

The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world’s middle class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said. But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 per cent a year from 4.5 per cent today, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf. Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalisation and a surge in private consumption. “It’s the tyranny of large numbers,” Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world’s second largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world’s fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036. The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth US$2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market, and supported their long-haul drive. “Low-cost long-haul will work,” he told a media briefing at the planemaker’s Toulouse headquarters. Twin-aisle demand Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak. A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model. Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo narrowbody for many missions targeted by Boeing’s proposed new mid-market jet. For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable. Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March. The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology has led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard. Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company’s finance chief was also achievable. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit expected to trade cautiously next week Stock bulls tested as Nasdaq rout exposes market’s vulnerability Extended consolidation, rotational play expected next week China condemns EU for new steel anti-dumping duties EU antitrust regulators to investigate US$38b Qualcomm, NXP deal Ringgit slightly higher against US dollar in early trade Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week Safitex has not made payment since FY15, says FGV board Bursa to be firmer next week Qatar crisis draws mediation effort as Saudis tighten screws Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Philippines’ Cebu Air orders seven Airbus planes, delays delivery of earlier order You say Austria, I say Australia: Airbus trips up on tricky typo 11 things I never knew about flying… until I became a flight attendant Value of Airbus work in Malaysia to exceed US$500m by 2021 Airbus takes new charge for A400M as core profit beats forecasts Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

The company said the “basic building blocks of the technology are clearly available” during a briefing at the Paris Air Show. “There’s going to be a transition from the requirement to have a skilled aviator operate the airplane to having a system that operates the vehicle autonomously, if we can do that with the same level of safety,” said Boeing. Boeing said the autonomous system must be able to handle emergency situations, like a bird strike. “We are not smart enough to preprogram all those things. The machine has to be capable of making the same set of decisions.” The system is set to be tested in a plane – without passengers – in 2018.

Reuters / Jason Redmond Photo: Reuters / Jason Redmond SEATTLE - Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. READ: Boeing to cut hundreds of engineering jobs Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and "fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make", he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes. "I have no idea how we're going to do that," Sinnett said. "But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms." Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the "Miracle on the Hudson," Sinnett said. "If it can't, then we can't go there." WATCH: Boeing develops self-cleaning bathrooms for future flights A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. "This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors'" he said, referring to rival Airbus. "It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?" Reuters Comment Now!

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Innovation Self-flying plane: Boeing to test pilotless jetliners in 2018 The company is working on AI that can make the same decisions pilots make during a flight. By Agamoni Ghosh Updated June 9, 2017 07:27 BST Boeing plans to go pilotless for some of its jetliners Boeing Move over self-driving cars as self-flying planes could soon be a reality. Aerospace giant Boeing has announced that it will test some of its jetliners next year without pilots leading to flying its passenger aircraft autonomously some day. While self-driving technology for cars is relatively new, autopilot on aeroplanes have existed for over a decade. However, autopilot mode is mostly used when the aircraft is in the skies that too monitored by the pilots. The crucial task of take-off and landing are still a pilot's core responsibility even though some onboard flight computers do posses the technology to take off and land on its own. "The basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available... but I have no idea how we're going to do that. We're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms," Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development told Reuters days before the Paris Airshow. Sinnett, who is a pilot himself, says the company is working on artificial intelligence (AI) that can make the same decisions pilots make during a flight. It is likely that the maiden test routes will be devoid of congested areas and challenging landscapes like high mountains or large stretches of water. The biggest challenge will be to maintain altitude in accordance to air traffic parameters and conduct a safe and smooth landing. "A self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the 'Miracle on the Hudson.' If it can't, then we can't go there," says Sinnett. BAE Systems, the British defence company, has been testing robotic planes since last year and has successfully logged trials with its autonomous technology that has taken over the controls 15,000ft high in the sky.

(KTRK) KTRK Thursday, June 08, 2017 09:04PM CHICAGO, Illinois (KTRK) -- Forget self-driving cars -- pilotless planes are the transportation of the future, at least according to Boeing. Officials at the aerospace company say the basic building blocks for the technology already exist -- jetliners can take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers. The summer, Boeing plans to use a simulator to test artificial intelligence to make decisions that human pilots would normally make. Airlines are backing the idea due to what they describe as a shrinking pool of future airline pilots.

News 82nd Airborne turns 100: Here are 4 major innovations over the past 100 years by admin — June 9, 2017 This is the centennial year of the US Army 82nd Airborne Division. At Major General Michael Kurilla’s remarks at the 100th Anniversary Memorial Service on May 24, he touched on the group’s history, noting: “A group of Americans from all over the country [formed] to fight as a cohesive unit. This had never been done before. They represented the values of All Americans.” Back then, the 82nd Airborne had a limited number of troops and planes. Today, their firepower has increased considerably. That might was on display at the annual Airborne Review on June 1, with 4,500 paratroopers of the 82nd’s 18,000 strong taking part. From aircraft to artillery, here are four of the most impressive recent innovations. C-17 aircraft The Boeing C-17 aircraft, “Globemaster” can carry more than 100 paratroopers in the cargo hold and then unleash them as they parachute into a battlespace. The aircraft can also carry Army vehicles – even the M1 battle tank. This 174 foot long aircraft also provides the advantage of remarkably short takeoffs and landings. Rather than require modern paved landing strips, the C-17 can take off from a 7,000-foot strip and land in less than 3,000 feet – a big advantage for war zones. M777 Howitzer long-range artillery The M777 Howitzer long-range artillery is a 155mm 39 caliber used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The M77 can accurately strike over great distances. It works with standard ammo types, but it can also take advantage ultra advanced rounds like the EXCALIBUR. With a maximum range of more than 30 km, it can fire 5 rounds per minute for up to 2 minutes and then 2 rounds per minute in sustained rate of fire. Able to be transported by air, this weapon can be rapidly deployed to where it is needed. With low radar and thermal signatures and low silhouette, it is designed to be very difficult for an enemy to detect. CH-47 Chinook The Boeing CH-47 Chinook has those iconic rotor blades at each end of the aircraft. The Army uses Chinooks for assault, transporting troops, artillery and equipment as well as medical evacuation. It can reach maximum speeds of approximately 190 miles per hour. Boeing continues to enhance the Chinook. There have been recent advancements in the airframe, cargo handling, and a digital cockpit. Another innovation is the flight control system that would allow pilots to hover the aircraft in place in spite of brown outs and other low visibility conditions. AH-64 Apaches (1st Combat Camera Squadron, Photo by Tech. Sgt. Barry Loo) The Boeing AH-64 Apaches can be used for missions like assault and close air support. They’re fast, travelling at speeds more than 175 miles per hour. These helicopters bring serious firepower to the fight like 70mm rockets and laser-guided precision Hellfire missiles. An enemy force could also face weaponry like the 30mm automatic cannon with its 1,200 high explosive, ammunition rounds. To locate, track, and attack targets Apache can be equipped with systems like laser and infrared. The latest Apaches are amped up with further advantages like enhanced weaponry and the ability to detect objects without being detected. There are even ultra advanced systems to classify and threat-prioritize 128 targets in less than a minute.

Waist-Deep Mud At The Somme Behind The Golden Boughs ﻿ 19 June 2017 Business Air India A Bird’s Past, And Future... The Praful Patel years, which all but grounded AI, come under the lens just as privatisation looms Bhavna Vij-Aurora Photograph by Soumik Kar Mail Print Share A A A increase text size Around Christmas time in 2010, Praful Patel, the then civil aviation minister, hosted a party for top employees of Air India at his upscale Mumbai house. An exo­tic tree—the centerpiece in his rooftop garden—elicited a lot of interest. Praful reportedly told everyone that he had it transported from Bali on board a special Air India flight. A relatively minor act of misdemeanour by the suave Praful, it may not have found its way into the scathing report put out less than a year later by the government’s auditor. There was already eno­ugh for the CAG to sink its teeth into: its 2011 report came down heavily on Air India, its management and the ministry of civil aviation for various acts of omission and commission that landed the national carrier in a morass of debt that has now swelled to over Rs 50,000 crore. Praful was the minister in the cockpit from 2004 to 2011—the major duration of the UPA’s two terms in power. Advertisement opens in new window The chickens have now come home to roost. Three separate FIRs—all naming Praful as the man at the helm—have been registered by the CBI. This follows a Sup­reme Court directive in January 2017, based on a PIL filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan, regarding the purch­ase of 111 aircraft at a cost of Rs 70,000 crore. Air India had purchased 68 aircraft from Boeing, and Indian Airlines had picked up 43 from Airbus Group SE. “There’s no point harping on debt. It’s a valued brand. The Maharaja will be valued much higher than Kingfisher.” In a parallel, seemingly unrelated deve­lopment, the debt-ridden AI is back in the market with the government annou­ncing an intent­ion to disinvest/privatise. AI employees and officials are surprised by the sudden move, coming as it does at a time when the airline had stabilised and started registering an operational profit. Recently, it announced seven new flights to Washington, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Houston, Los Angeles, Tel Aviv and Nairobi. In 2016, it star­ted flights to Vienna, San Francisco, Madrid and a flight to Newark via London from Ahmedabad. AI’s return to profitability was even acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his 2016 I-day speech. “Air India was infamous for incurring losses. My government has succeeded in bringing Air India to a situation of clocking operational profit,” he had said. The airline had posted an operational profit of Rs 105 core for the year 2015-16. The buzz within AI is that the government was perhaps waiting for the natio­nal carrier to become profitable so that it could get buyers easily. “A dead organisation was just beginning to show signs of revi­val. It is unfair to try and sell it in such an unceremonious manner just when things were looking up,” says a senior AI official. Advertisement opens in new window In a letter signed collectively by emplo­yees as ‘Team Air India’ on May 29, they wrote to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley: “You have chosen to attack my company at a time when we were rebuilding its broken hull. Broken, I might add by a twisted bunch of politicians who ruled this country from 2004 to 2014 (UPA I-II).” The employees claim they are being targeted for no fault of theirs. The EGoM document that cleared AI’s costly purchase order In the letter, a copy of which was sent to the PMO, they lament that no one registered their dissent when they opposed the UPA governme­nt’s decisions at that time. It was a longish list: “…the largesse of the then civil aviation minister bestowing our routes to other nations without reciprocity or allowing Cabotage and Fifth Freedoms to other carriers…the wanton purchase of such a large number of aircraft on government debt…gifting away our bilaterals and routes and, most importantly, the illogical and questionable merger of AI and Indian Airlines.” Advertisement opens in new window Coincidentally, it’s on the same day, May 29, that the CBI registered the three FIRs against “unknown officials of ministry of civil aviation, government of India, Air India, and unknown private pers­ons”, investigating all the decisions the AI employees say they had opposed. The cases pertain to purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of aircraft, and handing over of lucrative international routes to private airlines. The AI-IA merger is also being investigated in a separate case registered as a preliminary inquiry. Praful’s name figures in all three FIRs as part of allegations made by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation before the Supreme Court. According to one of the FIRs, “It has been alleged by the petitioner that (the) ministry of civil aviation under Shri Praful Patel…by abusing (his) position as public servant in conspiracy with other public servants and private domestic and foreign airlines, made the national carriers give up profit-making routes and profit-making timings of AI in favour of national and international private airlines, causing a huge loss of marketshare.... Such acts of commission were made on extraneous considerations, causing immense loss to the national carriers and pecuniary benefit to private domestic/foreign airlines.” Advertisement opens in new window Another FIR, pertaining to the purch­ase of aircraft, says the CBI is probing allegations that AI, with only a slender profit of Rs 100 crore to show on its books, simply did not have the capacity to purchase even a few aircraft and immediately went into huge losses on account of that decision—now mounted to tens of thousands of crores. “The decision benefited foreign aircraft manufacturers and caused loss to national carriers,” it says. The CAG report had also red-flagged the purchases, saying the “acquisition appears to be supply-driven”. Since the entire acquisition was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for IA, “this was a recipe for disaster ab initio and should have raised alarm signals in MoCA, PIB (Public Investment Board) and the Planning Commission,” it said. No alarm bells rang. In fact, all bodies with a regulatory mandate seem to have gone along with the acquisition. Praful, contacted by Outlook, simply reiterates that all decisions were taken “collectively and by multi-tiered processes”. Not bot­hered about the probe, he says it is actually a good move. “There has been speculation for long. It will be good to have an investigation and put the issue to rest.” Advertisement opens in new window “They were all major decisions, consci­ously taken. The purchase order was cle­ared by an empowered group of minist­ers headed by P. Chidambaram and approved by Pranab Mukherjee, and ratified by the cabinet. A sovereign guarantee had to be given by the government for purchase of the aircraft. Not a single decision was mine alone. The decision does not even have my signature. It was signed by Chidambaram,” he says. On AI’s privatisation, Praful says he too had proposed this but then prime minister Manmohan Singh had shot it down saying it must continue as a public undertaking, and even the Left that supported the UPA would not have agreed to it. “I think the government should privatise it if it gets a good buyer,” he says. Former AI executive director Jitender Bhargava, who wrote The Des­cent of Air India, feels the government should not act in haste. “There is no point in harping over a Rs 50,000 crore debt. The assets of AI—and that is excluding its aircraft—would be more than Rs 50,000 crore. It’s still a valued brand. The Maharaja will be valued much higher than Kingfisher,” he says. It has assets, brand value and is a running comp­any. Bhargava says all options should be expl­ored, including putting the company on the stockmarket and making it a public limited company like ITC and Coal India, or debt restructuring by turning part of it into equity and renegotiating terms with banks. “The government must have a hands-off policy with AI; it should be managed professionally keeping commercial interests in mind,” suggests Bhargava. It’s a thought. After all, most business acumen that went into AI was apparently about shoring up the commercial interests of other entities.

United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, said on Friday they were not given the opportunity to bid against SpaceX on the contract for the launch of the Air Force's secretive spaceplane, also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle. Tory Bruno, the president and chief executive officer of ULA, tweeted June 9 in response to a question that his company didn’t have the chance to bid on the launch contract. ULA confirmed the tweet in a statement to Space News. Space News The Verge reported the contract with SpaceX was made public on Tuesday when Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson disclosed during Congressional testimony that the fifth mission of the X-37B would be taken up on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The launch is scheduled for sometime in August. File photo of X-37B at Vandenburg AFB U.S. govt. United Launch Alliance has launched the previous four X-37B missions aboard their Atlas 5 rockets. Needless to say, an Air Force spokesperson declined to comment on the launch or the contract with SpaceX, saying they could not provide any details, According to Space News. Reuters is reporting that SpaceX's first publicly acknowledged launch contract for the Air Force was awarded last year for a next-generation Global Positioning System satellite flight in 2018, while a second GPS satellite launch contract was awarded in March this year, to the tune of $83 million and $96.5 million respectively. The Orbital ATK Cygnus spacecraft sits on top of an Atlas V rocket on March 22, 2016 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, ahead of its launch to the International Space Station United Launch Alliance, NASA/AFP It should be noted that ULA did not compete for the first of the two GPS satellite contracts but did compete on the second, but lost. Folks will remember that on May 1, SpaceX sent up a spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) from its Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 39. About nine minutes later, the Falcon 9 booster successfully touched down on a landing pad on Florida's Space Coast. The NRO spy satellite contract was awarded in May 2016. And there is no doubt that it has come to a competition between ULA and SpaceX. It's all about cost. “Competition is reducing the cost of launch services,” Wilson said at the Congressional hearing. “Currently we’ve got two providers for medium and heavy launch."

He said plans are on to acquire 300 acres for Coimbatore, 450 acres for Tiruchy airport and 400 to 600 acres for Madurai airport for the expansion plans. The main plan to acquire more land is to ensure wide-bodied aircraft can land in these airports. “We are planning to operate Boeing B-747 and B-777, Airbus A-330 and other wide-bodied aircraft under Code E in these airports,” Mohapatra said. He said AAI had briefed the Chief Minister for the acquisition of 300 acres for Coimbatore airport as the city was growing and the airport had a huge demand. He said the government was looking into the proposal. The land was  for runway expansion. It is learnt that around 627.89 acre of land was earmarked for airport expansion, of which 461.90 acre is owned by private land owners and 134.33 acre by the defence department. Meanwhile, Tiruchy airport has a passenger traffic of around 12 million and is considered to be the fastest growing airport among tier-two cities in the country. Tiruchy airport is constructing a new terminal building and is also in the process of acquiring land for runway expansion. Thoothukudi airport, which was catering to only Avion de Transport Regional (ATR) aircraft, a twin-engine turboprop short-haul regional airliner, may soon be upgraded to handle Airbus A320 aircraft, which is a narrow body commercial passenger twin engine jet-liner, as plans are to acquire around 200 acres.

The Cabinet will decide on the process but we have already come towards the end of the assessment of the assets owned by the airline,' Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha told India Today.  The privatisation process could be completed within a year  Top level sources have told India Today that the privatisation process will be completed in the next 12 months.  But for an airline with bureaucratic baggage, it will be a difficult task. The first challenge will be to deal with the massive debt of Rs 52,000 crore. While top level sources have told India Today that the government is willing to write-off the debt for the potential buyer, the question is whether that option is attractive enough to lure in enough bids for the sell-off.  For the moment though, the government is not ruling out opening the doors to even foreign airlines to compete in the bidding process. 'We want Air India to be a global airline and are moving as quickly as we can,' Sinha said.  The government has swung into action with its think tank Niti Aayog mapping the blueprint for the sale of Maharaja. It took Niti Aayog just 15 days to draft the Air India privatization report.  'We did recommendation on Air India in just 15 days time, it was very clear from the analysis and statistics of its financial performance, that it will do better if you structure it with a private partner,' revealed Amitabh Kant, Niti Aayog CEO to India Today.  Niti Aayog has made a strong argument to put national carrier on the sale bloc and allocate the funds used to subsidize it for the education and health sector in its fourth report to the PMO.  But is the timing of announcement on the third anniversary of the Modi Government appropriate? While Air India has piled up a loss of Rs 3,643 crore in 2016-17, there has been trimming of corners with staff reduction and optimization of resources already.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Kids will play 'Modi quiz' at BJP summer holiday camps to... 'Fast' track to peace? Madhya Pradesh CM Chouhan to go on... Share this article Share In March itself the AI board had approved a proposal to induct seven Boeing 787-9 aircraft to improve international connectivity to Canada, U.S and Australia. Currently the national carrier has 103 planes out of which 42 are Boeing and 61 are Airbus carriers.  'We won't put the expansion of Air India on hold, all steps make commercial sense. If anyone wants to buy the airline, it would to take these steps', Sinha explained.   The process of Air India assets sale is another big challenge. Air India has 4 subsidiaries of Air India Express Limited (AIEL), Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL), Air India Transport Services Limited (AISTL) and Alliance Air.  Each subsidiary has different valuation with experts estimating Air India Express Limited valuation at Rs 8,000 cr, AIESL at Rs 3,000 cr and AITSL valued at roughly Rs 2,000 cr. It also has a joint venture with AISATS which provides ground handling for domestic airports, with rough estimated worth at Rs 1000 cr.  'It's a very value rich company there will be many buyers if there aren't the government needs to structure it in the right manner', Amitabh Kant said.  Interestingly during the Vajpayee government there was a push to sell a stake of Air India by then divestment minister Arun Shourie but the bidding war was stuck in a political and corporate quagmire.  But will the Modi government learn from the past to give Air India private wings this time? 'Our government is transparent and it will happen in this case as well, our government is for the people and we are ready to make any changes to make Air India more competitive', Sinha added. 2 Read more: India News - Latest Headlines, Pictures and Videos | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

I say this with a certain level of humility, because Pierce graduates have already learned and given so many life lessons. What a joy to celebrate with them!” Story reprinted, with permission, from Pierce News website.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) Canada pushing ahead with stopgap plan to buy St. Louis-made Super Hornets, defense chief says By David Ljunggren Reuters 11 hrs ago (…) An F/A 18 Super Hornet sits on the flight deck of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman, off the coast of Florida, Sunday, Sept. 20, 2009. The ship was participating in a Joint Task Force Exercise in preparation for deployment to Afghanistan. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) OTTAWA • Canada is pressing ahead with plans to buy an interim fleet of 18 St. Louis-made F/A-18 Super Hornets, the country's top soldier told Reuters, speaking amid tensions with the United States that could derail a proposed deal with Boeing Co. General Jonathan Vance, chief of the defense staff general, said the armed forces needed the jets as a stopgap measure while Canada prepares a competition to buy a fleet of 88 new planes, a process scheduled to take five years. "There is a capability gap," he said in an interview late on Thursday. "There is a gap, and it needs to be filled." Canada's fleet of 77 CF-18s, some of which are almost 40 years old, is coming to the end of its operational life. Ottawa said last year it wanted to buy 18 Super Hornets as an interim measure but has since threatened to scrap the plan unless the U.S. company drops an anti-dumping challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc. Vance declined to comment on the dispute. Critics say it makes little sense to buy fighters that might be only used for a short period. Vance dismissed the idea of leasing the fleet. "One cannot lease fighters," he said. Should Canada decide not to acquire the Boeing planes as a stopgap measure, it could order from Lockheed Martin Corp., Dassault Aviation SA or Airbus SE. Depending on Canada's choice for the permanent fleet, this could result in the Royal Canadian Air Force operating two different kinds of modern jets at the same time, a prospect that did not worry Vance.

Canada says the 88 new planes must be interoperable with those used by allies such as the United States. The importance of working seamlessly with the Americans means Canada is likely to buy U.S. jets for the permanent fleet, people familiar with the matter have previously told Reuters. Vance said this was not a fair assumption. Canada on Wednesday announced a major increase in defense spending after Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the nation would have to play a larger global role as the United States retreats. Vance said Canada's close military ties with the United States would remain intact. "Our relationship is incredibly tight, necessarily so and usefully so," he said, "and it stays that way."   Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Airbus says passenger plane market to double within 20 years Money Friday 9 June 2017 - 4:44pm File. Airbus anticipates that air traffic will grow at 4.4 percent annually, requiring some 35,000 new passenger and dedicated freighter aircraft over the next two decades. Photo: AFP TOULOUSE - Airbus on Friday said it expects the market for large passenger planes to more than double in the next 20 years driven by growth from Asian markets. Raising its previous forecasts for the next two decades, the European aircraft maker also said a slowdown in orders over the past several months did not signal a drop in the market. "The trend is positive," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. READ: Global air traffic is up 6%, boosted by low-cost carriers Airbus last week had warned it expects slow orders this year and perhaps next year, too, but said it was a normal part of the business cycle. The planemaker predicts the need for 35,000 new planes worth $5.3 trillion over the next two decades, an increase from last year's estimates. "Air travel is remarkably resilient to external shocks and doubles every 15 years," said its chief operating officer for customer relations, John Leahy. "Asia Pacific continues to be an engine for growth, with domestic China to become the world's largest market." The numbers released Friday, as the industry gears up for the Paris Air Show later this month, show a six percent increase from last year's forecasts in terms of numbers of aircraft and a two percent increase in value. READ: Airbus, Boeing shine at Paris Air Show Airbus last year already raised its 20-year forecasts, which it publishes each year, as does its US rival Boeing. The number of aircraft worldwide that count over 100 seats should reach more than 40,000 while airline traffic will increase by 4.4 percent per year over the time period, according to the Airbus estimates released Friday. This means hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the planemaker said, estimating the need for 530,000 more pilots and 550,000 new maintenance engineers. The planemaker Friday cited more first-time flyers and rising disposable income for air travel as other reasons for its forecast. Emerging markets in China and India, as well as other parts of Asia and Latin America, are growing nearly twice as fast as North America and Western Europe. READ: Airline industry sees higher profits in 2017 Airbus is also hoping the expected demand will feed the appetite for its superjumbo jet A380 model. "The A380 is the solution for future traffic growth" said Leahy Friday. AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

ORIGINALS Exclusive interviews, news and more Blue Sky Innovation Blue Sky Originals Machine learning is tech's hot trend, but how are Chicago companies using it? Robert Holly / Blue Sky Avant Senior Data Scientist Edward Herman answers questions during the Data-Driven Chicago event at Groupon's headquarters in Chicago. Avant Senior Data Scientist Edward Herman answers questions during the Data-Driven Chicago event at Groupon's headquarters in Chicago. (Robert Holly / Blue Sky) Robert HollyBlue Sky Innovation Machine learning’s trendy tech is powering products all over Silicon Valley, but Chicagoans are using artificial intelligence in a more practical sense, Uptake’s Adam McElhinney says. “I see a big contrast between the way Chicago companies are using machine learning and the way some of the Silicon Valley companies are maybe using machine learning,” said McElhinney, vice president of data science at the predictive-analytics startup that targets construction, mining and other industrial sectors. “If you look at these companies, they’re all solving big, tangible problems for customers — not trying to sell a 99-cent iPhone app.” He joined representatives from Avant, Civis Analytics, Groupon and Narrative Science Thursday evening for “Data-Driven Chicago,” an event at Groupon’s headquarters where each company shared how they’re using machine learning to make sense of massive amounts of data. Affordable sensors — along with improved connectivity and data storage capacity — are creating opportunities across Uptake’s verticals, McElhinney said. Sensors on a Boeing 787 airplane, for example, can put out roughly 40 terabytes of data per hour, and future advancements may also lead to commonplace devices with more potent processing power, he said. “I think you’re going to see a lot more computing power spread to smaller devices that exist,” McElhinney said. “That camera right there probably has a small microprocessor on it, and it’s going to start running models that maybe identify faces and focus on those.” Groupon Product Manager Laura Hamilton said the deal-finding company uses machine learning to take advantage of all the consumer data it collects. “We’re talking about tens of billions of customer activities for us, counting clicks and searches and this and that,” Hamilton said. “We need to recommend folks deals in a fraction of a second, so that technical engineering that goes into making that happen instantaneously while a user is on her phone, I think, has been a really exciting challenge here at Groupon.” Advancements in deep learning could, in years to come, lead to Groupon’s interface being replaced by “the next frontier” of user-to-machine voice conversation, Hamilton said. Instead of going to its mobile app, Groupon’s customers would simply ask their phones to find deals and act on them. Andrew Paley, director of product design at Narrative Science, highlighted his startup’s advanced natural-language-generation platform Quill, which he said was originally developed by a Northwestern University student as part of a class project to convert baseball box scores into “old-timey,” human-sounding sports stories. With a more recent pivot toward business, Quill reviews data, automatically understands what’s important and then synthesizes that information in a narrative fashion. Financial institutions, which use Quill to pull insights from suspicious activity reports, are among the platform’s users, Paley said. “There’s an enormous, overwhelming amount of data out there,” he said. “We want to help people understand the world as reflected in data, at scale, and help them make better decisions.” The subreddit on machine learning and scholarly articles by Christopher Bishop and Kevin Murphy are good starting points for data enthusiasts looking to learn more about the topic, speakers said. Elon Musk’s OpenAI Gym and fast.ai were recommended as useful training resources. About 100 people attended Data-Driven Chicago, according to organizers. Presentations will be uploaded to YouTube within a couple of weeks, according to Groupon’s James Ellis, who served as master of ceremonies. A follow-up event is tentatively planned for September, he said. Robert Holly is a freelance writer. Twitter @robertwadeholly Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Groupon Inc. Kevin P.

Devina Gupta  | Posted by Bijin Jose  Follow @dg86   Devina.Gupta@aajtak.com New Delhi, June 9, 2017 | UPDATED 07:57 IST A +A - Highlights 1 Modi government has decided to privatise the 52,000 cr debt laden Air India. 2 Niti Aayog is mapping the blueprint for the sale of Maharajah. 3 Air India's national grid is backbone of the UDAN scheme for regional connectivity. In its boldest move yet the Narendra Modi government has decided to privatise the 52,000 cr debt laden national carrier the Air India.  A decision that will raise the hackles of trade unions and Left parties who have managed to block disinvestment in the airline sector for over 25 years. But now the government has swung into action with its think tank Niti Aayog mapping the blueprint for the sale of Maharajah. It took Niti Aayog just 15 days to draft the Air India privatisation report. "We did recommendation on Air India in just 15 days time, it was very clear from its analysis and statistics of its financial performance, it was very clear that it will do better if you structure it with a private partner," revealed Amitabh Kant, Niti Aayog CEO to India Today. Niti Aayog has made a strong argument to put national carrier on the sale bloc and divert the funds used to subsidise it for education and health sector needs in its fourth report to the PMO. "Our belief is that government is very good at somethings and pathetic at other things. It should get out of areas where its very bad and it should take out resources which are not in productive area should be taken out. There is no rationale of government to put money into an airline which is just taking 14 per cent of market share. Private sector has done pretty well and our analysis showed that resources required are huge and they need to be put in education and health," asks Amitabh Kant, Niti Aayog CEO. As a first step, the finance minister has shared a report from Niti Aayog on Air India with the aviation ministry. Speaking to India Today Jayant Sinha, Junior Minister of Civil Aviation for the first time has confirmed that the assessment of Air India's assets is already underway. "There are no 'two opinions' in the government about the privatisation of Air India. Cabinet will decide on the process but we have already come towards the end of the assessment of the assets owned by the airline," said Jayant Sinha, MoS Civil Aviation. BURDEN OF DEBT But for an airline with bureaucratic baggage, it will be a difficult task. First challenge will be to deal with massive debt of 52,000 crore.  While top level sources have told India Today that the government is willing to write-off the debt for the potential buyer, the question is if that option is lucrative enough to lure in enough bids for the sell-off. For the moment though, the government is not ruling out opening doors to even foreign airlines to compete in the bidding process. "We want Air India to be a global airlines and are moving as  quickly as we can," said Jayant Sinha, MoS Civil Aviation. But is the timing of announcement on the third anniversary of the Modi Government appropriate? While it has clocked loss of 3643 crore in last fiscal, there has been trimming of corners with staff reduction and optimisation of resources already. In March itself AI board had approved a proposal to induct 7 Boeing 787-9 aircraft to improve international connectivity to Canada, US and Australia. Currently the national carrier has 103 planes out of which 42 are Boeing and 61 are Airbus carrier. "We won't put expansion of Air India on hold, all steps make commercial sense. If anyone wants to buy the airline, it would to take these steps," said Jayant Sinha, MoS Civil Aviation.  Air India's national grid is backbone of the government's UDAN scheme for regional connectivity. But will the Maharajah be able to keep air fare under control or will privatisation have its own set of compulsions? "We will keep fare under control, all airlines are in competitive fare market," assured Jayant Sinha, MoS Civil Aviation. BIG CHALLENGE AHEAD The process of Air India assets sale is another big challenge. Air India has 4 subsidiaries of Air India Express Limited (AIEL), Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL), Air India Transport Services Limited (AISTL) and Alliance Air. Each subsidiary has different valuation with experts estimating Air India Express Limited valuation at 8,000 crore, AIESL at 3,000 crore and AITSL valued at roughly 2,000 crore. It also has a joint venture with AISATS which provides ground handling for domestic airports, with rough estimated worth at 1000 crore. "Its a very value rich company there will be many buyers if there aren't the government needs to structure it in the right manner", said Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog Interestingly during Vajpayee tenure there was a push to sell stake of Air India by then divestment minister Arun Shourie but the bidding war was stuck in political and corporate quagmire. But will Modi government learn from the past to give Air India private wings this time? "Our government is transparent and it will happen in this case as well, our government is for the people and we are ready to make any changes to make Air India more competitive", said Jayant Sinha, MoS Civil Aviation Top level sources have told India Today that the privatisation process will be completed in the next 12 months.

Ancient city walls still enclose a large portion of the city center, and about 6 miles (10 kilometers) out from the center of the city, a highway forms a huge circle around the capital Top left: Manhattan's rectangular street grids came to be from the New York Commissioners' Plan of 1811. Top right: Paris' square mile shows the Arc de Triomphe at its center with streets radiating outwards from it. Bottom left: Tunisia's capital, Tunis, has a complex layout. Bottom right: Atlanta's layout is typical of many American cities, disconnected and auto-centric An aerial view of the cityscape of San Francisco, California. San Francisco occupies the tip of a 32-mile peninsula between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The city has many one-way streets and its downtown streets are arranged in a grid pattern - with the exceptions of Market Street and Columbus Avenue, which cut across the grid at right angles to each other Even when comparing the block sizes of Portland and Irvine, you can see that the block sizes in Irvine are much larger and not as easily navigable on foot as the blocks of Portland.   In another image, a square mile of New York, Paris, Tunis and Atlanta's city layouts are depicted.  Manhattan's well known rectangular street grids came to be from the New York Commissioners' Plan of 1811. The only real break visible in Manhattan's grid is Broadway, which runs diagonally across.  The Manhattan grid system arose from the commissioner's plan of 1811: The original design for the streets of Manhattan above Houston Street and below 155th street, which put in place the grid system of streets and avenues that defines Manhattan. The task of designing Manhattan's city plan was given by New York City’s Common Council to three statesmen in 1807 Paris is broken down into 20 arrondissements (municipal districts), each of which has its own mayor, town hall, and particular features. The numbering of the arrondissements begins in the center of the city and continues in a spiral shape, ending to the east. The city was re-designed in 1853 by Baron Haussmann, who launched a huge renovation program of Paris Atlanta's layout is typical of many American cities - coarse-grained and disconnected, surrounded by freeways and very auto-centric. Its interstate 75-85 cuts through the center of downtown Atlanta, worsening its traffic congestion problems. Atlanta's public transportation system, the MARTA, is a plus-shaped subway line and so doesn't serve patches of the city  THE COMMISIONER'S PLAN OF 1811  The commissioner's plan of 1811 was the original design for the streets of Manhattan above Houston Street and below 155th street, which put in place the grid system that defines Manhattan. The task of designing Manhattan's city plan was given by New York City’s Common Council to three statesmen in the spring of 1807. These three men were appointed 'Commissioners of Streets and Roads' and would spend the next 4 years developing a plan that would meet the Common Council’s stated goal of 'laying out Streets... in such a manner as to unite regularity and order with the public convenience and benefit and in particular to promote the health of the City...' Source: New York Public Library  By contrast, Paris' square mile  shows the Arc de Triomphe at its center with streets radiating outwards from it, as designed by Baron Haussmann, who launched a huge renovation program of Paris which included building wide avenues, parks and squares as well as new sewers and aqueducts.  Tunisia's capital, Tunis, has a complex layout that developed over the middle ages. It's centered around its Medina - a section found in many cities in North Africa which is usually walled with narrow, maze-like streets radiating from it.  By contrast, Atlanta is very different from older cities like Tunis.  Atlanta's layout is typical of many American cities - coarse-grained and disconnected, surrounded by freeways and very auto-centric.  The final map presented by Geoff Boeing depicts Boston, Jumeirah circle in Dubai, suburban northeastern Sacramento, and Osaka, Japan. Boston has curving, winding streets along with patches of grid. Dubai's layout is auto-centric and is connected by large roadways leading from one development to the next. All of the maps show different kinds of places in cities: downtowns, business parks and some suburban residential neighborhoods.  Top left: Boston has curving, winding streets along with patches of grid. Top right: Dubai's layout is auto-centric and connected by large roadways leading from one development to the next. Bottom left: Suburban northeastern Sacramento, which is very different to its grid-like downtown. Bottom right: Osaka, Japan is divided into 5 grid sections Dubai's city layout is auto-centric and is connected by large roadways leading from one development to the next. Because of its layout, it's difficult to walk anywhere within the city. The city lacks shared public places so most people travel to buildings such as malls and hotel resorts using cars as a mode of transportation  Boeing notes that street patterns vary a lot within cities. For example, Portland's suburban east side looks very different to its downtown area, and Sacramento's grid-like downtown looks very different to its residential suburbs.  The research paper explaining Boeing's street network methods is still under review.  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video NASA's new Mars rover looks an awful lot like the Batmobile Watch video Microsoft teases its new Xbox E3 Scorpio ahead of its release Watch video Amazing research reveals babies can recognise faces in the WOMB Watch video Promotional video for the highly anticipated OnePlus 5 smartphone Watch video Breathtaking video brings NASA photos of moon mission to life Watch video Amputated worms regenerate as double-headed worms in space Watch video Shocking moment woman falls through trapdoor while texting Watch video Passengers laugh as drunk couple romp on a Ryanair flight Watch video Moment London Bridge attackers shot dead during frenzied stabbing Watch video Boy begins to drown in swimming pool in Finland and nobody notices Watch video Shocking video of woman hit by car and then run over in China Watch video Moment a toddler helps his baby brother escape from his crib Read more: geoffboeing.com/... geoffboeing.com/...

General Jonathan Vance, chief of the defense staff general, said the armed forces needed the jets as a stopgap measure while Canada prepares a competition to buy a fleet of 88 new planes, a process scheduled to take five years. "There is a capability gap," he said in an interview late on Thursday. "There is a gap, and it needs to be filled." Canada's fleet of 77 CF-18s, some of which are almost 40 years old, is coming to the end of its operational life. Ottawa said last year it wanted to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornets as an interim measure but has since threatened to scrap the plan unless the U.S. company drops an anti-dumping challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc. Vance declined to comment on the dispute. Critics say it makes little sense to buy fighters that might be only used for a short period. Vance dismissed the idea of leasing the fleet. "One cannot lease fighters," he said. Should Canada decide not to acquire the Boeing planes as a stopgap measure, it could order from Lockheed Martin Corp, Dassault Aviation SA or Airbus SE. Depending on Canada's choice for the permanent fleet, this could result in the Royal Canadian Air Force operating two different kinds of modern jets at the same time, a prospect that did not worry Vance. "Why is it so odd that the RCAF would be operating two fleets?" he said. "We used to operate three, four fleets." Canada says the 88 new planes must be interoperable with those used by allies such as the United States. The importance of working seamlessly with the Americans means Canada is likely to buy U.S. jets for the permanent fleet, people familiar with the matter have previously told Reuters. Vance said this was not a fair assumption. Canada on Wednesday announced a major increase in defense spending after Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the nation would have to play a larger global role as the United States retreats. Vance said Canada's close military ties with the United States would remain intact. "Our relationship is incredibly tight, necessarily so and usefully so," he said, "and it stays that way."

The WTO panel found one U.S. subsidy programme, a business and occupancy (B&O) tax rate reduction in the state of Washington, totalling $325 million in 2013-2015, that had actual adverse effects. The damage to EU interests only related to three single-aisle aircraft sales campaigns involving customers from the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Iceland.

The airline, however, said all the existing orders will be respected and new aircraft are being added to the fleet. "Whatever has been ordered in the past, that is there," Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani told reporters here, adding that no fresh orders will be placed right now. Ordering of new planes is a long-term process by Air India and it usually takes 6-9 months, he added. Asked how long the company would go without placing fresh orders, Lohani said: "We do not know. We have to keep on running the airline. There is no decision on that." He, however, denied reports that some old orders have been cancelled. "No, not right. Whatever the orders, these were ordered before. These will be coming," Lohani said. Giving details of Air India's order list, the CMD said: "We are adding 10 ATRs. We have placed order for 29 Airbus on lease. They have started coming now. But we are also grounding old aircraft. We have lot of old aircraft. So the net addition will be only about 15 Airbus." Besides, the airline is procuring wide-bodied Boeing aircraft to its fleet to strengthen the international route. "Also, seven more wide-bodies (Boeing) will be added in next 6-7 months. We are starting lots of international flights," Lohani said. The state-owned carrier has a total of 103 planes, of which 42 are wide-bodied Boeing 777s, 747s and 787s, while 61 are narrow-bodied Airbus 319s, 320s and 321s. Its low-cost subsidiary Air India Express has 23 Boeing 737s at present. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has proposed privatisation of Air India and the Civil Aviation Ministry is looking at all options to make the airline strong and viable. A Cabinet note in this regard is likely to be prepared shortly, according to Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha. The development came against the backdrop of NITI Aayog submitting its suggestions on the future course for the airline. Air India has piled up over Rs 50,000 crore of debt, mainly because of high maintenance costs and lease rent. Since the merger of Indian Airlines with itself, Air India has been in the red. However, it posted an operational profit of Rs 105 crore on account of low fuel prices and increased passenger numbers in 2015-16.

The total forecast for 34,899 passenger and freight aircraft was up from 33,070 aircraft predicted a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries was built into forecasts. Airbus programmes chief Didier Evrard listed several "challenges" for 2017 in the presentation, including raising total deliveries to more than 700 at the same time as introducing new variants.  The company's chief executive Tom Enders reaffirmed the same delivery target in separate comments to journalists.  Airbus has given both formal and informal targets for 2017, with its finance director predicting "over 720 deliveries" alongside the group's first-quarter results.   More on News Business Airbus planes Most Read 1Sterling recovers from sharp drop after UK result18:30 2Economic impact of Westminster shock17:57 3AIB's IPO timetable 'designed to cater for UK election'14:46 4Even before new political chaos, UK economy was limping15:35 5Car sales slow down by 5.4% in May - CSO11:40 More for you.

Most Popular {{item.title | formatTitle}} Company News 20h ago Airbus CEO worried by Qatar crisis, risk of hard Brexit Reuters Airbus CEO Tom Enders , AP Photo/Kerstin Joensson TOULOUSE, France — The head of Airbus expressed worries about growing geopolitical uncertainties on Thursday, calling the rift between key customer Qatar and its Gulf neighbors troubling and warning of the impact of a "hard Brexit" on the planemaker's U.K. operations. "Any disruption in any mature region or market that is relevant for us is a reason for concern," chief executive Tom Enders told reporters. Referring to the aviation blockade against Qatar imposed by Saudi Arabia and others this week, Enders said: "That's a development that is troubling for our industry, for many industries. We sincerely hope that these disruptions are not developing to a long-term conflict." The bust-up between Arab powers has dealt a blow to Gulf carriers already hurt by low oil prices and laptop bans and exposed the sensitivity of Gulf hubs to regional uncertainty, delegates at an airlines meeting said this week. Analysts say any prolonged disruption could prompt Qatar to delay taking aircraft deliveries from Airbus and Boeing. Speaking at a media briefing ahead of the June 19-25 Paris Airshow, Enders played down suggestions that Airbus, the world's second-largest planemaker behind Boeing (BA.N), was too reliant on the Middle East. "We are far from being over exposed… to this region," he said, noting it made up 13 per cent of unfilled orders. "I think this region will remain important and relevant even allowing for some recouping, some consolidation; nobody can exclude that for the long term." With talks looming on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, Enders said Airbus's U.K. plants were among its most competitive and warned against crimping this advantage through restrictions on people or goods. "We are a company that is obviously very interested in the free flow of people. The mobility between our sites in Europe is crucially important," he said. "Any tariff barriers could also potentially impact the competitiveness of our activities in Britain." Enders was speaking shortly before a shock exit poll suggested that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had failed to maintain an overall majority after calling an election to strengthen her Conservative government's position ahead of EU negotiations. Several companies have expressed concerns over a so-called "hard Brexit" under which trade tariffs could apply. Enders said "any British government paying attention to the importance of the aerospace industry is well aware of what is at stake." Analysts say Airbus is expected to press U.K. governments for continued support for the aerospace industry as the price for maintaining the same level of U.K. investment for future aircraft programs.

However, the air show will also serve as a demonstration, as the Finnish air force is currently in the process of choosing a new fighter jet. © Photo: Youtube/ Shephard Media Swedish Saab Hopes to Make Billions on Europe's Sweeping Military Upgrades With Only Two Subs SoldThe free air show in Helsinki's Kaivopuisto Park is part of Finland's 100-year anniversary celebrations and is expected to draw around 100,000 viewers. While the show will feature aviation history, as well as an aerobatic display by the British Red Arrows, which ranks among the world's premier flying performance teams, Helsinki's skies will be filled with some of the world's most advanced fighters, such as the US Super Hornet, the EU Eurofighter Typhoon and the Swedish Gripen. Their presence at the show is coincidence, since all three of them are being considered by the Finnish Air Force as a replacement for the outdated fleet of F-18 Hornets currently in use as its foundation. While approaching their "best before" date, these fighters will also take part in the aerobatics display. #Kaivopuisto'n edustalla jyrisee, kun suuri ilmailunäytös alkaa.

This idea is heavily supported by the commander of the Armed Forces, Juhani Kaskeala, according to whom the new generation of the Hornet is easiest to adapt to for pilots, the Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat reported. © AP Photo/ File Cult Cold-War Era US Bombers Partake in Major Nordic ExerciseFurthermore, Helsinki residents and city guests will also be able to catch a glimpse of the Swedish multirole fourth-gen fighter JAS 39 Gripen developed by Saab. In addition to their country of origin Sweden, these are also in service in the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand. The Eurofighter Typhoon, which has been developed and manufactured by a European consortium featuring the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, is currently in service in Germany, Italy, Spain, Great Britain, Austria and Saudi Arabia. #Eurofighter #Typhoon'it saapuivat #HelsinkiAirport'lle. #Kaivopuisto'n #lentonäytös lähestyy… pic.twitter.com/E9TL7KBvuh — lentoposti.fi (@lentopostifi) 8 июня 2017 г. ​The two other replacement options, which will not be shown in Helsinki, are the F-35 by US manufacturer Lockheed Martin and the French Rafale. Earlier this year, Finnish Defense Minister Jussi Niinistö declared additional measures to block contacts with lobbyists and add transparency to the process of competitive selection. © AFP 2017/ LAURA BUCKMAN Norway Looking Forward to Grand Rebate on F-35s Following Trump's TweetsThe goal of replacing the 60 F-18s currently in use is set to become one of the biggest purchases in Finnish history at up to $20 billion sand will be finalized in 2021. The aircraft are expected to be put into service by 2030. All in all, 80 aircraft of different generations will be put on display in Helsinki. What makes the air show all the more unique is that it was last organized at Kaivopuisto in 1955. "Last time such a display was arranged over the sea and it happened in the 1970s," organizer Perttu Karivalo told the Finnish newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet.

Brave Betty Bromage was strapped to the wing of a 1944 Boeing -Stearman so she could do the death-defying stunt hundreds of feet up in the air. The 88-year-old, who lives in a retirement home in Cheltenham, Glos., took off from Gloucestershire Airport and reached speeds of 140mph. The pensioner donned goggles and a woolly jumper as she strutted along the wings of the yellow vintage biplane .

Her stunt raised over £1,100, with all the money going to Midlands Air Ambulance Charity. She said: "I had a wonderful time, and being a retired nurse, am happy to support the Air Ambulance in their work that I have seen first hand. "I am now looking for my next challenge." The pensioner flew at high speeds hundreds of feet in the air (Photo: SWNS.com) Margaret Winterbourne, who works at Abbeyfield House where Betty lives, said: "Betty enjoyed the exhilaration of her flight over the local countryside, while her family, friends and fellow residents looked on with apprehension, then relief when she landed safely and happily." Susie Godwin, Fundraising Manager for the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity in Gloucestershire, said: "This is a wonderful challenge that Betty Bromage undertook on July 8, and we are very grateful to Betty, her family and friends for bringing in much needed funds to keep our Air Ambulance operational, 365 days a year, Saving Lives by Saving Time".

While most funds invested in new military capabilities are spent on major weapons programs, a number of military inventions over the years also had civilian applications. In fact, some of the most widely used commercial products today were originally developed for the purpose of defending the country. 24/7 Wall St. identified 15 such products. The federal government has always been the most powerful and resource-rich entity in the United States. As a result, the military has had the means to make incredibly large investments, either through its own research agencies or through contracts with private companies. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was involved in major innovations such as the internet, is behind two products on this list: GPS and the Aspen Movie Map, a precursor to Google’s Street View. The private and public spheres are closely interwoven in what is known as the military-industrial complex. Click ahead to see 15 commercial products invented for use by the military. 1. Drones © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1863 The origin of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) dates back to the middle of the U.S. Civil War in 1863, when New York City inventor Charles Perley patented a hot air balloon that functioned as an unmanned aerial bomber. The balloons may have been used by both Union and Confederate forces but were unreliable and extremely dangerous for users. UAVs would not be used again by the military until the development of radio control at the turn of the 20th century. The United States has been increasingly using UAVs -- also known as drones -- in military operations in recent years. More than 10,000 U.S. military flight drones are used for surveillance and combat purposes. Drones are now used in a wide range of commercial applications as well, including crop growth monitoring and watering, surveying, filmmaking, law enforcement, and personal enjoyment by hobbyists. 2. Undershirts © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1904 People have been wearing undergarments of one kind or another for thousands of years. However, it was not until they were made part of the official Navy uniform in 1905 that cotton, T-shaped undershirts were widely produced or worn. In the previous year, the Cooper Underwear Company marketed a cotton pullover to male bachelors with no sewing skills. The pullover T-shirt served as a simpler alternative to higher-maintenance traditional button up shirts. As for a number of other products on this list, the convenience and practicality of these garments appealed immediately to the military. In the case of undershirts, their use in the Navy popularized the term crewneck shirt. 3. Instant coffee © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1910 The roots of instant coffee may be traced back to 1771 in Britain, although some form of the coffee is claimed to have emerged in a number of other countries at varying periods. In the United States, instant coffee was first mass produced in 1910 and was received poorly by ordinary consumers. The military, however, greatly appreciated the convenience and versatility of instant coffee. According to Nestle, the entire production of its U.S. instant coffee plant, around 1 million cases, was reserved for the military in a single year during World War II. According to market research firm Euromonitor International, today nearly half of the world prefers instant coffee. On the other hand, instant coffee accounts for a relatively small share of the U.S. coffee market. 4. Feminine hygiene products © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1914 The earliest evidence of tampon-like feminine hygiene products dates back to Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the modern tampon has its roots in World War I. Until the 1920s, there was no ubiquitous form of menstrual absorption products, and many women relied on homemade products. During World War I, a cheap alternative padding was developed when a cotton supply shortage increased the demand for other forms of cheap bandaging. Under a government contract, Kimberly-Clark Co. was able to manufacture cellucotton, an absorbent material made from wood pulp. The material caught the attention of Red Cross nurses, who began to utilize cellucotton wads during menstruation. After the war, Kimberly-Clark repurposed cellucotton to make sanitary napkins and Kotex pads. While today it is estimated that 70% of women of menstruating age use tampons, many drug and department stores initially refused to carry the Kotex pads due to sensitivity to the issue. 5. Aviator sunglasses © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1930s Today an iconic fashion item, the characteristic shape and dark lenses of aviator sunglasses were once necessary protection for test pilots subject to the dangerously bright sunlight of the upper atmosphere. In the 1930s, optics manufacturer Bausch & Lomb developed aviator goggles under the direction of the U.S. Army Air Corps. Bausch & Lomb rebranded the sunglasses in 1937 as Ray-Ban -- as they banish the sun’s rays -- and sold them to the civilian population. By World War II, aviators were a standard accessory for U.S. soldiers. The glasses were further popularized by Hollywood stars in the 1950s, and the cultural vanguard continued to wear them throughout the decades. 6. Jeep © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1940 In World War II, the U.S. Army had a need for a light reconnaissance vehicle and asked automakers to develop prototypes and submit proposals. The government chose the design of American Bantam car company -- a four-wheel drive vehicle with a top speed of 65 mph. The automobile’s namesake, General Purpose, was abbreviated to G.P. and eventually nicknamed jeep. The jeep proved an invaluable contribution to the U.S. military effort, with then General Dwight D. Eisenhower stating that “America could not have won World War II without it.” The company manufactured more than 600,000 jeeps during the war, and later sold the postwar surplus to the public rather cheaply. Today, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sells Jeeps. While the military use of jeeps has dwindled since World War II, U.S. sales of the Jeep Wrangler -- which bears many of the design characteristics of the original -- exceeded 200,000 units in 2016. 7. Aerosol bug spray © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1941 In World War II, soldiers stationed in the South Pacific needed an easy way to kill mosquitos, which could potentially carry malaria. In a partnership with the Department of Defense, two scientists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Lyle Goodhue and William Sullivan, took on the task of developing a way to deliver insecticide as a fine mist. The first aerosol can was patented in 1941 and nicknamed “bug bomb” by soldiers. The partnership between the USDA and the DoD has yielded other life-saving innovations, including the use of DDT in controlling typhus. In 1949, engineer and veteran Robert Abplanalp patented a cheaper plastic aerosol valve meant for commercial mass production. He started the Precision Valve Corp. to market the invention and turned a profit almost immediately. The aerosol can has since been refined and is now less harmful to the environment. 8. Duct tape © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1942 During World War II, the U.S. military was in need of a durable adhesive tape that could maintain its bond under harsh field conditions. The military asked Johnson & Johnson Co. to develop the idea, and initially called it duck tape for its waterproof nature. Civilians began to utilize the product heavily during the postwar housing boom, when it was used to seal central air and heating systems. Duck tape was used in ductwork so much that it was renamed and recolored to match the silver metallic color of HVAC systems. Known for its versatile uses, duct tape has recently taken on another life as material used in a variety of personal products, including wallets, bags and phone cases. Multiple companies, including Scotch and Duck Brand, now manufacture duct tape. 9. Super glue © Wikimedia Commons> Date invented: 1942 Eastman Kodak was one of many companies that contributed to the war effort during World War II. In 1942, while testing a variety of compounds for use in a plastic rifle sight, Dr. Harry Coover a company chemist, inadvertently created cyanoacrylate, a compound later marketed as Super Glue. The material was incredibly durable but was dismissed for being too sticky. When a colleague was testing cyanoacrylate nine years later, Dr. Coover had another encounter with the material. As the colleague complained the compound ruined his equipment, Coover realized its commercial potential. Super Glue was first sold as a commercial product in 1958. The product was eventually adopted by military surgeons during the Vietnam War, who would spray it over wounds to stop bleeding instantly. 10. Silly Putty © https://www.flickr.com/photos/pugno_muliebriter/> Date invented: 1943 In the 1940s, the United States needed a new source of rubber after Japan had invaded Malaysia and cut off U.S. supply of the material. The War Production Board asked the nation’s industries for help. A chemist at General Electric came up with a stretchy, bouncy material made of boric acid and silicone oil. While highly unique, the material had no military application. The material caught on, however, after GE executives began showing it off at cocktail parties and one interested party, adman Peter Hodgson, bought the manufacturing rights and changed the name to Silly Putty. The product, packaged in small plastic eggs as a toy, began selling in 1950 and immediately caught on. In 1968, astronauts on the Apollo 8 mission used Silly Putty to help keep their instruments in place. Since 1950, the company has sold more than 350 million Silly Putty eggs. 11. Frozen juice concentrate © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1945 In 1943, the USDA and the Florida Citrus Commission set to work on the development of a frozen juice concentrate that could be sent to U.S. soldiers overseas. At the time of their collaboration, orange juice that had been frozen and thawed would turn an unappetizing brown color. The thawed juice also developed a bitter taste, prompting soldiers to nickname the beverage “battery acid.” Eventually, USDA scientists discovered that adding a dash of fresh orange juice to the concentrate before freezing it preserved its flavor. The process was patented in 1945 but made available to any public or private entity that wished to use it. Minute Maid began selling frozen juice products commercially in 1946. In 2014, orange juice was the most commonly consumed fruit product in the United States, with the average citizen drinking 31.3 pounds of juice annually. 12. Microwave oven © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1946 Microwave technology was originally used as a radar to help locate enemies during World War II. The ability of microwaves to cook food was discovered by accident. While conducting research on microwave radar technology, an engineer at defense contractor Raytheon Company noticed that a candy bar in his pocket had melted. This led to the realization that microwave equipment could be repurposed to heat and cook foods. Later that year, Raytheon Company filed the first patent for a microwave oven. The first commercial microwave was manufactured in 1954 and was about the size of a refrigerator. Today, more than nine in 10 U.S. households own a microwave oven. The technology is one of many military inventions that have shaped the American kitchen and kitchens worldwide. 13. GPS © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1960 Humans have been navigating the land and the sea for thousands of years, using more and more advanced methods to determine their position. In the 1960s, the DoD developed the original Global Positioning System (GPS). The idea was to use satellites to determine a user’s position on Earth by measuring his or her distance from three peripheral satellites in a process known as trilateration. The system would require 24 satellites. While the system became fully operational in March 1994, it captured the public’s interest long before then. President Ronald Reagan first ensured civil applications of GPS in 1983, after an incident where a Korean airliner that strayed off course and was shot down by the Soviet Union demonstrated the need for better navigational technology. The public received a comprehensive preview of the technology during the Gulf War, when soldiers used GPS to navigate across deserts and target enemies with an accuracy that was previously impossible. Today, GPS technology is used in consumer products such as cars and phones, as well as applications like earthquake research and geocaching. 14. Boeing 747 © Thinkstock> Date invented: 1968 Boeing is one of the world’s largest weapons manufacturers. Unlike many other defense contractors, the aerospace behemoth also has a major presence in non-military markets. The Boeing 747 commercial airliner is perhaps the company’s most iconic product. Like most commercial jets in use today, the 747's design is based on the Boeing 707, which can be traced to the Boeing 367-80. This model, nicknamed the Dash 80, was developed in secrecy by Boeing and unveiled in 1954. The plane was originally meant to test the long-range jet engine technology and was intended to be sold as a military tanker transport. That year, the U.S. Air Force ordered 29 of the jets, called KC-135. Today, versions of the 747 are used by most major commercial airliners as well as by the military, including a version used as Air Force One. 15. Google Street View © Wikimedia Commons> Date invented: 1978 The technological precursors of Google’s Street View can be traced back to 1978, when a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers mapped Aspen, Colorado with 16mm stop-frame cameras. The project, called the Aspen Movie Map, was funded by DARPA’s Cybernetics Technology Office. The military was interested in the mapping to improve training simulations. The researchers used cameras mounted on cars not unlike the vehicles Google uses to create Street View. Unlike most of the products on this list, the development of Google Street View is not directly a product of its precursor, Aspen Movie Map. Google asserts that Street View originated in a project at Stanford University. By now, much of the planet has been photographed and mapped. Not only the military uses Street View to simulate combat situations and for other applications, but the public as well. Today, people can experience the world without leaving their home. Detailed Findings and Methodology: The military contracted out or sold many of these inventions to private companies. One exception is the modern GPS network. It was developed in the 1970s by Department of Defense (DoD) researchers and was built over the following two decades. The technology, initially designed as a guidance and tracking system for fighter planes, boats, and missiles, is today used in many civilian applications from personal to commercial aircraft navigation systems. In other cases, the military became the primary consumer of a product shortly after it was invented by a private company. The government did not ask Boeing to develop the model 367-80 airplane, the prototype for the 747, but as soon as the plane demonstrated its utility the military purchased 29 of them. Similarly, the Jeep was designed by a company called American Bantam. The all-terrain scout vehicle was widely used by the military in World War II and eventually became very popular among ordinary consumers. Many of these products appealed to civilians for the same reasons they appealed to soldiers. American consumers value convenience, affordability, and ease of use -- qualities essential in a military setting. Instant coffee, for example, gained popularity during World War I, when it was likely the only option for soldiers living in trenches. Today, instant coffee is a popular choice for civilians who prefer its price and convenience over fresh coffee options. Further, there is often an aesthetic appeal to military products, and many were popularized by military use. The rugged soldier aesthetic of items such as aviator sunglasses and Jeeps were largely behind the success of these products. The commercial use of these products was often completely different from their intended military function. What eventually became feminine hygiene products under the Kotex brand was originally medical gauze developed for the military during World War I. Silly Putty was invented as a possible substitute for rubber. While it failed in this regard, it became a popular toy. Unlike years past, these days the flow of innovations is increasingly reversed -- from civilian to military application. The size of the consumer electronics market has far exceeded the military’s new technology budget, and the capacity for innovation in the private sector has likely surpassed the public sector. While the military dedicated $12.3 billion to research on new science and technology in 2016, the three largest corporate spenders -- Samsung, Intel, and Apple -- spent a combined $32.9 billion on consumer electronics R&D that year. As private companies outspend and out-innovate the federal government, products first marketed to Americans are continuously being repurposed for the military. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed products that were developed for military use either by the military or by contractors and became a popular civilian products. We also considered products that originated in the private sector but were popularized as a result of military use. We excluded products where the military or contractors only played a part in the development of the product, as was the case with the computer and the internet. The products are ordered by invention dates of their precursors. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

The government owns a 29.8 percent stake while Air France KLM has a 26.73 percent stake in the airline, which slumped into the red five years ago following a downturn in tourism after a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. The government has previously said it planned to convert its loans into equity but did not give an amount. The figure of $243 million was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal. Kenya Airways warned in a statement on Thursday there was a risk of "significant" dilution of existing shareholders as it offers new equity in the restructuring exercise. The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments. ALSO READ: State tightens grip on KQ with Sh24.5b debt conversion deal The restructuring is expected to reduce the airline's debt to about $1.2 billion from above $2 billion, the government said in its submission to parliament. Parliament's term ends next week ahead of an August election the deal will need to be approved quickly. The government is also seeking to guarantee $750 million worth of the company's current debt with international and local lenders as part of the restructuring. Some local creditors will convert some of their debt into equity too, a source at the airline said, without providing a figure of the amount. The restructuring is conditional on all creditors and shareholders agreeing to it, the government said in the document submitted to parliament. "There is a business case for a restructured Kenya Airways," the government said, citing a study by an unidentified third party contracted to look into the issue. Kenya has spent billions of shillings upgrading the country's main airports and views the airline as a strategic asset, supporting other industries such as tourism and encouraging investment from abroad.

The world's second largest planemaker after Boeing also forecast on Friday strong demand for repairs, training and upgrade work as the world's fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036. But in online presentations ahead of a media briefing it trimmed its rolling 20-year forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 percent a year, from 4.5 percent, as it took a more cautious view on mature markets such as North America. Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for single-aisle and wide-body twin-engined jets to 24,807 and 8,686 units respectively, but cut its forecast for very large planes like the A380, whose output has fallen due to weak demand. The total forecast for 34,899 passenger and freight aircraft was up from 33,070 aircraft predicted a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries was built into forecasts. Airbus programmes chief Didier Evrard listed several "challenges" for 2017 in the presentation, including raising total deliveries to more than 700 at the same time as introducing new variants. Chief Executive Tom Enders reaffirmed the same delivery target in separate comments to journalists. Airbus has given both formal and informal targets for 2017, with its finance director predicting "over 720 deliveries" alongside the group's first-quarter results.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Mattis arrives at Shangri-La summit By Gregory Hellman 06/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT With Zach Montellaro, Connor O’Brien and Jacqueline Klimas DRIVING THE DAY — MATTIS ARRIVES AT SHANGRI-LA, writes The Washington Post: “Defense Secretary Jim Mattis arrived in this Asian metropolis Friday, preparing to address nations in the region as they grapple with the growing threat of North Korea, Chinese militarization in the South China Sea and a rebellion in the Philippines that now includes links to the Islamic State. Story Continued Below “The trip, Mattis’s second to Asia since becoming defense secretary in January, will include a speech Saturday during the Shangri-La Dialogue, a defense summit, and smaller meetings with counterparts from Japan, South Korea and other nations. Mattis will emphasize how Washington is ‘broadening and deepening’ its relationships in the region, said David F. Helvey, a senior adviser on Asia issues who is traveling with Mattis. “The trip builds on months of Mattis reassuring allies while at the same time working for President Trump, whose nationalist agenda included withdrawing Thursday from the international Paris agreement stemming climate change. The Pentagon has long considered climate change a threat to national security, and Mattis testified in January during his confirmation process that it required a ‘broader, whole-of-government response.’” The full summit agenda is here. — FOREMOST, MATTIS IS EAGER TO BOOST U.S. ALLIES IN THE REGION, via Reuters: "At the Shangri-la Dialogue I will emphasize the United States stands with our Asia-Pacific allies and partners," Mattis told reporters on the way to the regional security forum. "The Department of Defense is focused on strengthening alliances, empowering countries to be able to sustain their own security, and strengthening U.S. military capabilities to deter war," Mattis said. NAVY WISHES UPON A STAR, reports our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: “The Navy’s greatest unmet requirement in fiscal 2018 is for 20 additional aircraft, according to the service’s unfunded priorities list, obtained by POLITICO. “They include 10 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets and six P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft, both made by Boeing, along with four more Lockheed Martin F-35C variants. “Combined, those three line items would cost a total of about $2.3 billion. “Notably absent from the unfunded priorities list is any significant investment in shipbuilding. The Navy last year released a fleet plan that called for 355 ships and expanding the fleet has been a stated priority of President Donald Trump.” The Army "wish list" is here, via our colleague Connor O'Brien. — AND THE COAST GUARD AIMS TO DELIVER ITS LIST BY THE END OF THE MONTH, Jacqueline adds: “The Coast Guard plans to deliver its unfunded priorities list to Congress by June 30, according to a spokesman for the commandant. “Earlier, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft told POLITICO he expects the ‘wish list’ to include investment in shore infrastructure to rebuild areas damaged by hurricanes. In all, he said the service needs about $1.6 billion for its shore infrastructure, including $60 million to rebuild from Hurricane Matthew in southern Georgia and northern Florida.” INDUSTRY INTEL — MORE SHIPS WOULD MEAN HELP WANTED, writes Stars and Stripes: “The Navy wants to hire about 2,000 new shipyard workers to help make more repairs to surface warships and keep them in service longer, said Vice Adm. Thomas Moore, the Navy’s top commander for ship maintenance. “Hiring more workers is a critical component in the Navy’s plan to increase the fleet to 350 ships, Moore said Thursday at a panel at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank.” TOP DOCS — CRS EYES NAVY OILERS, TACTICAL VEHICLES, via Connor: “The Congressional Research Service has issued updated reports on the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and the Navy's new fleet of oilers. “The JLTV report outlines the program history, acquisition process and potential issues for lawmakers to consider on the follow-on for the Humvee. The Trump administration's fiscal 2018 defense budget requested $1.1 billion to procure 2,777 JLTVs across the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force... “The oiler report, meanwhile outlines the program history and issues related to the new TAO-205 oiler fleet, which is named for Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.). The oilers transfer fuel and supplies to other Navy ships at sea." HAPPY FRIDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we're always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback. Email us at ghellman@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @greg_hellman, @morningdefense and @politicopro. MORNING D TRIVIA — This week’s question comes from last week’s winner, Christopher J. Le Mon: NATO's 28 members have more than 3.1 million military personnel, but which NATO ally lacks any armed forces? The first person to email the correct answer to Morning D (ghellman@politico.com) wins a mention in Monday’s edition. HAPPENING TODAY — TRUMP MEETS WITH GRAHAM: The president meets this afternoon with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the Oval Office. TRUMP ASKS THE SUPREME COURT TO REVIVE HIS TRAVEL BAN, reports POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “President Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to revive his controversial travel ban executive order, hoping that the justices will give the green light to a policy repeatedly blocked by lower courts. “In filings Thursday night, the Justice Department asked the high court to temporarily lift injunctions that bar officials from carrying out Trump’s directive to suspend visa issuance to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries and halt the flow of refugees to the U.S. from across the globe. “The Trump administration also asked the justices to add the legality of the travel ban to the high court’s docket so the case would be ready for argument this fall.” RUSSIA VOWS RESPONSE TO NATO BUILDUP, via The Associated Press: “Russia’s envoy to NATO warned Thursday that Moscow is concerned by the alliance’s military deployment in the Baltic States and Poland, and will respond to the buildup, as thousands of U.S. and European troops trained on land, sea and in the air in central and eastern Europe. “‘NATO is building a new military security situation that we cannot ignore, that we should address using our own military instruments,’ Ambassador Alexander Grushko said in Brussels. “He declined to spell out what kind of measures Russia might take, saying only that ‘NATO’s movements will not be left without a response in terms of military planning.’ “Twelve NATO countries are deploying a total of around 4,600 troops to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and the four battlegroups are due to be fully up and running within two weeks.” Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin says U.S. antimissile systems in Alaska and South Korea are directed at Russia and that his country will build up its own forces in response, adds Reuters. — ALREADY, IT’S ESCALATING ITS SPYGAMES, writes POLITICO’s Ali Watkins: “In the throes of the 2016 campaign, the FBI found itself with an escalating problem: Russian diplomats, whose travel was supposed to be tracked by the State Department, were going missing. “The diplomats, widely assumed to be intelligence operatives, would eventually turn up in odd places, often in middle-of-nowhere USA. One was found on a beach, nowhere near where he was supposed to be. In one particularly bizarre case, relayed by a U.S. intelligence official, another turned up wandering around in the middle of the desert. Interestingly, both seemed to be lingering where underground fiber-optic cables tend to run... “As the country — and Washington in particular — borders on near-obsession over whether affiliates of Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with the Kremlin to swing the 2016 presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials say Moscow’s espionage ground game is growing stronger and more brazen than ever.” — NATO ALLIES MULL A RESPONSE TO A CYBER ATTACK, reports Defense News: “NATO will not rule out invoking Article 5 of its charter should one or more member nations find themselves under a serious cyberattack that threatens critical military and civilian infrastructure. “NATO officials told delegates at the International Conference on Cyber Conflict, or CyCon, in Estonia that the Western alliance would deliver a robust response in the event of a serious and prolonged attack on a member state in cyberspace. Article 5 provides for a united response by NATO states should a member nation come under attack.” The consideration portends a “permanent war” in cyberspace because of increasingly destructive hacking attacks, the head of the French government’s cybersecurity agency warned in an interview with the AP. But according to Putin, the Russian government has never tried to hack the U.S. or Europe, though he didn’t rule out that some individual "patriotic" hackers might have, the AP adds. — AND LAWMAKERS FRET OVER A “HOLLOW” CYBER FORCE, via our colleague Martin Matishak: “Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees are worried that the Pentagon's push to quickly staff its cadre of elite cyber warriors may create a ‘hollow’ force, where all the slots are filled, but no one sticks around. “The military is trying to get its Cyber Mission Force — composed of 133 ‘cyber mission teams’ with 6,200 operators from across all the service branches — to full operational capability by the 2018 fiscal year, a daunting benchmark that U.S. Cyber Command says it is on pace to hit. “But national security-focused lawmakers are increasingly concerned about what comes next.” WAR REPORT — DoD BUDGET REQUEST BRACES FOR CHAOS DAY AFTER ISIS, reports Defense News: “The Pentagon is asking Congress for $1.8 billion to continue an Obama administration program to train and equip Iraqi and Syrian forces to fight against the Islamic State and resist a major commitment of U.S. ground troops. “The fiscal 2018 budget request released last week seeks roughly $1.3 billion to back Iraqi forces as the U.S. hopes to contain a post-Islamic State landscape of deadly ethnic and sectarian conflicts and keep “thousands” of ISIS loyalists from continuing to wage war. “While U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has not publicly announced the administration's strategy to defeat the Islamic State group, his 2018 budget request is remarkable in its detail. For example, it proposes a hefty, three-year U.S. commitment to build a far more effective force out of the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service, or CTS, that has already suffered 40 percent combat losses.” — U.S. BEEFS UP SYRIAN BASE, writes Stars and Stripes: “The United States has bolstered its firepower at a small training base in southern Syria in recent days as a group of Iran-supported militiamen backing the Syrian government are encamped nearby and refuse to move, a military spokesman for the anti-Islamic State coalition said Thursday. “Despite repeated warnings, the small group of fighters about 17 miles northwest of the Tanf base have not moved outside the established non-conflict zone, which extends about 35 miles around the outpost near the Jordanian border, said Army Col. Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the Operation Inherent Resolve coalition. The U.S.-led coalition trains Syrian rebels to fight ISIS at the base.” Meanwhile, the founder of the ISIS news agency is reported killed in an airstrike in eastern Syria, via the AP. FOR YOUR RADAR — COMEY TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE INTEL THURSDAY, via POLITICO’s Burgess Everett: “Former FBI Director James Comey will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, June 8, regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election, committee leaders announced on Thursday. “The hearing will be one of the most highly anticipated events on Capitol Hill in years, after President Donald Trump suddenly fired Comey in May and a flood of news reports followed suggesting that the president tried to get Comey to squash an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “After an open session in the morning, the committee will then be further briefed by Comey behind closed doors, said Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.).” — AMID THE RUSSIAN STORM, TRUMP SLAMS OBAMA ‘UNMASKING,’ reports our colleague Louis Nelson: “With a special counselor already at work investigating his campaign’s potential ties to Russia and the former head of the FBI set to testify before Congress on the issue in the coming days, President Donald Trump on Thursday insisted again that “the big story” remains the alleged ‘unmasking and surveillance’ conducted by the administration of former President Barack Obama. “Trump’s assertion, posted to Twitter, comes one day after the House Intelligence Committee issued seven subpoenas, four of which were related to Russian interference in last year’s election and the possibility of collusion between the Kremlin and individuals with ties to Trump. Three others were related to ‘unmasking,’ the process by which intelligence officials learn the names of Americans referenced in intelligence reports. New subpoenas show that, although House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), has stepped aside from his panel’s investigation, he’s still involved in a major way, write POLITICO’s Austin Wright and Madeline Conway. The embattled House investigation into Russia’s election meddling is once again beset by sniping and strategy disagreements, with Democrats now blocking key witness interviews, according to two sources familiar with the probe, report Austin, John Bresnahan and Kyle Cheney. Meanwhile, two influential Senate Democrats question whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions committed perjury when he testified during his confirmation hearing that he “did not have communications with the Russians,” adds POLITICO’s Seung Min Kim. MAKING MOVES — FORMER AIR FORCE SECRETARY JOINING TEXTRON BOARD, via Jacqueline: Former Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James is joining the board of Textron on July 1, the company announced Thursday. Prior to her tenure as secretary, James was a professional staff member for the House Armed Services Committee and assistant secretary of defense for Reserve affairs. Textron will be competing to build the Air Force’s proposed light attack aircraft and participating in a planned demonstration this summer.

The report shows the organization launched a new set of advisory services last year, revised and approved its principles and criteria, added several participating operators and members, and further developed the RSB standard. With the support of the Boeing Corporate Citizenship program and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Switzerland, the RSB also developed a program to support smallholders in several regions around the globe. The RSB is an independent organization that operates a global certification standard for sustainable biomasterials, biofuels and biomass. It’s monitoring and evaluations (M&E) system focuses on biomass supply chains. According to the RSB, results from the M&E system are used to continually improve the RSB standard, policies, guidance and tools associated with the certification system. The report recently released by the RSB evaluates these results and compares them to expected short-term, mid-term and long-term impacts it expects to drive through its actions. According to the report, the RSB standard was used to certify wheat starch, sugarcane, jatropha, used cooking oil, yellow grease, carinata, waste carbon dioxide gas, and camelina in 2014. In 2016, the certification expanded to also include glycerol, coconut, gliricidia, macaúba and solaris tobacco. Product types it addresses includes farnesene, food ingredients, epichlorohydrin, biokerosene, ethanol, vegetable oil and biodiesel. From October 2014 through December 2016, operators under the program grew from 17 to 20, with sites increasing from 23 to 49. The number of farms certified under the program increased from 166 to 472, spanning a total of 17 countries, up from 14. New countries represented in the RSB system include Tunisia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Over the period covered by the report, RSB-certified operators produced approximately 256,284.3 metric tons of biofuels. As of the end of 2016, RSB certification covered 56,785.14 hectares of land. In addition, 1,941 workers are now covered by RSB certification.

Sat 10 Jun 2017 | 6:20 GMT You are here: Home > Investing > Article Home News Investing Markets Metals & Mining Energy & Oil Agricultural Commodities Quotes Currencies Video AlertNet Humanitarian News About Thomson Reuters Kenya to convert $243 mln debt in Kenya Airways into equity Thu Jun 8, 2017 2:00pm GMT   Print | Single Page [-] Text [+] By Duncan Miriri NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya will convert its $243 million in loans to Kenya Airways into equity, the government has said, as part of a broader restructuring to nurse the ailing airline back to financial health. The government owns a 29.8 percent stake while Air France KLM has a 26.73 percent stake in the airline, which slumped into the red five years ago following a downturn in tourism after a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. The government has previously said it planned to convert its loans into equity but did not give an amount. The figure of $243 million was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal. Kenya Airways warned in a statement on Thursday there was a risk of "significant" dilution of existing shareholders as it offers new equity in the restructuring exercise. The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments.

(KABC) -- There's been a strange sighting off the Palos Verdes coast. It looks a little like a futuristic version of the Loch Ness monster. But upon closer examination, it turns out to be a 50-ton, 51-foot-long monstrous underwater robot. It's the Boeing "Echo Voyager." The unmanned undersea vehicle is now going through several months of trials at sea before setting off on its own with no crew and no tether to a support ship. Powered by a hybrid electric battery system, it periodically surfaces to snorkel depth to recharge its batteries by raising a mast. The Echo Voyager can reach an impressive depth of 11,000 feet. It will be used for months-long surveillance and reconnaissance missions for defense, commercial and scientific customers.

Dr Juliet Dinkha, Chair of ABCK, welcomed the guests to the Election Night and recapped for the guests how busy and active the ABCK has been the past year and the drive to further grow ABCK in the community.  Dr. Dinkha introduced Oswaldo Rueda, Nominating Chair and Vice Chair of ABCK, who introduced the candidates. Each candidate had 3 minutes to tell the members about what they would bring to the board of ABCK. All of the candidates gave very fervent speeches and it made the choice for the members very tough. It was a very close election and the final selections for the board of directors are: Hasan AlMatrouk of Jadeite Group, Jared Willis of Berkeley Research Group, Najmah Brown of Al-Adwani Law Firm and Pete Swift of KGL. Then the current board of directors voted on the corporate members of the board of directors and selected AIG, Boeing, Fluor, Honeywell, and Raytheon for the board for 2017-2019. The Officers of the Board of Directors for 2017 – 2018 were selected by the new board and they are: Dr Juliet Dinkha, Chair; Oswaldo Rueda, Vice Chair; Alok Chugh, Treasurer; Hasan AlMatrouk, Secretary. Dr Dinkha thanked the board of 2016-2017 for all of their work and commitment in achieving the goals of the ABCK. It was also a very special night because ABCK said good-bye to Joey Hood, Charge d’Affaires at the US. Embassy in Kuwait. Joey has been a very strong supporter of ABCK during his three years in Kuwait. Joey thanked ABCK for their role that they play in the community to help grow American businesses in Kuwait and the many events and activities that they do to support the business community. Dr Dinkha stated that the event would not have been possible without the support of ABCK’s sponsors: Boeing as Platinum Sponsor, KGL as Silver Sponsor and Marafie Kuwait as Bronze Sponsor.

Purporting to reveal "hundreds of documents from an anonymous source within the White House," the Pentagon-Papers-like fake trove covers over 20 categories of files in boisterous, excruciating detail, incorporating executive orders, secret recordings, classified briefings, CIA reports, communications between staff and family, children's letters to the president, and musings on knotty security issues, like where did all these lighthouses come from anyway? They range from Trump's secret demands to Boeing for the design of Air Force One - marble everywhere - and Pence's daily schedule - brisk jog through Stations of the Cross, look out the window for the Rapture - to Ivanka's instructions for putting little Donny to bed, Applebee's color-by-number kids' placemats to help him find North Korea, and the executive order allowing Bannon to execute him when none of us can take it any longer.

CHAMPAIGN — The Champaign Public Library is taking its "The Sky's the Limit" summer-reading program to extremes with a new exhibition opening this weekend. "The NASA Space Exhibit," to be unveiled Sunday, will feature 18 objects from NASA displayed at nine stations throughout the library, rather than gathered in one spot. "We want people to be able to move through the library and explore it, and it's an excellent way to do that," said events intern Emily Hoch. The highlight among the NASA objects most certainly will be a fist-sized "moon rock" from the 12-pounder collected by astronauts on the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. "People's eyes light up when they hear about the moon rock," said Evelyn Shapiro, promotions manager for the library. The moon rock is being kept secure in a locked safe at the library until it is put on display near the children's services desk on the first floor. The NASA objects on view through Aug. 11 are not part of a traveling NASA exhibit. "We're borrowing a set of objects that were available this summer that fit with our theme," Shapiro said. "They were not sent to us as a complete exhibit. It's not an off-the-shelf NASA exhibit." Upon entering the library, visitors will be able to pick up a self-guided tour of the NASA objects — most will be under clear plastic cases. Among them: — A spacesuit, which will be uncovered. — The Solar System Scale. People may weigh themselves on the scale to see how much they would weigh on the moon and the planets. (Pluto remains listed among them.) "Already, it's my favorite object in the show," Shapiro said. "It just gets your imagination going." "It's a fun, interactive experience, and it contextualizes how things are different in space," Hoch said. — Another interactive piece: a life-size cardboard depiction of an astronaut in a spacesuit, with the face empty so people may pose behind it for photographs. — To-scale models of space vehicles such as the Mercury-Atlas, Gemini-Titan II, space shuttle, a Boeing V-22 Osprey and Mars Exploration Rover. — A real (Michelin) space shuttle tire. It's huge. "They can use them only once because of the weight and the speed that the shuttle comes in on to land," Hoch said. — NASA posters. Because they are text-heavy, they will be on display in the adult section on the second floor of the library. The solar eclipse coming up Aug. 21 helped inspire this summer's theme. The library will have eclipse-related programs through the summer, including on Aug. 21. The library will open its "NASA Space Exhibit" with a "launch party" at 3 p.m. Sunday, following a 2 p.m. concert by Amasong, Champaign-Urbana's Premier Lesbian/Feminist Chorus. The library commissioned musician David Howie to write a children's song for the party. He will perform "Moon Rock," plus other moon-related songs, from 3 to 3:30 p.m. on the front porch of the library. As part of its summer reading program, the library also has space-related books on display and will give away space-related prizes to children and adults, among them a telescope valued at $400. "We're having fun with this," Shapiro said. "We're going to satisfy people's curiosity."

NASA Picks a Dozen Astronauts From a Pool of 3 Million Kyle Stock Bloomberg June 8, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share It’s not too late to be an astronaut. NASA doesn’t have an age limit for this gig, and the basic requirements aren’t as onerous as you might think. The odds of scoring one of those coveted seats to the stars, however, are getting long. The U.S. space agency named 12 new astronauts Wednesday—a hyper-elite squad winnowed from 18,300 applicants. That’s right, in every 100 CVs, Uncle Sam finds .07 astronauts. There have been about 350 professional star voyagers in the nation’s history. Some 56 of them are active or in training and 22 are “management astronauts” no longer eligible for a space flight. About 60 are deceased. Given the numbers, a more realistic career goal might be playing quarterback in the NFL or running a Fortune 500 company. The pay for both of those paths would be far better, to boot. That said, the requirements for your latest job were likely tougher than NASA’s most recent “astronaut” classified listing. One no longer has to be a test pilot or a rocket scientist. Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg probably wouldn’t make the cut (not enough schooling), but virtually every high school science and math teacher does, as well as physicians and professional pilots. More from Bloomberg.com: Comey Recounts Uneasy Meetings With Trump, Demands for Loyalty “Some people would be surprised to learn they might have what it takes,” NASA Flight Director Brian Kelly said in soliciting the current crop of candidates. “We want and need a diverse mix of individuals to ensure we have the best astronaut corps possible.” Getting in the door requires four things: U.S. citizenship. A Bachelor’s degree in engineering, science or math. The ability to pass a NASA physical (20/20 vision is a must but glasses and corrective surgery are accepted). 1,000 hours flying a jet or three years of “related, progressively responsible, professional experience” (graduate school and teaching both qualify). After NASA tosses the applicants who don’t meet those criteria, a panel of 50 people—mostly active astronauts—narrow the list to a few hundred top prospects. These are the folks who have their references called. More from Bloomberg.com: Sessions Has Suggested Resigning as Tensions Grow With Trump The field is then shrunk to 120 candidates. They are brought in for more medical screening and “intense interviews.” Finally, 50 of them are called back for a week of more of interviews and medical screening. (It helps to know how to swim and speak Russian.) For the recent search, NASA estimated at least 3 million U.S. residents would have met the basic requirements. Not all of them applied, but Americans do seem particularly keen on the space race these days. Applications almost tripled from the past hiring round as NASA played up the likelihood of a busier flight schedule. In calling for candidates, the agency noted incoming crews will soon be able to fly to space from Florida—rather than rural Russia since the Space Shuttles were mothballed—as it brings online new crew capsules from both Boeing Co. and SpaceX. Meanwhile, the agency is prepping its new Orion craft for deep-space missions, pushing to launch astronauts on the pod by 2023. More from Bloomberg.com: Bill Gross Says Market Risk Is Highest Since Pre-2008 Crisis “You may be the first to travel to Mars,” Vice President Mike Pence told the rookies at Wednesday’s announcement. Historically, most astronauts eventually get to ride on a rocket. Leaving aside the 2013 class, which only recently completed preliminary training, only about 6 percent of astronauts have failed to fly on a mission, according to NASA data. Not surprisingly, there are no slouches in the new class. All of the new astronauts have at least one graduate degree and four of the 12 are trained test pilots, much like the original Mercury astronauts back in the days of The Right Stuff. Then there’s Jonny Kim, a decorated Navy SEAL who finished 100 combat missions and went on to Harvard Medical School. “It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read about what these folks have done,” NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said.  With a starting salary of $66,026, the pay isn’t all that great for this diligent dozen—but the travel benefits are next level.

Vice Admiral Paul Grosklags explained to the House Armed Services Committee that two tactics had been deployed to deal with the jets’ problem of oxygen shortages mid-flight. The Marines’ and Navy’s short-term plan is to equip T-45 Goshawks with “alerting and protective measures” to ensure pilots can continue their training programs on schedule, the commander said. Secondly, they will try to pin down the exact issue with the On-Board Oxygen Generation Systems (OBOGS). © Photo: Public Domain US Navy Sends Jets Back Into the Air After Breathless Pilots Refuse to Fly In March, pilot instructors in the service said the planes weren’t suitable for flying because of the problems with the OBOGS. Suddenly losing oxygen is, after all, less than optimal for an inexperienced airman learning how to fly at multiple Gs. Nevertheless, the US Navy chose to put the jets back in the air in April after applying some quick fixes, Sputnik reported. Finding and addressing the root of the problem has proven difficult, however. Insufficient oxygen supply aboard the planes “has plagued the service’s fleet of T-45s for years now,” Sputnik reported. A top Navy official said the service had taken an “unconstrained resources” approach to fixing the jets, but even that hasn’t worked. Mechanics from Boeing and the OBOGS manufacturer have been hard at work on fixing the issue. They’ve also had the full power and expertise of NASA engineers and scientists to contribute to their efforts. To date, the armed forces don’t have anything to show for it. What mystifies military personnel is that OBOGS has been used on their Harrier jets without issue. Lt. Gen. Jon Davis remarked in wonder, "It’s the same box in the Harrier. It’s the same OBOGS box and we don’t have a problem in Harriers. So what’s different? What is different in the T-45s?" © Flickr/ DVIDSHUB F-35's Neck-Snapping Ejector Seat: Fighter's Manufacturer 'Has Not Been Approached' About Problem Even more confusing for military leaders is that negative physiological responses are on the rise in the Navy’s fleet of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, as well as in their EA-18 Growlers, too.  “The system has worked for 20-plus years,” Davis noted. “Something happened.” Meanwhile, on Friday, a 55-plane strong fleet of fifth-generation F-35 combat aircraft was grounded after five pilots endured oxygen deprivation incidents. ...

 US sends all 3 nuclear-capable bombers to Europe for the first time Oriana Pawlyk, Military.com Jun. 9, 2017, 5:21 PM 7,559 facebook linkedin twitter email print The B-52, the B-1, and the B-2 (right to left) on runways at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. US Air Force The U.S. Air Force has sent B-2 Spirit bombers to England for drills with NATO and partner allies furthering the military's continuance to deploy aircraft despite a period of bizarre political relations with Russia. The move means the service now has its full complement of bombers in Europe -- the B-2 joins three B-52 Stratofortresses from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and three B-1B Lancers from Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota -- and marks the first time all three aircraft have been in the theater at the same time, European Command officials said in a release. The Air Force said two B-2 nuclear-capable bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, arrived at Royal Air Force Fairford, U.K., on Friday, but said the bombers "are briefly joining the other Air Force Global Strike Command assets in support of recurring bomber assurance and deterrence operations," the release said. "These B-2 Spirits will not support Exercises BALTOPS or Saber Strike and will only remain in theater a short time," it said. Wikipedia Commons The B-1Bs and B-52s, however, are supporting those exercises. While the annual exercises have taken place for years, bomber deployments to Europe have been given more scrutiny since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The Pentagon sent two B-2s and three B-52s to Europe for similar training events in June 2014 days after then-President Obama announced he would increase the U.S. military presence in the region following the annexation, and Russia's continued aggression in Eastern Ukraine. Boeing This is the fourth year B-52s have been invited for exercises, of which the bombers practice dummy bomb drops. Last year, airmen practiced dropping "500-pound dummy mines, set up like a real mine, with a tail kit, and employment characteristics but it's just concrete," said Lt Col. Michael Maginness, 23rd Expeditionary Bomb Squadron commander. The goal is to hit "splash points," evaluated by the U.S. Navy, and track how well the bomber can hit up a mine field if it were laden with explosives, Maginness told Air Force Times at the time. Four B-1B Lancers assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, deployed from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, arrive Feb. 6, 2017, at Andersen AFB, Guam. US Air Force BALTOPs, which began in 1972, is a maritime-focused exercise taking place in the Baltic Sea in which several NATO allies and partner nations conduct live training events. This year, many of the drills will take place from Szczecin, Poland and finish in Kiel, Germany. Saber Strike, led by the U.S. Army in Europe and in its seventh year, is meant to improve communication skills during land exercises which span Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, such as working with joint terminal attack controllers on the ground.

Making staff cry? Why airline passengers have lost the plot By Quentin Fottrell Published: June 9, 2017 11:00 p.m. ET Share Two recent incidents on Ryanair reveal the worsening problems of traveling by air Getty Images Most travelers begin their journey with good intentions. After long security lines, delayed flights and large crowds, some passengers act out. By QuentinFottrell Personal Finance Editor One couple joined the “mile-high club” without using the restroom. Another customer berated a Ryanair employee at Brussels Airport. On a Ryanair RYAAY, -2.43%  flight from Manchester to Ibiza this week, one couple decided to have sex in their seat. It was filmed by another passenger who appeared to think it was funny, while another female passenger reportedly asked to change seats. The crew did not reprimand the couple, according to reports. Ibiza is a well-known “party island.” A Ryanair spokesman told the Daily Mail that the company does not tolerate “unruly, disruptive or inappropriate behavior.” (A company spokesman did not respond to MarketWatch for a request for comment.) If that wasn’t bad enough, another Ryanair passenger at Brussels Airport spent seven minutes videoing an employee because she told him that he would have to pay $50 to board the plane (as he had not printed out his boarding card). “Call security, I’m a customer, lady,” he says on the video, which was picked up by the New York Post. “I’m asking your supervisor’s name so I can speak with your supervisor because I’m unhappy with the way you’re performing your job.” The employee was reduced to tears and the passenger added, “Oh, are you having an emotional breakdown?” Airline travel experts find the latest incidents shocking, and there have been many lurid tales of passengers behaving badly in recent years. “Unbelievable,” says Christopher Elliott, author of “Scammed,” a book about how to avoid shady deals. “Definitely a new low.” George Hobica, founder of low-airfare alert site Airfarewatchdog, added, “Maybe airlines need to have passengers acknowledge a code of conduct when they buy and when they check in for flights. Starting with ‘do not harass our team members and keep it in your pants.’” What’s going on? No-frills airlines do lend themselves to more weekend travel and bachelor and bachelorette parties and, of course, some people like to start their vacations early. And with recent high-profile incidents where one passenger was dragged off a United Airlines UAL, -2.10%   plane by security for not voluntarily giving up his seat, animals dying on flights and, in at least one case, a dog spending 33 hours in cargo due to a snafu over paperwork, some passengers appear to have lost respect for airlines. Even Nobel Prize-winning economists aren’t safe. Don’t miss: How to fly first class for free (or on the cheap) Gone are the days when people sip a martini and make polite conversation about the weather and people’s health, and dress to the nines when they’re flying commercial, and these recent incidents in the U.S. and U.K. this spring don’t bode well for what passengers can expect this summer when more travelers take to the sky. In 2016, airlines ranked seventh-to-last out of 43 industries in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. More than one-quarter of people (27%) described air travel as “awful” according to a January CNBC survey. Airline passengers are grouchy. Seats on some American Airlines AAL, -2.26%  forthcoming Boeing BA, +0.05%  737 Max jetliners will now come with two inches less legroom in coach. The “pitch” or distance between seats was previously 31 inches and will now shrink to 29 inches. There has been a glut of arguments involving seat reclining. In one such incident, a male passenger reportedly had a “Knee Defender,” a $22 device that prevents the person in front of you from reclining their seat to take 40 winks. In retaliation, a woman threw a glass of water on him. All niceties are forgotten at 40,000 feet. People sometimes squeeze more onto planes in an effort to avoid baggage fees, which can go as high as $225 or more for a third bag on Air Canada flights from the U.S. to Mexico, according to that airline’s policies listed online. Add to that the long lines long lines in airports to go through security during peak summer travel times and reports of a possible ban on electronic devices on international flights by the Trump administration. Improving the experience starts with the person holding your ticket, according to Jacqueline Whitmore, founder of the Protocol School of Palm Beach, Florida, who is also a former flight attendant. “Always alert the flight attendant to problems,” she says. She learned this the hard way after asking a mother, “Will you please control your children?” Her mother’s response was too colorful to be repeated here. Other tips: don’t try to fit the kitchen sink into the overhead compartment, go easy on the cologne (and garlic and onion), carry deodorant and breath mints.

Making staff cry? Why airline passengers have lost the plot By Quentin Fottrell Published: June 9, 2017 11:00 p.m. ET Share Two recent incidents on Ryanair reveal the worsening problems of traveling by air Getty Images Most travelers begin their journey with good intentions. After long security lines, delayed flights and large crowds, some passengers act out. By QuentinFottrell Personal Finance Editor One couple joined the “mile-high club” without using the restroom. Another customer berated a Ryanair employee at Brussels Airport. On a Ryanair RYAAY, -2.43%  flight from Manchester to Ibiza this week, one couple decided to have sex in their seat. It was filmed by another passenger who appeared to think it was funny, while another female passenger reportedly asked to change seats. The crew did not reprimand the couple, according to reports. Ibiza is a well-known “party island.” A Ryanair spokesman told the Daily Mail that the company does not tolerate “unruly, disruptive or inappropriate behavior.” (A company spokesman did not respond to MarketWatch for a request for comment.) If that wasn’t bad enough, another Ryanair passenger at Brussels Airport spent seven minutes videoing an employee because she told him that he would have to pay $50 to board the plane (as he had not printed out his boarding card). “Call security, I’m a customer, lady,” he says on the video, which was picked up by the New York Post. “I’m asking your supervisor’s name so I can speak with your supervisor because I’m unhappy with the way you’re performing your job.” The employee was reduced to tears and the passenger added, “Oh, are you having an emotional breakdown?” Airline travel experts find the latest incidents shocking, and there have been many lurid tales of passengers behaving badly in recent years. “Unbelievable,” says Christopher Elliott, author of “Scammed,” a book about how to avoid shady deals. “Definitely a new low.” George Hobica, founder of low-airfare alert site Airfarewatchdog, added, “Maybe airlines need to have passengers acknowledge a code of conduct when they buy and when they check in for flights. Starting with ‘do not harass our team members and keep it in your pants.’” What’s going on? No-frills airlines do lend themselves to more weekend travel and bachelor and bachelorette parties and, of course, some people like to start their vacations early. And with recent high-profile incidents where one passenger was dragged off a United Airlines UAL, -2.10%   plane by security for not voluntarily giving up his seat, animals dying on flights and, in at least one case, a dog spending 33 hours in cargo due to a snafu over paperwork, some passengers appear to have lost respect for airlines. Even Nobel Prize-winning economists aren’t safe. Don’t miss: How to fly first class for free (or on the cheap) Gone are the days when people sip a martini and make polite conversation about the weather and people’s health, and dress to the nines when they’re flying commercial, and these recent incidents in the U.S. and U.K. this spring don’t bode well for what passengers can expect this summer when more travelers take to the sky. In 2016, airlines ranked seventh-to-last out of 43 industries in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. More than one-quarter of people (27%) described air travel as “awful” according to a January CNBC survey. Airline passengers are grouchy. Seats on some American Airlines AAL, -2.26%  forthcoming Boeing BA, +0.05%  737 Max jetliners will now come with two inches less legroom in coach. The “pitch” or distance between seats was previously 31 inches and will now shrink to 29 inches. There has been a glut of arguments involving seat reclining. In one such incident, a male passenger reportedly had a “Knee Defender,” a $22 device that prevents the person in front of you from reclining their seat to take 40 winks. In retaliation, a woman threw a glass of water on him. All niceties are forgotten at 40,000 feet. People sometimes squeeze more onto planes in an effort to avoid baggage fees, which can go as high as $225 or more for a third bag on Air Canada flights from the U.S. to Mexico, according to that airline’s policies listed online. Add to that the long lines long lines in airports to go through security during peak summer travel times and reports of a possible ban on electronic devices on international flights by the Trump administration. Improving the experience starts with the person holding your ticket, according to Jacqueline Whitmore, founder of the Protocol School of Palm Beach, Florida, who is also a former flight attendant. “Always alert the flight attendant to problems,” she says. She learned this the hard way after asking a mother, “Will you please control your children?” Her mother’s response was too colorful to be repeated here. Other tips: don’t try to fit the kitchen sink into the overhead compartment, go easy on the cologne (and garlic and onion), carry deodorant and breath mints.

Quoting the observations made by the inspection team, Mr. Sinha said that the existing runway length of 2,850 metres at the Calicut airport was inadequate for most of the Code E aircraft operations. The existing runway end safety area (RESA) available on both ends of the runway was of 90x90 m, against the civil aviation requirements (CAR) recommendation of DGCA of 240x90 meters RESA, he said. He added that the runway strip width was 75 m on either side or runway centreline against the required runway strip of 150 m as per CAR recommendation of DGCA. Besides, the required separation between the apron taxi lane and runway centreline was not available for Code E aircraft, the Minister said. The Airports Authority of India had suspended operations of Boeing B-747 and B-777, Airbus A-330, and other wide-bodied aircraft including Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) and Emirates at the airport since May 1, 2015. He said the Haj committee of India had decided to maintain status quo in respect of the number of embarkation points for Haj 2017. The decision was in view of the fact that the Calicut airport was not suitable to operate wide-bodied aircraft, the Minister said.

Kayla Barron, Bob Hines, U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Raja Chari, Loral O’Hara and Jessica Watkins. (NASA via Bloomberg/File) It’s not too late to be an astronaut. NASA doesn’t have an age limit for this gig, and the basic requirements aren’t as onerous as you might think. The odds of scoring one of those coveted seats to the stars, however, are getting long. The U.S. space agency named 12 new astronauts Wednesday—a hyper-elite squad winnowed from 18,300 applicants. That’s right, in every 100 CVs, Uncle Sam finds .07 astronauts. There have been about 350 professional star voyagers in the nation’s history. Some 56 of them are active or in training and 22 are “management astronauts” no longer eligible for a space flight. About 60 are deceased. Given the numbers, a more realistic career goal might be playing quarterback in the NFL or running a Fortune 500 company. The pay for both of those paths would be far better, to boot. That said, the requirements for your latest job were likely tougher than NASA’s most recent “astronaut” classified listing. One no longer has to be a test pilot or a rocket scientist. Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg probably wouldn’t make the cut (not enough schooling), but virtually every high school science and math teacher does, as well as physicians and professional pilots. “Some people would be surprised to learn they might have what it takes,” NASA Flight Director Brian Kelly said in soliciting the current crop of candidates. “We want and need a diverse mix of individuals to ensure we have the best astronaut corps possible.” Read also: What do astronauts eat in space? Getting in the door requires four things: U.S. citizenship. A Bachelor’s degree in engineering, science or math. The ability to pass a NASA physical (20/20 vision is a must but glasses and corrective surgery are accepted). 1,000 hours flying a jet or three years of “related, progressively responsible, professional experience” (graduate school and teaching both qualify). After NASA tosses the applicants who don’t meet those criteria, a panel of 50 people—mostly active astronauts—narrow the list to a few hundred top prospects. These are the folks who have their references called. The field is then shrunk to 120 candidates. They are brought in for more medical screening and “intense interviews.” Finally, 50 of them are called back for a week of more of interviews and medical screening. (It helps to know how to swim and speak Russian.) For the recent search, NASA estimated at least 3 million U.S. residents would have met the basic requirements. Not all of them applied, but Americans do seem particularly keen on the space race these days. Applications almost tripled from the past hiring round as NASA played up the likelihood of a busier flight schedule. In calling for candidates, the agency noted incoming crews will soon be able to fly to space from Florida—rather than rural Russia since the Space Shuttles were mothballed—as it brings online new crew capsules from both Boeing Co. and SpaceX. Meanwhile, the agency is prepping its new Orion craft for deep-space missions, pushing to launch astronauts on the pod by 2023.

Historically, most astronauts eventually get to ride on a rocket. Leaving aside the 2013 class, which only recently completed preliminary training, only about 6 percent of astronauts have failed to fly on a mission, according to NASA data. Not surprisingly, there are no slouches in the new class. All of the new astronauts have at least one graduate degree and four of the 12 are trained test pilots, much like the original Mercury astronauts back in the days of The Right Stuff. Then there’s Jonny Kim, a decorated Navy SEAL who finished 100 combat missions and went on to Harvard Medical School. “It makes me personally feel very inadequate when you read about what these folks have done,” NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said.  With a starting salary of $66,026, the pay isn’t all that great for this diligent dozen—but the travel benefits are next level.

SpaceX reader comments 106 Share this story SpaceX had difficult years in 2015 and 2016, as two accidents with its Falcon 9 rocket hit the company's bottom line and raised some concerns about its reliability in the global launch market. But now the company seems to have bounced back nicely, and after a little more than five months the company is on pace to have an absolutely stellar 2017. Further ReadingSunday’s launch could be the start of an annus mirabilis for SpaceX At the outset of this year, Ars Technica highlighted four achievements that could make 2017 an "annus mirabilis" for SpaceX. Our updated scorecard, shown below, demonstrates that SpaceX has made some impressive progress toward accomplishing these goals—and more—during what is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the company. 1. Fly a used booster (done) SpaceX achieved its first goal in late March with the launch of the SES-10 communications satellite to geostationary transfer orbit. The 10-story-tall first stage launched for the second time in its existence. After sending the 5-ton payload on its way to 36,000km above the Earth, it returned safely to the planet. For the company and the broader industry, it felt like a significant moment. Founder Elon Musk clearly felt he had finally pushed spaceflight across the rubicon of reusable rocketry, permanently changing the aerospace industry. "So it has been 15 years to get to this point, it took us a long time," he said at the time. "A lot of difficult steps along the way. This is going to be ultimately a huge revolution in spaceflight." Further ReadingWe may have just witnessed the dawn of truly commercial spaceflight This wasn't a fluke. As early as next weekend, provided the tempestuous summertime Florida weather cooperates, SpaceX will attempt to launch the BulgariaSat 1 communications satellite on a previously flown booster. By the end of this year, as many as six Falcon 9 first stages could have made second flights into space. 2. Fly a used spacecraft (done) Ultimately, SpaceX intends that its Dragon spacecraft—both the cargo one now carrying supplies to the International Space Station and a new, Dragon 2 crew variant—will be able to fly multiple times to lower overall costs. The first step toward that was flying a used Dragon into space, which the company achieved in early June. The re-flown Dragon first launched to the International Space Station in September 2014 during SpaceX's fourth supply mission to the orbiting laboratory. The June 3 mission was the company's 11th overall supply mission, and the used Dragon had undergone significant refurbishment along with receiving a new heat shield. During the post-flight news conference, NASA's program manager for the space station, Kirk Shireman, said the agency would consider flying future supply missions on used boosters. This raises the prospect of an entirely reusable launch and spacecraft system for delivering supplies to the laboratory—perhaps something to look for in 2018. 3. Fly the Falcon Heavy (in progress) Spaceflight enthusiasts have been waiting for the Falcon Heavy for a long, long time, but now that the hardware is undergoing testing the rocket seems to be close to the launch pad. On Thursday, Musk tweeted that "All Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape [Canaveral, in Florida] in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that." This would put the heavy launch in the September-October time frame from Florida. Further ReadingSpaceX to launch “silliest thing we can imagine” on debut Falcon Heavy This rocket would immediately become the most powerful operational booster on the planet, doubling the capacity of the Delta IV Heavy, manufactured by United Launch Alliance. The new rocket has a first stage composed of three Falcon 9 cores, which have a combined 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff from 27 Merlin engines. For the inaugural launch, the central booster will be new, but the two side boosters will be "flight proven" Falcon 9 first stages. Musk has explained the delays in Falcon Heavy development by saying the rocket had proven more difficult than anticipated. "At first it sounded easy, but actually, no, this is crazy hard," Musk said. The company has had to redesign the center core and additional hardware for the upcoming flight. Because the mission is risky, it will not carry a paying customer into space. Instead, Musk said, the rocket will launch "the silliest thing we can imagine." 4. Fly a Dragon 2 (perhaps not) So SpaceX has completed two of the four objectives for 2017 already, and it seems to be on a good pace for the third one, a Falcon Heavy launch. Less certain, however, is its progress toward launching a version 2.0 of its Dragon spacecraft later this year. Officially, the company is still targeting November 2017 for this uncrewed "demonstration" flight of a spacecraft that will eventually carry astronauts to the space station. Further ReadingTechnical troubles likely to delay commercial crew flights until 2019 Largely behind the scenes, as part of NASA's commercial crew program, both SpaceX and Boeing are working to bring their astronaut-carrying capsules to the launch pad. During an interview with Ars this week, NASA's manager of the commercial crew program, Kathy Lueders, said both companies were continuing to make progress but that both had a lot of work and testing yet to do to meet their milestones. That seems like code for: Don't trust either company's timeline. One key factor to watch for is SpaceX's development of the final version of its Falcon 9 booster, dubbed the "Block V." This rocket will incorporate additional changes to increase reliability and reusability, which could allow the company to eventually refly a booster within 24 hours. All Dragon crew missions will fly on the Block V booster and so, too, will the demonstration mission. So once Block V begins flying, the company will probably be close to flying the Dragon 2. But it is not at all clear this will happen before the end of 2017. 5. A bonus achievement: High flight rates SpaceX launched its first rocket in 2017 on January 14. Since then it has made six subsequent flights, or one about every three weeks. This is a pretty remarkable cadence for any government launch agency, let alone a private company flying a large, orbital class rocket. It would allow SpaceX to fly a record 17 missions this year, more than doubling the company's total for any previous year. However, the company may soon kick the launch cadence up yet another notch. On the manifest it has the BulgariaSat 1 mission for June 17 from Kennedy Space Center, followed by an Iridium communications satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on June 25 and an Intelsat launch from Florida on July 1. If you're keeping track at home, that's potentially three launches in two weeks. A total of 20 launches this year is no longer out of the question. That's a lot.

Raising its previous forecasts for the next two decades, the European aircraft maker also said a slowdown in orders over the past several months did not signal a drop in the market. "The trend is positive," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. Airbus last week had warned it expects slow orders this year and perhaps next year, too, but said it was a normal part of the business cycle. The planemaker predicts the need for 35,000 new planes worth USD 5.3 trillion over the next two decades, an increase from last year's estimates. "Air travel is remarkably resilient to external shocks and doubles every 15 years," said its chief operating officer for customer relations, John Leahy. "Asia Pacific continues to be an engine for growth, with domestic China to become the world's largest market." The numbers released today, as the industry gears up for the Paris Air Show later this month, show a six percent increase from last year's forecasts in terms of numbers of aircraft and a two percent increase in value. Airbus last year already raised its 20 year forecasts, which it publishes each year, as does its US rival Boeing. The number of aircraft worldwide that count over 100 seats should reach more than 40,000 while airline traffic will increase by 4.4 per cent per year over the time period, according to the Airbus estimates released today. This means hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the planemaker said, estimating the need for 530,000 more pilots and 550,000 new maintenance engineers. The planemaker today cited more first time flyers and rising disposable income for air travel as other reasons for its forecast. Emerging markets in China and India as well as other parts of Asia and Latin America are growing nearly twice as fast as North America and Western Europe.

Photographer: Michael Nagle President Donald Trump announced last week that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, saying that America bears too much of the burden and that he will seek better terms.  It would be myopic to assume, however, that all U.S. energy companies backed Trump’s decision. In fact, Exxon Mobil, Conoco Phillips and Occidental Petroleum, among others, wanted the U.S. to remain in the Paris agreement. The backlash by the energy industry and the business community against Trump’s decision is actually good for their stock prices. The reason for heeding to climate change is clear, as it’s less about a sense of moral responsibility than it is about the price of doing business globally. Also, allocating more assets to renewable energies, a potential $6 trillion market and one of the highest growth sectors in the nation, can help both their bottom line and reputation.  Maybe it's a case of sell on the rumor and buy on the news, but the U.S. dominated Bloomberg Americas Energy Index of stocks of companies in North, South and Central America is little changed from May 31, the day before Trump announced his decision. It’s not that the big exploration and production companies have awakened to the reality that climate change is a material concern. Rather, they acknowledge the need to be players on the international energy negotiation field and to be in the room making deals when decisions are made. The industry has become more global, and participants must play by rules increasingly being set from China to Africa. They will run their businesses as if the U.S. is still in the accord because ultimately they don’t want to see a reordering of the world’s power structure where others become more influential in international trade and the financing of infrastructure projects. The energy industry has faced a massive stock dis-investment by exclusionary, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible funds ranging from indices, ETFs, mutual and hedge funds. Portfolio managers and analysts perform negative screenings to meet the demands of endowments, foundations, universities, individual investors and others that don’t want the "bad boys" in their portfolios. Shareholders are demanding more prudent financial and environmental stewardship from all industries, particularly energy. Exxon Mobil shareholders suggest they were misled because the company didn’t price gas emissions into its financials, thus presenting a rosier outlook than reflected in internal estimates. Shareholders protested, urging the company to publish a detailed analysis and "stress test" to measure how carbon curbs could affect the value of its oil fields, refineries and pipelines. Sixty two percent of voting shareholders approved the resolution. Even though management opposed the resolution, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods believes low-emission fuels, carbon capture and biofuels are tools for meeting the Paris accord’s goals. His predecessor and now Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, concurs. Trade groups representing United Continenta, Boeing and other industry leaders such as DuPont and Pacific Gas & Electric are pressuring the White House to support low-carbon policies. So are financial services firms, such as Vanguard Group, that have large stakes in the big E&Ps. BlackRock, the $5.4 trillion asset manager -- Occidental’s largest shareholder and Exxon’s second largest -- supported the climate proposal this year for the first time. California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the nation’s largest pension fund, persuaded investors to validate the resolution by a 58 percent margin. Professionals offering actionable insights on markets, the economy and monetary policy. A roundup connecting the dots in global markets. Sign Up Regardless of whether Trump is able to negotiate what he views as an accord that's more favorable to America, the stocks of U.S. listed energy companies and other businesses supporting greenhouse gas reduction are poised to see some upside. Business as usual is no longer an option for them. Investors are voting on the imperative to the risks of climate change. They believe that the business case for climate action is real and that the gradual transition to a low-carbon economy not only can drive economic growth, but is a fact of life.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

"The trend is positive," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. Airbus last week warned that it expects slow orders this year and perhaps next year but said it was a normal part of the business cycle. New planes worth €4.7 trillion The planemaker predicts the need for 35,000 new planes worth 4.7 trillion euros over the next two decades, an increase from last year's estimates. "Air travel is remarkably resilient to external shocks and doubles every 15 years," said its chief operating officer for customer relations, John Leahy. "Asia Pacific continues to be an engine for growth, with domestic China to become the world's largest market." The numbers released on Friday, as the industry gears up for the Paris Air Show later this month, show a six percent increase from last year's forecasts in terms of numbers of aircraft and a two percent increase in value. Airbus last year already raised its 20-year forecasts, which it publishes each year, as does its US rival Boeing. 530,000 more pilots The number of aircraft worldwide that count over 100 seats should reach more than 40,000 while airline traffic will increase by 4.4 percent per year over the time period, according to the Airbus estimates. This means hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the planemaker said, estimating the need for 530,000 more pilots and 550,000 new maintenance engineers. The planemaker cited more first-time flyers and rising disposable income for air travel as other reasons for its forecast. Emerging markets in China and India Emerging markets in China and India, as well as other parts of Asia and Latin America, are growing nearly twice as fast as North America and Western Europe. Airbus is also hoping the expected demand will feed appetite for its superjumbo jet A380 model. "The A380 is the solution for future traffic growth" added Leahy.

(Source: NASA) Related News NASA unveils futuristic Mars rover concept Indian-American Raja Chari among 12 NASA astronaut candidates Indian-American among 12 new astronauts chosen by NASA NASA named 12 astronauts on Wednesday to the US space agency’s first new class of space fliers in five years, chosen from a record 18,300 applicants, for a new era of space travel. US Vice President Mike Pence welcomed the five women and seven men, aged 28 to 42, during their introduction at the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Pence said the White House planned to form a council to advise President Donald Trump on space policy and strategy, relaunching a body that has been inactive for more than 25 years. Trump is “firmly committed to NASA’s noble mission – leading America in space,” Pence said, noting that only 338 Americans have served as NASA astronauts. The trainees include a scientist working with the Mars robotic rover Curiosity, a SpaceX engineer, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and an Army surgeon. NASA is developing a heavy-lift rocket and Orion capsule for travel to the moon and eventually Mars. It is also working with Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Boeing Co to develop commercial space taxis that can ferry crews to and from the International Space Station, a $100 billion research lab that flies about 240 miles (400 km) above Earth. “Hopefully one day I’ll get to fly on a vehicle that has components I’ve actually designed,” said Robb Kulin, 33, a doctor of engineering and Fulbright Fellow who is joining the astronaut corps from SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Since the shuttle program ended in 2011, NASA has been dependent on Russia for rides to the station, a 15-nation project. Also read: Indian-American among 12 new astronauts chosen by NASA Jessica Watkins, 28, a post-doctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology, joins the class after serving on the science team operating the car-sized Curiosity rover which has been exploring Gale Crater on Mars since August 2012. “We intend to send her to Mars one day,” said acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot. The astronauts have two years of training before they are eligible for flight assignments. They are scheduled to report for duty at the Johnson Space Center in August.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print As someone who believes climate change is a moral issue, I’m appalled at President Trump’s announcement that he is pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. It’s particularly disturbing coming just days after his meeting with the Pope, who has stressed repeatedly that climate change is “one of the principal challenges facing humanity today.” The Pope also noted how it has a particularly devastating impact on the poor. All of us who read The Blade and watch the news are deeply aware of the turbulent effects of climate change, including melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and devastating storms. Scientists blame these frightening events, at least partly, on global warming. Our own experience over the past several summers, as well as carefully documented statistics, indicates an ongoing rise in temperature that doesn’t seem likely to reverse itself. Mr. Trump has abdicated his responsibility here. Let’s urge Rep. Bob Latta (R., Bowling Green) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) to provide leadership in reducing carbon emissions in Ohio, ensure a careful transition to renewable energy, and prepare workers for the new jobs in this area. PATRICIA SCHNAPP Homerdale Avenue   Click here to submit a letter to the editor   Incivility caused by the liberals A June 4 editorial bemoaned the lack of civility in today's America (“On the restoration of civility”). At one point, Republicans were criticized for not having the courage to meet the people of their districts in town hall meetings. Liberals were then praised for their efforts to host these types of sessions, but always before friendly crowds. When a conservative attempts to hold a similar event, hecklers show up to try to disrupt things. So, who is causing the lack of civility? BEN LESNIEWSKI Maumee   Hussain column lacking facts In his June 5 column, Dr. S. Amjad Hussain stated that the Trump Administration approved a deal with Iran so that Boeing could sell commercial aircraft to them (“Trump Administration should be careful when siding with the Saudis”). That deal was approved in September, 2016, by the Treasury Department under the Obama Administration. He also stated that the Trump Administration lifted sanctions against Iran. From what I have read, President Trump has put new sanctions in place against Iran and other countries who do business with them. Mr. Hussain fails to mention that President Obama paid a ransom of $400 million to release hostages and gave Iran $1.3 billion in funds that were frozen. Mr. Hussain also made fun of President Trump’s sword-dancing ceremony but seems to have forgotten that President Barack Obama bowed to the Saudi king, which is a sign of weakness. BONNIE NEWMAN Swanton   Where are the honorable pols? From George Washington’s “I cannot tell a lie” to Honest Abe Lincoln, to Bill Clinton’s “I did not have sexual relations with that woman,” to this. My, my it is very sad, isn’t it?

EVERETT — John Olson paused as he thumbed through batches of photos taken over the past 75 years. They date back to the early 1940s to what was then Everett Junior College, a fledgling institution of higher education housed in a former elementary school. Olson, vice president of college advancement at what is now Everett Community College, was drawn to the image of a young man and woman walking down the steps near the entrance to the former Lincoln Elementary School building. The black-and-white photo was vintage 1950s. She wore a plaid calf-length skirt. His high-waisted pants were neatly cuffed at the ankles. They were looking into each other’s eyes. Olson was intrigued. He wondered whatever happened to the young students from 1954. He flipped over the photo, hoping to learn more. There were two names on the back: Donna Wilson and Jerry Walimaki. He passed on trying to track down someone with such a common name as Donna Wilson. He perused the Whitepages online and found a name and number for a Jerry Walimaki on Camano Island. The woman on the other end explained to Olson that Walimaki had died. His widow not only knew about the photo, she was in it. A copy is in a family scrapbook. Donna Wilson married Jerry Walimaki in 1955, one year after the picture was taken. The couple had met in a dance class at Everett Junior College. She’d grown up in a home along 12th Street and Lombard Avenue and graduated from Everett High. Without the hometown junior college, she would not have been able to afford higher education. She grew smitten with the quiet gentleman from Hoquiam. They were married for nearly 50 years before his death in 2004. He was an electrician, and they’d raised four children. The Walimakis are a reminder that the college is more than the thousands of degrees and certificates it has awarded over the past 75 years. Its history reflects the community it serves, often the beginnings of decades-long relationships. The college will take two hours to celebrate its 75th anniversary year with a public reception from 4 to 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Walt Price Student Fitness Center. Anyone interested in attending can go to the college’s website at www.everettcc.edu to RSVP. Much of the college’s history is told in a recently published book. The photo of Jerry and Donna Walimaki appears on the cover. The author is Thomas Gaskin, who taught U.S., Pacific Northwest and Vietnam War history in his 37 years at the college. He was named EvCC’s faculty member of the year three times before retirement. “It certainly was a labor of love,” Gaskin said. “After you work at an institution you love, it’s pretty easy to say yes.” The book takes a chronological and thematic approach. It goes back to 1915 when a first version of Everett Junior College opened on the third floor of Everett High School. Enrollment plummeted during World War I and the college program shut down in the early 1920s. Another version of the college opened in 1941, this time at 25th Street and Oakes Avenue, where Lincoln Elementary School had opened just two years earlier. Over time, the campus would become a curious mix of buildings with Army barracks from Paine Field trucked in for extra classroom space. In 1941, the Everett School Board was overseeing both the college and the elementary school. Neighbors didn’t want to give up their new school. The board asked voters to decide their preference that September. The college won by a wide margin. A few days later, classes began for a freshman class of 134 students. A survey of 128 of those students found that only 15 would have been able to attend University of Washington or Washington State University if the junior college closed. There were still hard feelings in the neighborhood. “Animosity by the nearby community was still evident,” Gaskin wrote. “Chemistry instructor J.F. Marvin Buechel had tomatoes thrown at him as he rode his bike to school during the early months of the college’s existence.” Again a world war broke out, jeopardizing the future of Everett’s college for a second time. Again enrollment plunged. If it fell below 100, the college would be forced to close. Nursing and officer training programs kept it above that perilous threshold. “Not only were students off to war, but so were Everett Junior College faculty,” Gaskin wrote. “The one-man engineering faculty saw a turnover of five different instructors in the first academic year, as one after another entered military service.” Eventually, the college would grow, and grow, and grow some more. It would move north to its current location between Broadway and Wetmore Avenue and expand many times over. More than 2,500 students are expected to graduate from EvCC with a degree or certificate during this school year, according to EvCC’s Enrollment Services office. By contrast, the college’s inaugural graduating class in 1943 numbered 22 students who received their diplomas at a ceremony at the First Presbyterian Church. Donna Walimaki has watched with interest as the college expanded. “I was telling my friend the other day it’s like a little city,” she said. More than $150 million in new construction has been added to the campus since 2008, including the college’s new student housing buildings, Mountain View Hall in 2016 and Cedar Hall, which is slated to open in September. The book also lists notable alumni — some who left the area to find fame; others who made a mark in their own back yard. The roster includes the likes of internationally known artist Chuck Close, fantasy novelist David Eddings and journalist and author William Prochnau. Closer to home were former Everett Police Chief Kathy Atwood, businessman and philanthropist Dwayne Lane, and Everett Mayor Ray Stephanson. The college will recognize a dozen more alumni at Wednesday’s reception. Their names will be added to the distinguished alumni list. They are broadcaster Cynthia Andrews, golfer Jim Brady, contractor Gordon Cole, retired accountant Caryl Thorp DeJong, former Assistant Superintendent Richard (Dick) Hanson, sisters and dentists Natasha Habib and Sabrina Heppe, Boeing Co. senior manager Duard King, Emmy Award-winning video producer Paul Matthaeus, teacher Patti Safley, coach Kristina Schumacher, and retired EvCC photography instructor Lloyd Weller. On June 16, another class of graduates will receive their diplomas. Azrael Howell plans to be among the roughly 350 students choosing to walk in cap and gown. He will turn 40 the week he graduates. He completed most of his classwork during the previous two years, an eventful time in his life when he served as the college’s student body president. Howell grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and moved to Indiana before ending up in the Puget Sound area. He wanted a fresh start after 15 years in retail. He was a C-student in high school, but earned top grades in college. This year, he worked in a student coaching program at the college. Howell embraced his college experience, even writing lyrics for a song based on the college’s slogan “Stay close, go far.” Along the way, he said he has learned that his voice matters and that he must “lean into greatness” and encourage others to do the same. With scholarships, he’ll attend Seattle University next fall to study health psychology. He’d love to return to EvCC someday as an instructor or counselor. “Everett Community College has definitely encouraged me to pursue even greater dreams than I had when I started,” he said.

Story Continued Below “Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, NSA Director Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats repeatedly stonewalled when asked about news reports that Trump asked each of them to downplay or refute the FBI’s probe, which is examining whether Trump’s associates colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Both men insisted they’d never felt pressured to do anything improper, but they parsed their words carefully and stopped short of outright denials that Trump had asked them to undermine the FBI’s probe.” POLITICO’s key moments of the hearing are here. COMEY: TRUMP ASKED ME TO ‘LIFT THE CLOUD,’ via Josh: “Fired FBI Director James Comey claims that President Donald Trump asked him in late March to ‘lift the cloud’ put over his administration by the ongoing investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. “In a written statement submitted in advance of Comey’s expected testimony Thursday, the ex-FBI chief said Trump called him on March 30 to complain that the probe was hindering the White House's work. ‘He described the Russia investigation as 'a cloud' that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country,’ Comey's statement says. ‘He asked what we could do to 'lift the cloud.’” Comey’s highly anticipated appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee begins at 10 a.m. and will be widely televised. His full opening statement is here. Highlights are here. And POLITICO’s full Comey coverage is here.

What’s its role in the economy—and what does it take for government to foster new technologies that help the whole nation, not just a favored few? In a month long Special Report, The Agenda takes a deep look at the surprising new politics of innovation, and ideas for how to drive it in a new era. In this package, you’ll read about how AOL founder Steve Case became the first call for Congresspeople who want to bring innovation to the heartland; a critical look at Challenge.gov, the federal government’s prize competition designed to spur innovation; and the surprisingly innovative history of the U.S. Post Office, which was long on the forefront of technology before turning into a lesson in what *not* to do. Read the entire package here. HAPPENING TODAY — SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS EYES GLOBAL ISIS: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee hears from experts at George Washington University, Georgetown University and the Brookings Institution about the Islamic State’s activities outside Iraq and Syria. NORTH KOREA TEST FIRES MORE MISSILES, reports Reuters: “North Korea fired what appeared to be several land-to-ship missiles off its east coast on Thursday, South Korea's military said, a day after the South postponed full deployment of a controversial U.S. anti-missile system designed to deter a North Korean attack. “The launches, the latest in a fast-paced series of missile tests defying world pressure to rein in its weapons program, come less than a week after the United Nations Security Council passed fresh sanctions on the reclusive state.” — AS SOUTH KOREA SUSPENDS THAAD, adds The Washington Post: “South Korea has suspended the deployment of a controversial American missile defense system, with the new liberal administration declaring that no further moves can take place until an environmental assessment is carried out — a process that could take a year or even two... “Moon’s office Wednesday said it would suspend the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system. The antimissile battery is designed to protect the South against North Korea, but it has elicited strong opposition, particularly where it is being deployed.” — NOT ‘COMFORTABLY AHEAD’ OF THE NORTH KOREAN THREAT, via your Morning D correspondent: The director of the Missile Defense Agency, Vice Adm. J.D. Syring, told a House panel Wednesday he “would not say we are comfortably ahead of the threat” posed by North Korea’s missile program. “The advancements in the last six months have caused great concern to me and others,” he told the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee. “It is incumbent upon us to assume that North Korea today can range the United States with an ICBM carrying a nuclear warhead.” Syring’s appearance before the panel follows a successful test last month in which a U.S. interceptor missile destroyed what he described as “an exact replica of what the U.S. would face if North Korea launched ballistic missiles against the U.S.” And “it’s safe to say” the nuclear triad will remain regardless of the result of the Trump administration’s ongoing nuclear posture review, the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for nuclear and missile defense policy told a Senate panel, our colleague Jacqueline Klimas adds. CHINA CRITICIZES THE PENTAGON’S ‘COLD WAR MENTALITY,’ writes The Wall Street Journal: “China pushed back against a Pentagon warning about the Chinese military’s growing ambitions outside Asia, calling the U.S. report ‘irresponsible’ and saying China’s defense policy was aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty. “In a new report on the Chinese military published Tuesday, the U.S. Defense Department said China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army, was likely to try to expand its operations outside the region, while strengthening its ability to defend expansive territorial claims closer to home. “‘China’s defense is for safeguarding China’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,’ Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing Tuesday. Criticizing the U.S. for maintaining a ‘Cold War mentality,’ Ms. Hua said the Pentagon report was written ‘without regard for the facts.’” TRUMP FACES GROWING SENATE RESISTANCE ON SAUDI ARMS DEAL, reports POLITICO’s Elana Schor: “As President Donald Trump aligns with Saudi Arabia amid a fresh dispute among Gulf nations, senators in both parties as soon as Thursday will try to block him from selling more than $500 million in offensive weapons to Riyadh. “The Senate bid to stop the Saudi arms sales — a small portion of what the White House claims will be a $110 billion package — is likely to fail. But the push to tie Trump's hands will probably find more support than a similar brushback pitch directed at President Barack Obama last year, as Democrats are far more united behind the proposal. Not only do Democrats have little reason to give Trump a win on any front, they're also stepping up their outcry over Saudi involvement in Yemen’s worsening civil war. “If backers of the effort to stop Trump's arms deals can do better than they did in the previous vote to bless Obama’s Saudi tank sales, they say they’ll send a message to the Saudi government that its warm ties to Trump won't stanch congressional concern over civilian casualties in Yemen.” SENATE WRANGLES OVER IRAN AND RUSSIA SANCTIONS, Elana also reports: “Ongoing Senate talks on a bipartisan Russia sanctions proposal are testing the ability of powerful GOP chairmen to work together on a package that can avoid imperiling passage of the Iran sanctions bill it could hitch a ride to. “Leaders in both parties say they want to vote on a plan to punish Russia as an amendment to the Iran sanctions bill that senators voted to move ahead with on Wednesday.” IRAQI KURDS SET INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM, reports Reuters: “Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region on Wednesday announced it would hold a referendum on independence, in a move the central government in Baghdad is likely to oppose strongly. “‘I am pleased to announce that the date for the independence referendum has been set for Monday, Sept. 25, 2017,’ Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said on Twitter. “Barzani's assistant Hemin Hawrami tweeted that voting would take place in the disputed region of Kirkuk and three other areas also claimed by the central government; Makhmour in the north, Sinjar in the northwest and Khanaqin in the east.” ** A message from Huntington Ingalls Industries: With a hot production line, skilled workers, a strong supplier base and deep experience building San Antonio-class LPD amphibious warships, Ingalls Shipbuilding can close the gap between LPD 29 and LX(R), the next-generation warships our Navy and Marine Corps need now.

So far, the Syrian Democratic Forces -- an umbrella group of militias that includes the YPG -- has set up a 150-member council meant to govern the city post-ISIS — including 15 Kurds, one of them serving as its co-chair. "Will they withdraw? No, why would they?" Amberin Zaman, a columnist with the independent online Turkish news portal, Diken, said at a panel sponsored by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. And as ISIS retreats in Syria, the U.S. and Iran scramble for control, writes The Washington Post. TRUMP OFFERS TO MEDIATE THE ARAB GULF DISPUTE, reports POLITICO’s Jake Lahut: “President Donald Trump spoke to Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani on Wednesday amid a diplomatic falling-out in the region over accusations the Qatari government supported terrorist organizations… “Trump also offered to host Qatar and other disputing nations in Washington if it would help resolve their differences, the White House said.” Arab states are drawing up a list of demands that Qatar must meet to return to normal relations, writes the WSJ. And Turkey and Germany show their support for Qatar, adds the WSJ. Meanwhile, a cloud hangs over a U.S. arms deal with Qatar for F-15 fighter jets potentially worth $21.1 billion, reports Defense News. DIA CHIEF SEEKS TO TEST ASSUMPTIONS, writes our colleague Bryan Bender: “The Pentagon's intelligence arm, grappling with a host of growing military threats, is looking to step up its war-gaming to ‘test our assumptions’ about potential enemies, according to the military's top spy. “Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, says a host of worrisome military developments, including North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and Russia's introduction of ‘hybrid warfare’ in Ukraine, have increased the need to ‘make intelligence more useful to everyone from combatant commanders to warfighters on the ground.’” His answers to a series of questions are here, for Pros. INDUSTRY INTEL — BOMBARDIER PROTESTS COMPASS CALL CROSS DECK, reports Defense News: “The Air Force’s Compass Call cross deck program has yet another protest to contend with, this time from Bombardier. “Despite two legal challenges to the program, the Air Force intends to stay the course on its current acquisition strategy, said Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, the service’s uniformed head of acquisition.” — SPACEX TO LIFT AIR FORCE ORBITAL VEHICLE, also via Defense News: “The X-37B is heading back to space later this year, and this time the space plane will launch for the first time ever by a SpaceX Falcon 9, the Air Force announced late Tuesday. “The fifth mission of the X-37B, sometimes referred to as the orbital test vehicle, involves carrying the Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal Spreader (ASETS-11) created by the Air Force Research Laboratory, the service stated in a news release.” FOR YOUR RADAR — VA ACCOUNTABILITY BILL TO HEAD TO TRUMP NEXT WEEK, write our colleagues Rachel Bade and Connor O’Brien: “After years of complaining about a troublesome Veterans Affairs bureaucracy, Congress next week will send President Donald Trump a bill making it easier for the VA secretary to fire or discipline poor-performing employees. “House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) says his chamber next week will vote to clear legislation giving VA Secretary David Shulkin greater authority to ‘expeditiously remove, demote or suspend’ ill-performing employees or those guilty of misconduct.” MAKING MOVES — TRUMP NOMINATES TSA HEAD, reports The Washington Post: “President Trump on Tuesday nominated David P. Pekoske, the former Coast Guard vice commandant, to be the next administrator of the Transportation Security Administration... “[Homeland Security Secretary John] Kelly said Pekoske most recently served as vice president of national programs for PAE and group president of the National Security Group of A-T Solutions.” — AND TRUMP'S PICK FOR DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY IS FINALLY SENT TO THE SENATE: The president's nomination to be deputy defense secretary, Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan, was officially submitted to the Senate Wednesday. And the move is likely to jumpstart Shanahan's confirmation process after a long period of radio silence — his selection was first announced almost three months ago. Shanahan's nomination was one of a dozen sent to the Senate Wednesday, including Lockheed executive Ryan McCarthy, tapped Tuesday to be Army undersecretary.

NEW DELHI (Sputnik) — India's Srei Infrastructure Finance on Thursday announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Russian state development institution Vnesheconombank to create a $200 million IT and Innovation Fund. Cali4beach AI Robot Barely Passes China's Gaokao Math Test The fund will serve as a two-way bridge between Indian and Russian markets and create opportunities for technology cooperation, Hemant Kanoria, chairman and managing director of Srei, said in a statement. "The IT and Innovation Fund will promote India-Russian cooperation in the area of IT technologies and innovation. Srei and Vnesheconombank, through this fund, will explore investments opportunities in technology companies in Russia, India and other selected regions," Seri's statement reads. Srei is a multi-sector infrastructure conglomerate with around $5.5 billion of consolidated assets under its management, while Vnesheconombank operates to enhance the competitiveness of the Russian economy, diversify it and stimulate investment. © AFP 2017/ Toru Yamanaka India's TASL Delivers Components to Boeing for Chinook Helicopters With India, Russia trade being less than $10 billion annually, and primarily comprising defense sector cooperation at the public sector level, it needs a major boost and a shift towards private sector cooperation. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have agreed to enhance bilateral trade to $30 billion by 2025. "Trade is like electricity and flows in a direction with least resistance. The enhanced focus on improving trade and commerce ties between the two countries is beginning to show fruit like Essar-Rosneft deal and now this one. There also have been successive high-profile visits on both sides, which are bound to give impetus to trade. There are several other areas like gems and jewelry, pharmaceutical and IT where more synergy can be developed," Nandan Unnikrishnan, Vice-President, at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, told Sputnik. With rising protectionism in the US and anti-immigrant sentiment under the presidency of Donald Trump, Indian IT companies need to expand into new markets. During his visit to India in March this year, Russian Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov had said Moscow is eager to welcome highly-skilled Indian talent, and that they will aid the workforce with all possible facilities. ...
