The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency selected Boeing's design for the next "fabrication" and "flight" phases of its Experimental Spaceplane-1 (XS-1) effort. The DARPA program seeks to create a "launch-on-demand" capability for smaller payloads while lowering launch costs by a factor of 10. The reusable XS-1 would serve as a hybrid aircraft-space launcher capable of lifting payloads to the edge of space where an expendable upper stage would place satellites up to 3,000 pounds into polar orbits. Launched like a rocket and powered by cryogenic propellants, program officials said the XS-1 space plane would reach hypersonic speeds before releasing its upper stage. The reusable first stage would then land on a runway to be readied for its next flight "within hours," DARPA said. "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities," Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, which oversees XS-1, noted in a May 24 statement announcing the Boeing design win. Phase 2 of the program calls for Boeing's Phantom Works unit, which also builds the X-37B space plane used for classified Air Force missions, to design and test a prototype vehicle by 2019. The initial tests include firing the prototype vehicle's engines 10 times in 10 days to verify its propulsion system is ready for flight tests. The XS-1 will use an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the U.S. space shuttle main engine. Flight testing of the XS-1 is scheduled to begin in 2020, with up to 15 sorties that would also include 10 test flights over 10 days, DARPA said. Initial flights without a payload would reach speeds up to Mach 5. Later flights would top out at Mach 10 and eventually deliver a demonstration payload to orbit. Along with lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks, the XS-1 demonstration phases will evaluate the ability of composite-metallic wings and control surfaces to withstand the pounding of suborbital hypersonic flight along with temperatures of more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Pamela Melroy, a former shuttle commander who also served as deputy director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, noted that XS-1 and related efforts are designed to get a handle on launch and satellite costs. "The cost of access to space is one of our major focus areas," Melroy stressed. DARPA also said XS-1 testing will wring out its Airborne Launch Assist Space Access program, which seeks to launch 100-pound satellites into low-Earth orbit on short notice for less than $1 million per launch. That effort reflects the research agency's plans to develop smaller, cheaper satellites that could be replaced more quickly than current payloads launched using expendable rockets. Also competing for the next phase of the XS-1 program were the teams of Northrop Grumman and Virgin Galactic along with Masten Space Systems and XCOR Aerospace. Boeing's prototype dubbed "Phantom Express" measures 100 feet in length with a wingspan of 62 feet. The single AR-22 engine would burn a mixture of liquid hydrogen and oxygen. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works, noted in a statement.   About the Author George Leopold is a contributing editor for Defense Systems and author of Calculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom."Connect with him on Twitter at @gleopold1.

The news comes four days after an auction began for seats on the delivery flight scheduled for June 13. Phil LeBeau | @Lebeaucarnews Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 6:28 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images The first Boeing 737 MAX 9 airliner is pictured at the company's factory on March 7, 2017 in Renton, Washington. The 737 MAX 9, which can carry up to 220 passengers, is the second of three variants of the popular single-aisle model. For Norwegian Air, taking delivery of its new Boeing 737 MAX 8 is another great marketing opportunity. It's offering a dozen people a once-in-a-lifetime ride on the airline's newest plane. But just four days after opening an auction for seats on the delivery flight scheduled for June 13, Norwegian says it won't be taking off that day. "Boeing has informed us that the delivery of our first 737 MAX is postponed until the end of June," the company said in a brief statement. Why the delay? Boeing spokesman Doug Alder tells CNBC: "On occasion delivery processes run into minor issues — whether for maintenance or other reasons. In this case, we and our customer decided to re-schedule this delivery in order to resolve a minor technical issue." Alder declined to give further details about issues causing the delay. Boeing expects Norwegian Air to get the plane by the end of June. Pushing back scheduled deliveries of new planes is not unusual, but Boeing has a lot riding on its new 737. The transition from the current 737 NG to the 737 MAX is being watched closely. Boeing is currently building 42 737s each month, with monthly production scheduled to jump to 47 later this year, 52 in 2018 and 59 in 2019. As that production climbs, so will deliveries of the 737 MAX. There's no indication that delaying some initial 737 Max deliveries will jeopardize Boeing's production plans, but pushing back Norwegian's delivery comes less than a month after Boeing suspended 737 MAX test flights to inspect some of the engines for a potential manufacturing flaw. After inspecting the LEAP 1B engines and working with the engine manufacturer CFM International, Boeing resumed test flights, and the first 737 MAX 8 was delivered in mid-May to the Asian carrier Malindo Air. Malindo is now operating two 737 MAX planes. As for Norwegian, the delivery delay will not change the airline's plan to expand service to the U.S. this summer. "This will not affect our operation or our passengers, as the upcoming launch of transatlantic routes between the U.S. East Coast and Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Norway will be operated by another aircraft type," the airline said. Boeing shares closed Friday up more than 1.6 percent at about $190.23.

Davis 72nd Air Base Wing Public Affairs The Boeing E-3 Sentry is a special mission aircraft built around a highly-modified Boeing Model 707-320 commercial airliner. The Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, is essentially a powerful airborne search and track radar system using a rotating dome affixed 11 feet above the top of the rear fuselage using two aerodynamic pylons. The aircraft itself sits on tricycle landing gear with mid-fuselage mounted, swept-wings with two TF33 engines under each wing. It has a traditional tail configuration. Overall view of a 552nd Air Control Wing E-3C Airborne Warning & Control System (AWACS) aircraft shown over the central United States as it approaches a KC-135R Stratotanker to refuel. The AWACS aircraft has a large rotating radar mounted above the aircrafts’ fuselage and large sensors mounted along the sides of the forward fuselage and below the nose. The E-3C is based at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Copyright 2003 Greg L. Davis, Aviation Photojournalist Tinker’s connection with the E-3 Sentry has stretched over the aircraft’s entire operational life. The first E-3 arrived here in March 1977 directly off the production line and was quickly followed with a total of 35 aircraft purchased between fiscal years 1977-1984. Tinker is the primary operating location for the E-3 and includes both training and operational flight squadrons, unit-level maintenance and depot-level maintenance through the co-located Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization purchased and operates 18 E-3A ‘U.S./NATO Standard’ aircraft. These NATO standard aircraft differ slightly from U.S. Air Force aircraft in the avionics and communications suites necessary to communicate with NATO air and ground units. These aircraft also retain many of the legacy systems and technology when compared to the numerous upgrades given to the U.S.A.F. aircraft over the last 40 years. There have also been foreign military sales of E-3s: seven to the United Kingdom, five to Saudi Arabia and four to France. These aircraft are all equipped with high-bypass CFM56 engines. The U.S.A.F.’s current upgrade program, much of which is conducted at Tinker, is currently underway. Block 40/45 represents a revolutionary change for AWACS by modernizing the 1970s era mission computer, controller displays, and other systems using modern off-the-shelf components. An upgraded Identification Friend or Foe system and communications equipment make the E-3 not just a powerful flying radar capable of monitoring and controlling aircraft from ground level to the stratosphere in a 250 mile circle, but also acting as part of a larger Command and Control Battle Management element in the Theater Air Control System by passing information to other players such as fighters for intercepts and ground based assets for monitoring and interrogation. In modern warfare the ability to control the skies and achieve air-superiority is critical. Therefore, there are E-3s in-use across the world and the USAF has permanently forward based E-3s at Kadena Air Base, Japan and Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. Air refueling capability gives the Sentry long legs and the ability to quickly deploy and when necessary remain aloft for many hours at a time to meet the needs of combatant commanders. The venerable E-3 Sentry has played crucial roles in air combat by monitoring and controlling contested airspace over Iraq during Operation Desert Shield/Storm, Northern and Southern Watch, Iraqi Freedom, and over Afghanistan in Enduring Freedom. It also played a key role in NATO Operation Allied Force and over the continental US in support of Operation Noble Eagle. If there is an area of tension in the world it is virtually guaranteed an E-3 Sentry is on duty to monitor and control the airspace.   Manufacturer: Boeing Aircraft type: E-3 Nickname: Sentry/AWACS Crew: Flight crew of four; 16-20 mission specialists Power plant: Four Pratt & Whitney TF33 turbofan engines producing 21,000 pounds of thrust each.

Time Boarding passes could someday become quaint relics for air travelers. JetBlue Airways plans to test facial-recognition check-in for a few flights beginning later this month, and Delta Air Lines plans to let some passengers board with their fingerprints instead of a boarding pass. The once-ubiquitous paper boarding pass is already shunned by many travelers who prefer to use mobile boarding passes on their phones. Now pilot programs could render those obsolete too, as airlines aim to increase convenience for customers, and government agencies look to increase security. TODAY IN THE SKY: Delta to test facial-recognition tech on new self-service bag drop This image provided by Delta shows a biometric fingerprint scan being used to confirm entry at one of the carrier's frequent-flier lounges.  (Photo: Delta Air Lines) JetBlue and U.S. Customs and Border Protection will test facial recognition for passengers boarding flights from Boston's Logan Airport to Aruba starting later this month. Volunteers will be photographed and their images will be searched against a Customs database of passport and other photos. Passengers who are cleared will get a signal from a screen above the camera, telling them they can go ahead and board. JetBlue said it will be the first airline to work with Customs to test biometrics for identifying passengers during boarding. Delta recently started letting come members of its loyalty program use fingerprints as proof of their identity to enter the airline's lounge at Reagan Washington National Airport. The airline says that it plans to expand the test at National to let members use fingerprints to check a bag and board a plane.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:25 PM, June 2, 2017 ST PETERSBURG, Russia - Russia's new MS-21 passenger plane, its first domestically-built mainline commercial aircraft since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is a serious venture capable of competing with industry heavyweights Airbus <AIR.PA> and Boeing <BA.N>, the head of national airline Aeroflot <AFLT.MM> told Reuters on Friday. Russia carried out the MS-21's maiden flight on Sunday and has heralded the twin-engine jet as a domestic alternative to those made by America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus, which dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Manufacturer Irkut Corporation <IRKT.MM> and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) <UNAC.MM> say the new plane is more efficient than its Western counterparts, but analysts warn Russia faces a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "If they achieve the goals they announced, then this is of course a serious plane. It is a real plane which will compete with Boeing and with Airbus," Aeroflot CEO Vitaly Savelyev told Reuters in an interview at an economic forum in St Petersburg. "I think this will be a serious machine," he added. "It will be light, economical and effective. Now we are simply waiting for it." Flag carrier Aeroflot, which operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, has yet to sign any purchase contracts for the MS-21. But the company expects to do so this year and state defense conglomerate Rostec has already said it will lease at least 50 MS-21 planes to the airline. Savelyev said he expected the first delivery to be made in 2019 and 40 percent of Aeroflot's fleet would be made up of domestic aircraft by 2023. NO PRESSURE No official price has been announced, but it will have to be competitive to justify future purchases, Savelyev said. "We, as consumers, cannot take a plane that is more expensive than competing versions abroad. If we are to do it, it has to be at a competitive price," he said. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. Majority state-owned Aeroflot is sometimes seen as making business decisions which primarily benefit the Russian government, such as a move in 2015 to buy a 75-percent stake in failing competitor Transaero. The purchase was later abandoned and Aeroflot agreed to fulfill Transaero's ticket obligations at the state's request. Savelyev said he had come under no pressure to support the MS-21, which the government is hoping will help rejuvenate domestic industrial production and make the country less dependent on foreign firms. "We are a commercial company, there is no pressure on us or instructions to buy Russian planes," he said. "We would like there to be a domestic aircraft, because every airline all over the world tries to support domestic producers."

The flight seems to have gone well -- well enough that United said it will add another, even longer Boeing (BA) 787-9 flight to Singapore, this time from Los Angeles. Service will begin Oct. 27, pending government approval. At 8,700 miles, Los Angeles-Singapore would become the third-longest flight in the world as well as the longest U.S. origination flight and the longest Boeing 787 flight. "San Francisco-Singapore has done extremely well and there has been a chorus of passengers within the L.A. basin asking for non-stop service to Singapore," said Patrick Quayle, United vice president of international network. The demand is primarily from business passengers bound for Singapore, Quayle said, adding, "Singapore is a great global economic powerhouse in Southeast Asia." Passengers who want to fly beyond Singapore can board flights on Singapore Airlines, which like United is a Star Alliance member. On the San Francisco-Singapore route, about 70% of the traffic originates in the U.S., which is unsurprising since Singapore Airlines also operates between the two cities, utilizing an Airbus A350. Currently, according to OAG, the world's three-longest flights are Qatar's 9,026-mile Doha-Auckland flight aboard a Boeing 777; Emirates' 8,819-mile Dubai-Auckland flight aboard an Airbus A380 and Qantas' 8,576-mile Sydney-Dallas flight, also aboard an A380. Fourth is San Francisco-Singapore, which is 8,435 miles. (United has the mileage at 8,446, differing by 11 miles from the OAS measurement). The Boeing 787-9 has the longest range among Boeing's 787 family. At 8,700 statute miles, Los Angeles-Singapore is at the top end of the range, Quayle said. United will operate the aircraft with 252 seats in two classes. The first 787-9 flew its first commercial flight for ANA in August 2014.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News World News INTERVIEW-Aeroflot says new Russian jet 'serious' competitor to Boeing, Airbus Shares0 Fri, 2 Jun 2017-04:53pm , Reuters Russia's new MS-21 passenger plane, its first domestically-built mainline commercial aircraft since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is a serious venture capable of competing with industry heavyweights Airbus and Boeing, the head of national airline Aeroflot told Reuters on Friday. Russia carried out the MS-21's maiden flight on Sunday and has heralded the twin-engine jet as a domestic alternative to those made by America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus, which dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) say the new plane is more efficient than its Western counterparts, but analysts warn Russia faces a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "If they achieve the goals they announced, then this is of course a serious plane. It is a real plane which will compete with Boeing and with Airbus," Aeroflot CEO Vitaly Savelyev told Reuters in an interview at an economic forum in St Petersburg. "I think this will be a serious machine," he added. "It will be light, economical and effective. Now we are simply waiting for it." Flag carrier Aeroflot, which operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, has yet to sign any purchase contracts for the MS-21. But the company expects to do so this year and state defence conglomerate Rostec has already said it will lease at least 50 MS-21 planes to the airline. Savelyev said he expected the first delivery to be made in 2019 and 40 percent of Aeroflot's fleet would be made up of domestic aircraft by 2023. NO PRESSURE No official price has been announced, but it will have to be competitive to justify future purchases, Savelyev said. "We, as consumers, cannot take a plane that is more expensive than competing versions abroad. If we are to do it, it has to be at a competitive price," he said. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. Majority state-owned Aeroflot is sometimes seen as making business decisions which primarily benefit the Russian government, such as a move in 2015 to buy a 75-percent stake in failing competitor Transaero. The purchase was later abandoned and Aeroflot agreed to fulfil Transaero's ticket obligations at the state's request. Savelyev said he had come under no pressure to support the MS-21, which the government is hoping will help rejuvenate domestic industrial production and make the country less dependent on foreign firms. "We are a commercial company, there is no pressure on us or instructions to buy Russian planes," he said. "We would like there to be a domestic aircraft, because every airline all over the world tries to support domestic producers."

McIntyre June 2, 2017 6:10 am EDT Print Email Tweet United Airlines will start the longest flight between a U.S. location and any airport in the world. The service, which will cover 8,700 miles, will run between Los Angeles and Singapore. United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL) will use a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner plane for the flight. The aircraft builder launched the plane in 2009 and delivered the first one to Nippon Airlines in 2011. It can hold over 300 passengers. It is good for long-range flights because Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) has taken as much weight off its frame as possible, mostly through the use of composite material. Boeing says it has made 541 of the planes. Boeing’s price for the plane is $270 million, although carriers rarely pay the list price. Lighter planes have become the key to longer flights. On top of that, international travel has surged. According to a leading industry group: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced full-year global passenger traffic results for 2016 showing demand (revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 6.3% compared to 2015 (or 6.0% if adjusted for the leap year). This strong performance was well ahead of the ten-year average annual growth rate of 5.5%. Capacity rose 6.2% (unadjusted) compared to 2015, pushing the load factor up 0.1 percentage points to a record full-year average high of 80.5%. The rise in load and drop in fuel prices make these long routes more profitable than they would have been several years ago.

Banking & Finance Construction Education Energy Healthcare Media Real Estate Retail Technology Transport Travel & Hospitality Etihad says to expand Dreamliner network in Europe Abu Dhabi airline plans to launch flagship long-haul aircraft on routes to Amsterdam and Madrid Article Photos By Staff writer Friday, 2 June 2017 12:59 AM Etihad Airways has announced plans to boost its European Dreamliner network with the deployment of Boeing 787-9 aircraft to Amsterdam and Madrid. The 299-seat Dreamliners will be introduced on year-round scheduled services to Amsterdam from September, and to Madrid, effective October 1, joining Düsseldorf and Zurich as the airline’s other European Dreamliner services. The 787-9 will also operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months, Etihad said in a statement. With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, the aircraft are gradually being introduced on a number of international routes from the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub, it added. Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 13 Boeing 787-9s to 11 destinations – Washington, Düsseldorf, Zurich, Johannesburg, Amman, Riyadh, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Perth and Brisbane from Abu Dhabi. Beirut, Beijing, Seoul and Melbourne are due to join the 787 network over the next few months. Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways CEO, said: “With two of Etihad Airways’ most popular European destinations joining our 787 network later this year, we are giving more guests the opportunity to fly on our next generation aircraft. "The 787 is fast becoming our flagship long-haul aircraft and as more are delivered, we will continue to look at upgrading existing routes with these excellent planes.” Etihad Airways has pending deliveries of a further 58 Dreamliners over the next few years.

"We're very disappointed with the actions Boeing has taken against Bombardier...We believe (Boeing's) position is unfounded," Sajjan said on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual meeting of global defense officials. Ottawa is currently reviewing defense procurements with the U.S. aerospace giant, Sajjan added, which include 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets. In May, Boeing launched a trade complaint against Canadian plane maker Bombardier, alleging the Montreal-based firm receives government subsidies that allow it to sell planes at below-market prices. Canada's defense policy report on June 7 is expected to shed more details on the country's future investments and purchases, including the proposed Boeing orders. show chapters Canada's defense minister warns on foreign fighters    Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 12:00 AM ET | 02:21 "We're hopeful things can be resolved, but we have to stand up for Canadian interests," stated Sajjan, who became the nation's first Sikh defense minister after being appointed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet in 2015. A decorated lieutenant-colonel, 46-year old Sajjan clarified that his government was looking into the situation in its entirety, explaining the county's long relationship with the firm. "Boeing has been a very credible partner on various other procurements and we'd like that to continue," Sajjan said. "As a minister, I need to make sure the Canadian armed forces have all the right tools."

The Liberal government, angry that Boeing has launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc <BBDb.TO>, is threatening to scrap plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighters. Steven MacKinnon, parliamentary secretary to Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote, told reporters that Boeing “is not acting like a valued partner right now so we’ve suspended discussions with that partner.” Minutes later, Foote spokeswoman Annie Trepanier said that while government ministers were not talking to the company, “there is no formal suspension.” Earlier in the day Boeing scrapped an announcement about the jets, a day after Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan objected to the firm’s behaviour in the dispute against Bombardier. The company had been due to announce which Canadian companies would benefit if the purchase went ahead. Boeing has 560 suppliers in Canada. “Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story,” Boeing spokesman Scott Day said in a statement issued at an Ottawa defence show. While he did not specifically refer to the trade dispute, his comments appeared to be a reference to growing tensions between Ottawa and the firm. The Boeing saga has increased tensions between Canada and the United States in the run-up to talks on renewing the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last month, Canada said it “strongly disagrees” with the U.S. Commerce Department decision to investigate Boeing’s claims that Bombardier sold planes below cost in the United States and benefited unfairly from Canadian government subsidies. Even lower-level Canadian officials were not visiting the company’s stand at the Ottawa defence show, said one source familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. Sajjan on Wednesday said the firm would be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but he complained the anti-dumping petition against Bombardier was “not the behaviour we expect of a trusted partner”. Canada says it needs the Super Hornets as a stopgap until it can launch an open competition to replace its fleet of aging Boeing CF-18 planes. A Super Hornet deal would generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada’s aerospace hub of Quebec, where existing CF-18s are now maintained.

A total of 179 of Boeing’s KC-46 'Pegasus' tankers will be delivered by the end of the 2017. TrendsViral The new fleet of ‘aerial gas stations’ are set to replace their predecessors, the KC-135 Stratotankers, which have been in service since the Eisenhower administration. In an emergency, the new KC-46 is also capable of carrying over 100 troops, 54 medical patients or 65,000 pounds (29,500 kg) of cargo, reports CNN Money. Boeing-USAF KC-46A tanker undergoing electromagnetic testing in world's largest anechoic chamber at Edwards AFB #USAF #Boeing #KC46 #Tanker A post shared by The Boeing Company (@boeing) on May 26, 2017 at 9:22am PDT The US Department of Defense has allotted $3.1 billion of its requested 2018 budget of $639.1 billion to pay for just 15 of the tankers. The Pegasus boasts an array of aerial countermeasures to defend against anti-air missiles. It also houses a suite of high definition cameras and infrared lights which allow it to carry out its stealthy midair refueling operations. The BAF, operated by the 772nd Test Squadron, is the largest anechoic chamber in the world and can fit most aircraft inside. It provides a free space so electronic warfare tests can be conducted without radio frequency interference from the outside world. The chamber is filled with polyurethane and polyethylene pyramids designed to stop reflections of electromagnetic waves.

This project has proven to be somewhat of a coup for Boeing, as US military top brass have remained skeptical throughout the project's development. The first successful 'lights out' test was carried out in December when the KC-46 refueled a massive C-17 cargo plane in pitch black skies.

This is made possible by the access hatch underneath the plane's nose which removes the need for boarding staircases for the crew. The refueling boom that was specifically designed for USAF jets boasts an impressive 1,200 gallons per minute pump speed, enough to fill an average passenger car in less than a second. Non-USAF jets have to make do with two additional refuelling pods housed under the wings which pump at 400 gallons per minute.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. A Boeing logo on one of the firm's 737 Max 9 jets. Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Lufthansa weighs slowing deliveries of 777X, which would be blow to Boeing Originally published June 1, 2017 at 4:30 pm Updated June 1, 2017 at 5:08 pm Lufthansa aircraft are parked in Frankfurt, Germany, in this 2014 file photo. (Michael Probst/The Associated Press) The German airline is concerned about the cost and size of the big Boeing 777X as the aviation industry shifts to smaller, more nimble planes. Share story By Richard Weiss and Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News Germany’s Lufthansa is considering stretching out deliveries of Boeing’s new 777X aircraft, concerned about the cost and size of the big jet as the aviation industry shifts to smaller, more nimble planes. A decision on the new timeline is “urgent” and could be reached by September, according to an internal video presentation by Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr. The airline may take additional Airbus A350 planes, which carry fewer passengers than the 400-seat Boeing jet. “I’m not sure if we’ve really ordered enough A350s and possibly too many 777Xs,” Spohr said at a staff meeting, a replay of which was seen by Bloomberg. “We must now think about either stretching the 777X in a deal with Boeing to let them come in more slowly, or increasing profitability to finance our overdue fleet investments.” The move would be a blow to Boeing, which signed up Lufthansa as a launch customer for the 777X. The jet maker has a backlog for the model worth about $125 billion at list prices, with orders concentrated among airlines that have hit market turbulence recently.

Carriers in the Persian Gulf, where low oil prices are damping economies and sapping demand for travel, account for more than three-quarters of the 306 orders. Deliveries for the 777X — a new version of Boeing’s existing 777 aircraft that will be the industry’s largest-ever twin-engine jetliner — are due to start in 2020. Lufthansa spokesman Andreas Bartels said reviewing the order book is daily business for any airline and that the company won’t comment on internal discussions. Demand for big twin-aisle aircraft has weakened since Lufthansa placed an order for the Boeing model in 2013, under Spohr’s predecessor. Cheaper fuel and an industrywide glut of smaller, relatively young widebody planes have upended the economics that had favored larger models for long-range flying. Any deferrals or cancellations would add to concerns about the future of the 777, Boeing’s second-largest source of profit. The company is slowing production of current versions as it encounters weaker sales and prepares to build test planes for the next-generation variant, Boeing’s most expensive commercial plane. Boeing spokesman Daniel Mosely declined to comment on potential talks with Lufthansa. The airline, which has its main hubs in Frankfurt and Munich, is grappling with a shifting aviation market that may have made parts of its orders for 205 aircraft out of step with current trends. Carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle are ramping up cut-rate trans-Atlantic services using long-range narrow-bodies or fuel-efficient aircraft like Boeing’s twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner. Based on list prices, Lufthansa’s order book translates into average spending of 3.9 billion euros ($4.4 billion) a year through 2025. That compares with a budget of about 2.5 billion euros in annual capital expenditure. The $408.8 million 777X would eat up almost all of that, but remains necessary to replace older four-engine aircraft, the CEO said. Spohr’s message, delivered in March, may also have been intended to motivate Lufthansa managers to cut costs. He argued that meager profitability has caused the airline to underinvest in its fleet for two decades. The German carrier’s aircraft were 11.3 years old on average last year, compared with 5.25 years at Dubai-based Emirates airline and 5.5 years at Dublin-based discount carrier Ryanair. The aging fleet has left Lufthansa with the highest fuel expenses of any airline in Europe, as it operates almost 100 four-engine gas guzzlers. That includes the largest global fleet of Airbus A340s, a model that has long been out of production. While Lufthansa has 20 777Xs on firm order plus another 14 options, according to Boeing’s order book, it has just 25 A350s due for delivery. The Airbus plane, which seats 293 people and costs about $100 million less, is interesting for long-haul routes frequented by fewer passengers, reducing the need to bundle traffic at large hubs. These capabilities could make long-haul services from Düsseldorf, Hamburg and Berlin viable for Lufthansa’s Eurowings budget subsidiary, Spohr said. Lufthansa has also indicated that it may lease a larger proportion of its fleet and buy more used models to curb expenditures. The carrier said last month that it will replace most of the long-haul planes flown by its Belgian arm and opt for used aircraft. “Generally speaking, there for sure will be good deals in the coming years,” Spohr said in the video. “Airbus and Boeing have sold far too many aircraft to the Gulf.” Richard Weiss Julie Johnsson Next Story Trump faces tough task unwinding Obama’s Cuba policy Previous Story JetBlue, Delta will test biometric boarding passes Contact Newsroom staff list FAQ Contact form About the company Seattle Restaurant Week Newspapers in Education Fund for the Needy Employment Historical Archives Pulitzers Company information Permissions Seattle Times Store Advertise Classifieds Autos Homes Obituary Jobs Media Kit Advertise with Us Subscriber Services Subscribe Activate Account Manage Subscription Place Temporary Hold Report Delivery Issue Make a Payment Print Replica Today’s Front Page Facebook Twitter RSS Feeds Newsletters Mobile Apps Subscribe Copyright © 2017 The Seattle Times Company | Privacy statement | Terms of service Get our Morning Brief delivered to your inbox.

Idaho Business Health Marijuana Nation World Photos Business Boeing puts 737 up against small business jets for $6.9B defense contract UPDATED: Thu., June 1, 2017, 5:31 p.m. A conceptual rendering of the aircraft proposed by Lockheed Martin for the Pentagon’s JSTARS aircraft. (Seattle Times) By Dominic Gates Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS SEATTLE – For a vital aircraft that will fly above distant battlefields, the Air Force will choose between Goliath and two Davids. One is a jet originally designed to carry around 135 passengers, the two others built to carry fewer than 20 people. With a $6.9 billion deal on the line, a militarized version of Boeing’s 737 jet is going up against the Gulfstream G550 and the Bombardier Global 6000 high-end business jets for a special-mission contract to be awarded as early as this fall. The 17 JSTARS jets at issue will be stuffed with high-tech military radar and computer-analysis equipment. The planes are heavily used in combat zones for surveillance of ground forces and to target enemy positions. The current JSTARS fleet is now active in strikes on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Chicago-based Boeing, which has a big presence in the Seattle region, hopes a JSTARS win could incline the Air Force to choose the 737 to replace more than 100 different types of special-mission aircraft in its inventory – contracts that are lucrative far beyond the mere number of 737s involved. But the competition from Georgia-based Gulfstream and Canada’s Bombardier is formidable. For special missions, air forces around the world are increasingly selecting business jets that fly higher, faster and further than airliners. The Air Force initially chose the Gulfstream for a separate electronic-jamming plane code-named Compass Call, although Boeing in May formally challenged that process. Fred Smith, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing Military Aircraft, dismisses the business jets as “a great solution for countries with smaller air forces and navies.” As for the U.S., he said, “for a bigger mission, you need a bigger airplane.” In a conference room inside Boeing’s former Space Center in Kent, Washington, now a hive of different defense programs, a reporter donned a virtual-reality visor to take a look at a mock-up of the jet maker’s 737 JSTARS contender. JSTARS – Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System – is an Air Force-Army system revolving around a massive, long-range radar that monitors what’s happening on the ground in a battle zone. A virtual mock-up shows the radar hidden in a canoe-shaped bump about 20 feet long under the jet’s fuselage. Operators at 10 stations toward the rear of the aircraft would monitor large computer screens, analyzing the radar data and communicating with U.S. forces. Aft of the stations, large metal cabinets housed the computer servers and other equipment. Forward of them was a robust printer and a “mission table,” with a tabletop computer display screen of the battle zone. At the front of the cabin, immediately behind the flight deck, was a crew rest area for long-endurance missions and extra seats. Then Smith showed off a Boeing marketing trick, designed to impress upon the Air Force why size matters. With a click of a button, an arc of light sliced through the virtual cabin, superimposing upon Boeing’s mock-up another cabin wall that cut off half the computer stations. “That’s the G550 fuselage,” Smith said. The Gulfstream jet is proposed by a team led by defense firm Northrop Grumman and L3 Technologies, a leading integrator of military electronics. L3 is the lead system integrator role on the Compass Call contract and is set to choose the aircraft for that program – Boeing’s protest of the contracting process centers on L3’s close collaboration with Gulfstream. L3 integrated the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission systems on G550s sold to Australia, Israel and Singapore and for other special-mission models sold to Japan and Germany. Northrop is the prime contractor on the current JSTARS fleet. First deployed in combat during the first Iraq war in 1991, those jets are all converted 707 airliners – now with an average age of 48 years and ripe for replacement with something more efficient. Alan Metzger, Northrop’s vice president for surveillance and targeting systems, said in an interview that though the Air Force needed a 707-size jet to house all the equipment when the original JSTARS contract was awarded in 1985, a smaller business jet is appropriate today because the technology has all been miniaturized. “I don’t understand why you need a 135-passenger aircraft to carry around 10 Air Force operators,” Metzger said. Northrop bought a G550 and outfitted it with the current JSTARS mission equipment to demonstrate not only that the jet was big enough and met all requirements but that it had sufficient margin for any anticipated future growth. The key advantage of the business-jet solution is performance, he said. The G550 will fly hundreds of miles farther than a 737 and burn less fuel. It’s so much lighter it can take off from a shorter runway, giving it access to almost twice as many bases around the world, Metzger said. And the G550’s standard flight ceiling is 51,000 feet, compared with 41,000 feet for the 737. That matters when you are beaming radar down into a mountainous region such as, say, Afghanistan. At lower altitudes, a mountain peak up ahead may be in the way. As the plane flies higher, it has a direct line of sight into more of the landscape below. “You’ll see less if you have to look through rock, instead of over it,” Metzger said. The third JSTARS contender, offering the Bombardier business jet as the platform, is a team led by defense giant Lockheed Martin, partnered with electronics and mission-systems integrator Raytheon. Raytheon is separately bidding against Northrop to provide the high-tech radar equipment on the JSTARS plane and all three contenders are ready to offer whichever radar system wins. The Bombardier Global 6000 is larger than the G550, both longer and with a wider cabin, yet still about half the weight of the smallest 737. The U.S. Air Force uses a Global 6000 for its E-11 special-mission jet, which is an airborne node for relaying battlefield communications. And the Bombardier jet too has won a series of foreign military orders, said Stephane Villeneuve, Bombardier’s vice president of specialized aircraft. It’s the platform for the U.K.’s Sentinel reconnaissance fleet, AWACS aircraft for the United Arab Emirates, intelligence-gathering aircraft for India and maritime-patrol aircraft for Israel. “In the international market, people are going to a business jet for all the missions we are describing here,” Villeneuve said. That trend threatens Boeing’s hope of extending its line of modified commercial jets for the military by replacing all the U.S. Air Force special-mission aircraft with 737-based models. The Gulfstream and Bombardier jets each cost just over $60 million at list prices, some $20 million cheaper than the Boeing 737 model on offer. And they do burn a lot less fuel than the big jet. Nevertheless, one of Boeing’s major arguments is that the Air Force will save money on a fleet of 737s because maintenance and operational costs are so much lower. There are more than 9,000 of its 737s in service around the world, Boeing argues, with spare parts available anywhere in the world within 24 hours and with a tremendous reliability record that minimizes downtime. Smith compares the Air Force’s options to someone looking to repair a Ford truck rather than a fancy sports car. “There’s a maintenance shop on every corner,” he said. “It’s extremely cost-competitive.” He cited U.S. Defense Department data showing that when maintenance costs are included, the total operational cost of a 737 used to ferry around top military brass is about half that of a G550-based Air Force jet used for the same purpose. Rod Meranda, Boeing’s sales and marketing lead for the JSTARS program, contends that the Air Force also takes on less risk if it goes with Boeing. For example, he said, neither the G550 nor the Global 6000 has ever been fitted with an in-flight refueling capability – a JSTARS requirement. “There’s a lot of risk taking a small airplane, cutting a hole in it and putting in in-flight refueling,” said Meranda. “How much will it take to test that, something that’s never been done before?” Boeing by contrast has already installed in-flight refueling on its 737-based fleet of P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine jets. The Air Force plans to weigh the cost, risk and performance of the three proposals on offer and choose the JSTARS replacement by year end. If Boeing were to win, the necessary military modifications to the airframe would likely be done during final assembly on the Renton, Washington, production line – perhaps even on the same dedicated military line now churning out the P-8s. Where Boeing would then install the mission equipment, the radar and all the computers, is unclear. Still, for Renton, a Boeing JSTARS win would be significant and worth more than just 17 airplanes. It would indicate a high likelihood of further special-mission aircraft contracts later. First though, Goliath has to beat the Davids.

By the time the sun had gone down that evening, a pitched battle had taken place in the South Yorkshire village that changed the course of British history. Hundreds of striking miners, from all over the country, faced a force of more than 4,000 police, including mounted officers, dogs and several special riot units. The violence that day shocked the nation. What happened, and where blame lies, is still the subject of bitter dispute. Bitter dispute: Miners clash with police in 1984 But no-one, certainly not miners’ leader Arthur Scargill, nor even the late former prime minister Margaret Thatcher could have predicted what would happen to the Orgreave area itself. Three decades on, the scene of one of the worst episodes of our industrial history has been turned into a crucible of 21st century advanced manufacturing.

Share this article Share South Yorkshire in its heyday was at the leading edge of industry, famous for its coalfields and for Sheffield steel. By the grim 1980s, however, it seemed as though its glory days were gone. Now, in an extraordinary reinvention, the site of the old Orgreave works is a magnet for innovative companies. Scores of PhDs wander round where the pitmen used to tread. The Orgreave coking plant is long demolished. In its place is an advanced manufacturing park on around 100 acres near Sheffield and Rotherham. Technology developed at the park is being used in Formula One cars and craft such as the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner There are more than 40 companies on the site along with Sheffield University’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, a collaboration with Boeing. The US aircraft maker announced this year it will open its first European factory in Sheffield to make actuators, which move the flaps on plane wings. Auto-maker McLaren is another big name presence. It is moving the production of the carbon fibre chassis of its supercars to a £50m factory. Technology developed at the park is being used in Formula One cars and craft such as the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Nearby, 4,000 new homes are being built, with around 700 finished. They will house the employees. One of the firms breathing new life into the area is Metalysis. It opened a new £10m ‘materials discovery centre’ in the spring, where it is working on commercialising the production of titanium powder to be used in 3D printing for car and plane parts. ‘This site is Europe’s biggest manufacturing centre of gravity,’ says chief executive Dr Dion Vaughan. Big names: Auto-maker McLaren is moving the production of carbon fibre chassis of its supercars to a £50m factory The company, which was initially a spin-out from Cambridge University, secured £20m of investment last year, including a chunk from legendary fund manager Neil Woodford, and plans to employ at least 100 people. ‘This is not a deprived area, but what is missing is skilled jobs,’ says Vaughan. One Metalysis worker says stories of the Eighties live on: ‘Dozens of local cabbies must have regaled me with their memories of that time, sadly, but there’s a lot of optimism about the future of this site among those who recall those dreadful scenes.’ Companies like Metalysis are helping regenerate an area that used to lead the world in manufacturing, says Lord Prior of Brampton, a former senior executive at British Steel and now under-secretary of state at the department of business. ‘The Bessemer process came out of Sheffield, stainless steel came out of Sheffield, yet by the mid-1980s we had demonstrably lost it,’ he says. ‘Now we have the chance for a renaissance.’ The research going on here will play a big part in how Britain fares in what’s known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution or 4IR. The first was powered by coal and steam, the second by electricity, and the third was digital. The fourth will be about converging technologies, such as the Internet of Things, for instance fridges that can order milk for you. The hope is that the UK can outflank our rivals in 4IR by sheer intellect and better inventions. At 34, Chris Read, the Labour leader of nearby Rotherham council, is too young to remember the miners’ strike – but he says his generation was deeply affected. He says: ‘When I was a kid, there was always the thought in the back of your mind that if you wanted a good job you would have to go somewhere else. It doesn’t have to be like that. ‘People from outside are moving here now – there are fantastic jobs being created here.’ The number of highly skilled people in South Yorkshire will increase if it can attract more firms like Rolls-Royce, whose £110m advanced fan blade casting facility employs 180 people. It can make more than 100,000 turbine blades for jet engines in a year. Douglas Caster, chairman of Metalysis, believes the companies here show that British manufacturing can rise from the ashes. ‘This is a stark contrast to the unforgettable scenes which took place over the hill from here in 1984,’ he says. ‘I hope the growth and the future prosperity at this site will be a fitting tribute for those who remember it quite differently 33 years ago.’   Share or comment on this article e-mail 9 shares Most watched Money videos Rolls Royce exhibition will showcase 'The Great Eight Phantoms' Investing Show: Can the FTSE 250 continue its strong run?

(AP Photo / Susan Walsh) Aerospace blog Muilenburg: Boeing remains on track to keep boosting profits Dan Catchpole Fri Jun 2nd, 2017 3:12pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — The cash is going to keep coming. That was Boeing CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg’s key message at a Wall Street conference Thursday morning. The aerospace giant is making steady progress on pushing its profit margin to historic highs, a goal set by Muilenburg after taking over the company’s helm in 2016. The target is to hit about 15 percent operating profit by 2020 — essentially twice its average over the past 10 years. “We’re very committed to that target,” he told the audience at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York. Boeing expects to bring in less revenue by the end of its second quarter, which covers April, May and June. The decline is due to delaying deliveries of some new airplanes, chiefly Boeing’s KC-46, a new aerial refueling tanker for the Air Force. While tankers are rolling out of the Everett plant where they are assembled, the company does not expect to start handing over the planes to the military until late this year. Over the next few years, ramping up production of the company’s single-aisle 737 and making more of higher-priced 787s are expected to play a big role in boosting revenue and profit, Muilenburg said. Boeing will sell more and more of the its 787-9s and 787-10s, and less of the smallest Dreamliner, the 787-8. The larger -9 and -10 versions are bigger money makers for the company. The company is still testing the 787-10. The third production aircraft is already being manufactured, he said. Boeing continues talking with customers about creating a bigger version of its popular single-aisle 737 — a MAX 10 to compete with rival Airbus’ A321neo. A MAX 10 “would basically be the same size of an A321 with “about 5 percent lower operating cost per seat” due to weight savings,” Muilenburg said. If Boeing follows through on the MAX 10, it could make up as much as 25 percent of 737 sales and would first deliver to an airline probably in 2020, he said. Boeing sees an upside beyond its commercial airplanes division, which is based in Washington. Defense and satellite sales are expected to increase, Muilenburg said. The company even has seen renewed interest in the two fighter jets it produces — the F-15 and F/A-18. Just a couple years ago, many industry watchers expected the F-15 line to close in the next few years. Since then, Boeing has seen spurred interest from foreign customers that could have the F-15 line “extended in a strong way well into the next decade,” he said. And greater demand for the F/A-18 from the U.S. and allied militaries means “that line could very well be strong and healthy through the next decade,” Muilenburg said. This story has been modified to clarify the Boeing Company’s expected lowered operating costs resulting from improvements to the MAX 10.

Steve MacKinnon, the parliamentary secretary for Procurement Minister Judy Foote, says the government has "suspended" talks with Boeing about its plan to purchase 18 Super Hornets. But neither is the government talking to other companies about supplying the planes, MacKinnon says. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has called the Super Hornet purchase an interim measure to address a shortfall in capability that is preventing Canada from meeting its NATO and Norad responsibilities. The government says it is disappointed that Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. It says that is not the action of a trusted partner in defence procurement. MacKinnon was simply using the word "suspension" as "an expression," said a spokesperson in Foote's office. On Wednesday, Sajjan slammed Boeing in a speech to defence industry representatives at a major Ottawa conference. Boeing responded Thursday by cancelling a planned press conference at the large CANSEC military trade show that was meant to highlight its contribution to the fighter jet project. "Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story," Boeing spokesman Scott Day said in a statement. "Boeing has provided reliable solutions to Canada's defence and security needs, and we respect the mutual trust we have established with the Canadian Armed Forces." The company declined further comment.

The Liberal government, angry that Boeing has launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc, is threatening to scrap plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighters. Steven MacKinnon, parliamentary secretary to Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote, told reporters that Boeing "is not acting like a valued partner right now so we've suspended discussions with that partner." Minutes later, Foote spokeswoman Annie Trepanier said that while government ministers were not talking to the company, "there is no formal suspension." Earlier in the day Boeing scrapped an announcement about the jets, a day after Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan objected to the firm's behavior in the dispute against Bombardier. Advertisement Advertisement The company had been due to announce which Canadian companies would benefit if the purchase went ahead. Boeing has 560 suppliers in Canada. "Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story," Boeing spokesman Scott Day said in a statement issued at an Ottawa defense show. While he did not specifically refer to the trade dispute, his comments appeared to be a reference to growing tensions between Ottawa and the firm. The Boeing saga has increased tensions between Canada and the United States in the run-up to talks on renewing the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last month, Canada said it "strongly disagrees" with the U.S. Commerce Department decision to investigate Boeing's claims that Bombardier sold planes below cost in the United States and benefited unfairly from Canadian government subsidies. Even lower-level Canadian officials were not visiting the company's stand at the Ottawa defense show, said one source familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. Sajjan on Wednesday said the firm would be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but he complained the anti-dumping petition against Bombardier was "not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner". Canada says it needs the Super Hornets as a stopgap until it can launch an open competition to replace its fleet of aging Boeing CF-18 planes. A Super Hornet deal would generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where existing CF-18s are now maintained.

David Krayden Contributor 3:27 PM 06/01/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Canada has upped the ante in its war of words with Boeing, the National Post reports. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said Wednesday that the U.S. aerospace giant is no longer a “trusted partner.” Critics say the rhetoric is just an excuse for the Liberal government to not follow-through on a multi-billion dollar buy of the F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged to buy 18 plans as a stop-gap measure to replace the existing fleet of vintage CF-18 fighters originally procured by Trudeau’s father when he was prime minister in the early 1980s. Boeing’s violation of the “trusted partnership” supposedly occurred when it criticized the business practices of Montreal’s Bombardier aircraft, a company that is chronically in facing financial disaster and has received billions of dollars of federal government assistance over the decades. Boeing says Bombardier’s government subsidies enables it to sell its competing aircraft at lower prices; the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission agreed with Boeing’s accusations and has initiated an investigation into Bombardier. “It is not the behavior of a trusted partner,” Sajjan said during formal remarks at major defense trade show in Ottawa on Wednesday. He suggested that Boeing should cease and desist in its complaint because Canada must deal with “trusted trading partners.” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has also chimed in with criticism of Boeing bu many see the tempest as over the top. Conservative defense critic and Manitoba Member of Parliament James Bezan told The Daily Caller that the Boeing flap is just another chapter in Trudeau’s plan to do nothing about replacing the CF-18 inventory. “The Liberals’ decision to pull our CF-18s out of the fight against ISIS, their discredited sole-source fighter jet purchase, and their failure to advance important procurement projects all suggest that Justin Trudeau has a naïve view of our military and expects other countries to do the heavy lifting,” he said. Even if Canada signs the deal with Boeing, the anticipated $7 billion contract will only be a temporary fix. Trudeau has indicated that he would like to re-open the larger aircraft purchase to a bidding process, even though the successive Canadian governments, both Liberal and Conservative, had agreed to buy the F-35 joint strike fighter.

The Liberal government, angry that Boeing has launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc , is threatening to scrap plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighters. Steven MacKinnon, parliamentary secretary to Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote, told reporters that Boeing "is not acting like a valued partner right now so we've suspended discussions with that partner." Minutes later, Foote spokeswoman Annie Trepanier said that while government ministers were not talking to the company, "there is no formal suspension." Earlier in the day Boeing scrapped an announcement about the jets, a day after Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan objected to the firm's behavior in the dispute against Bombardier. The company had been due to announce which Canadian companies would benefit if the purchase went ahead. Boeing has 560 suppliers in Canada. "Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story," Boeing spokesman Scott Day said in a statement issued at an Ottawa defense show. While he did not specifically refer to the trade dispute, his comments appeared to be a reference to growing tensions between Ottawa and the firm. The Boeing saga has increased tensions between Canada and the United States in the run-up to talks on renewing the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last month, Canada said it "strongly disagrees" with the U.S. Commerce Department decision to investigate Boeing's claims that Bombardier sold planes below cost in the United States and benefited unfairly from Canadian government subsidies. Even lower-level Canadian officials were not visiting the company's stand at the Ottawa defense show, said one source familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. Sajjan on Wednesday said the firm would be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but he complained the anti-dumping petition against Bombardier was "not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner". Canada says it needs the Super Hornets as a stopgap until it can launch an open competition to replace its fleet of aging Boeing CF-18 planes. A Super Hornet deal would generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where existing CF-18s are now maintained.

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Boeing spat with Canadian defence minister hurts fighter jet deal Boeing spat with Canadian defence minister hurts fighter jet deal June 1, 2017, 7:57 PM BST | Written by Christian Nordqvist | A Boeing spat with Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan led to the American airplane maker abandoning an announcement about fighter jets it was hoping to sell to Canada. Mr. Sajjan had objected to Boeing’s behaviour in a trade dispute with Bombardier Inc., a Canadian multinational aerospace and transportation company. The Financial Post quoted Scott Day, a Boeing spokesman who said at CANSEC, the Ottawa defence show: “Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story.” The F/A-18 Super Hornet is a supersonic, twin-engine, all weather multi-role jet fighter that is able to land and take off from an aircraft carrier. At just under $100 million each (flyaway cost), Boeing’s complaint may have lost it (so far) $1.8 billion’s worth of Canadian business. (F/A-18 Super Hornet webiste) On May 31st, Defence Minister Sajjan said: “Our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners [Boeing]. We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing’s petition against Bombardier.” “As my colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has indicated, Canada is reviewing our procurement involving that firm. As you all know, one of those is the exploration of an interim fleet of fighter jets.” Boeing says subsidies unfair According to Boeing, Bombardier benefits unfairly from Canadian government subsidies by selling airplanes below cost to the US. The Canadian government minister was furious regarding the claim and has cut off contacts with Boeing. Boeing had planned to announce at CANSEC which Canadian suppliers would benefit if the purchase of fighter jets went ahead. There are approximately 560 Canadian suppliers. Harjit Singh Sajjan, born in Bombeli, India in 1970, is Canada’s Minister of National Defence. Before entering politics, Sajjan was a detective investigating gangs for the Vancouver Police Department. As a regimental commander in the Canadian Armed Forces, he was decorated for his service in Afghanistan. He emigrated with his family to Canada when he was five years old. Sajjan is the first Sikh to become Minister of Defence and also the first Sikh-Canadian to command a Canadian Army reserve regiment. (Image: twitter.com/harjitsajjan) Canadian minister and lower-end officials were giving the Boeing stand at CANSEC the cold shoulder (not visiting it), according to local media reports. Canada will soon need to replace its fleet of seventy-seven aging Boeing CF-18 air force planes. It needs the eighteen Super Hornet jets as a stopgap until an open tender competition can be launched. In a press conference, Steven McKinnon, Parliamentary Secretary to Public Services Procurement Minister Judy Foote, said: “We have a capability gap, we outlined a process, our partner in that process is not acting like a valued partner right now so we’ve suspended discussions with that partner.” What is CANSEC? CANSEC is Canada’s Global Defence and Security Trade Show. It has been held once a year in Ottawa since 1998 by the Canadian Association of Defence and Security Industries (CADSI). According to CADSI: “CANSEC 2017 will once again showcase leading-edge technology, products and services for land-based, naval, aerospace and joint forces military units. This two-day event is the largest and most important defence industry event in Canada.” Video – CANSEC This CADSI video explains what CANSEC is, Canada’s Global Defence and Security Trade Show.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Photo Credit: PC / Adrian Wyld Boeing cancels fighter jet announcement amid spat with Ottawa over Bombardier By Levon Sevunts | english@rcinet.ca Thursday 1 June, 2017 , 1 Comment ↓ Share Boeing is slamming the breaks on its plans to make a major announcement regarding the sale of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets to Canada after Ottawa took the aerospace and defence manufacturer to task over its complaint against Bombardier. Boeing spokesman Scott Day said this morning that the company is postponing its planned Interim Fighter Capability Project (IFCP) industry teaming announcement at the annual CANSEC defence industry trade show organized the Canadian Association of Defence and Security Industries (CADSI). “Boeing had planned to announce the IFCP industry partnership team today at CANSEC,” Day said. “However, due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story.” Canada plays hardball Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan’s office refused to comment on the matter. “Minister Sajjan’s comments yesterday speak for themselves and we do not have anything to add,” Jordan Owens, the minister’s spokesperson, said in an email. The announcement by Boeing came after Sajjan blasted the company on Wednesday for picking a trade spat with Bombardier in a keynote address to defence industry representatives at CANSEC.

In a breakfast speech to hundreds of defence contractors, including representatives of Boeing, Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the “unfounded” action by one of its major partners in the defence industry. “We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing’s petition against Bombardier,” Sajjan said. “As my colleague, the minister of foreign affairs has indicated, Canada is reviewing our procurement involving that firm. As you all know, one of those is the exploration of an interim fleet of fighter jets.” Urgent stopgap measure? Canada had announced plans to buy 18 Super Hornet fighter jets as a stopgap measure to beef up its legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter jets – also produced by Boeing – because it didn’t have enough jets to meet its NORAD and NATO obligations, Sajjan said.

However, Boeing is not behaving like a “trusted partner” and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint, he said. “We are following a normal process available to U.S. companies, we’re following U.S. laws,” Day told Radio Canada International Wednesday. “Obviously this is not a done deal yet, we value the minister’s opinion and we think the Super Hornet is still a valuable fit for Canadian defences.” ‘Unwavering commitment’ Boeing’s commitment to Canada “has been, and remains, unwavering,” Day said on Thursday. The company’s operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country’s aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. “Boeing has provided reliable solutions to Canada’s defence and security needs, and we respect the mutual trust we have established with the Canadian Armed Forces through the successful execution of several key programs, including the CF-188 Hornet, CC-177 Globemaster III and CH-147 Chinook,” Day said.

The first Boeing KC-46 refueling tanker is being readied for the U.S. Air Force. By Jon Ostrower SEATTLE (CNNMoney) -- Boeing is set to deliver a refueling tanker that can gas up a jet in midair in complete darkness -- the first of its kind. The U.S. Air Force is buying 179of the new KC-46 'Pegasus' tankers, which are set to begin delivery at the end of this year. The Air Force has had stealthy jets for decades, but even they have to turn on their lights when refueling in the sky. The KC-46's ability to gas up an aircraft in complete darkness is a first for any military. The new jet is part of a $44 billion program to begin replacing hundreds of the Air Force's KC-135 tankers, which have been flying since the Eisenhower Administration. Boeing showed off the new Pegasus for the first time in May, inside a hangar north of Seattle. Adapted from Boeing's twin-aisle 767, each matte gray KC-46 bristles with missile defenses, high definition cameras and infrared lights for flying under the cover of night. The military brass were skeptical that refueling in pitch black could be done at all. Boeing's chief test pilot for the Pegasus, Ron Johnson, said it took years to prove it was possible. Boeing and Air Force test pilots first used the KC-46 to perform a refueling in total darkness in December. The pilots switched off all visible lights and donned night vision goggles, and an enormous C-17 cargo plane crept up behind the KC-46. The pair linked up, and history was made. The KC-46 is designed for combat. Airmen can sprint to the jet and press a single button on its exterior to start its onboard power systems, bringing the aircraft to life. The crew ascends through a hatch underneath the jet's nose and is flying in 10 minutes. No stairs needed. A refueling boom pumps 1,200 gallons every minute to Air Force jets, enough to fill a passenger car in less than a second. Two underwing pods unfurl hoses to refuel Navy, Marine and allied jets with 400 gallons per minute. The KC-46 carries just shy of 32,000 gallons of gas. Pilots have been guiding tankers using a porthole view used for the last 60 years, but that's not so with the Pegasus. Instead, this jet has a high-tech workstation with high definition stereoscopic cameras that give a 185-degree view of everything between the wingtips. 3D glasses give the boom operator a perception of depth. The jet can operate around chemical and biological attacks and is designed to withstand the pulse of a nuclear blast. It has room for 114 troops, or 54 patients or 65,000 pounds of cargo. But the KC-46 is behind schedule and way over budget, according to the Government Accountability Office. Boeing was originally supposed to deliver the first 18 tankers by August, but that deadline has slipped and the GAO warns that additional delays are possible. Despite the cost overruns, the taypayer isn't on the hook. Boeing won the contract to develop the KC-46 at a fixed price of $4.9 billion, and is on the hook for any costs beyond that. The manufacturer has already had to write off $2 billion due to extensive changes it has to make in the 120 miles of wiring that each jet contains. Mike Gibbons, the 33-year Boeing veteran who quietly took over the KC-46 program last August, says the program is done with the expensive write offs. But Boeing and the Air Force said they're again reviewing the schedule. Still, Gibbons said in May he won't give the Air Force its jet unless it's ready. "Our number one goal is to make sure that we don't deliver aircraft until they are fully capable and they will require no [modifications] after they deliver," he said.

Boeing cancelled a planned announcement Thursday about Canada's plan to buy 18 of the jets amid a trade spat between Boeing and Canadian rival Bombardier. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) Murray Brewster Defence and security Murray Brewster is senior defence writer for CBC News, based in Ottawa. He has covered the Canadian military and foreign policy from Parliament Hill for over a decade. Among other assignments, he spent a total of 15 months on the ground covering the Afghan war for The Canadian Press. Prior to that, he covered defence issues and politics for CP in Nova Scotia for 11 years and was bureau chief for Standard Broadcast News in Ottawa.

"We have suspended discussions with Boeing and that is what we have decided," Steve MacKinnon, the parliamentary secretary for the public works minister, told reporters following a speech to defence contractors.   Last March, the federal government submitted a request to the Pentagon for a government-to-government purchase of 18 Super Hornets, on an urgent basis, to fulfil what the Liberals have claimed is a capability gap in the fighter jet fleet. As part of that request, National Defence and Public Works officials hold regular discussions with the aircraft-maker in order to iron out details and deliver the specific requirements of the Royal Canadian Air Force. It is those talks that have been suspended, according to MacKinnon. "There are lots of things we can talk to them about, but we have cut off those discussions," he said.  Sajjan blasts Boeing over trade spat with Bombardier Boeing says complaint aims to prevent larger CSeries The dispute, which had largely played out behind closed doors, spilled into the open Wednesday when Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan publicly called out Boeing in front of a room full of defence contractors over the company's commercial trade challenge involving Quebec-based Bombardier. The public rebuke prompted Boeing to scrap the planned unveiling of its Canadian industry partners for the Super Hornet program Thursday morning. The company cited the "current climate" for the decision. "It is not the most opportune time to share this good news story," said Boeing spokesman Scott Day in a statement, issued shortly before the briefing was to take place at an Ottawa defence industry trade show. Trade complaint Boeing has been engaged in a very public battle with Canada's Bombardier. The U.S. aircraft maker wants trade regulators in Washington to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft, claiming they allow the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. On Wednesday, Sajjan called on Boeing to halt its trade complaint against Bombardier. He also upped the ante in the Liberal government's threat to cancel the planned sole-source purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets by suggesting there were alternatives to the interim procurement. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner," Sajjan said. "Our government is of the view their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behaviour we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it." ​ Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan used his speech Wednesday at CANSEC to blast Boeing for its trade complaint against Quebec-based rival Bombardier. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) MacKinnon kept the pressure up on Thursday. "We certainly hope they'll reconsider their recent actions, which are not friendly and not in Canada's interests," he said.  Sajjan's office refused to comment on the matter Thursday. "Minister Sajjan's comments [Wednesday] speak for themselves and we do not have anything to add," Jordan Owens, the minister's spokesperson, said in an email. Canada had announced plans to buy 18 Super Hornet fighter jets as a stopgap measure to beef up its legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter jets, which were also produced by Boeing. Sajjan said at the time Canada didn't have enough jets to meet its Norad and NATO obligations. Boeing's commitment to Canada "has been, and remains, unwavering," Day said on Thursday. The company's operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country's aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. "Boeing has provided reliable solutions to Canada's defence and security needs, and we respect the mutual trust we have established with the Canadian Armed Forces through the successful execution of several key programs, including the CF-188 Hornet, CC-177 Globemaster III and CH-147 Chinook," Day said.

India is buying over 1,000 new planes – but can it handle them? Posted on Thursday, June 1, 2017 by CNN in Business News India is adding airline passengers faster than any other country, and it needs more planes to carry them: 1,080 more, to be precise. To meet exploding demand, the South Asian nation is set to to buy 2.2 new airplanes for each of the 480 aircraft currently in service, according to a new report by the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA). The U.S. and China are the only countries to have more pending aircraft orders, the report says. Boeing, one of the biggest potential beneficiaries of the massive spending spree, is equally optimistic. The manufacturer predicts India will need 1,850 new planes over the next two decades. It values the orders at $265 billion. The U.S. firm will reportedly agree in the coming weeks to sell 100 planes to Indian carrier Jet Airways. It is also a top contender to sell another 100 to the country’s newest airline, Vistara. Boeing is locked in a battle for India’s skies with European rival Airbus, which already has contracts with several Indian carriers. “We are in constant communications with the airlines in India about their current and future fleet needs,” a Boeing spokesperson said Thursday, while declining to comment on individual deals. The buying frenzy, led by budget airlines like SpiceJet and IndiGo, is not without reason. Around 220 million Indians flew last year — an annual increase of 20% — and the country is on track to overtake the U.K. as the world’s third-largest aviation market by 2026. But the race to capture that market is a slippery slope, and CAPA warned that airlines risk biting off more than they can chew. “Unprecedented expansion will place immense pressure on the aviation system,” the report said. “The industry currently appears to be underestimating the challenges ahead.” There are several examples in India’s aviation history that serve as a cautionary tale, with Kingfisher Airlines — the defunct carrier owned by beer baron Vijay Mallya — being the most recent example. National carrier Air India is also in a precarious position, and talks of offloading it into the private sector have gathered momentum in recent weeks. Another huge challenge is a lack of infrastructure. India’s aviation boom is severely threatened by the fact that only 75 of its 400 airports are currently operational — and even the biggest hubs like Mumbai, New Delhi and Chennai are bursting at the seams. With 700 of India’s 1,080 new planes set to be delivered within the next ten years, CAPA said the country’s lack of preparedness could quickly unravel the industry. “Aircraft induction on this scale will require massive infrastructure development, skilled resources … at a pace that has not been seen before in India,” the report said. “Parking bays and runway slots will become increasingly scarce over the next few years.” — Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.

This is the first Boeing contract award to COTESA. “We are committed to bringing opportunities to German companies from across the Boeing enterprise and will continue to strive to bring the best of Boeing to industry and the best of industry back into Boeing,” said Michael Hostetter, Defense, Space & Security director of Vertical Lift Programs, Germany. “As a leading production facility for specialty composite parts, COTESA’s expertise will support our efforts to enhance the Chinook helicopter and deliver top-quality, cost-effective solutions to our customers.” With this agreement, COTESA is joining Boeing’s already established supply chain in Germany, in addition to its global supply chain of more than 20,000 suppliers and partners around the globe. “The contract award to COTESA is a testament to the technology potential we see in Germany and another important milestone in our partnership with German industry,” said Sir Michael Arthur, president, Boeing Europe. “We are excited to join the Boeing supplier team.

Harjit Sajjan said Boeing’s action against Bombardier is “unfounded” and not the behaviour of a “trusted partner.” He said buying the Super Hornet fighter jets “requires a trusted industry partner.” Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada’s foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. “Our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners,” he said. Chicago-based Boeing’s trade complaint prompted a US. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier’s new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada’s threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the US. Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, noted that Sajjan also recognised Boeing as a strong partner in the past and for the future. Day defended the company’s trade action. “This is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues,” Day said in an email. Boeing petitioned the US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in “predatory pricing.” Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organisation over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier’s. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 per cent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada’s federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from US-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta. The Canadian government said late last year it would enter into discussions on buying 18 Super Hornet jet fighters from Boeing on an interim basis and hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years. Canada remains part of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme. Sajjan said he would have more to say about the issue next week.

Jack Boland/ Postmedia Jack Boland / Jack Boland/Toronto Sun Share Adjust Comment Print Boeing has postponed its Interim Fighter Capability Project industry teaming announcement that was supposed to be made on Thursday at CANSEC. “Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story,” Boeing noted in a statement. But it added, “Boeing’s commitment to Canada has been, and remains, unwavering.” On Wednesday at CANSEC, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan suggested Boeing could no longer be considered a trusted partner. Although Sajjan stopped short of cancelling the Liberal government’s plan to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighters from Boeing, Sajjan said the U.S. firm has damaged its relationship with Canada. Boeing has complained to the U.S. government that Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier is receiving subsidies, which in turn, allowed it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. Boeing convinced the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Bombardier. “It is not the behaviour of a trusted partner,” Sajjan told industry representatives Wednesday at the CANSEC defence trade show in Ottawa. He called on Boeing to withdraw its complaint. Sajjan said Canada requires “trusted industry partners.” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also recently chastened Boeing for its actions. But Sajjan’s dressing down of the company in such a high profile forum is considered by industry representatives as unprecedented. The Liberals are now reviewing the Super Hornet jet proposal and whether it should continue. In its statement Thursday, Boeing noted that, “The Canadian IFCP Super Hornet Team is bringing together a committed industry team with global supply chains, well established in-country presence, and complimentary capabilities, while leveraging 30+ years of legacy Classic Hornet activities in Canada,” Boeing noted.   Boeing Company Harjit Sajjan sponsored Super Hornet Discovery Air completes air-to-air training against Austrian Eurofighters Cost of Canadian Surface Combatant put at more than $61 billion...

Sadly, many will feel their options are limited and may believe they have no option but to settle for less than the job they dream of. Fortunately, there are options available: opportunities that can provide a springboard to something truly challenging and fulfilling. One example is Boeing’s [NYSE: BA] highly acclaimed six months International Business Internship Program (IBIP), which is now open to South African students in a business-related field. Tell a friend FILE - In this March 7, 2017, file photo, the first of the large Boeing 737 MAX 9 models, Boeing's newest commercial airplane, sits outside its production plant in Renton, Wash. Boeing stops test flights of its new 737 model because of a possible problem in engine discs. The company is working with engine maker CFM to investigate. The company said Wednesday, May 10, 2017, it was notified of a potential manufacturing-quality issue by CFM, which makes the engines that are going on the Boeing 737 Max. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) Full-time under-graduate and post-graduate students from South African universities and technical universities are encouraged to apply for the internship. Two students from Wits University are currently on the full-time program (Jan – July 2017). Registration for the next intake period (Jan –July 2018) is open from June the 6th to July the 15th 2017. Laila Zayan, Head of Talent Pipeline Development at Boeing, says the IBIP is open to all students studying in a business-related field including Industrial Engineering, Accounting, Finance, Human Resources, Marketing, Strategy, Management, and Information Systems. She says applicants must be enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program or have graduated within the last 12 months (applicants that graduated in May 2016 or earlier will NOT be considered).  Students must have excellent communications and interpersonal skills, be high achievers academically, demonstrate leadership and team work skills. J. Miguel Santos, Boeing Managing Director - Sub-Sahara Africa and Director of Commercial Airplane Sales for Africa based in Johannesburg, encouraged students to apply, saying it is a great bridge to the world of working. He cites is as a is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get real world exposure to a large multi-national corporation. “The students will be provided with US-based work experience and will prove extremely valuable when they return and invest their new skills to the benefit of South Africa. Having Boeing on your resume could be a launching pad for your future career.” The International Business Internship Program (IBIP), which was launched in 2012, provides students valuable exposure to the latest technological and business advances and thinking in a variety of disciplines relating to business operations, finance, marketing, strategy and the aviation industry.   The students will be exposed to a range of business activities and work alongside Boeing employees in various fields. They will also have an opportunity to spend time with Boeing leaders, visit several Boeing factories and share their experience with other IBIP interns from around the world. Zayan says interested students can apply through the career advice divisions of their respective universities who will be provided with information brochures.

Idaho Business Health Marijuana Nation World Photos Spokane Aerospace manufacturing a high-wage, growth industry for Spokane area UPDATED: Thu., June 1, 2017, 10:58 a.m. Matt Annis, a maintenance supervisor for Horizon Air, walks from a Horizon Air Q-400 turboprop airplane in February 2007 in Spokane. (Jed Conklin / The Spokesman-Review) By Becky Kramer beckyk@spokesman.com(509) 459-5466 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Aerospace manufacturing Jobs in Spokane County: 3,489 in 2016 Average wage: $73,446 Companies with aerospace-related sales: 101 Aerospace manufacturing is a growing, high-wage industry in Eastern Washington and North Idaho, and one that local business leaders want to continue to nurture. More than 200 Eastern Washington companies make parts for commercial and military aircraft, primarily in Spokane and the Tri-Cities. Across the border in Idaho, another 60 companies have ties to aerospace. “We paint planes. We rerun the brakes … We make seat cushions,” said Doug Tweedy, regional labor economist with the Washington Employment Security Division. “We don’t actually build the planes, but we put components into them.” Some of the locally made parts end up in Boeing’s planes, but Boeing isn’t the only game in town, Tweedy said. Other components end up in aircraft manufactured by Boeing competitor Airbus or Bombardier of Canada, or as custom decor for high-end private jets. And there is one local airplane manufacturer: Quest Aircraft of Sandpoint, which makes a 10-seat turboprop plane called the Kodiak. The industry pumps tens of millions of dollars into the local economy through purchases and wages. In Idaho, aerospace manufacturing jobs pay an average of $60,000 annually. In Spokane County, the average is around $73,500. “It’s a high-wage, high-growth sector,” said Sam Wolkenhauer, a regional economist for the Idaho Department of Labor. For airline parts suppliers, there’s more growth on the horizon, said John Byrne, Boeing’s vice president of airplane materials and structures. Byrne was the keynote speaker at Wednesday’s I-90 Corridor Aerospace Conference & Expo at the Coeur d’Alene Resort, which drew about 200 industry representatives. The conference was organized by the Inland Northwest Aerospace Consortium and Idaho Aerospace Alliance. Over the next 20 years, about 40,000 new airplanes will be needed to keep pace with global demand for air travel. The value of those orders is about $5.9 trillion, Bryne said. Much of the growth is coming from industrializing nations, where middle-class residents can now afford air travel. At Boeing, one out of every three 737s rolling off the assembly line is headed to China. “India is next,” Bryne said. The 20-year forecast calls for 4 percent annual growth in global passenger travel, he said. However, another industry trend is the cost-savvy traveler, who’s looking for the lowest-priced plane ticket. The quest for low fares puts pressure on airplane manufacturers to constantly increase quality and output while lowering production costs, Bryne said. That push for cost savings gets passed on to Boeing’s suppliers, he said. “The supply chain feels the brunt of most of this,” he said. In Spokane County, about 3,500 people work in aerospace manufacturing, said Tweedy, the labor economist. Some of the larger aerospace manufacturers are Kaiser Aluminum, which rolls aluminum for airplanes as part of its product mix, and Triumph Group, which makes floor panels and ducting. Others include Exotic Metals, UTC Aerospace Systems and Aerospace Coatings. Overall, Spokane County has 101 companies that make parts for airplanes. However, only nine companies are considered “direct suppliers,” which means that 50 percent or more of their business is tied to aerospace, Tweedy said. Finding skilled labor is an upcoming challenge for the local aerospace industry, said Wolkenhauer, the Idaho Department of Labor economist. North Idaho College is working to increase the labor pool through its Aerospace Center, which offers classes in areas such as aviation maintenance, composites and advanced manufacturing. However, demand for skilled labor is expected to grow faster than the number of qualified workers. “The No. 1 constraint (on future growth) is the labor supply,” Wolkenhauer said.

EARNS-UBER Uber posts $708M loss as revenue grows; finance head quits HONG KONG (AP) — Ride-hailing giant Uber has reported another multibillion dollar loss even as its revenues grow. The San Francisco-based company said Thursday that its losses in the first quarter narrowed to $708 million from $991 million in the previous three-month period. Uber told The Associated Press that it had $3.4 billion in revenue for the period, 18 percent higher than the final three months of last year. The company is not publicly listed but has been mulling an IPO. It said in a statement “the narrowing of our losses in the first quarter puts us on a good trajectory towards profitability.” The company also said its head of finance, Gautam Gupta, is departing, becoming the latest high profile executive to leave amid a string of troubles facing the company. PUERTO RICO-ECONOMIC CRISIS Puerto Rico budget unveils tax breaks, protects pensions SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico’s governor has unveiled a budget that promises tax breaks, sets aside more than $400 million for debt service and guarantees $2 billion in pension payments amid a deep economic crisis. The proposed $9.56 billion budget is more than a half million dollars larger than last year’s. Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Wednesday that for the first time in recent history the budget would be truly balanced. The U.S. territory is struggling to emerge from a 10-year recession that has prompted more than a half million Puerto Ricans to flee to the U.S. mainland. Rossello’s administration is now is in the midst of restructuring a portion of a $73 billion public debt load through a bankruptcy-like process in federal court. CANADA-BOEING Canada’s defense minister threatens Boeing deal in speech TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s defense minister is repeating a threat to cancel the purchase of 18 fighter jets from Boeing Co. because of the company’s trade complaint against Canadian plane maker Bombardier. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said Wednesday that Boeing’s action against Bombardier is “unfounded” and “not the behavior of a trusted partner.” He says buying the Super Hornet fighter jets “requires a trusted industry partner.” Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint. Canada’s foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. Boeing’s trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier’s new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada’s threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with America. KUSHNER-INVESTMENT VISAS Kushners used creative mapmaking to gain visa-tied funds NEW YORK (AP) — The Kushner Cos. engaged in a bit of creative mapmaking to qualify one of its buildings in a booming New Jersey waterfront neighborhood across from Manhattan for a federal visa-for-investment program targeting struggling areas. Emails obtained by The Associated Press show that the family of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner placed its 65 Bay Street building in Jersey City in a map stringing together three dozen other areas, some with high unemployment. The map was included in a 2015 application to the EB-5 visa program that allows overseas investors to obtain temporary U.S. residency in exchange for investments of $500,000 or more in areas with high unemployment. DENVER DRONE DOUGHNUTS Doughnut delivery by drone in Denver is a peek at the future DENVER (AP) — Doughnuts have been delivered by drone to Denver’s mayor and the city’s police and fire departments. The event provided a glimpse into what companies hope will be a quick, inexpensive way to get merchandise to customers. Denver’s LaMar’s Donuts hired Austin, Texas-based company Drone Dispatch to deliver four boxes of doughnuts Wednesday using piloted drones flown from parking lots within a block of the delivery target Wednesday. LaMar’s spokesman Tami Osifodunrin said Federal Aviation Administration regulations prohibit commercial drone pilots from losing sight of drones. The FAA said in a statement it is investigating to ensure the deliveries followed rules governing commercial drone use in populated areas. Amazon and other companies are testing autonomous drones for deliveries. Drone maker Flirtey last year began limited deliveries for 7-Eleven in Reno, Nevada. JAPAN-ROCKET-GPS Japan launches rocket with satellite to build its own GPS TOKYO (AP) — Japan is building its own GPS in hopes of reducing location errors for drivers, drone operators and other users. A rocket launched Thursday from southern Japan is carrying a satellite that will form part of a Japanese GPS. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries plan to launch two more satellites by next spring to complete the system. Japan currently relies on an American GPS. Having its own system is expected to reduce location errors in Japan to a few centimeters (inches) from as much as 10 meters (30 feet) by some estimates. The more accurate information could be used for both driving and drone deliveries. Japanese media report it also may enhance the country’s defense capabilities. WILDERNESS MINE Federal judge overturns approvals for proposed Montana mine HELENA, Mont. (AP) — A federal judge has overturned government agency approvals to develop a copper and silver mine in a Montana wilderness area, saying the decisions violated laws meant to protect threatened grizzly bears, bull trout and their habitat. U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy ruled Tuesday the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must reconsider their findings related to the Montanore Mine in Kootenai National Forest. Molloy said it made no sense for the wildlife service to say the project would not harm grizzlies and bull trout. The mine was proposed by Coeur d’Alene, Idaho-based Hecla. Company officials have said they spent about $46 million to bring the project into compliance. A public information officer with the Kootenai National Forest said the agency was reviewing the decision and could not yet comment.

Harjit Sajjan said Boeing’s action against Bombardier is “unfounded” and not the behavior of a “trusted partner.” He said buying the Super Hornet fighter jets “requires a trusted industry partner.” Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada’s foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. “Our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners,” he said. Chicago-based Boeing’s trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier’s new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada’s threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the U.S. Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, noted that Sajjan also recognized Boeing as a strong partner in the past and for the future. Day defended the company’s trade action. “This is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues,” Day said in an email. Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in “predatory pricing.” Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier’s. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada’s federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta. The Canadian government said late last year it would enter into discussions on buying 18 Super Hornet jet fighters from Boeing on an interim basis and hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years.

Dave Majumdar May 31, 2017 TweetShareShare The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstrated the ability to intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) using Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptors for the first time during a live test on May 30. According to the MDA, the test looks likely to have been a success—though the agency will have to analyze the data to be sure. During the test, a roughly five-foot long Raytheon-built exo-atmospheric kill vehicle slammed head-on directly into an ICBM-class test target that was launched from the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (in the Pacific). The U.S. Air Force’s 30th Space launched the interceptor missile Wing from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. "The intercept of a complex, threat-representative ICBM target is an incredible accomplishment for the GMD system and a critical milestone for this program," MDA Director Vice Adm. Jim Syring said in a statement. "This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat. I am incredibly proud of the warfighters who executed this test and who operate this system every day." The MDA notes that intercepting the Orbital-built ICBM target required precise coordination from multiple sensors across the globe.  Northrop Grumman’s sophisticated Command, Control, Battle Management and Communication (C2BMC) system integrated data from Raytheon’s forward deployed AN/TPY-2 and the Sea-Based X-band radar—positioned in the Pacific Ocean— to develop target tracking data and a fire control solution to intercept the target. Boeing, which is the prime contractor for the overall GMD system, was thrilled with the results of the test—which pave the way for expanding the expansion of the entire construct. “This successful test keeps the United States on track for a significant increase in interceptor inventory of 44 in 2017,” Norm Tew, Boeing’s vice president and GMD program director said. “In addition, the GMD program remains on track to evolve and modernize this crucial national defense asset in the face of an evolving threat environment, with system upgrades and future technology including the Boeing-led Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV).” The MDA cautions that data from the test still has to be analyzed to be sure that the intercept worked properly. “Initial indications are that the test met its primary objective, but program officials will continue to evaluate system performance based upon telemetry and other data obtained during the test,” the MDA states. Altogether, the test cost roughly $244 million. Though the test has been portrayed as a signal to North Korea, in reality it was a happy coincidence—the intercept test has long been in the works. The MDA argues that the GMD was tested in an operationally setting against a target—complete with decoys—representative of a threat well into the 2020s. “This did represent a very real operational scenario in the Pacific,” Syring told reporters at the Pentagon on May 31. However, critics contend that the GMD system—as it currently stands—has not demonstrated the ability to intercept a real ICBM under wartime conditions. In fact, such a capability is a long way off. Indeed, according to the GAO, the MDA won’t even test the system in the rain. “Not even close,” Jeffrey Lewis, Director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey told The National Interest. “It's a nice baby step.” Even if the MDA conducted tests under realistic conditions, the program is still essentially a research and development program in many ways. The agency—which is not part of any military service—does not have a strategy or doctrine on how to use the system operationally. “The MDA is still running a technology development program and hasn't really thought about transitioning it to an credible operational capability, despite their silly pronouncements to the contrary,” Lewis said. Moreover, in Lewis’ view, nor does the MDA have the capacity to transition the GMD into a genuine operational capability to defend the United States. “I don't think MDA has the capacity, no. I would return the mission to the services,” Lewis said. “Basically, we should treat missile defense like any other defense program. If it provides a cost-effective military benefit, great.  If not, spend the money on something that does.” Pages 1 2 next › last » TweetShareShare Show full page View the discussion thread.

Harjit Sajjan said Boeing’s action against Bombardier is “unfounded” and not the behavior of a “trusted partner.” He said buying the Super Hornet fighter jets “requires a trusted industry partner.” Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada’s foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. “Our government – and I stress this – our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners,” he said. Register now to learn how DHS and Commerce are implementing CDM strategies. Advertisement Chicago-based Boeing’s trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier’s new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada’s threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the U.S. Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, noted that Sajjan also recognized Boeing as a strong partner in the past and for the future. Day defended the company’s trade action. “This is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues,” Day said in an email. Boeing petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in “predatory pricing.” Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier’s. Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada’s federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta. The Canadian government said late last year it would enter into discussions on buying 18 Super Hornet jet fighters from Boeing on an interim basis and hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years. Canada remains part of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Sajjan said he would have more to say about the issue next week.

The Pentagon wants to get a head start on the jet that will eventually replace the US Air Force C-32A, the Boeing 757 jets calibrated for flying the vice president and other senior level government officials, Defense One reported. © AP Photo/ Andrew Harnik Problems With Air Force One Mark 'Very Serious Blow to Boeing's Reputation' Longer flying range, more seats, a new private office and “enhanced senior leader communications” are a few of the items on the wish list for the next Air Force Two, which a new $6 million program office will seek to deliver, the budget request states. The “doomsday” fleet of four Pentagon-altered 747s strengthen communications abilities in times of nuclear war and function as a flying executive command and control room. The new budget integrates two worst-case scenario jet programs, the doomsday plane and the Navy’s E-6 Mercury, into one program dubbed the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SOAC).  SOAC hopes to score $7.8 million to explore new aircraft to replace aging doomsday aircraft.   Air Force Two and Air Force One are supposed to serve the presidents at any time needed, especially in the event of nuclear war. Preparing the planes for atomically induced chaos is why some aerospace analysts argue Boeing’s $3.2-$4 billion new Air Force One is magnitudes costlier than the 747’s commercial price of $378.5 million.  © AP Photo/ Cliff Owen Boeing Pays Tab on $4M Damage to POTUS’ Air Force One After Dangerous Mistake The hope is to “better align” the next generations of Air Force One and Air Force Two, according to the Pentagon. By making a more “robust” Air Force Two, the government says it could “mitigate many capability gaps that exist when the current C-32A aircraft serve as a backup to VC-25A [the current 747 available for the president]” and the new Air Force One.  Boeing swallowed a $4 million expense for mechanical mishaps rendering the POTUS’ personal jet susceptible to fire.  ...

A budget request for $259 million aims to speed up the development of the technology, and see it achieve ‘demonstrated capability’ by 2025, five years earlier than previously estimated. It comes as North Korea is thought to be working on decoy-firing missiles, but officials say the move is not in response to any specific threats, according to Defense One. Scroll down for video  The Pentagon has accelerated its plans to develop a Multi-Object Kill Vehicle – a warhead interceptor that can take out a missile and its decoys at the same time. A concept photo of the technology is pictured WHAT IS THE MOKV?  The Multi-Object Kill Vehicle would be able to take out several incoming warheads, or a warhead along with any decoys it releases - all at the same time. The ‘rational behind the Multi-Object Kill Vehicle program,’ is that ‘the more kill vehicles we can put on an interceptor, the greater raid capacity our Ground-based Midcourse Defense system will have,’ the Missile Defense Agency explained in a proposal last year. This technology could ultimately ‘revolutionize our missile defense architecture.’ ‘We have accelerated MOKV risk reduction and product development phases to achieve a demonstrated capability in the 2025 timeframe,’ an official from the Missile Defense Agency told Defense One in an email. It’s ‘not in response to any specific intelligence, but to stay ahead of potential future threats,’ the official said. The MDA awarded a $58.6 million, 35-month contract to Boeing last month to demonstrate the technology. This type of 'kill vehicle' would be able to take out several threats at a time - be it several warheads, or a warhead and its decoys, according to Defense One.   Just days ago, the Pentagon tested a Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptor at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The technology was used to disable a mock intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launched above the Pacific Ocean. Footage of the test, which was hailed a success, reveals the moment the interceptor roared toward the fake warhead, before colliding into it in a flash of light and heat.

According to Boeing, the MOKB will increase the ability of interceptors to spot missiles heading toward the US, and destroy them mid-air. ‘Our MOKV concept gives the Missile Defense Agency flexibility in eliminating threats more efficiently and affordably,’ said Paul Geery, vice president, Mission Solutions, Phantom Works. ‘We’ve created a robust, resilient design that benefits from our extensive experience in advanced seekers.’ Read more: Pentagon Accelerates Work on Multi-Warhead Interceptor - Defense One www.mda.mil/glob...

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

(FSLR) Stock Is Going to $50 Is GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Headed Back to the High Road? View All Posts With some 44% returns in the past year, Chicago-based Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) continues to be a remarkable turnaround story. But with Dow component up some 20% year-to-date, there is now fear that BA stock has peaked. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr But it would be a mistake to part with this winner, especially given that defense spending was one of only three areas in President Trump’s budget proposal to see an increase. And plus, not only is Boeing coming off a solid first-quarter earnings beat, the world’s biggest plane-maker is posting higher cash flow, which should support Boeing’s buyback program and its increases in the dividend, which already yields a robust 3.05%. With these factors in mind, BA stock should reach $200 in the next 12 to 18 months. Reasons to Love BA Stock Boeing’s attractive combination of income and value should keep BA stock flying high for much of 2017. The company just raised its full-year earnings-per-share forecast to a range of $10.35 to $10.55 from a prior range of $10.25 to $10.45 per share. The company also raised its adjusted full-year outlook to $9.20 to $9.40 from a prior range of $9.10 to $9.30. Revenue is expected to range from $90.5 billion to $92.5 billion. The company has already announced 198 net orders for first quarter, compared to just 121 last year. And the fact that Boeing believes it can achieve its delivery goals on a lower engineering headcount means more profits will trickle down to the bottom line. Why is the order inflow metric important? Boeing has begun to trim its headcount to offset declining revenue, which in the first-quarter declined 7.2% year-over-year to $20.98 billion, missing consensus estimates of $21.34 billion. In other words, the company needs to sell more plans to meet its profitability goals. And that’s what BA stock investors have come to understand. The fact that president Donald Trump’s administration continues to tout increased defense spending should bode well for aerospace and defense. The White House’s just-released $4.1 trillion budget proposal calls for an additional $25 billion in defense spending for next fiscal year, following a similar bump in the current budget. And to say nothing about the existing number of contracts Boeing already has with the Pentagon. Most recently, the company secured a $983 million deal from the U.S. Air Force to provide engineering support services. Boeing also won a modification foreign military sales contract valued at $488.1 million from the U.S. Army to re-manufacture 38 AH-64 Apache aircraft.

Available exclusively through Marsh, AFIC provides an alternative aircraft finance insurance product for new aircraft deliveries and is underwritten by four leading global insurance companies: Allianz, AXIS Capital, Sompo International (formerly Endurance), and Fidelis, said Marsh in a statement. The AFIC structure has already been used by a major international airline to support its financing of new Boeing 747 and 787 aircraft, the broker added. “AFIC can assist airlines globally in obtaining more efficient financing by utilizing insurance to protect the lender’s exposure to default for the duration of the loan,” Marsh explained, noting that the terms of this product can be tailored according to the individual purchase agreements made between Boeing, the airline and its financiers. “We believe that AFIC is a significant development in airline financing globally and will contribute to the growth and diversification of aircraft finance,” said Bruce Fine, global leader of AFIC for Marsh. “AFIC offers Boeing customers a wider range of financing options to facilitate the purchase of newer, more efficient aircraft to enhance their fleets, and lenders will be able to conduct new transactions with greater confidence,” he added.

CNBC Here's how much we've spent in Apple's App Store Apple today revealed how much developers have earned through the App Store, and from this figure we can glean just how much users have spent on apps over the years. Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases. Apple didn't stop with an earnings number boast as it also revealed App Store downloads grew by over 70% in the past 12 months, and active paid subscriptions are up 58% since the same time last year.

The Wall Street Journal.3:51 UP NEXT Stocks rose to record levels Friday as Wall Street shrugged off a jobs report that came in well below expectations. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 190.23 +2.91 +1.55% CME Group Inc CME ▼ 116.93 -0.89 -0.76% Charles Schwab Corp SCHW ▼ 38.95 -0.75 -1.89% AdChoices The Dow closed 62 points higher, with Boeing contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 also managed a new all-time high, ending 0.37 percent higher. The Nasdaq outperformed, rising 0.94 percent to a record high. "This was the closest thing to a nonresponse you're going to see," said Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management. "This isn't a report that warrants a strong response in financial markets and I don't think you're going to get one." The Labor Department said 138,000 jobs were created last month, well below the expected 185,000. Wages also grew less than expected, with average hourly earnings rising at a 2.5 percent annualized rate. The unemployment rate, however, fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent. "There are some sectors in the jobs market that are seeing strong wage growth and others that aren't," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. "I think that's reflective of the tightness seen in some sectors. Chamberlain also noted the U.S. economy has added jobs for 80 straight months now, the longest positive streak dating back to the 1930s. "It's hard to ignore the the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected and, more importantly, the number came in below the 12-month average of 181,000," said Sharon Stark, managing director of fixed income strategies at Incapital. Investors eagerly awaited the report as it is one of the last major data sets released before the Federal Reserve holds its June monetary policy meeting. Market expectations for a rate hike were near 94 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "The fall in job growth numbers may make some query the likelihood of a rate rise next month, however, one slightly disappointing month does not constitute a wholesale change in fortunes," said Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, in a note. "This is not so much a downward trend away from the strong jobs market but merely a temporary blip on the radar," Samra said. Treasury yields fell on the back of the jobs number, with the benchmark 10-year yield slipping to 2.16 percent; it also hit its lowest level since May 18 earlier in the session. The dollar also dropped against a batch of major currencies, with the dollar index slipping 0.43 percent to 96.78. In turn, the euro rose 0.53 percent to $1.127 against the U.S. currency.

The service’s biggest unmet requirement is $2.7 billion to acquire 24 more planes, including 10 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet strike fighters, six P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft — both made by Boeing — four Lockheed Martin-made F-35C Joint Strike Fighters and four CMV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, made by Bell and Boeing. The 48-item list, sent to lawmakers May 30, asks for a total of $4.8 billion for weapons, equipment, operations and maintenance and development efforts not included in the Navy’s $171.5 billion fiscal 2018 budget, which was released last month. ADVERTISEMENT The document does not include any ships, an unexpected development as the Navy has called for expanding the fleet to 355 vessels. A larger Navy fleet was a top defense issue for President Trump on the campaign trail. Several lawmakers have pressed for an additional littoral combat ships (LCS) in the budget — the Navy’s 2018 request only includes one — and the acting Navy acquisition chief, Allison Stiller, said last month that the White House is “supportive” of buying two ships.  The unfunded list does include $84 million for LCS lethality and survivability upgrades, $31 million to develop an over-the-horizon capability for the ships and $110 million for the Navy’s new LCS training facility at Naval Station Mayport in Florida. The list also include $312 million to buy five Textron-made ship-to-shore connectors. Congress asks for unfunded lists from each service on an annual basis. The documents help guide lawmakers as they work through the budget requests and form policy and spending bills.   View the discussion thread.

The new aircraft with its three-class configuration commenced operating on the sector effective today, Jet Airways in a statement said.

"The deployment of the largest aircraft in its fleet will also allow Jet Airways to offer significantly larger cargo capacity, providing more flexibility in transporting various types of consignments, including perishables, pharmaceuticals, machinery and industrial goods between Delhi and Singapore," it said.

The Norwegian boss believes their vested interest in preserving status quo in transatlantic travel drove the long-established transatlantic airlines to try to suppress low-cost routes such as those now offered by his airline from Ireland. Until last December, Norwegian Air was entangled in a two-year stalemate with the US Department of Transportation over the airline's efforts to begin offering services between Ireland and the US. American politicians and unions consistently called on the government to deny Norwegian Air the necessary licenses to fly between the two countries and questioned the legitimacy of the Irish-based subsidiary Norwegian Air International, dubbing it a “flag of convenience.” The unions also claimed that Norwegian Air established the Irish subsidiary in order “to use flight crews employed under contracts governed by the laws of various Asian countries, including Singapore and Thailand.” The airline blasted this claim as fear-mongering and denied that employees would be sourced from Asia. “They hate competition. They hate low fares. Politicians shouldn’t listen to them. They should listen to consumers,” Kjos stated. The decision to award a foreign carrier permit to Norwegian Air International came in December 2016, more than two years after the airline had first applied. The US Department of Transportation issued a tentative decision last April granting the license, but pushback from US unions and politicians caused further delays. The European Commission had already officially begun arbitration proceedings against the United States government when the decision to grant the license was announced late last year. The Commission believed the delay in granting the license was a breach of the Open Skies Agreement, a US-EU treaty that allows EU-registered airlines to fly to the US from anywhere in Europe. Read more: Large majority of Irish support Norwegian Air Cork to US flight plans Unions continued to fight the decision into the new year, however, calling on then President-elect Trump to overturn the transportation department’s approval of the routes. “The new administration should immediately move to reverse the DOT’s decision regarding Norwegian Air International and revoke or suspend the foreign air carrier permit,” stated the US Air Line Pilots’ Association, reiterating again their claim that employees would be brought in by Norwegian Air under Asian contracts. Speaking in London this week, Kjos said that these groups are not taking the wishes of customers into consideration, also casting doubt on what he calls the “legacy” airlines’ ability to create low-cost transatlantic fares. “The consumer is always right. They want to travel for low fares and spend their money in the US or Europe. Don’t listen to groups who are trying to preserve an old-fashioned regime. “You don’t get a low-cost airline by painting the aircraft. A lot of carriers have tried that in the past. It doesn’t work,” he continued, referring to the recent establishment of Level, a subsidiary of IAG flying transatlantic from Barcelona using Iberia flight crew. Norwegian Air initially submitted their foreign carrier permit application hoping to be the first to offer transatlantic flights from Cork airport, a service they felt was greatly missing, and one that was welcomed by many in Ireland. Due to the delays in acquiring their license, Norwegian Air was beaten to the post by Icelandic low-budget carrier Wow Air. Wow Air announced flights between Cork and Reykjavik from where passengers could transfer to the airline's low-cost flights to the US. Norwegian Air was still the first to offer a direct flight from Cork Airport to the US, however. Read more: Norwegian Air sells a record 5,000 seats to Ireland in six hours Norwegian Air International will now fly from Belfast, Cork, Shannon, and Dublin to Providence Rhode Island, which is near Boston, Hartford, Connecticut; and Stewart International at Newburgh, NY, which is, about 90 minutes by road from New York City. While these are not major airports, Kjos explains that they were chosen in order to cut costs for the customer while still offering up to 24 flights to/from the US each week.   “It has incredibly low operating costs. We fly it into very low-cost airports. Then you are not paying heavy charges, so we can offer the tickets for much, much less,” Kjos said. Passengers can expect prices to average $300 to $350 round-trip, Lars Sande, senior vice president of sales at Norwegian told the Boston Herald.   A record 5,000 seats were sold by Norwegian Air within six hours in February 2017 when they first announced their new services between Ireland and America. Fares are advertised as fares as available for as little as $300 round trip, but, some passengers were disappointed with the additional costs, such as checking a bag, that are not included in the quoted price. Passengers will face additional fees for checked luggage ($45 for the first bag, $50 for a second), meal service including alcoholic beverages ($30) and a reserved specific seat ($30). They can also pay a $70 bundled fee for a checked bag, meal and specific seat or they can go without any amenities, food, and no checked bag, only hand baggage.

Edmonton Journal Editorial Board More from Edmonton Journal Editorial Board Published on: June 2, 2017 | Last Updated: June 2, 2017 6:00 AM MDT B.C. NDP leader John Horgan and B.C. Green party leader Andrew Weaver sign an agreement on creating a stable minority government during a press conference in the Hall of Honour at Legislature in Victoria, B.C., on Tuesday, May 30, 2017. CHAD HIPOLITO / THE CANADIAN PRESS Share Adjust Comment Print Like a big brother pulling bullies off of baby sister on the playground, the Trudeau government jumped headlong into a couple of cross-border trade scraps this week. For a softwood lumber industry under threat by a protectionist Donald Trump, the Liberals unveiled an $867-million aid package, including loans and loan guarantees for forestry firms and agreements to limit job losses. Ottawa is easing the pain for forestry companies whose bottom lines are now being gnawed at by countervailing U.S. duties applied April 28. And three months after lending Bombardier $372.5-million in its latest government cash infusion, the feds came out swinging against rival aircraft maker Boeing. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan wielded Ottawa’s purchase of Boeing fighter jets like a multibillion-dollar blackjack to persuade the company to drop its trade complaint against the Montreal firm. Nice Super Hornets you got here. Wouldn’t want anything to happen to them. Given these freshly minted precedents of federal intervention, is it too much to hope the government will focus those instincts toward Alberta’s oilpatch, once the country’s economic engine, now sputtering because of depressed crude prices and lack of overseas market access?  Despite tens of thousands of lost jobs, a hobbled economy and drained government coffers, Ottawa has not rushed to help Alberta as swiftly as previous regimes have rescued, say, Ontario’s auto industry in 2009 with a $9-billion bailout — not that the oilpatch has ever asked. The best the Trudeau government has done to assist Alberta’s energy industry was to sign off on Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain and Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline projects, and only after lengthy and exhaustive approval processes and hard-won social licence gained through the pain of Notley government’s climate plan. But the Edmonton-to-Burnaby Trans Mountain project is now threatened by the anti-oil axis of British Columbia’s NDP and Green parties — who sit on the other extreme of the political spectrum from Trump — but are ideologues all the same when it comes to their indifference to the practical realities of managing an economy, providing jobs, reducing interprovincial trade barriers and keeping capital from fleeing the market. To his credit, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reiterated his support for Trans Mountain but unlike standing up to trade foes in foreign countries, he risks a political firestorm in B.C. if he wields both his suasion and the legal powers at his disposal to see the Trans Mountain project through. Time will tell whether his government has the backbone to stand by a project that’s in the best interests of Canada when the fight gets really tough.

2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ViaSat Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT), a global broadband services and technology company, is pleased to announce the successful launch of its ViaSat-2 satellite aboard an Arianespace Ariane 5 ECA launch vehicle. The Ariane 5 ECA carrying ViaSat-2 lifted off yesterday, June 1 at 4:45 pm PDT from the Guiana Space Center, located in Kourou, French Guiana. Approximately 29 minutes after liftoff, the ViaSat-2 mission was underway with the satellite separating from the launch vehicle. First signals from the satellite were acquired shortly thereafter through a ground station at Hassan, India. In the coming days, ViaSat-2 will start orbit raising with its chemical propulsion system, followed by solar array deployments, and will then switch over to its electric propulsion system to complete orbit raising over the coming months. ViaSat expects it will take several months for ViaSat-2 to reach its final orbital destination, located at 69.9° west longitude.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Qatar Airways to offer Inmarsat inflight Broadband Qatar Airways to offer next generation Inmarsat GX Aviation in-flight broadband service   Five star onboard wi-fi for five star global airline Qatar Airways   First Middle East airline to announce selection of best-in-market solution, which will be offered to passengers on board its flagship aircraft   2 June 2017: Inmarsat (ISAT.L), the world’s leading provider of global mobile satellite communications, announced today that Qatar Airways has become the first Middle East megacarrier to select its advanced new GX Aviation in-flight broadband solution.   In a landmark agreement, the next-generation service will initially be available to Qatar Airways passengers on board more than 130 aircraft, consisting of Airbus A350s and Boeing 777s.   GX Aviation technology has already been equipped on Qatar Airways’ latest Airbus A350s; installations on the airline’s remaining Airbus A350s, together with the Boeing 777s, will commence on a retrofit basis from this summer.   GX Aviation is the world’s first in-flight connectivity solution with reliable, seamless high-speed global coverage provided through a single operator. It allows airline passengers to browse the internet, stream videos, check social media and more during flights, with an on board connectivity experience on par with broadband services available on the ground.   Leo Mondale, President of Inmarsat Aviation, said: „Qatar Airways is one of the world’s most successful, fastest growing and in-demand airlines, with an unwavering focus on providing the best service possible. It has offered Inmarsat’s SwiftBroadband connectivity solution for over five years now. However, with our next generation GX Aviation service now live, its upgrade to true broadband on more than 130 aircraft initially will ensure passengers have access to consistent, reliable and high-speed connectivity wherever they fly.   „Qatar Airways considered all available options in the connectivity market and selected Inmarsat due to our unique infrastructure, proven aerospace partners, and committed long-term development strategy. Broadband transformation on the ground is already well advanced and we are able to transfer that into the very challenging in-flight environment, working with Qatar Airways to make connectivity a success. Our networks are engineered with multiple layers for redundancy and global coverage. Our design philosophy is to scale up capacity over time to fit the route systems of our airline customers and reflect the industry’s real needs.”   Qatar Airways’ rollout of GX Aviation-equipped aircraft is scheduled to commence this summer. The service will integrate with Qatar Airways’ award-winning in-flight entertainment system and ensure that connectivity initiatives, such as its passenger app and aircraft technology, will be strengthened using dependable in-flight broadband. GX Aviation also complements the airline’s latest passenger experience innovations, including its unique and revolutionary new Qsuite premium travel experience.   His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, said: „Qatar Airways prides itself on assessing and understanding the latest market innovations, demonstrating over and over again our ability to ride and guide trends in passenger preferences. By partnering with Inmarsat, we are confident that Qatar Airways will meet the highest expectations in the industry for in-flight broadband services, and avail of the many other new opportunities powered by connectivity.”   Qatar Airways will connect to the GX network using exclusive high-efficiency JetWave terminals produced by Inmarsat partner Honeywell Aerospace. The terminals are designed for ease of installation and maintenance to assure the lowest downtime for any cabin connectivity solution in the market.   The selection of GX Aviation follows a separate announcement that Qatar Airways has activated an advanced new space-based system, supplied by Inmarsat, to track all of its flights across the world. Inmarsat worked exclusively with Qatar Airways to develop this cutting-edge solution, which utilises Inmarsat’s market-leading satellite technology to provide the exact real-time location of the airline’s aircraft in latitude and longitude.   ENDS     Investors                                                      Media Rob Gurner                                           Jonathan Sinnatt (Corporate Communications) +44 (0)20 7728 1518                             +44 (0)20 7728 1935 Rob.gurner@inmarsat.com                      jonathan.sinnatt@inmarsat.com                                                            Robeel Haq (Inmarsat Aviation)                                                           +44 (0)20 7728 1352                                                           robeel.haq@inmarsat.com     About Inmarsat Inmarsat plc is the leading provider of global mobile satellite communications services.

A decision on the new timeline is “urgent” and could be reached by September, according to an internal video presentation by Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr. The German airline may take additional Airbus SE A350 planes, which carry fewer passengers than the 400-seat Boeing jet. “I’m not sure if we’ve really ordered enough A350s and possibly too many 777Xs,” Spohr said at a staff meeting, a replay of which was seen by Bloomberg. “We must now think about either stretching the 777X in a deal with Boeing to let them come in more slowly, or increasing profitability to finance our overdue fleet investments.” The move would be a blow to Boeing, which signed up Lufthansa as a launch customer for the 777X. The Chicago-based company has a backlog for the model worth about US$125 billion (RM535 billion) at list prices, with orders concentrated among airlines that have hit market turbulence recently. Carriers in the Persian Gulf, where low oil prices are damping economies and sapping demand for travel, account for more than three-quarters of the 306 orders. Deliveries for the 777X — a new version of Boeing’s existing 777 aircraft that will be the industry’s largest-ever twin-engine jetliner — are due to start in 2020. Lufthansa spokesman Andreas Bartels said reviewing the order book is daily business for any airline and that the company won’t comment on internal discussions. Boeing shares fell 0.3 per cent to US$187 at 1.05pm in New York. That pared the stock’s gain this year to 20 per cent, valuing the manufacturer at US$113 billion. Demand for big twin-aisle aircraft has weakened since Lufthansa placed an order for the Boeing model in 2013, under Spohr’s predecessor. Cheaper fuel and an industrywide glut of smaller, relatively young wide-body planes have upended the economics that had favored larger models for long-range flying. Slowing output Any deferrals or cancellations would add to concerns about the future of the 777, Boeing’s second-largest source of profit. The US manufacturer is slowing production of current versions as it encounters weaker sales and prepares to build test planes for the next-generation variant, Boeing’s most expensive commercial plane. Boeing spokesman Daniel Mosely declined to comment on potential talks with Lufthansa. The airline, which has its main hubs in Frankfurt and Munich, is grappling with a shifting aviation market that may have made parts of its orders for 205 aircraft out of step with current trends. Carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA are ramping up cut-rate trans-Atlantic services using long-range narrow-bodies or fuel-efficient aircraft like Boeing’s twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner. Based on list prices, Lufthansa’s order book translates into average spending of €3.9 billion (RM18.7 billion) a year through 2025. That compares with a budget for about €2.5 billion in annual capital expenditure. The US$408.8 million 777X would eat up almost all of that, but remains necessary to replace older four-engine aircraft, the CEO said. Cutting Costs Spohr’s message, delivered in March, may also have been intended to motivate Lufthansa managers to cut costs. He argued that meager profitability has caused the airline to under-invest in its fleet for two decades. The German carrier’s aircraft were 11.3 years old on average last year, compared with 5.25 years at Dubai-based Emirates airline and 5.5 years at Dublin-based discount carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc. The ageing fleet has left Lufthansa with the highest fuel expenses of any airline in Europe, as it operates almost 100 four-engine gas guzzlers. That includes the largest global fleet of Airbus A340s, a model that has long been out of production. While Lufthansa has 20 777Xs on firm order plus another 14 options, according to Boeing’s order book, it has just 25 A350s due for delivery. The Airbus plane, which seats 293 people and costs about US$100 million less, is interesting for long-haul routes frequented by fewer passengers, reducing the need to bundle traffic at large hubs. These capabilities could make long-haul services from Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Berlin viable for Lufthansa’s Eurowings budget subsidiary, Spohr said. Lufthansa has also indicated that it may lease a larger proportion of its fleet and buy more used models to curb expenditures. The carrier said last month that it will replace most of the long-haul planes flown by its Belgian arm and opt for used aircraft. “Generally speaking, there for sure will be good deals in the coming years,” Spohr said in the video. “Airbus and Boeing have sold far too many aircraft to the Gulf.” Other strategies for passenger operations outlined by Spohr included: New business-class cabin slated for future long-haul planes beginning with the 777X won’t be retrofitted onto aircraft currently in fleet A possible “business-plus” cabin rather than a first class on some 777X aircraft On European routes, potential introduction of a so-called ultra-light fare cheaper than its current lowest-cost “light” pricing segment. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions World Bank still sees global growth picking up amid policy risks Ringgit opens higher against US dollar Oil subdued as rising US output undermines Opec effort to cut supply Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Lufthansa expands Asia network with Cathay Pacific tie-up Nearly all Berlin flights cancelled due to strike (VIDEO) ABC News: Lufthansa flight to Germany diverted to NYC after threat More than 800 Lufthansa flights grounded as pilots resume strike Lufthansa scraps 900 flights today as pilots extend strike Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

The Thursday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories National by The Canadian Press Posted Jun 1, 2017 2:33 pm MDT Last Updated Jun 1, 2017 at 3:20 pm MDT Highlights from the news file for Thursday, June 1 U.S. WITHDRAWS FROM PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD: President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, but will begin negotiations to “re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction.” Trump said during a White House Rose Garden announcement that the U.S. will exit the landmark climate agreement aimed at reducing carbon emissions to slow climate change. Trump says the deal “disadvantages” the U.S. and is causing job losses and lower wages. ——— CANADA ANNOUNCES COMPENSATION FOR SOFTWOOD PRODUCERS: Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and other members of cabinet have unveiled an $867-million package of supports to help lumber producers and employees weather the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Canadian softwood. The package announced Thursday includes loans and loan guarantees to help ease the burden for forestry companies and to help them explore new markets and innovations. In April, the Trump administration slapped countervailing import duties as high as 24 per cent on softwood, arguing Canada unfairly subsidizes its industry. ——— FORMER ONTARIO NURSE PLEADS GUILTY TO MURDER: The former Ontario nurse charged in the slayings of eight seniors has pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder. Elizabeth Wettlaufer appeared in a Woodstock, Ont., court Thursday. Police have said the killeds took place over the last decade in three long-term care facilities where Wettlaufer worked as a registered nurse, and at a private home. Wettlaufer also pleaded guilty to four counts of attempted murder. ——— FORMER ENGINEER ACQUITTED OF CHARGES IN MALL COLLAPSE: A northern Ontario court has acquitted a former engineer of criminal negligence charges in the collapse of an Elliot Lake shopping mall. Robert Wood had declared the Algo Centre Mall structurally sound just weeks before the collapse in 2012. Two women were killed when part of the roof-top parking deck at the mall caved in. ——— COUILLARD SAYS TIME TO REOPEN CONSTITUTION: Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard says Canada’s 150th birthday is the right time to reopen constitutional discussions. Couillard told The Canadian Press that while the issue took a backseat to the economy and health care for the first half of his mandate, he would have been disappointed had his first term finished without tackling the subject of Quebec-Canada relations. There is no timeline for opening constitutional negotiations, but Couillard is hopeful the vast coast-to-coast discussion he is launching will eventually lead there. ——— FIGHTER JET TALKS IN LIMBO: The federal government says it’s not talking to other companies about replacement fighter jets in spite of its trade dispute with Boeing. The parliamentary secretary for Procurement Minister Judy Foote says the government has suspended talks with Boeing about plans to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets. But Steve MacKinnon says the government is not talking to other companies about supplying fighters. The government says it is disappointed that Boeing has petitioned the U.S. government to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. ——— TAKEOVER SPECULATION FUELS BLACKBERRY STOCKS: BlackBerry Ltd. shares were on the rise Thursday after a research report identified the Canadian company as a likely target for an acquisition. The shares rose nearly 11 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at one point in the wake of the report by Citron Research. It is predicting the company’s shares are likely to reach US$20 on the Nasdaq within 24 months and is a likely buyout target at a sizable premium. ——— HOUSING STRATEGY TO CLOSE EQUALITY GAP: The head of the federal agency crafting a national housing strategy says he’ll try to close the equality gap between the haves and have-nots. Evan Siddall of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says inequality threatens the very fabric of western society. The comments are a change of tone from Siddall, who months ago tried to temper high expectations that the strategy would meet hopes that a national plan would move people out of shelters and into homes and deal with concerns about affordability in the country’s biggest cities. ——— FORMER SECURITY OFFICIAL CALLS FOR BEEFED UP CYBER DEFENCE: The former head of the American National Security Agency says the U.S. and and Canada need a new cyberdefence program to prevent hackers from economic attacks. Retired Gen. Keith Alexander tells The Canadian Press that the potential benefits from the Liberal government’s core economic plan to encourage investment and innovation are at risk of being stolen and undermined by hackers. He says with Canada staking its economic future on technological innovation, it mustn’t allow the products and advancements that might come from that to simply be stolen. ——— PHILIPPINES HOTEL COMPLEX ATTACKED: An attack on a hotel and casino complex near Manila’s airport sent hundreds fleeing early Friday morning.

The Thursday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories by The Canadian Press Posted Jun 1, 2017 4:33 pm EDT Last Updated Jun 1, 2017 at 5:20 pm EDT National Highlights from the news file for Thursday, June 1 U.S. WITHDRAWS FROM PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD: President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, but will begin negotiations to “re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction.” Trump said during a White House Rose Garden announcement that the U.S. will exit the landmark climate agreement aimed at reducing carbon emissions to slow climate change. Trump says the deal “disadvantages” the U.S. and is causing job losses and lower wages. ——— CANADA ANNOUNCES COMPENSATION FOR SOFTWOOD PRODUCERS: Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and other members of cabinet have unveiled an $867-million package of supports to help lumber producers and employees weather the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Canadian softwood. The package announced Thursday includes loans and loan guarantees to help ease the burden for forestry companies and to help them explore new markets and innovations. In April, the Trump administration slapped countervailing import duties as high as 24 per cent on softwood, arguing Canada unfairly subsidizes its industry. ——— FORMER ONTARIO NURSE PLEADS GUILTY TO MURDER: The former Ontario nurse charged in the slayings of eight seniors has pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder. Elizabeth Wettlaufer appeared in a Woodstock, Ont., court Thursday. Police have said the killeds took place over the last decade in three long-term care facilities where Wettlaufer worked as a registered nurse, and at a private home. Wettlaufer also pleaded guilty to four counts of attempted murder. ——— FORMER ENGINEER ACQUITTED OF CHARGES IN MALL COLLAPSE: A northern Ontario court has acquitted a former engineer of criminal negligence charges in the collapse of an Elliot Lake shopping mall. Robert Wood had declared the Algo Centre Mall structurally sound just weeks before the collapse in 2012. Two women were killed when part of the roof-top parking deck at the mall caved in. ——— COUILLARD SAYS TIME TO REOPEN CONSTITUTION: Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard says Canada’s 150th birthday is the right time to reopen constitutional discussions. Couillard told The Canadian Press that while the issue took a backseat to the economy and health care for the first half of his mandate, he would have been disappointed had his first term finished without tackling the subject of Quebec-Canada relations. There is no timeline for opening constitutional negotiations, but Couillard is hopeful the vast coast-to-coast discussion he is launching will eventually lead there. ——— FIGHTER JET TALKS IN LIMBO: The federal government says it’s not talking to other companies about replacement fighter jets in spite of its trade dispute with Boeing. The parliamentary secretary for Procurement Minister Judy Foote says the government has suspended talks with Boeing about plans to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets. But Steve MacKinnon says the government is not talking to other companies about supplying fighters. The government says it is disappointed that Boeing has petitioned the U.S. government to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. ——— TAKEOVER SPECULATION FUELS BLACKBERRY STOCKS: BlackBerry Ltd. shares were on the rise Thursday after a research report identified the Canadian company as a likely target for an acquisition. The shares rose nearly 11 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at one point in the wake of the report by Citron Research. It is predicting the company’s shares are likely to reach US$20 on the Nasdaq within 24 months and is a likely buyout target at a sizable premium. ——— HOUSING STRATEGY TO CLOSE EQUALITY GAP: The head of the federal agency crafting a national housing strategy says he’ll try to close the equality gap between the haves and have-nots. Evan Siddall of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says inequality threatens the very fabric of western society. The comments are a change of tone from Siddall, who months ago tried to temper high expectations that the strategy would meet hopes that a national plan would move people out of shelters and into homes and deal with concerns about affordability in the country’s biggest cities. ——— FORMER SECURITY OFFICIAL CALLS FOR BEEFED UP CYBER DEFENCE: The former head of the American National Security Agency says the U.S. and and Canada need a new cyberdefence program to prevent hackers from economic attacks. Retired Gen. Keith Alexander tells The Canadian Press that the potential benefits from the Liberal government’s core economic plan to encourage investment and innovation are at risk of being stolen and undermined by hackers. He says with Canada staking its economic future on technological innovation, it mustn’t allow the products and advancements that might come from that to simply be stolen. ——— PHILIPPINES HOTEL COMPLEX ATTACKED: An attack on a hotel and casino complex near Manila’s airport sent hundreds fleeing early Friday morning. Gunshots rang out as police rushed to the Resorts World Manila complex. The Islamic State group took responsibility for the attack, but a police official says there is no evidence the casino attack is terrorism and no confirmed reports of gunshot wounds. Police believe just one gunman was involved. ——— Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Edit Profile | Logout. Loading profile... Unexpected error.

'We are proud that United Airlines will set a new record for the longest nonstop route by a domestic carrier right here at LAX,' said Deborah Flint, CEO of Los Angeles World Airports.  United's 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft will feature a total of 252 seats – 48 United Polaris business class, 204 United Economy, including 88 Economy Plus.  United Economy seats feature an adjustable headrest and seat-back monitor, while the United Economy Plus offers up to five inches of extra legroom.  United Economy seats feature an adjustable headrest and seat-back monitor, while the United Economy Plus offers up to five inches of extra legroom. Pictured is business class on Singapore Airlines' Boeings The longest current US flight is Qantas' 8,578-mile trip between Dallas-Fort Worth and Sydney, Australia. Among flights that don't touch the US, Qatar Airways flies a 9,032-mile route between its hub in Doha and Auckland, New Zealand.  United's announcement comes after nearly two months of bad press. In April, several incidents were reported on United flights, the most notorious occurred when police violently drug Dr David Dao off a flight, leaving him with a concussion and broken nose, among other injuries. LONGEST FLIGHTS IN THE WORLD 1. Sydney-Dallas, Qantas – 8,578 miles, 16 hours and 55 minutes 2. Jeddah-Los Angeles, Saudia – 8,332 miles, 16 hours and 40 minutes 3. Johannesburg-Atlanta, Delta Air Lines – 8,439 miles, 16 hours and 40       minutes 4. Dubai-Los Angeles, Emirates – 8,339 miles, 16 hours and 35 minutes 5. Abu Dhabi-Los Angeles, Etihad Airways – 8,390 miles, 16 hours and 30 minutes. 6. Doha-Los Angeles, Qatar Airways – 8,306 miles, 16 hours and 25 minutes 7.

'It is not who we are. We will do better,' he said.  In May, passengers reported being attacked by a scorpion that caused a flight to evacuate and another passenger received a five-figure compensation pay out after her giant bunny, Simon, froze to death on its way to America while traveling with the airline. A couple was also kicked off a flight on their way to their wedding in Costa Rica. Last week, the airline reportedly accused a gay father, who was flying with his son to North Carolina, of inappropriately touching the boy. United issued an apology immediately after that incident.  And most recently, a bird strike shut down the engine of a United plane not long after it took off from Chicago on Thursday morning. A video showed flames shooting from the wing.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 265 shares Most watched News videos Graphic footage of London attack victim with serious neck injury Shocking dashcam footage shows people fleeing scene of terror attack Hero Londoners try to save victims of city's latest terror attack Bloodied man led to safety through a cordon of armed police Moment gunshots are heard outside a restaurant in London Bridge Police tell drinkers to 'get down immediately' in London bar Exclusive: Armed police order people to the floor in Barking Horrific moment man randomly hits 90-year-old with cane in NYC Shocking moment woman blocks young boy from brutal crash This cat wants out!

Trump said during a White House Rose Garden announcement that the U.S. will exit the landmark climate agreement aimed at reducing carbon emissions to slow climate change. Trump says the deal "disadvantages" the U.S. and is causing job losses and lower wages. ——— CANADA ANNOUNCES COMPENSATION FOR SOFTWOOD PRODUCERS:  Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and other members of cabinet have unveiled an $867-million package of supports to help lumber producers and employees weather the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Canadian softwood. The package announced Thursday includes loans and loan guarantees to help ease the burden for forestry companies and to help them explore new markets and innovations. In April, the Trump administration slapped countervailing import duties as high as 24 per cent on softwood, arguing Canada unfairly subsidizes its industry.   ——— FORMER ONTARIO NURSE PLEADS GUILTY TO MURDER: The former Ontario nurse charged in the slayings of eight seniors has pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder. Elizabeth Wettlaufer appeared in a Woodstock, Ont., court Thursday. Police have said the killeds took place over the last decade in three long-term care facilities where Wettlaufer worked as a registered nurse, and at a private home. Wettlaufer also pleaded guilty to four counts of attempted murder. ——— FORMER ENGINEER ACQUITTED OF CHARGES IN MALL COLLAPSE: A northern Ontario court has acquitted a former engineer of criminal negligence charges in the collapse of an Elliot Lake shopping mall. Robert Wood had declared the Algo Centre Mall structurally sound just weeks before the collapse in 2012. Two women were killed when part of the roof-top parking deck at the mall caved in. ——— COUILLARD SAYS TIME TO REOPEN CONSTITUTION: Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard says Canada's 150th birthday is the right time to reopen constitutional discussions. Couillard told The Canadian Press that while the issue took a backseat to the economy and health care for the first half of his mandate, he would have been disappointed had his first term finished without tackling the subject of Quebec-Canada relations. There is no timeline for opening constitutional negotiations, but Couillard is hopeful the vast coast-to-coast discussion he is launching will eventually lead there. ——— FIGHTER JET TALKS IN LIMBO: The federal government says it's not talking to other companies about replacement fighter jets in spite of its trade dispute with Boeing. The parliamentary secretary for Procurement Minister Judy Foote says the government has suspended talks with Boeing about plans to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets. But Steve MacKinnon says the government is not talking to other companies about supplying fighters. The government says it is disappointed that Boeing has petitioned the U.S. government to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. ——— TAKEOVER SPECULATION FUELS BLACKBERRY STOCKS: BlackBerry Ltd. shares were on the rise Thursday after a research report identified the Canadian company as a likely target for an acquisition. The shares rose nearly 11 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at one point in the wake of the report by Citron Research. It is predicting the company's shares are likely to reach US$20 on the Nasdaq within 24 months and is a likely buyout target at a sizable premium. ——— HOUSING STRATEGY TO CLOSE EQUALITY GAP: The head of the federal agency crafting a national housing strategy says he'll try to close the equality gap between the haves and have-nots. Evan Siddall of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says inequality threatens the very fabric of western society. The comments are a change of tone from Siddall, who months ago tried to temper high expectations that the strategy would meet hopes that a national plan would move people out of shelters and into homes and deal with concerns about affordability in the country’s biggest cities. ——— FORMER SECURITY OFFICIAL CALLS FOR BEEFED UP CYBER DEFENCE: The former head of the American National Security Agency says the U.S. and and Canada need a new cyberdefence program to prevent hackers from economic attacks. Retired Gen. Keith Alexander tells The Canadian Press that the potential benefits from the Liberal government's core economic plan to encourage investment and innovation are at risk of being stolen and undermined by hackers. He says with Canada staking its economic future on technological innovation, it mustn't allow the products and advancements that might come from that to simply be stolen. ——— PHILIPPINES HOTEL COMPLEX ATTACKED: An attack on a hotel and casino complex near Manila's airport sent hundreds fleeing early Friday morning. Gunshots rang out as police rushed to the Resorts World Manila complex. The Islamic State group took responsibility for the attack, but a police official says there is no evidence the casino attack is terrorism and no confirmed reports of gunshot wounds. Police believe just one gunman was involved. ——— The Canadian Press Previous No sanctions for 43 of 45 Home Capital brokers and agents, Ontario regulator says Next Saying I do without the debt Related Articles ‘Come From Away’ wins 3 Drama Desk Awards, including outstanding musical June 04, 2017 Ottawa vigilant as Canada 150 birthday party looms after London attack: mayor June 04, 2017 Military faces intensive archival search to pinpoint gay purge numbers June 04, 2017 CP Regional News B.C. legislature in ‘uncharted territory’ as it tussles with Speaker appointment June 04, 2017 Halifax author Kris Bertin wins $10,000 Danuta Gleed Literary Award June 03, 2017 Hundreds gather to mourn B.C. fire chief killed in flooding creek June 03, 2017 First Nation applauds B.C.

Bush. Boeing builds the Super Hornet in St. Louis County. (AP Photo/U.S. Navy, Brian Stephens) Updated at 2:35 p.m. OTTAWA • Canada, embroiled in a dispute with Boeing, tried to lash out at the U.S. aerospace giant for the second day in a row on Thursday but stumbled over whether talks over a proposed jet purchase had been suspended or not. The Liberal government, angry that Boeing has launched a trade challenge against Canadian plane maker Bombardier Inc., is threatening to scrap plans to buy 18 made-in-St. Louis F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters. Steven MacKinnon, parliamentary secretary to Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote, told reporters that Boeing “is not acting like a valued partner right now so we’ve suspended discussions with that partner.” Minutes later, Foote spokeswoman Annie Trepanier said that while government ministers were not talking to the company, “there is no formal suspension.” Earlier in the day Boeing scrapped an announcement about the fighter jets, a day after Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan objected to the firm’s behavior in the dispute against Bombardier. The company had been due to announce which Canadian companies would benefit if the purchase went ahead. Boeing has 560 suppliers in Canada. “Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story,” Boeing spokesman Scott Day said in a statement issued at an Ottawa defense show. While he did not specifically refer to the trade dispute, his comments appeared to be a reference to growing tension between Ottawa and the firm. The Boeing saga has increased tension between Canada and the United States in the run-up to talks on renewing the North American Free Trade Agreement. Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Last month, Canada said it “strongly disagrees” with the U.S. Commerce Department decision to investigate Boeing’s claims that Bombardier sold planes below cost in the United States and benefited unfairly from Canadian government subsidies. Even lower-level Canadian officials were not visiting the company’s stand at the Ottawa defense show, said one source familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified,given the sensitivity of the situation. Sajjan on Wednesday said the firm would be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but he complained the anti-dumping petition against Bombardier was “not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner.” Canada says it needs the Super Hornets as a stopgap until it can launch an open competition to replace its fleet of aging Boeing CF-18 planes. A Super Hornet deal would generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada’s aerospace hub of Quebec, where existing CF-18s are now maintained. In St. Louis, the sale was one of a couple of contracts expected to keep the F/A-18 production line operating into the early 2020s.

The Liberal government, angry that Boeing has launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc, is threatening to scrap plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighters. Steven MacKinnon, parliamentary secretary to Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote, told reporters that Boeing "is not acting like a valued partner right now so we've suspended discussions with that partner." Minutes later, Foote spokeswoman Annie Trepanier said that while government ministers were not talking to the company, "there is no formal suspension." Earlier in the day Boeing scrapped an announcement about the jets, a day after Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan objected to the firm's behavior in the dispute against Bombardier. Advertisement Advertisement The company had been due to announce which Canadian companies would benefit if the purchase went ahead. Boeing has 560 suppliers in Canada. "Due to the current climate, today is not the most opportune time to share this good news story," Boeing spokesman Scott Day said in a statement issued at an Ottawa defense show. While he did not specifically refer to the trade dispute, his comments appeared to be a reference to growing tensions between Ottawa and the firm. The Boeing saga has increased tensions between Canada and the United States in the run-up to talks on renewing the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last month, Canada said it "strongly disagrees" with the U.S. Commerce Department decision to investigate Boeing's claims that Bombardier sold planes below cost in the United States and benefited unfairly from Canadian government subsidies. Even lower-level Canadian officials were not visiting the company's stand at the Ottawa defense show, said one source familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. Sajjan on Wednesday said the firm would be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but he complained the anti-dumping petition against Bombardier was "not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner". Canada says it needs the Super Hornets as a stopgap until it can launch an open competition to replace its fleet of aging Boeing CF-18 planes. A Super Hornet deal would generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where existing CF-18s are now maintained.

Last month, Canada said it "strongly disagrees" with the U.S. Commerce Department decision to investigate Boeing's claims that Bombardier sold planes below cost in the United States and benefited unfairly from Canadian government subsidies. As a result, government ministers have cut off contacts with Boeing. The company had been due to announce at the show on Thursday which Canadian companies would benefit if the purchase went ahead. Boeing has 560 suppliers in Canada. Even lower-level Canadian officials were not visiting the company's stand at the defense industry exhibition, said one source familiar with the matter who didn't want to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan on Wednesday said the firm would be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but he complained the anti-dumping petition against Bombardier was "not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner". Canada says it needs the 18 Super Hornet jets as a stopgap until it can launch an open competition to replace its fleet of 77 aging Boeing CF-18 planes. A Super Hornet deal with Boeing would generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where existing CF-18s are now maintained. Montreal-based simulator manufacturer CAE Inc works with L-3 MAS, a Quebec-based division of L3 Technologies Inc , to provide in-service support for the CF-18s. Boeing has already said it would collaborate with L-3 MAS on production and support of the Super Hornets if Canada purchases the fighter jets.

By Peter Sayer IDG News Service - Paris bureau chief, IDG News Service | Jun 1, 2017 6:48 AM PT Credit: ESA - CNES - Arianespace / Photo Optique Video CSG More like this I tested Gogo’s in-flight Wi-Fi of the future and said goodbye to Netflix... Cisco's New-market Ambitions Extend Into Orbit Gogo buys more satellite capacity after lawsuit over slow in-flight Wi-Fi Video Witcher 3 on a MacBook Air? Yep, with Nvidia GeForce Now All-electric satellites are changing the way airline passengers access the internet. Like a Tesla in space, an all-electric satellite uses electric propulsion to climb from transfer orbit to geostationary orbit and to maintain its position on station, instead of the chemical rockets used by traditional satellites. Such satellites still need a traditional launcher burning solid or liquid fuel for the brute-force task of getting them into space, but the delicate work of positioning the satellite is done electrically. Without the need to carry vast quantities of chemical fuel, all-electric satellites can be up to 40 percent lighter at launch. That gives their operators the option of using a smaller, cheaper launch vehicle -- or of tacking on extra communications equipment to deliver more power or operate in more frequency bands. Whatever option the operator chooses, airline passengers jonesing for in-flight internet access benefit, as the service can be cheaper, faster, or available in more places. Boeing has been building all-electric satellites for a couple of years, but now a European company, Airbus Defense and Space, is getting in on the game. The first Airbus-built all-electric satellite, Eutelsat 172B, is scheduled for launch late on June 1. It will take off from Kourou in French Guiana aboard an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. The same launcher will also carry ViaSat 2, a conventionally powered broadband communications satellite built by Boeing. Once lofted into its transfer orbit by the Ariane 5, Eutelsat 172B will turn on its electric motors and start the slow climb to geostationary orbit over Asia. ViaSat 2, meanwhile, will light up its rockets for a somewhat faster journey to an orbital slot over the Americas. While Eutelsat 172B carries no combustible fuel, it does still carry some expendable reaction mass -- something to sling out the back in order to push itself forward through the vacuum of space. It will use xenon gas, splitting it into positive and negative ions and accelerating these to high speeds using an electric field. The use of xenon ion propulsion systems (XIPS, pronounced "zips") to move a satellite up into geostationary orbit is relatively new. Most still use chemical thrusters ejecting burning gases for that task, although there are plenty of satellites using XIPS to remain on station. The electric propulsion system draws its power from the satellite's solar panels but, even if the satellite still has power, once its xenon reaction mass is used up it will slowly drift off station and it will be time to launch a replacement. So what does all this mean for airline passengers? Lots more internet capacity, for one thing. One of the three communications packages Eutelsat 172B will carry is the high-throughput service that will be operated by Panasonic Avionics. That company will its 11 spot beams with a capacity of 1.8Gbps to deliver in-flight entertainment and connectivity to commercial airlines across the Pacific Ocean. The satellite's manufacturer, Airbus, is also building other all-electric satellites that will be able to carry even bigger communications packages, promising still more bandwidth to come.

Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said Boeing's action against Bombardier is "unfounded" and not the behavior of a "trusted partner." He said yesterday buying the Super Hornet fighter jets "requires a trusted industry partner." Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint in a speech. Canada's foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. "Our government - and I stress this - our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners," he said. Chicago-based Boeing's trade complaint prompted a US Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier's new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada's threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the US Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company's trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. "It's more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case," he said. "We're going to continue working with the US Navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada." Boeing petitioned the US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier's CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than USD 3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in "predatory pricing." Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier's. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada's federal government also recently provided a USD 275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from US-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta.

Chicago-based Boeing's trade complaint prompted a US Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier's new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada's threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with the US Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company's trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. "It's more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case," he said. "We're going to continue working with the US Navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada." Boeing petitioned the US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Montreal-based Bombardier's CSeries aircraft. Boeing says Bombardier has received more than USD 3 billion in government subsidies that let it engage in "predatory pricing." Brazil has also launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization over Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. Sao Paolo-based Embraer is a fierce rival of Bombardier's. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the CSeries last year. Canada's federal government also recently provided a USD 275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders for its new medium-size plane. But Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the CSeries from US-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37%  closed up 9.01 points, or 0.4%, at a record 2,349.07, after touching an intraday record at 2,440.23. Tech, with a 1% rise, was the top performing sector. Energy shares finished down 1.2%, largely following oil prices. Financials stocks were another area of weakness on Wall Street, with the sector trading 0.4% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  rose 62.11 points, or 0.3%, to finish at a record 21,206.29, led higher by shares of Boeing Co. BA, +1.55%  and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.37%  Earlier, the average touched a record intraday high of 21,225.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.94%  climbed 58.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at a record 6,305.80, after touching an intraday high of 6,308.76. Along with all three main indexes closing at records, the Dow industrials finished the week up 0.6%, the S&P 500 advanced 1%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.5%. The May nonfarm payrolls data showed the economy added 138,000 jobs last month, coming in below Wall Street economists’ forecasts. The details of the jobs report were also weaker than expected. The number of job gains for April and March were revised lower. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.3% but the decline was largely due to shrinking labor force. Average wages rose 0.2% to $26.22 an hour, in line with expectations. “This is undoubtedly a weak jobs report, especially with downward revisions. But it’s just one data point that will not change the Fed’s course, which is to raise rates at its June meeting,” said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Nonfarm payrolls month-to-month is a very jumpy number and a one-off weakness should not be seen as a beginning of a trend. For example, we’ve had a very poor print in May 2016, with 43,000 jobs. Since then, the S&P 500 is up about 400 points,” Antonelli said. Read: The S&P 500 has never had a down year after a start like 2017 Despite the unexpectedly low print on the jobs report, expectations for a rate increase in June didn’t fall. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 91% probability of a rate increase this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. While a June hike is widely expected, the weak jobs number and tepid wage growth may give the Fed pause when it comes to other rate increases this year, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, in an interview. “Wage growth is not fabulous, and maybe that gives the Fed room to sit on rates,” Nolte said. “Markets love a near-zero rate.” Should inflation trends and weakness persist then it’s entirely possible that a rate increase in June could be the last one of 2017, and with Treasury yields at unexpected lows, equities become one of the few games in town for a return, said Nolte. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.48%  fell nearly 6 basis points to 2.154%, declining below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against other major currencies, with the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, +0.02%  last down less than 0.1% at 96.68. Other markets: Oil prices CLN7, +1.24%  fell 1.5% to settle at $47.66 a barrel for a three-week low on Friday, partly driven by concerns that President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord will lead to an increase in U.S. oil output. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, -0.04%  closed above the key 20,000 level, adding 1.6% as the Japanese yen eased against the dollar USDJPY, +0.14% European stocks SXXP, +0.23%  finished higher, and the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.05% pared back from an intraday high to close up less than 0.1%.

MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Network ViaSat's New Satellite Launch Furthers Reach of High-Speed Internet ViaSat said the new $625 million satellite will allow it to offer residential satellite internet plans with up to 100 megabits per second speeds and virtually unlimited data use. by Mike Freeman, The San Diego Union-Tribune / June 2, 2017 Twitter/ViaSat (TNS) -- ViaSat’s latest internet satellite blasted into space Thursday afternoon, furthering the Carlsbad company’s strategy of delivering high-speed broadband to more homes and commercial airlines for in-flight Wi-Fi. ViaSat-2, which at 14,149 pounds is the size of four sedans, launched from Guiana Space Center on an Ariane 5 rocket. It was supposed to enter orbit on April 25, but civil unrest in French Guiana delayed blast off until Thursday. With more than 300 gigabits per second of maximum capacity, ViaSat-2 has more than twice the bandwidth of the company’s first internet satellite, ViaSat-1, launched six years ago. It’s the highest capacity communications satellite ever launched, according to the company. RELATEDViaSat Is Dramatically Expanding Satellite BroadbandHow New Mini-Satellites Could Impact Hurricane ForecastsSatellite Constellations May Challenge the Broadband Industry ViaSat-2 represents the latest test to the company’s strategy of engineering satellites to maximize speed and low-cost bandwidth in hopes of mitigating concerns over latency — the delays as signals travel from space to Earth that can bog down some real-time applications such as online gaming. ViaSat held a blast-off party at its corporate headquarters Thursday, where several hundred employees and guests watched a live stream of the launch. “With ViaSat-2, we set out to solve this problem of how do we get capacity and coverage,” said Chief Operating Officer Rick Baldridge. “We were able to do that. ViaSat-2 has over seven times the coverage of ViaSat-1.” ViaSat said the new $625 million satellite, which was built by Boeing Satellite Systems in El Segundo, will allow it to offer residential satellite internet plans with up to 100 megabits per second speeds and virtually unlimited data use — challenging cable and telephone line internet in some regions. That beats ViaSat’s current baseline plans, which start at 12 megabits per second but have usage caps around 10 gigabits per month. Launched in 2011, ViaSat-1 is full with 660,000 subscribers. It will take several months to test and position ViaSat-2 in its orbital slot 22,000 miles above Earth. The company expects to begin offering service in January. Competitor Hughes Network Systems, owned by EchoStar, already launched its second high capacity internet satellite, giving it about a seven-month head start on ViaSat-2. But analysts say there’s room for both. About 14 million U.S. households are outside the footprint of cable or telephone company high speed internet services. But only 1.7 million currently subscribe to satellite internet, according to Northern Sky Research. For commercial flights, ViaSat-2 aims to deliver 25 megabit speeds or better to each passenger airplane, and widen geographic coverage beyond the U.S. The satellite’s footprint reaches the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, parts of South America and across the Atlantic. Once in Europe, ViaSat-2 would hand off in-flight Wi-Fi to satellites of partner Eutelsat, but the switch would be seamless to users, the company said. “In fact, with ViaSat-2, you’ll be able to fly from the U.S. West Coast all the way across the Atlantic and through Europe to the Middle East with ViaSat’s network,” said David Abrahamian, director of space systems at ViaSat. The company currently powers free inflight Wi-Fi on JetBlue, as well as some American Airlines and United Airlines commercial aircraft. More than 550 aircraft use its technology today, which is fast enough for passengers to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime video on their mobile devices in the air. About 830 additional commercial aircraft are in the pipeline to be retrofitted with antennas for ViaSat-powered onboard Wi-Fi. Northern Sky Research forecasts in-flight connectivity will be installed on two out of every three commercial passenger aircraft worldwide by the end of 2026, driven by higher demand for broadband connectivity. The industry research firm said inflight Wi-Fi could generate $32 billion in revenue over the next decade. While ViaSat pushed the market toward faster in-flight Wi-Fi, competitors are fighting back. Gogo, a Chicago company that provides cellular-based ground-to-air Wi-Fi to airlines, has developed a new antenna and leased space on existing satellites to provide faster speeds. It is battling with ViaSat and others for a pending Wi-Fi upgrade contract at Alaska Airlines, according to analysts. ViaSat-2 isn’t the end for the company. It’s currently building payloads for ViaSat-3 – a three satellite constellation slated to begin launching in 2019. Each ViaSat-3 satellite will have 1 terabit-per-second maximum capacity – more than triple that of ViaSat-2. When all are in orbit, the company will have global coverage. “What’s really important is ViaSat-2 is a stepping stone to ViaSat-3, said Baldridge. “Two of those satellites are already under construction with our Boeing partner. We just can’t wait to get there in a couple years.” ©2017 The San Diego Union-Tribune Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37%  closed up 9.01 points, or 0.4%, at a record 2,349.07, after touching an intraday record at 2,440.23. Tech, with a 1% rise, was the top performing sector. Energy shares finished down 1.2%, largely following oil prices. Financials stocks were another area of weakness on Wall Street, with the sector trading 0.4% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  rose 62.11 points, or 0.3%, to finish at a record 21,206.29, led higher by shares of Boeing Co. BA, +1.55%  and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.37%  Earlier, the average touched a record intraday high of 21,225.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.94%  climbed 58.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at a record 6,305.80, after touching an intraday high of 6,308.76. Along with all three main indexes closing at records, the Dow industrials finished the week up 0.6%, the S&P 500 advanced 1%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.5%. The May nonfarm payrolls data showed the economy added 138,000 jobs last month, coming in below Wall Street economists’ forecasts. The details of the jobs report were also weaker than expected. The number of job gains for April and March were revised lower. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.3% but the decline was largely due to shrinking labor force. Average wages rose 0.2% to $26.22 an hour, in line with expectations. “This is undoubtedly a weak jobs report, especially with downward revisions. But it’s just one data point that will not change the Fed’s course, which is to raise rates at its June meeting,” said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Nonfarm payrolls month-to-month is a very jumpy number and a one-off weakness should not be seen as a beginning of a trend. For example, we’ve had a very poor print in May 2016, with 43,000 jobs. Since then, the S&P 500 is up about 400 points,” Antonelli said. Read: The S&P 500 has never had a down year after a start like 2017 Despite the unexpectedly low print on the jobs report, expectations for a rate increase in June didn’t fall. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 91% probability of a rate increase this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. While a June hike is widely expected, the weak jobs number and tepid wage growth may give the Fed pause when it comes to other rate increases this year, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, in an interview. “Wage growth is not fabulous, and maybe that gives the Fed room to sit on rates,” Nolte said. “Markets love a near-zero rate.” Should inflation trends and weakness persist then it’s entirely possible that a rate increase in June could be the last one of 2017, and with Treasury yields at unexpected lows, equities become one of the few games in town for a return, said Nolte. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.48%  fell nearly 6 basis points to 2.154%, declining below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against other major currencies, with the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, +0.03%  last down less than 0.1% at 96.68. Other markets: Oil prices CLN7, +1.22%  fell 1.5% to settle at $47.66 a barrel for a three-week low on Friday, partly driven by concerns that President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord will lead to an increase in U.S. oil output. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, -0.03%  closed above the key 20,000 level, adding 1.6% as the Japanese yen eased against the dollar USDJPY, +0.15% European stocks SXXP, +0.23%  finished higher, and the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.05% pared back from an intraday high to close up less than 0.1%. Gold prices GCQ7, +0.23%  rose 0.8% to settle at $1,280.20 an ounce. Individual stocks: Shares of Broadcom Limited AVGO, +8.50%  finished up 8.5% after reporting earnings. Shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, +11.55%  shot up nearly 12% after the apparel-maker posted first-quarter results that beat expectations and announced a shake-up of its Ivivva brand, late Thursday. Leading the slump in energy were shares of Devon Energy Corp. DVN, -3.33% Newfield Exploration Co. NFX, -5.02% Range Resources Corp. RRC, -3.89% all of which finished down 3% or more, while Transocean Ltd. RIG, -2.17%  shares declined 2.2%. Shares of Cooper Cos. COO, +8.43%  rallied 8.4% after Raymond James raised its price target of medical device company’s stock. Shares of Delta Air Lines DAL, +2.69%  advanced 2.7% after the company reported its monthly operating performance. Shares of RH Inc. RH, -25.69%  sank nearly 26% after the retail chain formerly known as Restoration Hardware cut its earnings outlook for the year.

The ribbon cutting at the project's centerpiece urban village is a milestone for one of North Texas' most ambitious real estate endeavors. "This project took an army to develop," said Legacy West's Fehmi Karahan. "A project like this one has consumed me - night and day, seven days a week for about three years." Developed by Karahan, KDC and Columbus Realty Partners, Legacy West is located on the Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121. Dallas' Sam Moon family switches orbits, from handbags to a Legacy West hotel in Plano The project was built on 250 acres of surplus land surrounding retailer J.C. Penney's headquarters. This weekend's celebration is to debut the Legacy West Urban Village, which has more than 300,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, about 300,000 square feet of office space, more than 1,000 apartments and a high-rise hotel. The retail and restaurant center and most of the office space is already rented.

(Ryan Michalesko/The Dallas Morning News) (Ryan Michalesko/Staff Photographer) Restaurants in Legacy West include Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, Fogo de Chao, Mesero, Shake Shack, Taverna, True Food Kitchen and Toulouse. Legacy West's retailers include Bonobos, Coach, Fabletics, Filson, Johnny Was, Peter Millar, Pockets Menswear, Suitsupply, Tesla, Tommy Bahama, TUMI, and West Elm. "You can make great projects, but if you don't lease it doesn't work," Karahan said. "On the office leasing, we've been attracting some of the best names in the country." Aerospace giant Boeing recently announced plans to locate a new division headquarters in the Legacy West Urban Village. And Toyota has just started moving the first of thousands of workers into its new North American headquarters located just up the street. Liberty Mutual Insurance and JPMorgan Chase will start moving thousands more employees into Legacy West late this year. Plano's Legacy West adds Madewell, J. Crew, M.A.C and Levi's to store lineup More than 20,000 people will soon work in the development. "Welcome to the center of the universe," said Plano's mayor Harry LaRosiliere. "What makes this special is the sense of place created. "Anybody can build strip shopping centers," LaRosiliere said. "Only Fehmi Karahan can building Legacy West." Karahan developed Legacy West after having great success with the Shops at Legacy retail center he built on the east side of the tollway at Legacy Drive. "I had this dream to someday build something across the street," Karahan said. After petitioning Penney for years to develop its vacant land, the team of Karahan Cos., KDC and Columbus Realty were picked from a field of competing developers in early 2014. Just three months later in April of 2014 Toyota stunned the market when it announced it would build its new headquarters in Legacy West - joining FedEx Office as the first major companies in the mixed-use project. After Toyota's announcement, Legacy West took off. What was supposed to be a 10-year project is almost out of land and is recognized as one of the most successful such projects in the country. Plano's Legacy West celebrates grand opening with free bites and more delights "I'm proud to be involved in the partnership building this project," said Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys' star quarterback and a partner in Legacy West's apartments. "Legacy West is going to be outstanding. "People who live in the apartments are going to be able to walk to the finest retail experience in the Dallas area." Designed by architect Gensler, the $400 million Legacy West Urban Village was financed by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Invesco Real Estate is a financial partner in the development. This weekend's grand opening events for the Legacy West Urban Village include live entertainment and drink tastings. Some of the retailers will be offering store discounts. Legacy West Urban Village includes more than 300,000 square feet of shops and restaurants and hundreds of new apartments.

Photo by: Getty Images. Plans for the Stratolaunch airplane, a a dual-fuselage, 28-wheel behemoth that measures more than 385 feet from wingtip to wingtip, had been in the works since 2011. Finally, at an event in Mojave, California, the world's largest airplane was wheeled out of its hangar for the first time. The 500,000 pound Stratolaunch is the dream of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen (who is also the owner of the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers and NFL's Seattle Seahawks). Standing 50 feet tall, 238 feet long, and powered by six engines that are also used on Boeing 747s, the Stratolaunch can carry 250,000 pounds of fuel while also taking off with a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds. As impressive as those measurements are, there is actually one airplane that is slightly longer. The An-225, which was a Soviet Union built plane in 1988, is about 275 feet long (37 ft. longer than the Stratolaunch). Yet, the Stratolaunch has a bigger wingspan, technically making it the larger airplane. More than a traditional airplane, however, the Stratolaunch is engineered to release rockets that will carry satellites into space. According to the company, this will significantly decrease the costs associated with launching satellites into orbit. "With aircraft-like operations, our reusable launch platform will significantly reduce the long wait times traditionally experienced between the construction of a satellite and the opportunity to launch it into space," Allen stated. "As the launch vehicle rockets into orbit, Stratolaunch will fly back to a runway landing for reloading, refueling and reuse." Because the aircraft will be tasked with such a uniquely challenging task, the engineers and designers at the company want to ensure everything runs according to plans during the crucial testing phases. "This is a first-of-its-kind aircraft, so we're going to be diligent throughout testing and continue to prioritize the safety of our pilots," said Jean Floyd, Stratolaunch's chief executive officer, in a statement. Floyd indicated the goal for the aircraft is to have a launch demonstration as early as 2019. Before that happens, however, Floyd and his team will run several fuel and ground tests on the Stratolaunch. This story originally appeared on Architectural Digest.

But the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq all managed record highs on an intraday and closing basis. Fred Imbert | @foimbert Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 4:13 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Stocks hit all-time highs today    Friday, 2 Jun 2017 | 4:23 PM ET | 00:35 U.S. equities rose to record levels on Friday as Wall Street shrugged off a jobs report that came in well below expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 60 points higher and reached its first intraday record since March 1 as well as its second straight record close. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite also managed intraday and closing records. "This was the closest thing to a nonresponse you're going to see," said Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management, referring to the market's reaction to the jobs report. "This isn't a report that warrants a strong response in financial markets and I don't think you're going to get one." Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics, said a pop in small-cap stocks helped the large-cap indexes rise on Friday. Small caps "have caught up in a big way and they're on their way to all-time highs," he said. The Russell 2000, which tracks small cap stocks, rose 0.67 percent and was less than 2 percent away from a record high. The Labor Department said 138,000 jobs were created last month, well below the expected 185,000. Wages also grew less than expected, with average hourly earnings rising at a 2.5 percent annualized rate. The unemployment rate, however, fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent. "There are some sectors in the jobs market that are seeing strong wage growth and others that aren't," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. "I think that's reflective of the tightness seen in some sectors." Chamberlain also noted the U.S. economy has added jobs for 80 straight months now, the longest positive streak dating back to the 1930s. Brendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks futures gave back some gains after the data were released. Dow futures traded 41 points higher, while S&P and Nasdaq futures gained 3 points and 14.5 points, respectively. Heading into the 8:30 a.m. ET release, Dow futures were trading nearly 70 points higher, while S&P and Nasdaq had risen 4.75 points and 17.75 points, respectively. "It's hard to ignore the the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected and, more importantly, the number came in below the 12-month average of 181,000," said Sharon Stark, managing director of fixed income strategies at Incapital. Investors eagerly awaited the report as it is one of the last major data sets released before the Federal Reserve holds its June monetary policy meeting. Market expectations for a rate hike were near 94 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "The fall in job growth numbers may make some query the likelihood of a rate rise next month, however, one slightly disappointing month does not constitute a wholesale change in fortunes," said Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, in a note. "This is not so much a downward trend away from the strong jobs market but merely a temporary blip on the radar," Samra said. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq posted solid strong weekly gains helped by high-yielding sectors, including telecommunications and utilities, which rose 2.33 percent and 1.67 percent, respectively. Dow, S&P and Nasdaq this week Source: FactSet Symbol Name Price   Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62.11 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 21,206.29, with Microsoft leading advancers and Exxon Mobil lagging. The S&P 500 gained 9.01 points, or 0.37 percent, to end at 2,439.07, with information technology leading eight sectors higher and energy the biggest decliner. The Nasdaq advanced 58.97 points, or 0.94 percent, to close at 6,305.80. About four stocks advanced for every three decliners at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 866.21 million and a composite volume of 3.44 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 9.8. Correction: Marc Chaikin is CEO of Chaikin Analytics. An earlier version misspelled his name.

Putin’s audience included senior executives from Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Philip Morris and Honeywell. NYT: Trump brags to Russians about firing ‘nut job’ Comey Relations between Russia and the U.S. have been in sharp decline since 2014, when Western powers reacted to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea by slapping sanctions on the country. Allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 have further strained the relationship. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is now leading an investigation into Moscow’s actions, including potential collusion between President Trump’s campaign associates and Russian officials. Putin lamented the lost economic opportunities on Friday, saying that trade between the U.S. and Russia has dramatically declined. Trade in goods between the two countries fell by over 40% between 2014 and 2016. Advertisement “If you look at lost opportunities and lost profits, analyze that, you see that … it harms everyone,” he said, according to an account of the meeting published by Russian state media. The Russian leader said he was ready for improved relations. “We are ready to support bilateral business projects, that include equal, constructive partnership and cooperation,” he said. “We are interested in developing technology, attracting foreign firms to help develop our industries and infrastructure.” Advertisement Putin’s comments come one day after he suggested that “patriotic hackers” may have meddled in the U.S. election, but insisted that none of their potential activities were state-backed. It’s the first time he has conceded that the election attacks may have emanated from Russia. Putin has also used the St. Petersburg summit to elaborate on his relationship with Trump. “We don’t know each other, we’ve never met,” Putin said on Thursday, before offering an assessment of the U.S. leader. “He is a straight-forward, sincere man. You can’t really classify him as a traditional politician,” Putin said of Trump. “This is a person with a fresh view of things.” 51.507351 -0.127758 Related Stories Defiant Trump says he had ‘absolute right’ to share information with Russia Washington Post: Trump shared classified info to Russians Authors: WGNO Web Desk Filed in: National/World News Topics: American President, comrade, Corporate America, covfefe, message, Russian President, trump, Vladimir Putin 367 Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel More in National/World News 37 bodies found in Resorts World Manila, Philippines official says More from WGNO Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App facebook twitter instagram pinterest Email Alerts About & Contact Screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • EEO Report • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1 Galleria Blvd., Suite 850 Metairie, LA 70001 • Copyright © 2017, WGNO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

You can't really classify him as a traditional politician," Putin said of Trump. "This is a person with a fresh view of things." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The aircraft will undergo ground tests in preparation for flights in which the aircraft will launch rockets from high altitude. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Billionaire Paul G. Allen's Stratolaunch, a massive aircraft designed to launch rockets into space from high altitude, has been rolled out of its hangar for the first time in preparation for testing. Here are things to know about the program that has been underway since 2011: Gigantic The Stratolaunch aircraft is enormous, with a wingspan totaling 385 feet, longer than the wingspan of any other aircraft and greater than the length of an American football field. Its twin fuselages stretch 238 feet. By comparison, the H-4 flying boat — nicknamed Spruce Goose and built by Howard Hughes in the 1940s — has a 320-foot wingspan and is just under 219 feet long. Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380's wings span 262 feet. Weight and power The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds empty, can carry 250,000 pounds of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds. It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. Air launch On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the center of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Va. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites that can be affected by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. History Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and '60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. What's next Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms operate. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

Putin’s audience included senior executives from Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Philip Morris and Honeywell. Relations between Russia and the U.S. have been in sharp decline since 2014, when Western powers reacted to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea by slapping sanctions on the country. Allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 have further strained the relationship. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is now leading an investigation into Moscow’s actions, including potential collusion between President Trump’s campaign associates and Russian officials. Putin lamented the lost economic opportunities on Friday, saying that trade between the U.S. and Russia has dramatically declined. Trade in goods between the two countries fell by over 40% between 2014 and 2016. “If you look at lost opportunities and lost profits, analyze that, you see that … it harms everyone,” he said, according to an account of the meeting published by Russian state media. The Russian leader said he was ready for improved relations. “We are ready to support bilateral business projects, that include equal, constructive partnership and cooperation,” he said. “We are interested in developing technology, attracting foreign firms to help develop our industries and infrastructure.” Putin’s comments come one day after he suggested that “patriotic hackers” may have meddled in the U.S. election, but insisted that none of their potential activities were state-backed. It’s the first time he has conceded that the election attacks may have emanated from Russia. Putin has also used the St. Petersburg summit to elaborate on his relationship with Trump. “We don’t know each other, we’ve never met,” Putin said on Thursday, before offering an assessment of the U.S. leader. “He is a straight-forward, sincere man.

Image source: Arianespace Kourou, French Guiana – With a bright flash and a deep rumble, the future of satellite-delivered broadband services was lofted into orbit Thursday night. Eyeing the kind of speeds typically delivered by wired broadband services, ViaSat 2, ViaSat’s new high-powered satellite is designed to deliver 100 megabits per second, and possibly more, to individual subscribers. ViaSat 2, built by Boeing Commercial Satellite Systems and launched into successful orbit here aboard Arianespace's Ariane 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle, will provide 300 Gigabits per second of total throughput. ViaSat 2 is expected to enter into service in early 2018. “We’re still working on our plans, but we likely will have service plans that are up to 100 Mbps, and we may have some that are as high as 200 Mbps,” Mark Dankberg, chairman and CEO of ViaSat, said here in an interview just hours before Thursday’s launch. “The satellite’s capable of that. The real issue is how do we price those plans and how many subscribers we can put on them?” Though a 100-meg satellite-delivered broadband service is achievable, Dankberg believes that most of the company’s subscribers will be on tiers delivering less than that. But the launch of ViaSat 2 will give the company, which has about 659,000 satellite broadband subscribers, the ability to far exceed what it’s delivering in the U.S. today using a legacy satellite fleet that includes ViaSat 1 and those coming way of its 2009 acquisition of WildBlue Communications. RELATED: ViaSat To Acquire WildBlue For $568 Million Today, its top-end service, under the “Exede” brand, pumps out up to 25 Mbps in the downstream direction, and implements a broadband-usage policy to keep bandwidth usage in check. RELATED: ViaSat Rolls 25-Meg Satellite Broadband With the new satellite and its new bandwidth capabilities, Dankberg believes ViaSat will also have an opportunity to support and implement new, unlimited data policies. The ability to deliver faster speeds will give ViaSat a way to compete more directly with cable operators, telcos and other wired-based ISPs. But that won’t be the primary focus. “Our mission is to be a really good choice for the underserved – not necessarily for people who already have access to fiber-to-the-home or the most modern cable [high-speed Internet] service,” Dankberg said. “But the qualification I’m going to make to that is, we want to give that same experience to people who otherwise can’t get it.” ViaSat 2 will help to turn ViaSat into a bigger, regional provider of services that will also span government and enterprise customers while also enhancing its ability to deliver high-quality in-flight connectivity as well as broadband service to cruise ships. In addition to delivering gobs of bandwidth, ViaSat 2, at an orbital location of 22,236 miles above the earth’s equator (at 69.9 degrees west longitude), will enable ViaSat to expand coverage in North America, Central America, the Caribbean and a portion of northern South America. Key transportation routes between North America and Europe also are expected to benefit. And there's a lot more to come. “ViaSat has ambitions to be a global broadband services company,” Dankberg said. “This ViaSat 2 launch is a big step along the way for us towards that path.”  ViaSat’s grander global coverage plan will be coming way of its set of ViaSat 3 satellites. The first, which will expand and enhance ViaSat’s coverage in the Americas, is planned to launch in 2019, followed in 2020 by a satellite that will cover the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. ViaSat hasn’t announced when it expects to launch its third ViaSat 3 satellite, but it's slated to provide coverage in the Asia Pacific. Among other stats, ViaSat 2 packs 1.2 kilometers of coaxial cable, 37 kilometers of electrical wire, and more than 300 electronic boxes. At a wingspan of 46 meters, it’s about half the length of a rugby pitch, and a weight of 6,400 kilograms at launch, giving it the heft of about four mid-sized sedans, according to Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International.  “This is the largest commercial satellite that we've ever built,” Spiwak said. “This was a big one for us all,” he added following last night’s successful launch, while also extending his congratulations to ViaSat 2’s co-passenger aboard the Ariane 5, the Airbus-built Eutelsat 172B, an all-electric telecommunications satellite that will beef up capacity that includes in-flight and maritime connectivity, cellular backhaul, and service for video and government agencies in the Asia Pacific, from Alaska to Australia.  “You'll have to forgive me for having a big grin on my face after watching that spectacular launch,” Dankberg said. According to Spaceflight Now, the pairing of those satellites, valued at about $800 million, represented the heaviest and costliest commercial payload ever launched. Arianespace has posted a video of last night’s launch and details about the tricky maneuvers that followed:     More detail about the launch will be featured in the June 5 edition of Multichannel News.

"We have started experimentation, developmental planning and technology investment," said Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, Military Deputy, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Acquisition. The new aircraft, engineered to succeed the 5th-generation F-35 Joint StrikeFighter and explode onto the scene by the mid 2030s, is now in the earliest stages of conceptual development with the Air Force and Navy. The two services are now working together on early conceptual discussions about the types of technologies and capabilities the aircraft will contain. While the Air Force has not yet identified a platform for the new aircraft. The Air Force characterizes the effort in terms of a future capability called Next-Gen Air Dominance. While Bunch did not elaborate on the specifics of ongoing early efforts, he did make reference to the Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan which delineates some key elements of the service's strategy for a future platform. Fighter  jets in 20-years may likely contain the next-generation of stealth technoology, electronic warfare, sophisticated computer processing and algorithms, increased autonomy, hypersonic weapons and so-called "smart-skins" where sensors are built into the side of the aircraft itself. Some of these characteristics may have been on display more than a year ago when Northrop Grumman's SuperBowl AD revealed a flashy first look at its rendering of a new 6th-generation fighter jet. Northrop is one of a number of major defense industry manufacturers who will bid for a contract to build the new plane - when the time is right. While there are not many details available on this work, it is safe to assume Northrop is advancing concepts, technology and early design work toward this end. Boeing is also in the early phases of development of a 6th-gen design, according to a report in Defense News. The Navy's new aircraft will, at least in part, replace the existing inventory of F/A-18 Super Hornets which will start to retire by 2035, Navy officials said. The Navy vision for a future carrier air wing in 2040 and beyond is comprised of the carrier-launched variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35C, and legacy aircraft such as the EA-18G Growler electronic jamming aircraft. Also, around this time is when Navy planners envision its 6th generation aircraft to be ready, an aircraft which will likely be engineered for both manned and unmanned missions. Technologies are rapidly advancing in coatings, electromagnetic spectrum issues, artificial intelligence, maneuvering, superiority in sensing the battlespace, communications and data links, Navy leaders have said. Navy officials also add that the Navy is likely to develop new carrier-launched unmanned air vehicles in coming years as well. For instance, Northrop's historic X-47B demonstrator aircraft was the first unmanned system to successfully launch and land on the deck of an aircraft carrier. Analysts have speculated that as 6th generation developers seek to engineer a sixth-generation aircraft, they will likely explore a range of next-generation technologies such as maximum sensor connectivity, super cruise ability and an aircraft with electronically configured “smart skins.” Super cruise technology would enable the new fighter jet to cruise at supersonic speeds without needing afterburner, analysts have explained. As a result, super cruise brings a substantial tactical advantage because it allows for high-speed maneuvering without needing afterburner, therefore enable much longer on-location mission time. Such a scenario provides a time advantage as the aircraft would likely outlast a rival aircraft likely to run out of fuel earlier. The Air Force F-22 has a version of supercruise technology. Maximum connectivity would mean massively increased communications and sensor technology such as having an ability to achieve real-time connectivity with satellites, other aircraft and anything that could provide relevant battlefield information.The new aircraft might also seek to develop the ability to fire hypersonic weapons, however such a development would hinge upon successful progress with yet-to-be-proven technologies such as scramjets traveling at hypersonic speeds. Some tests of early renderings of this technology have been tested successfully and yet other attempts have failed. The Air Force Chief Scientist, Dr. Geoffrey Zacharias, has told Scout Warrior that the US anticipates having hypersonic weapons by the 2020s, hypersonic drones by the 2030s and recoverable hypersonic drone aircraft by the 2040s. There is little doubt that hypersonic technology, whether it be weaponry or propulsion, or both, will figure prominently into future aircraft designs. Smart aircraft skins would involve dispersing certain technologies or sensors across the fuselage and further integrating them into the aircraft itself, using next-generation computer algorithms to organize and display information for the pilot. We see some of this already in the F-35; the aircraft sensor fusion uses advanced computer technology to collect, organize and display combat relevant information from a variety of otherwise disparate sensors onto a single screen for pilots. In addition, Northrop's Distributed Aperture System is engineered to provide F-35 pilots with a 360-degree view of the battlespace. Cameras on the DAS are engineered into parts of the F-35 fuselage itself to reduce drag and lower the aircraft's radar signature. Smart skins with distributed electronics means that instead of having systems mounted on the aircraft, you would have apertures integrated on the skin of the aircraft, analysts have said.

By Associated Press June 2, 2017 10:20 BST Statolaunch, the world's largest plane, rolled out of its hangar for the first time on 31 May 2017.Stratolaunch Systems Corp. Billionaire Paul G. Allen's Stratolaunch, a massive aircraft designed to launch rockets into space from high altitude, has been rolled out of its hangar for the first time in preparation for testing. Here are things to know about the program that has been underway since 2011: Stratolaunch facts: Size The Stratolaunch aircraft is enormous, with a wingspan totalling 385 feet (117 metres), longer than the wingspan of any other aircraft and greater than the length of an American football field. Its twin fuselages stretch 238 feet. By comparison, the H-4 flying boat — nicknamed Spruce Goose and built by Howard Hughes in the 1940s — has a 320-foot (97.5-metre) wingspan and is just under 219 feet (67 metres) long. Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380's wings span 262 feet (nearly 80 metres). It's wingspan totals 385 feet (117 meters) - longer than any other aircraft in history.Stratolaunch Systems Stratolaunch facts: Weight and power The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds (226,799 kilograms) empty, can carry 250,000 pounds (113,399 kilograms) of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds (589,676 kilograms). It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. Stratolaunch facts: Air launch On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the centre of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites which can be impacted by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. The Stratolaunch will be used to carry rockets into the stratosphere.Stratolaunch Systems Stratolaunch facts: History Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and '60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. The plane is so big that it has two cockpits.Stratolaunch Systems Stratolaunch facts: What's next? The rollout Wednesday at Mojave Air & Space Port in the desert northeast of Los Angeles followed removal of scaffolding used during construction and placement of the aircraft on its 28 wheels for the first time. Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms are operating properly. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Even as the Trump administration seeks to roll back Obama-era rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants and leave the Paris climate agreement, Washington state is forging ahead with its own rules to cap carbon pollution from big industrial facilities. But the state faces legal challenges as it begins requiring large polluters such as RockTenn. (Ted S. Warren / Associated Press file photo) In Our View Editorial: If Trump won’t, state can keep climate commitments Fri Jun 2nd, 2017 1:30am Opinion You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By The Herald Editorial Board Now that President Trump has pulled the United States from working with 195 other nations as part of the Paris climate agreement — choosing instead to side with Syria and Nicaragua — what’s next, specifically for those of us in Washington state? Besides selling our snow skis and learning to like farm-raised salmon? Joking aside, there’s much for our state and its residents to do. Ironically, a Thurston County Superior Court is hearing arguments today regarding a suit by an industry group and four natural gas utilities, challenging the clean air rule adopted by the state Department of Ecology that and put into effect in January. The state rule is based on a similar commitment in the Paris agreement, in that it seeks a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A 2008 law, signed by then-Gov. Chris Gregoire, set goals of cutting emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to reduce emissions 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2035. Unable to get legislation passed that would have established a carbon cap-and-trade program, Gov. Jay Inslee directed the Department of Ecology in 2015 to draft a clean air rule that requires a gradual reduction in carbon from the state’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Directly, that’s power plants, oil refineries, natural gas utilities and manufacturers; indirectly, that’s all of us. The rule sets a cap on carbon emissions, requiring industrial producers to reduce emissions by 1.7 percent each year. The cap starts at 100,000 metric tons of carbon a year, and for the first three years will affect the state’s petroleum refineries and natural gas utilities. By 2020, the state’s petroleum importers — and by extension, motorists and other transportation users — will fall under the cap. The cap will be lowered every three years until it reaches 75,000 metric tons by 2035. The cap limit isn’t expected to reach Boeing’s Everett operations, for example, until 2035. Companies can comply with the cap limits by lowering their emissions outright, investing in projects that reduce carbon pollution or buying credits from others in an approved carbon-trading market. But industries and utilities are challenging the rule, claiming the state doesn’t have the authority to make the rule and that the rule isn’t necessary because Washington state is a leader among other states in low emissions. The courts will determine whether the state has the authority or not, but the state’s leadership in emissions — much of it thanks to the availability of hydro-power — doesn’t mean we can’t and shouldn’t do more. Inslee ordered the clean air rule to comply with the limits set by the Legislature in 2008, a commitment also required by court order from a lawsuit filed on behalf of eight children seeking greater action by the state to address climate change. Late in 2016, a study by the Department of Ecology said even deeper cuts to carbon emissions would be necessary between now and 2050 to adhere to the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting average increase of the global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Even if the clean air rule stands, the expected reduction by 2035 — about 16 million metric tons less than the 93 million metric tons recorded in 2013 — would fall far short of the 2008 goal of 66 million metric tons and the 2016 report’s updated goal of 53.2 million metric tons. One of the hurdles to reaching those goals has been the assumption that the economic costs of controlling carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions will be too great, but it ignores the economic advantages that could result. The state’s economic analysis of the clean air rule estimated that the costs to all businesses to comply — which, yes, are passed on to the consumer — could total as much as $6.9 billion over the next 20 years, but would be offset by $9.6 billion in benefits over the same period in improved environmental, health and other effects, the Associated Press reported in December. Others, also, are looking at how our response to climate change can be an economic engine in itself. The Association of Washington Cities and its Center for Quality Communities this year launched its Growing the Green Economy proposal, following work by Everett City Council member Paul Roberts and others, to develop an “eco-nomic” center in the state to foster the development of new technologies and products that address climate change, touching on a range of economic centers found throughout Snohomish County, the Puget Sound region and the state. With President Trump’s announcement, other nations, notably the largest carbon emitters China and India, have recommitted their nations to the Paris pact. Washington and other states can do the same. The reasons to carry on are clear, as stated in the Ecology report from December: “In recent years we have observed devastating wildfires, drought, lack of snowpack and increases in ocean acidification. These events are examples of what our future will look like if we fail to take action. While Washington cannot single-handedly solve climate change, we can do our part, and set an example for other states and jurisdictions.”   Most Read Neighbors worried about development next to former Everett dump EVERETT — Two groups of homeowners are asking the Snohomish County hearing… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Noah Haglund 2 charged after scuffle over stolen meat and a stab in the eye MARYSVILLE — A Snohomish woman was indignant that a grocery store manager… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Diana Hefley Anchor Pub hosts nontraditional church services once a month EVERETT — Their beliefs are traditional, but not much else.

Not only was it the first to launch from a private site, it was also the first to be powered by an engine made almost entirely using 3D printing. This might not make it the “first 3D-printed rocket in space” that some headlines described it as, but it does highlight how seriously this manufacturing technique is being taken by the space industry. Members of the team behind the Electron rocket at US company RocketLab say the engine was printed in 24 hours and provides efficiency and performance benefits over other systems. There’s not yet much information out there regarding the exact details of the 3D-printed components. But it’s likely many of them have been designed to minimise weight while maintaining their structural performance, while other components may have been optimised to provide efficient fluid flow. These advantages – reducing weight and the potential for complex new designs – are a large part of why 3D printing is expected to find some of its most significant applications in space exploration, with dramatic effect. One thing the set of technologies known as additive manufacturing or 3D printing does really well is to produce highly complicated shapes. For example, lattice structures produced in exactly the right way so that they weigh less but are just as strong as similar solid components. This creates the opportunity to produce optimised, lightweight parts that were previously impossible to manufacture economically or efficiently with more traditional techniques. Boeing’s microlattice is an example of taking this to the extreme, supposedly producing mechanically sound structures that are 99.9% air. Not all 3D printing processes can achieve this, but even weight savings of a few percent in aircraft and spacecraft can lead to major benefits through the use of less fuel. Play Credit: Boeing/ via YouTube.com 3D printing tends to work best for the production of relatively small, intricate parts rather than large, simple structures, where the higher material and processing costs would outweigh any advantage. For example, a redesigned nozzle can enhance fuel mixing within an engine, leading to better efficiency. Increasing the surface area of a heat shield by using a patterned rather than a flat surface can mean heat is transferred away more efficiently, reducing the chances of overheating. The techniques can also reduce the amount of material wasted in manufacturing, important because space components tend to be made from highly expensive and often rare materials. 3D printing can also produce whole systems in one go rather than from lots of assembled parts. For example, NASA used it to reduce the components in one of its rocket injectors from 115 to just two. Plus, 3D printers can easily make small numbers of a part – as the space industry often needs – without first creating expensive manufacturing tools. In orbit 3D printers are also likely to find a use in space itself, where it’s difficult to keep large numbers of spare parts and hard to send out for replacements when you’re thousands of kilometres from Earth. There’s now a 3D printer on the International Space Station so, if something breaks, engineers can send up a design for a replacement and the astronauts can print it out. The current printer only deals with plastic so it’s more likely to be used for making tools or one-off replacements for low-performance parts such as door handles. But once 3D printers can more easily use other materials, we’re likely to see an increase in their uses. One day, people in space could produce their own food items and even biological materials. Recycling facilities could also enable broken parts to be reused to make the replacements. Astro printing. Photo credit: Barry Wilmore/NASA Looking even further ahead, 3D printers could prove useful in building colonies. Places like the moon don’t have much in the way of traditional building materials, but the European Space Agency has proven solar energy can power the production of “bricks” of lunar dust, which would be a good start. Researchers are now looking at how to use 3D printing to take this idea further and develop complete printed buildings on the moon. To make many of these applications a reality, we’ll need to research more advanced materials and processes that can manufacture components to withstand the extremely harsh conditions of space. Engineers also need to work on developing optimised designs and find ways of testing 3D printed parts to prove they’re safe. And then there’s the irritating issue of gravity, or rather the lack of it. Many current processes use powders or liquids as their raw materials so we’re likely to need some clever tricks in order to make these function safely in a low or microgravity environment. Some of these barriers may even require entirely new materials and techniques. But as research goes on, 3D printing is likely to be used more and more in space, even if a fully printed space vehicle isn’t going to launch any time soon. The sky is no longer the limit.

In hubs along the west coast and in many other places besides, American industry is investing like there is no tomorrow in energy-efficient semi-conductors, cleaner power generation, batteries and electric cars. By one industry estimate, there are 2.2 million American jobs tied up in energy efficiency — from replacing clunky old heating and air conditioning through to the 6,000 workers engaged in geo-thermal power discoveries. The same lobby has even broken the jobs down into “red and blue” states to prove the point that clean energy is as big a deal in the combined Trump mid-west heartland — Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee — as it is in California. An estimated $100 billion is being ploughed into the sector via corporate investments, private equity and venture capital. Like all investors, those putting up the money were anxious that Mr Trump keep America in the Paris Climate Agreement. But now he has opted out, it doesn’t necessarily follow that the brakes are coming off US carbon emissions. Eleven per cent in eight years … Could US still meet its target? Barack Obama’s national pledge in Paris was to reduce US emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2025, using a 2005 measure as the starting point. Pressure from all sides The messy withdrawal from the Paris agreement is a reflection of the pressure the President’s been under to both stay in, and pull out, of the deal, writes Zoe Daniel. As America was already striving for a 17 per cent target by 2020, the Paris Agreement meant an extra effort of nine to 11 per cent. Analysts have been quick to cast doubt on whether the goal can be reached once the White House has ripped up the discipline imposed by an international agreement. But there is one certainty Mr Trump’s Rose Garden pronouncement does not change: his country is on a course towards carbon reduction that might be slowed, but cannot be stopped. Whether it is Boeing or Chevrolet’s pursuit of cleaner, quieter engines, Carrier’s invention of more efficient air conditioning or the construction of large lithium-ion battery centres springing up throughout California, there is too much at stake for American industry to turn back on securing some of the roughly $US1.4 trillion global spend on clean energy products. Besides, state governments remain active in carbon reduction through emissions trading, incentives to modernise or convert coal-fired power plants, vehicle fuel standards, rooftop solar incentives and energy-efficient building standards. Where do the dollars go? One of Mr Trump’s stated reasons for quitting the Paris Agreement was his objection to the US paying money into the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF), an investment bank with deposits from wealthier countries to fund climate mitigation works in poorer nations. The fund’s board is currently chaired by Australia, which has contributed $200 million. “So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars and we’re already way ahead of anybody else,” Mr Trump said. “Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything. And many of them will never pay one dime.” What is the Paris climate deal? What did countries say they would do under the terms of the Paris climate accord, and how will it be funded? In his Rose Garden speech, Mr Trump highlighted America’s $US20 trillion in debt and referred to UN officials wanting $US100 billion “per year” for the GCF — he also spoke of its executive director aspiring to get funding increases of “$US450 billion per year after 2020”. He may fret about future US financial exposure, but failed to mention there is an effective cap on the initial pledge made by Mr Obama when he sought to build international consensus for the Paris meeting. Of the $US3 billion Mr Obama originally committed, only $US1 billion has so far been paid and half of that was made in a last-minute $US500 million payment slipped out on his third-last day in the Oval Office in January. Even without further US contributions, the GCF is meant to have almost $US200 billion in its account by 2020, due to contributions by other governments and private donations. As yet, there are no indications that any country will be asked to make up what appears to be a $US2 billion hole created by Mr Trump’s decision. Promises, promises… The President has couched his decision as one that “protects the environment, our companies, our citizens and our country”. It certainly fulfils an election promise, but it is not safe to assume that America’s companies or its environment need or want the sort of “protection” the White House is providing. The withdrawal suggests the White House is rigidly intent on fulfilling chief strategist Steve Bannon’s quest to “deconstruct the administrative state” while ignoring the fact the US economy is propelled by an in-built commercial inertia to decarbonise the atmospheric state. In that conflict, the smart money should be on America’s corporate cowboys, its states and its mighty research and development institutions prevailing — that’s what they’re good at Leave a comment Click here to cancel reply.

SCOUT Sign In Air Force Has Begun Experimentation, Planning and Investments for a 6th Generation Fighter to Come After the F-35 Scout Warrior Thursday at 9:09 PM / Originally published onWarrior The Pentagon's 6th Generation Fighter may be stealthy and will likely have next-generation computers, electronic warfare technology, speed, weapons and sensors The Air Force has begun experimenting and conceptual planning for a 6th generation fighter aircraft to emerge in coming years as a technological step beyond the F-35, service leaders said.  "We have started experimentation, developmental planning and technology investment," said Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, Military Deputy, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Acquisition.  The new aircraft, engineered to succeed the 5th-generation F-35 Joint StrikeFighter and explode onto the scene by the mid 2030s, is now in the earliest stages of conceptual development with the Air Force and Navy. The two services are now working together on early conceptual discussions about the types of technologies and capabilities the aircraft will contain. While the Air Force has not yet identified a platform for the new aircraft. The Air Force characterizes the effort in terms of a future capability called Next-Gen Air Dominance. While Bunch did not elaborate on the specifics of ongoing early efforts, he did make reference to the Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan which delineates some key elements of the service's strategy for a future platform.  Fighter  jets in 20-years may likely contain the next-generation of stealth technoology, electronic warfare, sophisticated computer processing and algorithms, increased autonomy, hypersonic weapons and so-called "smart-skins" where sensors are built into the side of the aircraft itself.  Some of these characteristics may have been on display more than a year ago when Northrop Grumman's SuperBowl AD revealed a flashy first look at its rendering of a new 6th-generation fighter jet. Northrop is one of a number of major defense industry manufacturers who will bid for a contract to build the new plane - when the time is right. While there are not many details available on this work, it is safe to assume Northrop is advancing concepts, technology and early design work toward this end. Boeing is also in the early phases of development of a 6th-gen design, according to a report in Defense News.  The Navy's new aircraft will, at least in part, replace the existing inventory of F/A-18 Super Hornets which will start to retire by 2035, Navy officials said.  The Navy vision for a future carrier air wing in 2040 and beyond is comprised of the carrier-launched variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35C, and legacy aircraft such as the EA-18G Growler electronic jamming aircraft. Also, around this time is when Navy planners envision its 6th generation aircraft to be ready, an aircraft which will likely be engineered for both manned and unmanned missions. Technologies are rapidly advancing in coatings, electromagnetic spectrum issues, artificial intelligence, maneuvering, superiority in sensing the battlespace, communications and data links, Navy leaders have said. Northrop Grumman   Navy officials also add that the Navy is likely to develop new carrier-launched unmanned air vehicles in coming years as well. For instance, Northrop's historic X-47B demonstrator aircraft was the first unmanned system to successfully launch and land on the deck of an aircraft carrier.  Analysts have speculated that as 6th generation developers seek to engineer a sixth-generation aircraft, they will likely explore a range of next-generation technologies such as maximum sensor connectivity, super cruise ability and an aircraft with electronically configured “smart skins.”  Super cruise technology would enable the new fighter jet to cruise at supersonic speeds without needing afterburner, analysts have explained. As a result, super cruise brings a substantial tactical advantage because it allows for high-speed maneuvering without needing afterburner, therefore enable much longer on-location mission time. Such a scenario provides a time advantage as the aircraft would likely outlast a rival aircraft likely to run out of fuel earlier. The Air Force F-22 has a version of supercruise technology.  Maximum connectivity would mean massively increased communications and sensor technology such as having an ability to achieve real-time connectivity with satellites, other aircraft and anything that could provide relevant battlefield information.The new aircraft might also seek to develop the ability to fire hypersonic weapons, however such a development would hinge upon successful progress with yet-to-be-proven technologies such as scramjets traveling at hypersonic speeds. Some tests of early renderings of this technology have been tested successfully and yet other attempts have failed. The Air Force Chief Scientist, Dr. Geoffrey Zacharias, has told Scout Warrior that the US anticipates having hypersonic weapons by the 2020s, hypersonic drones by the 2030s and recoverable hypersonic drone aircraft by the 2040s. There is little doubt that hypersonic technology, whether it be weaponry or propulsion, or both, will figure prominently into future aircraft designs.  Smart aircraft skins would involve dispersing certain technologies or sensors across the fuselage and further integrating them into the aircraft itself, using next-generation computer algorithms to organize and display information for the pilot. We see some of this already in the F-35; the aircraft sensor fusion uses advanced computer technology to collect, organize and display combat relevant information from a variety of otherwise disparate sensors onto a single screen for pilots. In addition, Northrop's Distributed Aperture System is engineered to provide F-35 pilots with a 360-degree view of the battlespace. Cameras on the DAS are engineered into parts of the F-35 fuselage itself to reduce drag and lower the aircraft's radar signature.  Northrop Grumman Smart skins with distributed electronics means that instead of having systems mounted on the aircraft, you would have apertures integrated on the skin of the aircraft, analysts have said.  This could reduce drag, increase speed and maneuverability while increasing the technological ability of the sensors. It is also possible that the new 6th-generation fighter could use advanced, futuristic stealth technology able to enable newer, more capable air defenses. The air defenses of potential adversaries are increasingly using faster computing processing power and are better networked together, more digital, able to detect a wider range of frequencies and able to detect stealthy aircraft at farther distances.  The new 6th-generation fighter will also likely fire lasers and have the ability to launch offensive electronic attacks.

The aircraft will undergo ground tests in preparation for flights in which the aircraft will launch rockets from high altitude. Stratolaunch Systems Corp. via AP) Business June 01, 2017 9:07 PM Enormous Stratolaunch aircraft rolled out for first time By JOHN ANTCZAK Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story LOS ANGELES Billionaire Paul G. Allen's Stratolaunch, a massive aircraft designed to launch rockets into space from high altitude, has been rolled out of its hangar for the first time in preparation for testing. Here are things to know about the program that has been underway since 2011: ___ GIGANTIC The Stratolaunch aircraft is enormous, with a wingspan totaling 385 feet (117 meters), longer than the wingspan of any other aircraft and greater than the length of an American football field. Its twin fuselages stretch 238 feet. By comparison, the H-4 flying boat — nicknamed Spruce Goose and built by Howard Hughes in the 1940s — has a 320-foot (97.5-meter) wingspan and is just under 219 feet (67 meters) long. Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380's wings span 262 feet (nearly 80 meters). ___ WEIGHT AND POWER The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds (226,799 kilograms) empty, can carry 250,000 pounds (113,399 kilograms) of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds (589,676 kilograms). It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. ___ AIR LAUNCH On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the center of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites which can be impacted by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. ___ HISTORY Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and '60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. ___ WHAT'S NEXT The rollout Wednesday at Mojave Air & Space Port in the desert northeast of Los Angeles followed removal of scaffolding used during construction and placement of the aircraft on its 28 wheels for the first time. Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms are operating properly. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

America's most successful free-wheeling corporate cowboys, and girls, don't care much for governments, their laws and their taxes — they invent, invest, manufacture, buy and sell in spite of such meddlesome annoyances. In hubs along the west coast and in many other places besides, American industry is investing like there is no tomorrow in energy-efficient semi-conductors, cleaner power generation, batteries and electric cars. By one industry estimate, there are 2.2 million American jobs tied up in energy efficiency — from replacing clunky old heating and air conditioning through to the 6,000 workers engaged in geo-thermal power discoveries. The same lobby has even broken the jobs down into "red and blue" states to prove the point that clean energy is as big a deal in the combined Trump mid-west heartland — Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee — as it is in California. An estimated $100 billion is being ploughed into the sector via corporate investments, private equity and venture capital. Like all investors, those putting up the money were anxious that Mr Trump keep America in the Paris Climate Agreement. But now he has opted out, it doesn't necessarily follow that the brakes are coming off US carbon emissions. Eleven per cent in eight years … Could US still meet its target? Barack Obama's national pledge in Paris was to reduce US emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2025, using a 2005 measure as the starting point. Pressure from all sides The messy withdrawal from the Paris agreement is a reflection of the pressure the President's been under to both stay in, and pull out, of the deal, writes Zoe Daniel. As America was already striving for a 17 per cent target by 2020, the Paris Agreement meant an extra effort of nine to 11 per cent. Analysts have been quick to cast doubt on whether the goal can be reached once the White House has ripped up the discipline imposed by an international agreement. But there is one certainty Mr Trump's Rose Garden pronouncement does not change: his country is on a course towards carbon reduction that might be slowed, but cannot be stopped. Whether it is Boeing or Chevrolet's pursuit of cleaner, quieter engines, Carrier's invention of more efficient air conditioning or the construction of large lithium-ion battery centres springing up throughout California, there is too much at stake for American industry to turn back on securing some of the roughly $US1.4 trillion global spend on clean energy products. Besides, state governments remain active in carbon reduction through emissions trading, incentives to modernise or convert coal-fired power plants, vehicle fuel standards, rooftop solar incentives and energy-efficient building standards. Where do the dollars go? One of Mr Trump's stated reasons for quitting the Paris Agreement was his objection to the US paying money into the UN's Green Climate Fund (GCF), an investment bank with deposits from wealthier countries to fund climate mitigation works in poorer nations. The fund's board is currently chaired by Australia, which has contributed $200 million. "So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars and we're already way ahead of anybody else," Mr Trump said. "Many of the other countries haven't spent anything. And many of them will never pay one dime." What is the Paris climate deal? What did countries say they would do under the terms of the Paris climate accord, and how will it be funded? In his Rose Garden speech, Mr Trump highlighted America's $US20 trillion in debt and referred to UN officials wanting $US100 billion "per year" for the GCF — he also spoke of its executive director aspiring to get funding increases of "$US450 billion per year after 2020". He may fret about future US financial exposure, but failed to mention there is an effective cap on the initial pledge made by Mr Obama when he sought to build international consensus for the Paris meeting. Of the $US3 billion Mr Obama originally committed, only $US1 billion has so far been paid and half of that was made in a last-minute $US500 million payment slipped out on his third-last day in the Oval Office in January. Even without further US contributions, the GCF is meant to have almost $US200 billion in its account by 2020, due to contributions by other governments and private donations. As yet, there are no indications that any country will be asked to make up what appears to be a $US2 billion hole created by Mr Trump's decision. Promises, promises… The President has couched his decision as one that "protects the environment, our companies, our citizens and our country". It certainly fulfils an election promise, but it is not safe to assume that America's companies or its environment need or want the sort of "protection" the White House is providing. The withdrawal suggests the White House is rigidly intent on fulfilling chief strategist Steve Bannon's quest to "deconstruct the administrative state" while ignoring the fact the US economy is propelled by an in-built commercial inertia to decarbonise the atmospheric state. In that conflict, the smart money should be on America's corporate cowboys, its states and its mighty research and development institutions prevailing — that's what they're good at.

(Stratolaunch Systems Corp./AP) LOS ANGELES (AP) - Billionaire Paul G. Allen’s Stratolaunch, a massive aircraft designed to launch rockets into space from high altitude, has been rolled out of its hangar for the first time in preparation for testing. Here are things to know about the program that has been underway since 2011: GIGANTIC The Stratolaunch aircraft is enormous, with a wingspan totaling 385 feet (117 meters), longer than the wingspan of any other aircraft and greater than the length of an American football field. Its twin fuselages stretch 238 feet. By comparison, the H-4 flying boat — nicknamed Spruce Goose and built by Howard Hughes in the 1940s — has a 320-foot (97.5-meter) wingspan and is just under 219 feet (67 meters) long. Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380’s wings span 262 feet (nearly 80 meters). WEIGHT AND POWER The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds (226,799 kilograms) empty, can carry 250,000 pounds (113,399 kilograms) of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds (589,676 kilograms). It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. AIR LAUNCH On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the center of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites which can be impacted by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. HISTORY Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and ’60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. WHAT’S NEXT The rollout Wednesday at Mojave Air & Space Port in the desert northeast of Los Angeles followed removal of scaffolding used during construction and placement of the aircraft on its 28 wheels for the first time. Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms are operating properly. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

Arianespace Celebrates Launch of ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B Bon chance! and indeed, all went well on a June 1 evening for the Ariane 5 whisking its payload to get ready to transfer the dual-satellite payload of ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B into geostationary transfer orbit. Liftoff of the Ariane 5 took place at the opening of a one hour window, with the launch marked 23:45 UTC at the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana. This is Arianespace’s sixth mission overall in 2017 in which ViaSat-2 will be released first which is designated Flight VA237 in Arianespace’s launcher family numbering system. The spacecraft, with a liftoff mass estimated at 6,418 kg., will be operated from an orbital position of 70 degrees West by ViaSat, a global broadband services and technology company based in Carlsbad, California. The Boeing-built ViaSat-2 relay platform is designed to bring considerable improvements in terms of speed, lower costs and extended broadband coverage within its footprint, which includes North and Central America, plus the Caribbean, northern South America, and the aeronautical and maritime routes in the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe. Completing Flight VA237 will be EUTELSAT 172B’s deployment by Ariane 5. This spacecraft will join the fleet of Paris-based Eutelsat, a leading satellite operator in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and has a liftoff mass set at 3,551 kg. EUTELSAT 172B is to be located at an orbital position of 172 deg. East for Asia-Pacific reach over land and sea from Alaska to Australia, delivering increased capacity for fast-growing applications that include in-flight and maritime connectivity, cellular backhaul, corporate networks, video distribution and government services. The spacecraft was built by Airbus as the initial all-electric telecommunications satellite produced in Europe—and the first of its type to be orbited by Ariane 5.

It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. ___ —Stratolaunch Systems Corp. via AP 3. Air launch On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the center of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites which can be impacted by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. ___ 4. History Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and ’60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. Advertisement More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. ___ —Stratolaunch Systems Corp. via AP 5. What’s next The rollout Wednesday at Mojave Air & Space Port in the desert northeast of Los Angeles followed removal of scaffolding used during construction and placement of the aircraft on its 28 wheels for the first time. Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms are operating properly. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

ViaSat-2, which is to be stationed above the Americas, has a total throughput capacity of about 300 gigabits per second. The spacecraft was part of a dual payload on the Ariane flight. It was joined by Eutelsat 172B, a UK/French-built platform to go over the Pacific. Both satellites will be chasing the rampant market for wi-fi on aeroplanes. Airlines are currently in a headlong rush to equip their fleets with connections that will allow passengers to use their mobile devices in mid-air. More than 6,000 commercial aircraft worldwide were offering an onboard wi-fi service in 2016; it is expected more than 17,000 will be doing so by 2021. In-flight internet has traditionally had a terrible reputation, but there is a feeling now that the latest technology really can give passengers a meaningful slice of bandwidth and at a competitive price. Inmarsat rides SpaceX Falcon Intelsat rolls out next-gen system Image copyright VIASAT Image caption Artwork: ViaSat-2 will be positioned 36,000km above the equator at 69 degrees West The Ariane left the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana at 20:45 local time, Thursday (23:45 GMT), ejecting the satellites into their transfer orbits about half an hour later. Both must now get themselves into their final positions. Noteworthy is the fact that ViaSat-2 and 172B will be using electric engines to do this. These work by accelerating and expelling ions at high speed. The process provides less thrust than a standard chemical engine, but saves substantially on propellant mass. Image copyright AIRBUS DS Image caption Eutelsat-172B is the first satellite from Airbus to use all-electric propulsion for orbit-raising and station-keeping That saving can be traded to get either a lower-priced launch ticket, or to pack even greater capacity into the satellite's communications payload for no additional weight. The US, Boeing-built ViaSat-2 uses a mix of chemical and electric propulsion, but Eutelsat's platform is all-electric - the first such design to come from Europe's biggest space manufacturer, Airbus. ViaSat-2 will be providing broadband services to fixed customers across North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and a portion of northern South America. But the satellite is also configured to service planes and ships, and in particular it is looking to grab a significant share of business out over the Atlantic. The aviation sector currently is a key battleground for satellite operators; it is where they are seeing double-digit growth. In the US, working with airlines such as JetBlue, ViaSat has already found success through its existing high-throughput ViaSat-1 spacecraft. With the extra capacity on ViaSat-2, it aims to do better still. "We think people want to use their devices in the air the way they do on the ground; that's the bet we've made," said ViaSat Chief Operating Officer Rick Baldridge. "JetBlue delayed their in-flight wi-fi offering, waiting for us, and now they're giving it away for free and we're providing 12 megabits per second to every seat, including streaming video," he told BBC News. ViaSat-2's "footprint" touches the western coast of Europe, but aeroplanes travelling further east will be handed seamlessly to a better-positioned Eutelsat spacecraft, which should enable passengers to stay connected all the way across to Turkey if needs be. This is one of the benefits of the strategic alliance that the two satellite companies have formed. And in time this will see the pair operate a ViaSat-3 platform together over Europe. This spacecraft is being built to have a total throughput capacity of one terabit per second. Image copyright AIRBUS DS Image caption 172B has a 3D printed bracket (far right) holding an antenna to the satellite. This component is 35% lighter than the conventionally produced bracket (far left) From its position very close to the International Date Line, Eutelsat's 172B spacecraft is going to target - amongst other business - the flight corridors of the Asia-Pacific region. And it has some very smart British technology to do this in the form of a multi port amplifier. This can flexibly switch power between the satellite's 11 spot beams to make sure the available bandwidth is always focused where it is needed most - whether that be on the planes moving east-west from Japan to California, say, or when they go in the other direction as a cluster at a different time of day. "To oversimplify, in-flight connectivity has mostly been restricted to the US. But now it is expanding into the Asia-Pacific region and it's also coming to Europe," said Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat's chief executive officer. "We see spontaneous demand from airlines and it's booming. It's true the technology hasn't always delivered, but you will see with the introduction of very high throughput satellites in the next few years that we will be able to… bring a massive quantity of bandwidth onboard the plane, meaning you can stream Netflix in HD. That's a game-changer." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In-flight connectivity is a key battleground for the satellite operators Euroconsult is one of the world's leading analyst groups following the satellite industry. Its research confirms the rapid growth now taking place, and says this will only accelerate. Euroconsult's recent report on in-flight-connectivity (IFC) predicted nearly half of all commercial planes would be enabled by 2021, pushing revenues for the suppliers of onboard services from $1bn to $6.5bn inside 10 years. But Euroconsult's CEO, Pacôme Revillon, said there will be winners and losers in this IFC race and this would likely be decided in the very near future. "Going to 2020, approximately 50% of aircraft could have opted for their chosen connectivity solutions, and certainly all of the major airlines will have made that choice. By that stage the market share could decide who are the winners and losers, and we anticipate seeing some consolidation in this sector, with two to three companies coming to dominate the market," he told BBC News.

"The idea is to have two test motorcycles," Doug Rombough, vice president of business development for Logos, told Stars and Stripes. The vehicles, which will also carry equipment, will be equipped with front-wheel drive.  © AP Photo/ Northrop Grumman Corp Space Ghost: Boeing and DARPA Team Up for New Hypersonic Spaceplane Since 2015 Logos has been developing the hybrid electric dirt bike known as the SilentHawk, and is also making progress on a multi-fuel hybrid with an air-cooled engine, as well as an all-electric motorcycle. The SilentHawk’s drive system will make it easier to start the vehicle on a steep hill, which for a conventional motorcycle is typically a difficult task, according to lead engineer Alex Dzwill. He said, "On a typical dirt bike you would use a ton of power trying to move in sand … With the front-wheel drive you can climb out of it without using too much power." The recreation dirt bike on which the SilentHawk is based was created by Alta Motors in California. It weighs 267 pounds and costs $15,000. © Photo: Pixabay 'Watt' a Shocker! New DARPA Project Seeks to Electrically Rewire Human Brains Dzwill said that on off-road terrain the bike has a range of 40-50 miles, which increases to 170 miles once a multi-fuel generator is added. He also noted that it will be able to power electronic equipment in the field and that the range extender will be easy to remove and replace. Rombough said, "Soldiers could be sitting on a hill and top up the battery with the generator and charge up other gear … They are carrying more and more equipment that has to be powered so it’s a great benefit." He added that the US Marine Corps and Army, as well as foreign militaries have expressed interest in the SilentHawk, though Logos still has a year to develop the vehicle. "The DARPA program calls for a lightweight, rugged, single-track vehicle that can operate near-silently for extended periods while transporting small numbers of troops over hostile terrain," according to Logos. "Operators will benefit from the near-silent capability and ease of operation of an all-electric vehicle, along with the adaptable power generation and extended range of a multifuel internal combustion engine. The bike will also offer the capability to provide supplemental power for electric devices in the field." ...

Allen’s Stratolaunch, a massive aircraft designed to launch rockets into space from high altitude, has been rolled out of its hangar for the first time in preparation for testing. Here are things to know about the program that has been underway since 2011: ___ GIGANTIC The Stratolaunch aircraft is enormous, with a wingspan totaling 385 feet (117 meters), longer than the wingspan of any other aircraft and greater than the length of an American football field. Its twin fuselages stretch 238 feet. By comparison, the H-4 flying boat — nicknamed Spruce Goose and built by Howard Hughes in the 1940s — has a 320-foot (97.5-meter) wingspan and is just under 219 feet (67 meters) long. Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380’s wings span 262 feet (nearly 80 meters). ___ WEIGHT AND POWER The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds (226,799 kg) empty, can carry 250,000 pounds (113,399 kg) of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds (589,676 kg). It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. ___ AIR LAUNCH On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the center of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kg) to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites, which can be impacted by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. ___ HISTORY Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and ’60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. ___ WHAT’S NEXT The rollout Wednesday at Mojave Air & Space Port in the desert northeast of Los Angeles followed removal of scaffolding used during construction and placement of the aircraft on its 28 wheels for the first time. Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms are operating properly. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board released reports detailing the pilots’ actions, the weather and the plane’s performance. The accident investigation agency hasn’t yet concluded the cause of the Oct. 27 incident. None of the nine crew members and 39 passengers, including Pence, were hurt. The  Eastern Air Lines Group Inc. pilots landed on a rainy night with a tail-wind, which can make it harder to slow down. After the aircraft came to a stop, both the pilots said they should have aborted the touchdown rather than attempting to land with such little stopping distance remaining, according to the cockpit transcript. The plane’s flight data showed it touched down 4,242 feet (1,293 meters) beyond the start of the runway, more than half way down the 7,001-foot landing strip’s length, according to NTSB. Touchdown Regrets “My career just ended,” Captain Robert Galloway said seconds after the plane came to a stop. “We should have went around,” copilot Diego Restrepo replied, referring to aborting the touchdown, a flight procedure known as a go-around. Galloway agreed. While the multiple reports issued by NTSB didn’t attempt to identify causes of the incident, performance of the flight crew will be a focus. The plane leveled off as it neared the ground -- which Boeing’s flight manual said should be avoided. It also was flying higher than the recommended path to the runway, according to NTSB. Pilots are generally supposed to break off a landing if that happens. In addition, the captain took control of the plane after the touchdown, but didn’t announce what he was doing, according to the records. The touchdown was farther down the runway than the 3,000 feet NTSB had initially estimated in a preliminary report Nov. 22. Boeing recommends landing within 2,333 feet of the start of the LaGuardia runway, according to NTSB records. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(NYSE: LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson said she could see up to $28 billion in new business for Lockheed alone as a result of President Trump’s recent announcement that the Saudis would purchase up to $110 billion in weapons from the United States. Not to be outdone, Boeing Co.’s (NYSE: BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg reportedly said Boeing’s share of the Saudi pie could be worth more than $50 billion, including both military and commercial sales. He did not specify the value of the military portion by itself. A large portion of these estimates are no doubt down to maintenance and sustainment deals that can run for periods as long as 30 years, so don’t expect either company’s revenues to surge over the next quarter or two. In fact, the sustainment part of these kinds of deals typically amounts to 70% of the total value. Foreign weapons sales take a long to time to negotiate and a long time to deliver. Congress must be notified of a pending deal and that is a potential minefield. If the sale is not stopped there, then the contracts must be drawn up between the manufacturer and the country before manufacturing and delivery begin. Payments for the hardware typically begin when the contract is signed, followed by a future payment when the actual unit gets to the assembly line, and then the final payment is received when the system is delivered. Then the sustainment payments begin. In 2012 the Saudis received the okay to acquire 25 C-130 aircraft, some as tankers and some the basic cargo hauler. So far the country has purchased just two, and the rest likely fall under this newly announced deal. Lockheed’s Hewson told Aerospace Daily that the Saudis are looking for four multimission warships and Lockheed is proposing a variant of its Littoral Combat Ship. Lockheed and a Saudi state company also agreed to form a joint venture to support final assembly and completion of about 150 S-70 Black Hawk utility helicopters. She also said that Lockheed’s THAAD and PAC-3 missile systems may be on the Saudi shopping list. There has been no report of what Boeing might be selling to Saudi Arabia, but expect to hear something soon.

Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380's wings span 262 feet (nearly 80 metres). ___ WEIGHT AND POWER The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds (226,799 kilograms) empty, can carry 250,000 pounds (113,399 kilograms) of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds (589,676 kilograms). It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. ___ AIR LAUNCH On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the centre of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) to low Earth orbit.

Allen's Stratolaunch, a massive aircraft designed to launch rockets into space from high altitude, has been rolled out of its hangar for the first time in preparation for testing. Here are things to know about the program that has been underway since 2011: ___ GIGANTIC The Stratolaunch aircraft is enormous, with a wingspan totalling 385 feet (117 metres ), longer than the wingspan of any other aircraft and greater than the length of an American football field. Its twin fuselages stretch 238 feet. By comparison, the H-4 flying boat — nicknamed Spruce Goose and built by Howard Hughes in the 1940s — has a 320-foot (97.5-meter) wingspan and is just under 219 feet (67 metres ) long. Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380's wings span 262 feet (nearly 80 metres ). ___ WEIGHT AND POWER The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds (226,799 kilograms) empty, can carry 250,000 pounds (113,399 kilograms) of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds (589,676 kilograms). It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. ___ AIR LAUNCH On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the centre of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites which can be impacted by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. ___ HISTORY Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and '60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. ___ WHAT'S NEXT The rollout Wednesday at Mojave Air & Space Port in the desert northeast of Los Angeles followed removal of scaffolding used during construction and placement of the aircraft on its 28 wheels for the first time. Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms are operating properly. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

Details Published: 2017-06-01 21:04:20 Updated: 2017-06-02 11:06:05 Comments Increase Text Size Print this story Business Enormous Stratolaunch aircraft rolled out for first time Posted 9:04 p.m. Thursday Updated 11:06 a.m. Friday Leave this field blank Your e-mail address:* Your friends e-mail addresses (comma separated):* Subject:* Message:*A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/18E1D Get a new codeAre you human?* You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters By JOHN ANTCZAK, Associated Press LOS ANGELES — Billionaire Paul G. Allen's Stratolaunch, a massive aircraft designed to launch rockets into space from high altitude, has been rolled out of its hangar for the first time in preparation for testing. Here are things to know about the program that has been underway since 2011: ___ GIGANTIC The Stratolaunch aircraft is enormous, with a wingspan totaling 385 feet (117 meters), longer than the wingspan of any other aircraft and greater than the length of an American football field. Its twin fuselages stretch 238 feet. By comparison, the H-4 flying boat — nicknamed Spruce Goose and built by Howard Hughes in the 1940s — has a 320-foot (97.5-meter) wingspan and is just under 219 feet (67 meters) long. Among commonly seen aircraft, the double-decker Airbus A380's wings span 262 feet (nearly 80 meters). ___ WEIGHT AND POWER The Stratolaunch aircraft weighs 500,000 pounds (226,799 kilograms) empty, can carry 250,000 pounds (113,399 kilograms) of fuel, and with payload can take off at a maximum weight of 1.3 million pounds (589,676 kilograms). It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. ___ AIR LAUNCH On launch missions, Stratolaunch will carry as many as three rockets attached to the center of the wing between the two fuselages. The rockets will be released, ignite their engines and carry small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) to low Earth orbit. Under a deal announced last year, Stratolaunch will use Pegasus XL winged rockets provided by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia. According to Stratolaunch, the advantages of its system include being able to use numerous airports and avoid the limitations of fixed launch sites which can be impacted by weather, air traffic and ship traffic on ocean ranges. ___ HISTORY Airborne launches date back decades, most famously to the X-15 program of the 1950s and '60s, when manned rocket planes were carried aloft under the wing of a B-52 bomber and released on hypersonic research flights. In the 1990s, Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) began releasing rockets from the belly of a converted L-1011 airliner to put small satellites into low Earth orbit. More recently, Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, funded development of the Burt Rutan-designed SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned spacecraft. Suspended between the twin-fuselages of a special jet, SpaceShipOne was carried to high altitude and released. It reached space on three suborbital flights in 2004. The same launch concept is being used for SpaceShipTwo, the passenger-carrying craft being developed for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise. A spinoff, Virgin Orbit, is also developing an air launcher for putting small satellites into space. ___ WHAT'S NEXT The rollout Wednesday at Mojave Air & Space Port in the desert northeast of Los Angeles followed removal of scaffolding used during construction and placement of the aircraft on its 28 wheels for the first time. Initial testing will focus on filling the six fuel tanks to ensure they are properly sealed and that related mechanisms are operating properly. The aircraft will then be taken back inside the hangar for weight and balance testing. Ground testing will lead to flight operations and the first launch demonstration, which is expected in 2019.

Columnist Sonjoy Ganguly explains how implementing a rich, B2B-focused data structure and collaborating with the right strategic partners can make all the difference. Sonjoy Ganguly on May 31, 2017 at 10:07 am More In digital media and advertising, data management platforms (DMPs) have become an essential tool that “ingests, classifies, sorts and houses information, and then delivers it in a way that’s useful for marketers, publishers and other businesses.” But for B2B marketers, these tools have a major flaw. As the name implies, B2B marketers sell into organizations (e.g., General Electric, Boeing, Nestle), not individual consumer demos (e.g., millennial male in New York DMA, $100K+ income, in market for SUVs). Traditional advertising technologies and data management practices, to date, have predominantly focused on managing individuals rather than companies. That is core to the issue: How do you market to the right companies if existing systems and practices are predicated upon targeting individual consumers? B2B marketers don’t benefit from solutions that allow them to target “soccer moms,” “tech-savvy millennials” or other consumer-based lookalike audiences. They need a much more precise and relevant targeting scheme. For example, the CMO at an enterprise software company with long sales cycles (nine to 18 months) needs to simultaneously monitor, analyze and surface insights on cross-departmental stakeholders across levels of seniority and diversity, all within discrete organizations. At large corporations, this can include the Financial Analysts, Director of Finance, CFO, VP Engineering, CTO, Architects, Engineering Directors, Procurement Managers and dozens of other business stakeholders, from the first introductory call to a signed contract and through the process of onboarding, as well as utilization. With B2B marketing and advertising spend reaching $161 billion — and digital accounting for over half — B2B CMOs and CIOs need to dramatically change their data management approach to avoid drowning in irrelevant data and legacy systems that were designed for an entirely different practice. This is only possible by reorganizing their data infrastructure around B2B’s unique go-to-market needs and working with partners that support these new standards. First things first: Extend company attributes Basic audience targeting is too broad and is just not an effective mechanism for B2B marketers. B2C marketers now have a seemingly endless pool of data to define target audiences across devices, from historical purchases and behavioral data to location-based visitor arrivals. But ask any B2B marketer, and their targeting parameters look awfully similar to ones found in playbooks from several years ago: industry, company size (employees), revenue (if public) and office headquarters’ locations. B2B CMOs need to significantly expand the company attributes they track — ones that provide signals that are uniquely relevant to the products and services they sell — and allow sales and marketing teams to communicate more tailored messages by account. These can range anywhere from, “What other software is installed?” and “Which types of solutions are they researching?” to “How much do they currently spend on R&D?” Once the extended attributes are strategically identified, CMOs must persistently incorporate these new signals throughout their internal systems to keep alignment across teams. These new signals require organizational commitment to adopt new procedures that utilize and act on the signals to improve their marketing effectiveness. Build out a rich company-user ontology Once more granular and vivid company-based information becomes ingrained throughout the marketing and sales organizations, it behooves CMOs and their CIOs to further build out a rich ontology. With the exponential growth of data (which also includes more user-generated content than ever before), creating taxonomies to classify and categorize the data is absolutely critical to making these massive unstructured data assets actionable at scale. But the sheer volume and the denormalized nature of this data make it very complex to classify it correctly. At best, traditional DMPs, integrated with other existing targeting solutions, might allow a B2B marketer at an enterprise software company to target individuals with “CTO” in their title, at companies of a specific employee or revenue size, and located in certain DMAs or cities. The problem with this approach is that CTOs may not always represent the right stakeholder to engage on an account-by-account basis. Maybe the account is not actively looking for your solutions, which means your standard messaging may not be as effective with that account. In other words, the appropriate audiences at prospective accounts can differ starkly, based on sizes of the accounts, an account’s existing needs and more. By creating a more robust ontology, B2B marketers can use these extended attributes to better inform and influence their list of target accounts, which people to actually target at those accounts and what messaging may be more effective in engaging those accounts. Find the right long-term partner This expanded B2B data management framework ultimately enables B2B marketers to build and execute more relevant, seamless messages against key influencers across the organization on an account-by-account basis. But CMOs and CIOs alone lack the capacity — in budget, time and resources — to design and implement this massive and essential modernization of its data infrastructure. It is important to identify strategic partners that not only can provide access to technology and data but can also help them determine how to modernize their practices to act on that data. As such, it’s incumbent upon executives charged with this initiative to ask partners probing questions to gauge alignment with long-term business goals and viability. These questions should include understanding how they are using technology to create and automate the development of their ontologies to make the scale of their data more actionable. In an increasingly demanding environment for personalized B2B messages — delivered through the right channels at the right time — B2B marketers must raise their standards on data management. By upending traditional models, implementing a rich B2B-focused data structure and collaborating with partners that allow new principles to flourish, there’s no stopping what B2B marketers can accomplish.

Go to Search More news Runway reconstruction begins at Arctic city airport Business & Economy June 01, 17:40 UTC+3 NORILSK Share 1 pages in this article NORILSK, June 1. /TASS/. Reconstruction of the runway's central part began at the Krasnoyarsk Region's main air harbor - at the Norilsk airport. The airport to mid-September would be able to serve only smaller, regional, planes, the airport's Director General Andrei Nikiforov told reporters on Thursday. Read also Price tag to reconstruct two Arctic airports nearly $5 mln "We have approached the most responsible and technically complicated part of the reconstruction, where we shall replace the runway's central part," he said. "The airport's all services are ready to work under the new conditions, and we are sure that on September 16, the workers would present the reconstructed runway. <…> The workers are receiving the task now, the work will begin in a few days, and from Monday heavy equipment will begin working at the runway." Earlier reports said the runway's reconstruction was planned for three summer seasons. The works began in 2016, and the planes could use the runway of 2.5km, thus no passenger or cargo flights were limited. However, this year the work will be at the central runway passage of more than one kilometer long, and thus the airport would not serve planes of the Boeing type - those would be replaced by planes for regional routes. New timetable Reconstruction of the central part will be between June 1 and September 16. During this time, all Boeing planes will be replaced with ATR-42, ATR-72 and Antonov An-24 planes, which will serve flights to Moscow (with a stop in Surgut), Krasnoyarsk and Novyi Urengoi. "The first day of the new timetable has proven our decision was correct - we have chosen not to close down the airport but to have temporary limitations and have the reconstruction in three stages," the director general said. The flights to Krasnoyarsk, Novyi Urengoi and Surgut will be served by regional planes. Passengers of the flight to Moscow, after the connection in Surgut, will continue the flight on board of Boeing-737-800 planes. The flight to Moscow will take about eight hours. Terms and financing The third and last stage of the runway's reconstruction is due between June and September, 2018. the financing is made under the federal program on development of the Russian transport system (2010-2020): the federal budget has allocated 9.6 billion rubles (about $168.5 million), and the Norilsk Nickel Company invests thee billion rubles ($52.6 million). {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Topics Arctic today Top News June 04, 17:34 In connection with terrorist acts in London police arrest 12 people June 04, 17:34 June 05, 3:49 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference June 05, 3:49 June 04, 14:09 Death toll from London terrorist attacks rises to seven June 04, 14:09 June 04, 8:51 Putin's annual televised Q&A session due on June 15 June 04, 8:51 In other media Реклама Photo 12 The 2017 World Car of the Year and its rivals at the New York Auto Show 15 How Russians conquered the Arctic in vintage photos 13 Futuristic supercars at the Geneva Motor Show Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference 2 Putin says jokingly to NBC journalist she "should be arrested" in US for contacts with him 3 Lives of those who turned Trump’s alleged ties with Russia into sensation boring - Putin 4 Putin recommends US not to teach Russia how to live 5 Legalization of cryptocurrencies to simplify startups financing - Ethereum 6 Russian submarines to be equipped with Kalibr missiles by 2025 7 Russia warns NATO against military buildup along eastern border 1 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 2 Russia’s economic policy no longer depends on oil prices - Economic Development Minister 3 More than 380 agreements were signed at SPIEF-2017 for 2 trillion rubles ($35.32 bln) 4 Putin recalls Kennedy’s assassination to compare with Russia’s alleged interference 5 Six people died in terrorist acts in London - police 6 Trump following London attacks calls for stopping being politically correct 7 Chairman of Saudi Aramco on meeting with Putin, travelling to Arctic and OPEC deal 1 Moscow concerned over US threats against Syria’s armed forces 2 Russia’s cutting-edge fighter jet to enter service this year 3 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane 'unprecedented' 4 Russian cruise missiles hit terrorist targets near Palmyra 5 Putin asked Bill Clinton to consider option Russia might join NATO 6 Russian anti-submarine destroyer enters English Channel 7 Putin jokes about climate change, US hegemony at St. Petersburg forum TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Speaking at a news conference at RIA Novosti headquarters in Moscow, Sergei Gorkov, the chairman of state-owned Vnesheconombank (VEB), said that the bank had invested around $90 million in the design and construction of the MC-21 jetliner. “We have a policy of supporting Russian exports and the aviation sector. This is exactly what we are doing also with the Sukhoi SuperJet-100. SuperJet exports are being entirely financed by the VEB. All the contracts that are being implemented in Ireland, Mexico and other countries are also being financed by us. As for the MC-21, we have already signed a leasing contract for 20 such planes and we will also support their sales abroad,” Gorkov said. He added that despite initial misgivings about the prospects of SuperJet sales in Europe, the VEB, jointly with Sukhoi Design Bureau and the United Aircraft Corporation, have been successfully exporting these planes. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov Three States Already Interested in Brand New Russian MC-21 Passenger PlaneSergei Gorkov said that there have not yet been any foreign orders for the MC-21s because the plane had just conducted its maiden voyage. “We will be working very hard in this direction,” he promised, adding that the VEB will be making every effort to support Russian non-resource exports. Work on the MC-21 first began in the late 2000s, and intensified in 2014 after the downturn in relations with Western countries. Moscow has taken a number of steps to allow Russian aviation companies to win back the commercial passenger aircraft market, both domestically and abroad. The MC-21 is designed to be faster, more efficient, and less expensive than its Western counterparts, incorporating the latest in the field of airframe, engine and avionics systems technology in its design. © Sputnik/ Grigoriy Sisoev Iran Interested in Purchase of 100 Sukhoi Superjet PlanesFor example, the plane features a composite wing design, which improves fuel efficiency, and will eventually be fitted with new Russian-made PD-14 engines, which meet and exceed global safety, noise, and fuel efficiency standards. The plane also boasts a superior cruising speed, and costs tens of millions of dollars less than its Boeing and Airbus competitors. On Tuesday, RIA Novosti reported that the Russian government had instructed its representatives on the boards of directors of state companies to vote in favor of the purchase or lease of only Russian-made aircraft.

Juan Gabriel Tokatlian CLARIN English edition • WORLDCRUNCH 2017-06-01 English edition • WORLDCRUNCH 2017-06-01 -Analysis- BUENOS AIRES — The campaign slogan that helped get Donald J. Trump elected to the White House and that has characterized his first 100 days in office needs to be clarified: "America First" has so far actually meant "military first." Trump's announcements on tax reform, his executive orders affecting the economy and finances and his promises of unilateral action on trade will not necessarily strengthen the country's industrial or productive foundations, nor reduce material inequalities or social and cultural divisions. What is clear since January is that there has been greater emphasis on military muscle than diplomatic tact, an emphasis that was already evident since the end of the Cold War, and even more so since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Trump has unveiled his vision of strategic primacy: Washington will not tolerate the rise and advance of any power to the level of the U.S. This strategy was pursued by George W. Bush, then calibrated somewhat under Barack Obama and is now back in full force under Trump, as several indicators show: First, there is the military presence within the administration headed by Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, all senior officers. People tied to the defense industry also occupy top positions, such as Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who had links to Lockheed subsidiary firms and investments in companies like Raytheon and Honeywell; Benjamin Cassidy, a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security who was an executive at Boeing; and Michael Catanzaro at the National Economic Council, who was a lobbyist for Halliburton. Added to these are well-known hawks like Attorney General Jeff Sessions and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Using the most lethal arms does not necessarily make strategic sense, but it does convey a wish to appear more offensive Second, the administration decided to increase the defense budget by $54 billion for 2018, over the current $600 billion, while cutting the budgets of education, healthcare, environmental protection and international aid. Third, there has been a significant growth in the arms business. According to the Forum on the Arms Trade, Obama's first 100 days in office resulted in $713 million worth of notified arms sales, while arms sales in Trump's first 100 days totaled $6 billion. It was no wonder, therefore, that Moody's Investors Service noted an improved market climate for the military industry in March 2017 after a fall in the sector's contracts during 2012-15. Fourth, the new administration has continued and expanded the use of force with more potent and threatening weapons. A recent report in the Council on Foreign Relations said that the Obama administration launched 26,171 bombs in 2016, while it observed a 400% increase in drone attacks by the Trump administration. A military flyover in Saudi Arabia in May — Photo: Andrea Hanks/Planet Pix/ZUMA The report notes that the administration has increased U.S. involvement in Yemen, expanded military operations in Africa (especially Somalia), launched 59 Tomahawk missile attacks on Syria, dropped the "mother of all bombs" (MOAB) on a site in Afghanistan and is contemplating sudden military action against North Korea. Using the most lethal arms does not necessarily make strategic sense, but it does convey a wish to appear more offensive in conflicts where the United States has not demonstrated decisive victories. And fifth, there is clearly a political, bureaucratic and corporate backdrop to the belligerence of Trump's early presidency. During his campaign and in the early days of his administration, Trump's main focus was on terrorism, and other goals seemed limited. Over time, under pressure from civil and military actors and partly in response to his allies' demands, internal complications grew and with them, the belief that the use of force could deliver domestic political gains. Hence the decisions to step up the "war on terrorism," to threaten Iran and North Korea, to reconsider Russia's position as a major enemy of the West, to tacitly suggest "regime changes," reinforce certain Middle East alliances that have not contributed to boosting the region's alliances, tighten the geopolitical noose around China and to insinuate the willingness to cross red lines in the use of weapons of mass destruction. This is why the core policy of Donald Trump, whose personal style combines boldness and ignorance, is a resurgent United States where the military comes first.

The testing is being conducted to show that the aerial refuelling tanker is in compliance with the Federal Aviation Administration certification requirements and the US Department of Defense (DoD) electromagnetic environmental effects requirements for systems. The tests, including shielding effectiveness, emission control and high intensity radiated fields, would confirm that the KC-46A systems do not suffer performance degradation that would prevent mission completion when subjected to the external radio frequency environment, the USAF stated. These tests are being carried out by Boeing, 772nd Test Squadron, 418th Flight Test Squadron and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division. Operated by the 772nd Test Squadron, the BAF provides a free space so electronic warfare tests can be conducted without radio frequency interference from the outside world. "Operated by the 772nd Test Squadron, the BAF provides a free space so electronic warfare tests can be conducted without radio frequency interference from the outside world." The BAF is said to be the largest anechoic chamber in the world and can fit most aircraft inside. It is filled with polyurethane and polyethylene pyramids designed to stop reflections of electromagnetic waves. 772nd Test Squadron project lead engineer Delia Reyes said: “It also provides efficient testing that requires a large amount of high-power RF radiation, whereas outdoors this would be very restrictive and typically limited to shorter night-time test operations.” The USAF initiated the KC-46A tanker modernisation programme to replace about a third of the service’s ageing fleet of KC-135 Stratotanker fleet. The KC-46A is capable of providing boom and drogue refuelling on the same sortie, world-wide navigation and communication, and airlift capability on the entire main deck floor. It is also proficient in receiver air refuelling, improved force protection and survivability, and multi-point air refuelling capability.

Sales at the Benton Harbor-based manufacturer's washer division, meanwhile, have been hampered by the situation. The American appliance giant on Wednesday filed a petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission against Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. The so-called safeguard petition is meant to provide help to domestic manufacturers hurt by importers selling products at excessively low prices. "This filing addresses unprecedented behavior by two serial violators of U.S. trade laws," Whirlpool Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig said in a statement. In the filing, Whirlpool alleges Samsung and LG pursued a strategy of selling washing machines in the U.S. at artificially low prices, then doing an "end run" around U.S. anti-dumping laws intended to prevent such behavior. For example, the South Korean companies moved production to Vietnam and Thailand to avoid duties being imposed by the U.S. on machines they made in China, Whirlpool alleges. The long-simmering conflict has the potential to become a high-profile test for President Donald Trump. Trade and domestic manufacturing were signature issues in his campaign, and Fettig serves as a member of the president's manufacturing council. If the trade commission decides in Whirlpool's favor, it could recommend that Trump's administration step in and slap tariffs on the competitors' products. Whirlpool's filing would be the latest in a series of complaints companies have filed with the ITC, a federal tribunal that rules on trade disputes. Last month, Boeing Co. accused Bombardier Inc. of selling passenger jets in the U.S. at "absurdly low prices," asking the U.S. to impose duties on the Canadian jet builder. Trump has threatened to pull the U.S. out of its free-trade agreement with South Korea, calling the 2012 deal a "one-way street" that has only benefited the Asian country. The U.S. trade deficit with South Korea last year, at about $28 billion, was the eighth-largest shortfall among U.S. trading partners, according to Census Bureau data. Whirlpool's dispute follows cases in which the U.S. government has determined that the South Korean companies injured U.S. manufacturers by selling washing machines in the country at illegal prices, Whirlpool said. "In light of their apparent inability to compete with leading global brands like LG in the U.S. market, Whirlpool has decided to seek government restrictions to limit consumer choices," LG said in an emailed statement. The company said that in order for Whirlpool to succeed in its petition, it would have to prove that the imported goods are found to be a significant cause of serious injury to U.S. producers — "a high legal standard that Whirlpool cannot meet," LG said. Representatives for Samsung didn't have an immediate response to the filing. The disagreement with the South Korean companies dates back years, with victories on both sides. In 2011, Whirlpool alleged that its overseas rivals were receiving unfair government subsidies and selling products in the U.S. at below-market values. In 2013, South Korea filed a World Trade Organization dispute challenging the U.S. Commerce Department's calculations. It won a ruling from the WTO last year. The company's washer division has underperformed its other businesses, Fettig said. "If not for this unlawful behavior, we believe our washer category would have thrived like the rest of our North American business," he said. Whirlpool previously scored a win at the ITC in January, when it granted the company's request to place dumping duties on imports of large residential washing machines from China. The 6-0 decision paved the way for final duties on the products of as much as 52.5 percent. The company posted earnings last quarter that fell short of analysts' estimates, though in that case it blamed efforts to integrate Italy's Indesit SpA with its European operations.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman ViaSat-2 Scheduled for Launch Tonight, June 1 at 4:45 PM PDT CARLSBAD, Calif., June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — ViaSat Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT), a global broadband services and technology company, is proud to announce its ViaSat-2 satellite will launch tonight from the Guiana Space Center located in Kourou, French Guiana. The launch window is scheduled to open at 4:45 pm PDT (8:45 pm in Kourou) with a live webcast of the event starting at 4:30 pm PDT, streaming on www.viasat.com. The Arianespace Ariane 5 ECA launch vehicle will be responsible for sending the 6,418 kg ViaSat-2 satellite into its geostationary transfer orbit. ViaSat-2 will be located at the 69.9° west longitude orbital slot. The ViaSat-2 mission will take less than 30 minutes from liftoff to separation. Once the satellite separates from the rocket, the next major event will be acquisition, which is the point at which the satellite first communicates with, and accepts commands from a ground station. Acquisition is expected to occur approximately 15 minutes after separation from the launch vehicle. At that point, the mission can be considered successful. Launch Window The launch window for ViaSat-2 is one hour in duration, opening at 4:45 pm PDT / 8:45 pm GFT / 11:45 pm UTC. ViaSat, Arianespace and Boeing Satellite Systems International (the ViaSat-2 satellite manufacturer) will work closely to determine and confirm that conditions are appropriate for liftoff within the launch window. If conditions are not suitable for liftoff within the available launch window, the launch will be held until the following day, which follows the normal course of business for launch activities. About ViaSat-2 The ViaSat-2 satellite system is expected to significantly improve speeds, reduce costs and expand the footprint of broadband services across North America, Central America, the Caribbean and a portion of northern South America, as well as the primary aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe.  ViaSat-2 is a geostationary satellite that operates in Ka-band frequencies. It was designed to offer high-capacity connectivity and wide coverage, with the flexibility to move capacity to where demand requires it. As compared to ViaSat-1, ViaSat-2 is expected to double the bandwidth, with more than 300 Gigabits per second (Gbps) of total network capacity, as well as provide seven times the broadband coverage.

(SpaceX) Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business June 01, 2017 If you need to measure whether the pace of space activity is really increasing or if people just get excited about rockets, consider that for the first time in five years, three orbital rockets will launch today on three different continents—and all three are on commercial missions. First, just after midnight GMT on June 1, a Japanese HII-A rocket operated by Mitsubishi launched a satellite intended to enhance global positioning system usage over Japan and the surrounding region, allowing more precise navigation in dense cities, for example. Launch of the #JAXA H-IIA with #QZS2. Reports that the second stage now in parking orbit. pic.twitter.com/PpPRMpxtQy — Alasdair Allan (@aallan) June 1, 2017 Then, if all goes as planned, Elon Musk’s SpaceX will fly its 11th mission to the International Space Station on behalf of NASA, at 5:55 pm EST/21:55 GMT. For the first time, much of its Dragon spacecraft will be reused from previous missions, part of the company’s cost-cutting efforts. And finally, coming in just under the wire at 7:45 pm EST/23:45 pm GMT, an Ariane 5 rocket will launch two communications satellites, one each from ViaSat and Eutelsat, from the European space champion’s South American spaceport in French Guiana. According to data kept by astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, the last time three orbital rocket launches occurred on the same day was on May 17, 2012. Then, Russia launched a military satellite and a Canadian broadcast satellite on separate rockets, as a Japanese rocket launched satellites for its own space agency and Korea’s. Triple launches also occurred on June 15, 2010 (two Russian launches, including a convoy of astronauts to the International Space Station, and a Chinese launch) as well as on December 21, 2005 (again, two Russian launches, and an Arianespace launch from its Guiana space center). So today’s will be only the fourth triple-launch day in the last 17 years. By contrast, there were seven such days during the decade of the 1990s. The return of a triple-launch date, while essentially a coincidence, is a sign that after several years of growing pains, commercial rocket companies are starting to hit the tempos that have promised to boost access to space while reducing the cost. Those dreams were delayed by funding struggles; a launch failure and a fueling accident at the newest rocket giant, SpaceX, that kept its rockets grounded for 10 months in the last two years; and even political turmoil in French Guiana, home to Arianespace’s launch site. Now, the three major commercial space access providers are hoping to clear out a multi-year backlog of satellites. SpaceX is anticipating a dozen more missions this year, and has managed to maintain its goal of one launch every two weeks in May, with three launches anticipated in June. ULA, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, expects to fly eight more missions this year. Arianespace also has eight more launches on its manifest, but is still resetting its plans following the political discord in French Guiana. The pace of launch being reached by the rocket firms has had knock-on effects for both satellite operators and manufacturers. At Boeing’s busy satellite factory in Los Angeles, an over-crowded floor has finally started to clear, with two satellites it built launched in the last two months and a third, Viasat-2, scheduled to fly today. Having multiple rockets in operation is easing the burden on the executives responsible for the multi-ton, multi-million-dollar flying computers we rely on in space. “Launch vehicles come and go, in a way; they have periods of issues, take time to come back and restore reliability, or sometimes they have congestion problems,” Michele Franci, the chief technical officer of Inmarsat, told Quartz after the company’s Boeing-built comms satellite launched on a SpaceX rocket from Cape Canaveral on May 16. “Having diversity in the choice of the launchers, having access to more than one, is really important to hedge your bets and protect the deployments of your assets.” That kind of confidence, along with falling prices spurred by SpaceX’s push into reusability, has led to a flood of private investment into space start-ups, from satellite makers to companies marketing small rockets specially made for launching the latest generation of lightweight satellites.

The chief of naval staff also said the Scorpene submarine Kalvari is going through its final phase of trials and should be delivered by July-August. Reuters According to reports, having rejected indigenously built 'Tejas' as too heavy, the Indian Navy in January issued a Request for Information to procure 57 multi-role combat aircraft for its carrier. "The Navy has got a response from four players for the RFI. We will examine the RFI and take it forward," Lanba said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by FICCI on 'Building India's Future Navy Technology Imperatives'. He, however, did not disclose the name of the companies which have shown interest in the proposal. At present, the Navy operates 45 MIG-29K jets which face serviceability issues from time to time. Currently, six planes are compatible for aircraft carrier. They are Rafale (Dassault, France), F-18 Super Hornet (Boeing, US), MIG-29K (Russia), F-35B and F-35C (Lockheed Martin, US) and Gripen (Saab, Sweden). Reuters While F-18, Rafale and MIG-29K are twin engine jets, the remaining three have single engine. The delivery of deck-based fighter jets is expected to take four-five years. The indigenously built aircraft-carrier Vikrant should complete trials in 2019. It was likely to be commissioned by 2020, Lanba said. When asked about the recently approved Strategic Partnership (SP) model under which select private firms will be engaged to build military platforms like submarines and battle helicopters, Lanba said the next step would be to identify strategic partners. "All three service chiefs will have to go and get the AONs (Acceptance of Necessity) on what we want to be built through strategic partners, so that partners in each segment can be identified. Reuters "We are hopeful that we should be able to move this process in next six months," he said. Four segments -- submarines, fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured carriers/main battle tanks -- were identified under the new policy, aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment in defence manufacturing by private defence majors including leading foreign firms.

Sent off to the store room for a tin of tartan paint. Told to find a new bubble for the spirit level, up on the shelf beside the glass hammers. Today’s modern apprenticeships, run by Skills Development Scotland, are not like that. Every year, 25,000 school leavers start four-year traineeships, earning while learning on the job. They are in every part of the economy, from health and finance to building and IT. At the end, young people have a qualification. There are four levels, with the top one equivalent to a degree. And they have no student debt around their necks. A wide range of career paths will be on show at The Scottish Apprenticeship Shows in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen this autumn. Modern apprenticeships are also a great way for young women to get into technical professions. We met three mould-breakers excelling in male-dominated jobs. Read More Scots Muslim convert forced to flee country after sick social media rant on Manchester bombing causes backlash Anna Manson Anna Manson will soon complete her HND in aeronautical engineering (Photo: Daily Record) Anna finished her apprenticeship – “got her time out” – last year. Like the five other young people who started with her at Spirit in Monkton in 2012, she’s been kept on. She has two more exams to get her HND in aeronautical engineering. Anna spent the first year of her apprenticeship Ayr College, learning the basics of aircraft engineering and practical skills such as hand drilling. For the next three years, she spent six months working on each of the models the Ayrshire factory builds. “I now have experience of Airbus and Boeing, the two biggest manufacturers, so I can work anywhere in the world,” she said. Anna’s first day at the vast plant was quite intimidating. She explained: “The interview and testing was in the office, but the factory is huge. “There’s so much going on, it’s so busy, it’s really noisy as well. It’s not like anything at school.” But Anna settled in fine, and is now helping two female friends in engineering apprenticeships adjust to working in male environments – not that she finds it hard. She said: “Most of the time it’s fine, I don’t notice any difference at all. But occasionally when it’s all football chat I start to tune out.” One niggle is the uniform. The boiler suits don’t fit her so she wears a paper one over combat trousers and a polo shirt – plus gloves, boots and ear defenders. “It’s a really great look,” she grinned. “But if you’re too hung up on how you look, it’s probably not the right job for you.” Bethany Welsh Bethany Welsh wants to be a site engineer (Photo: Daily Record) Architecture and design have been Bethany Welsh’s obsessions since first-year at school. The classroom was never her favourite place but she loved technical subjects. She recalled: “I was always outdoors, doing stuff. I didn’t not like going to school, but when the last bell rang it was the best time of my day. “I wanted to be out on the site designing, seeing projects being built, being part of that process.” A graduate-level apprenticeship with Balfour Beatty in the north of Scotland ticked all the boxes. Bethany has worked on major infrastructure projects such as the Inveramsay Bridge outside Inverurie. As a contractor for the RAF, she has been on bases around the north of Scotland, as well as working on the nuclear plant at Caithness. She has also joined smaller projects including a local authority flood protection scheme. And she has run her own concrete-pouring operation – not an achievement on many 20-year-olds’ CVs. There is classroom time involved, but it’s nothing like school. Bethany explained: “It’s much more interesting now. It’s something you want to learn because you’ve got the job and you can relate it to what you’re doing every day.” Now in her fourth year with Balfour Beatty, Bethany is convinced she made the right career move. She said: “I will come out with the same qualification as someone who has been to university, but with years and years of experience, which is ultimately what employers are looking for. “Once I have qualified I want to be a site engineer. “I’ve thought about going into the design side of civil engineering, maybe when I’m older. But that site experience – that’s with me for life. I will remember that more than reading a book.” Read More 18 women on hen do in tears after being kicked off plane for wearing 'offensive' t-shirts Kelsey Pexton Kelsey Pexton When Kelsey first did work experience with Arnold Clark, she had no interest in cars. She hadn’t even started driving lessons. But she got on so well that they invited her back and eventually offered her an apprenticeship. She had planned to go to university to study product engineering but after trying all the different roles in the firm’s body shop, she changed gear. “I did parts, mechanics, reception and spray-painting,” she recalled. “But I’m quite an artsy, designy person and I liked painting, so that drew me towards that side of the job.” Kelsey is the only woman in the body shop. But she insisted: “It’s not as bad as everyone thinks.” Until, that is, her colleagues start on their favourite subject. “They talk about football all the time,” she said. “I have tried, but I don’t really have any interest in football whatsoever. “I put my earphones in and get Netflix on so I don’t have to listen to it.” She is also the only female in her block release class of 15 at West College Scotland in Clydebank. “It was a bit challenging when we started. The boys were saying, ‘Oh, we have a girl in our class, better watch what we’re saying.’ Now they’re fine.” People meeting five-foot Kelsey for the first time often she assumes she works in a traditionally “ladylike” job. She soon puts them right. “They can’t believe such a small petite person can do a big job like spray-painting cars. They think I work in retail until I tell them no no no, I work for Arnold Clark. “My boyfriend is still coming to terms with it. He says I have a more masculine job than he does. He has to deal with it. I’m not changing my job any time soon.” Read More Top news stories today Mum slain and son left fighting for life SAS troops deployed for first time Rangers close in on double deal Scholes: Brown not good enough for EPL Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Daily_Record Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Universities and Colleges Glasgow Edinburgh Aberdeen Education Tartan Schools News all Most Read Most Recent NewsPoliceman's sweet gesture in crowd at One Love as Justin Bieber gives emotional speech was moment Manchester "broke" Justin Bieber may have been given an emotional speech, but the crowd was in love with this policeman UK & WorldWhy you shouldn't share these photos of 'missing' people from London terror attacks - and sick truth behind them Don't share anything until you're confident the source is trustworthy and their claim is legitimate NewsLondon Bridge hero who used martial arts skills to tackle terrorists cannot speak after being stabbed in the neck Geoff Ho, a business editor with the Sunday Express, is in intensive care after confronting the terrorists in a bid to save strangers' lives London Bridge terror attackFirst victim named in London Bridge Terror Attack was a 'beautiful bride-to-be': Everything we know so far Overnight update: Canadian killed by the terrorists in London on Saturday night was Chrissy Archibald.

The US military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands towards the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defence Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defence (GMD), managed by Boeing Co, and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defence of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defence strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the US mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km, but some are designed to travel 10,000 km or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defence Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a programme that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. — Reuters ← Previous People smugglers make $35 bn a year on migrant crisis, says IOM head Trump plans to pull US out of climate deal: Source Next → You May Also Like Police seek motive in Quebec mosque attack 30/01/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Police seek motive in Quebec mosque attack Yemen war claims lives of 1,400 children: UN 11/01/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Yemen war claims lives of 1,400 children: UN Turkey detains 235 over Kurdish militant links after Istanbul blasts 12/12/2016 Oman Observer Comments Off on Turkey detains 235 over Kurdish militant links after Istanbul blasts Latest News 80 expat doctors to be replaced by Omanis 04/06/2017 Kabeer Yousuf Comments Off on 80 expat doctors to be replaced by Omanis Sultanate’s roads best among 5 in the world 04/06/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Sultanate’s roads best among 5 in the world Salalah gears up for khareef 04/06/2017 Kaushalendra Singh Comments Off on Salalah gears up for khareef London attackers kill seven, May says ‘enough is enough’ 04/06/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on London attackers kill seven, May says ‘enough is enough’ Facebook Twitter Instagram Load More...

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 1 June 2017 Plane overshoots runway in Indonesia Jakarta: An Indonesian passenger plane carrying 146 people skidded off the runway as it landed in the eastern Papua region, an official said, the latest mishap to hit the country’s aviation sector. No one was hurt after the Boeing aircraft operated by domestic carrier Sriwijaya Air overshot the wet runway at the airport in Manokwari city, said transport ministry spokesman J. Adravida Barata. TV footage showed people being evacuated from the plane, as it rested on its belly on grass next to the runway. The airport will be closed for several hours so that the plane can be removed, Barata added. Indonesia’s aviation sector has been booming in recent years as a growing middle class increasingly use planes, but critics say safety standards have not kept pace with the expansion. — AFP Tags / Keywords: world Related Stories Related Stories Manila casino attack not a terror act, say police, hotel security chief At least 36 bodies found at Manila casino resort after attack Gunman dead after Philippines casino shooting Philippines police eye robbery, not IS, in Resorts World Manila attack Duterte hits back at Chelsea Clinton over rape comment You May Be Interested Manila casino attack not a terror act, say police, hotel security chief The need to educate investors on ponzi and pyramid scheme Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Sleek and stylish 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read Rugby: Patience needed for Australia's rookie coaches, says Byrne Nest Cam IQ security camera can recognise faces Little India a big pull for Chinese tourists advertisement Latest News Saudi Arabia cuts ties to Qatar, cites 'terrorism' Ex-Labuan JKR head slapped with two bribery charges South Korea will return four North Koreans 'if they want to go back' China says 31 nationals detained in Zambia for illegal mining India shows off space prowess with launch of mega rocket Most Viewed in News Thai woman details her alleged killing and dismemberment of friend Girl gang-raped after following boyfriend for supper Man who criticised dead traffic police officer on Facebook arrested for shoplifting Sad role reversal for elderly mother Businessman found dead with gunshot wounds on neck Middle East countries cut off ties with Qatar, cites terrorism Outrage over hunting pix on FB 12 arrested after ‘evil’ London terror attack Liow backs IGP’s move to blacklist Grace Lam Egypt cuts ties with Qatar, cites support for 'terrorist' groups Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
