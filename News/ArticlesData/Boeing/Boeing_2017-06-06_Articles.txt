These and other improvements to Boeing’s environmental performance are highlighted in the company’s 2017 Environment Report, released today. “Our unwavering commitment to innovation and environmental performance is reflected across our products, services and operations,” said Ursula English, vice president of Environment, Health & Safety. “Today, on World Environment Day, we acknowledge the progress we’re making, and we look forward to raising the bar as we work toward a sustainable future.” The 2017 Environment Report highlights include: •    Boeing operations reduced green-house gas emissions, solid waste to landfill, water intake and hazardous waste generation by between 5 and 19 per cent in 2016. Five production facilities sent zero waste to landfills. •    The ecoDemonstrator program’s 2016 testbed was an Embraer E170 regional jet, and marked the first such collaboration with another airplane manufacturer. Overall, the program has tested 60 new technologies that show promise in reducing fuel use, emissions and noise. •    The new 737 MAX, which entered service in May, is 20 per cent more fuel efficient than the original Next-Generation 737 and has a 40 per cent smaller noise footprint than today’s single-aisle aircraft. •    The new 787-10, which began flight testing earlier this year, will be approximately 25 per cent more fuel efficient than the airplanes it replaces. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | fuel efficiency | Embraer | emissions | environment day | More Health & Environment Stories Turkish Hospital ties up with QLM for healthcare services New app calculates body hydration Top tips for renewing health insurance in UAE UAE ministry, Jafza to develop pharma sector Shared appointments ‘can benefit doctors, patients’ Cerner announces key Mideast appointments UAE pulls out stroke drug with wrong packing Cigna sets up Mena office in Dubai RTA wins big at Gulf Sustainability and CSR Awards Bahrain dialysis centre work ‘progressing well’ AkzoNobel backs Ocean Cleanup's landmark effort Dubai Investments ‘Sustainability Champions’ join training session Roche to help UAE strengthen strategic drug stockpile Merck backs World MS Day with awareness events Dubai resident receives region’s first 3D-printed prosthetic leg Successful kidney transplant at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Grohe names new Middle East, Africa president Global accord reached on key health issues Cerner launches programme to develop local talent Qatar hopes to match global best practice in healthcare Suqia, Dewa partner for water desal project Honeywell joins top firms in delivering preferable refrigerants Prime Hospital wins top Bariatric Surgery certification G7 leaders fail to reach climate change accord Bee'ah, Masdar launch JV for waste-to-energy plant Utico bags global desalination award Pegasus ‘adhering to German food standards’ Neopharma invests $237m towards diabetes management in GCC TDIC releases rehabilitated turtles at Saadiyat Beach Dubai Hospital set for $79m expansion Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

US equities closed lower on Tuesday as Wall Street hedged bets ahead of key events slated for later this week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 45 points, with Boeing contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 closed 0.28 percent lower, with consumer discretionary leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite lagged, slipping 0.33 percent. The three indexes briefly a small bid in afternoon trade after ABC News reported, citing a source, that former FBI director James Comey will stop short of saying President Donald Trump obstructed justice in the bureau's investigation of ex-national security advisor Michael Flynn's Russian ties, but failed to follow through. "The market took a small sigh of relief, but there's still some caution because we don't know what's going to happen when Comey testifies," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments. Comey is slated to testify Thursday in front of the Senate intelligence committee, marking his first public comment since being fired by Trump. "The Comey testimony may give us something to talk about. I think it could be a he-said-he-said situation which could put off what can be done in Washington," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. Investors have remained vigilant about any new developments on the situation. Nevertheless, the major large-cap indexes have made on making new highs recently as pullbacks present new buying opportunities. "It's hard to figure out what exactly would put a dent on this market," said Key Private Bank's McCain. "Things haven't been going too well but sentiment data has been strong." "It's as if the Energizer Bunny has taken over and we're just going higher and higher," he said. Bond prices, meanwhile, caught a bid as the benchmark 10-year note yield hit its lowest level since the days following the U.S. presidential election. Gold prices also hit their highest level in seven weeks. "Those two markets are maybe signaling concern" among investors, said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank. "The [stock] market has been flatlining in the past few days as it waits for some clarity." In economic news, job openings hit a record high in April, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which showed a total of 6.0 million openings. Craig Bishop, vice president of U.S. fixed income at RBC Wealth Management, said that, while the U.S. economy keeps perking along, inflation is still trailing the Federal Reserve's desired levels. "I think there's some concern in the market that the Fed may be done raising rates after June," he said. "We all know the Fed is data dependent. Right now, there's a good chance the Fed holds after the June meeting. The U.S. central bank is set to meet next week, when it's widely expected to raise rates. Overseas, investors prepared for a general election in the United Kingdom set for Thursday. While a vast majority of observers still expect May to emerge victorious on Thursday, a Survation poll published last weekend placed the prime minister's ruling right-wing Conservative Party ahead by just a single percentage point. On Tuesday, the pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped 0.67 percent, while the British pound slipped 0.1 percent to $1.289. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.81 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 21,136.23, with Wal-Mart leading decliners and Exxon Mobil outperforming. The S&P 500 slipped 6.77 points, or 0.28 percent, to end at 2,429.33, with consumer discretionary leading nine sectors lower and energy and materials the only advancers. The Nasdaq declined 20.63 points, or 0.33 percent, to close at 6,275.06.

He plans to retire by the end of the year. (Kamran Jebreili/AP) Airbus sales supremo John Leahy — who has outlasted more than a half-dozen counterparts at U.S. rival Boeing since being appointed as Airbus’s chief commercial officer in 1994 — plans to retire before the end of this year, though he gave no specific departure date. Share story By Christopher Jasper and Benjamin Katz Bloomberg News Airbus faces the end of an era as sales supremo John Leahy prepares to leave after racking up more than $1 trillion of aircraft deals during his career at the European planemaker. Leahy, 66, said at a briefing in Mexico that he’ll go “sooner rather than later” and confirmed that the reins of the sales operation will be handed to Kiran Rao, executive vice president of strategy and marketing at Airbus’s commercial-plane unit. New Yorker Leahy, who joked that both his wife and doctor would like him to retire, pointing to his waistline, plans to stand down before the end of this year, though he gave no specific departure date. He has outlasted more than a half-dozen counterparts at U.S. rival Boeing since being appointed as Airbus’s chief commercial officer in 1994. He is preparing to stand down during a global lull in aircraft sales and no major new programs close to the crucial marketing stage.

The famously hard-charging executive worked in marketing at Piper Aircraft for seven years before joining Airbus North America in 1985. He later assumed responsibility for cracking the key U.S. market, where Boeing once reigned supreme but most major airlines now have Airbus jets. When Leahy moved to Toulouse, France, as commercial chief more than two decades ago, the company had only an 18 percent share of the jetliner market, with Boeing controlling the rest. The fact that the two are now balanced roughly 50-50 is possibly the biggest testament to the success of his sales technique. While that no-holds-barred approach sometimes led to tensions, it also allowed the executive to broker major deals at a succession of air shows, the aviation industry’s highest-profile events, where Airbus became a specialist at landing last-minute contracts guaranteed to make headlines. Leahy also proved a master at whipping up enthusiasm for new models, creating a sense of urgency that made airlines fearful of waiting too long to join the order bandwagon. That was illustrated with the re-engined A320neo, with which Airbus garnered more than 5,000 orders at a record pace. The larger versions of the four-engined A340 model proved a tougher sell as airlines began to switch to twin-turbine jets even for very long flights, while not even Leahy’s brio has been able to drum up anything more than modest demand for the A380 superjumbo. Leahy’s successor Rao, 53, was named internally as his deputy this past year, people with knowledge of the promotion said in November. Born in Bangalore, India, Rao studied aeronautical engineering in London and has held the title of executive vice president for sales and marketing. Leahy studied communications and philosophy at New York’s Fordham University, holds an MBA from Syracuse University and was named an officer of France’s Légion d’Honneur in 2012 for his services to European aviation. He commented on his planned exit from Airbus during a briefing on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association’s annual meeting in Cancún.

Four previous X-37B missions were launched by United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets. 'SpaceX will be sending the next Air Force payload up into space in August,' Wilson said during webcast testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee.  The reusable X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (pictured) returned Sunday morning, concluding an almost two-year mission in orbit, according to the US Air Force X-37B TEST SHUTTLE  Contractor: Boeing Height: 9 feet 6 inches Length: 29 feet 3 inches Wingspan: 14 feet, 11 inches Weight: 11,000 pounds Power: Gallium Arsenide Solar Cells with Lithium-Ion batteries Launch Vehicle: Alliance Atlas V (501)   She later specified that the payload would be one of the Air Force´s two X-37B spaceplanes. The Air Force did not immediately reply to a request for comment about when the contract with SpaceX was awarded, or if it had previously hired United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, for the mission. Launch contracts are usually announced about two years before a flight. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell declined to comment. ULA could not immediately be reached for comment. SpaceX´s first publicly disclosed launch contract for the Air Force was awarded last year for a next-generation Global Positioning System satellite flight in 2018.  A second GPS launch contract was awarded in March. The contracts are valued at $83 million and $96.5 million, respectively. In May 2016, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office disclosed it had hired SpaceX to launch a spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Think the view from your desk is good?

Earlier this year the unmanned military space plane landed at Kennedy Space Center Sunday with a sonic boom concluding an almost two-year mission in orbit, according to the US Air Force. The Air Force tweeted shortly after 8am that the vehicle had landed safely, marking the conclusion of its fourth classified mission, which lasted more than 700 days.   The Air Force tweeted shortly after 8am that the vehicle had landed safely, marking the conclusion of its fourth classified mission, which lasted more than 700 days The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a mini space shuttle, landing on a runway used by the now-mothballed craft. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The Air Force said the orbiters 'perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies.'  THE X-37B MYSTERY The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three previous secret missions to date. Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit. The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29ft (8.8m) long and 9.5ft (2.9 m) tall. It has a wingspan of just less than 15ft (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000lbs (4,990kg). Like a shuttle, X-37B is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft. The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth. While its main mission payload is a mystery, Nasa has revealed it has a materials experiment aboard. The Planetary Society is tagging along with a solar-sail demo.  Ten CubeSat nanosatellites are also taking a piggyback ride into orbit.  However, the exact nature of the mission and its cost is classified. The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft. The vehicles are 29 feet long and have a wingspan of 15 feet, making them about one quarter of the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's now-retired space shuttles. The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. Sunday's landing was the X-37B's first in Florida. The three previous landings took place at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.  The Air Force relocated the program in 2014, taking over two of NASA's former shuttle-processing hangars. The Air Force intends to launch the fifth X-37B mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the Kennedy Space Center, later this year.  Air Force officials have called the X-37B program 'the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft.' The program is managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office When the plane landed Sunday morning the sonic boom could be heard throughout Central Florida, and some Brevard County residents likely heard them before it even touched down at the Shuttle Landing Facility.  Air Force officials said that several technologies are being tested in the program.  'The primary objectives of the X-37B are twofold; reusable spacecraft technologies for America's future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth,' an official said, according to Click Orlando. Officials also explained that the X-37B is the first vehicle of its kind able to return experiments to Earth for further inspection and analysis. It is the first with this capability since NASA's Shuttle Orbiter.  The X-37B is able to stay in space longer because of its minimum on-orbit time of 270 days, officials said.   When the plane landed Sunday morning at the Kennedy Space Center (pictured) the sonic boom could be heard throughout Central Florida, and some Brevard County residents likely heard them before it even touched down at the Shuttle Landing Facility According to the Air Force, this is the fourth successful mission for the project, with the first three landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.  In total, the two craft have spent a total of 2,085 days in orbit.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... The iconic American company Boeing seems simultaneously to be for and against intervention. This spring Boeing’s former CEO and other U.S. business leaders convinced President Trump to give a new lease on life to the Export-Import Bank, a trade-distorting relic of crony capitalism’s heyday. Just weeks later, Boeing asserted the sanctity of fair trade in allegations about Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft company. The Export-Import Bank was on life support, but, in April, following a meeting with former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, President Trump reversed himself and decided the Export-Import Bank should not be shut down after all. The Bank has supported major U.S. corporations for years with taxpayer dollars, with Boeing being its chief beneficiary. In 2014, before Congress moved to curtail its activities, the Bank provided long-term loan guarantees totaling $10.8 billion, of which $7.4 billion went to Boeing. All told, Boeing received about 40 percent of the Bank’s $20.5 billion in programs - hence the moniker “the Boeing Bank.” Then, in May, Boeing asked the Commerce Department to punish Bombardier for harming Boeing and distorting trade with the sale of a new series of passenger planes to Delta at a price Boeing alleges is well below what the planes should have cost, a practice commonly referred to as “dumping.” It is practically a fait accompli that the Department of Commerce will agree that Boeing’s claims have a solid enough foundation to turn the matter over to the International Trade Commission (ITC), an independent, quasi-judicial government agency, for a formal investigation. President Trump is proudly skeptical of international trade’s benefits for the United States, or at least the way commerce has been conducted in recent decades. Given the advantages Boeing enjoys courtesy of the Export-Import Bank and its defense contracts, it is both galling and ironic to see Boeing then ask for more U.S. government intervention over Bombardier’s sale of 75 C Series planes to Delta. Boeing claims the $19.6 million price per plane is well below the $33 million or more Boeing figures the planes should have cost. The only way to account for the bargain basement price is that Bombardier must have deliberately underpriced them to muscle Boeing out of the way and that Bombardier could only have done so because it is the recipient of lavish subsidies by federal and provincial government in Canada, according to Boeing. The standard remedy is to affix special duties on Bombardier’s planes sold in the U.S. The irony for Boeing is rich. Domestic airlines have complained for years that below market, and taxpayer-subsidized, loans through the Export-Import Bank have been used by foreign countries to buy airplanes and offer cut rate airfares. And, according to Veronique DeRugy, Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center, “When Delta and other airlines can’t compete on costs, they have to cut jobs. And that’s what they do. During the hearing on Ex-Im before the House Finance Committee, the CEO of Delta, Richard Anderson, testified that some 7,500 U.S. airlines jobs had to be cut because they faced unfair competition from the Ex-Im subsidized ‘customers.’” But here are some facts that should become readily apparent to the ITC. Boeing does not make a plane that competes with Bombardier’s C Series so there is no way that Boeing could have been injured by the alleged unfair competition. Boeing has no business asking the ITC to help it overcome what, in retrospect, appears to have been a strategic misstep about the market for 100-150-passenger class of plane. The taxpayer-funded ITC exists to make sure foreign governments and companies play by the rules of global commerce, not to pick winners and losers, which brings us back to the Ex-Im Bank. The Bank, like so many government agencies, has its origins with the New Deal. It was set up to help U.S. companies looking to export by providing a type of insurance. One way it does this is with foreign loans guarantees, in essence, creating a market for U.S. products by loaning foreigners money to buy U.S. goods. To be sure, exports benefit American workers but the American taxpayer has been subsidizing business transactions that would likely take place without the Bank and other forms of government support for far too long. It could be that Bombardier is simply producing a great new airplane and Boeing, regretting a strategic decision years ago, now wants to marginalize Bombardier as a competitor. In a perfect world, Boeing and other companies would make products the market wants at a competitive price without government (taxpayer) support. However, even in an imperfect world, it is unfair to ask taxpayers to foot the bill to pay for entities such as the Export-Import Bank and then saddle them with duties imposed on foreign products that do not compete directly with U.S. products. Boeing is claiming it simply wants fair trade. In fact, Boeing wants to be able to trade just as unfairly as other countries do – and then some.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse 1/2 left right Boeing Co's logo is seen above the front doors of its largest jetliner factory in Everett, Washington, U.S. January 13, 2017. REUTERS/Alwyn Scott 2/2 By Tim Hepher and Brad Haynes | CANCUN, Mexico CANCUN, Mexico Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) said on Tuesday it was confident of winning a trade dispute with Boeing Co (BA.N) in the United States and dismissed industry suggestions that the row could slow efforts to accelerate sales of its CSeries jet. Fred Cromer, head of commercial aviation, said a CSeries order by Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) that triggered a recent Boeing complaint reflected a "launch pricing" discount common in the industry and was not an ongoing commercial strategy. "Now that the aircraft is in service, the risk profile goes down and the pricing of the aircraft starts to move up," Cromer said on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting in Mexico. The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to make a preliminary ruling by June 12 on Boeing's complaint that Bombardier dumped the CSeries below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair Canadian subsidies. Cromer said Bombardier's sales and funding practices were legal and the dispute had not hurt ongoing sales efforts, which were helped by the entry into service of the CS100 last July and the CS300 last December. He declined to say if he expected to announce any orders at the Paris Air Show this month, but said the purpose of the event was mainly to showcase new products. "I don't like to predict. I think we're going to build the momentum at the Paris Air Show," Cromer said. Bombardier has not reported a new CSeries order in nearly a year, leading some analysts to question whether the aggressive response from Boeing's complaint could slow further sales and effectively close its new rival out of the narrowbody market. Cromer argued the opposite was true. "It has actually raised the interest level," he said. "This attention is really creating a situation where airlines around the world are saying this airplane is real. It's in service and it's performing well and something to be contended with." Cromer also said Bombardier was on track to ramp up CSeries production later this year after postponing deliveries at the end of 2016 due to problems at engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N). "We feel very confident that Pratt is going to be there to support that delivery schedule," he said. "The calendar for 2017 was always a little bit backend-loaded, so ... we expect deliveries, per our plan, to start accelerating in the back half of the year."

X Norwegian’s Irish flights to proceed despite delay with new aircraft Boeing postpones delivery of 737 Max aircraft over ‘minor technical issue’ Tue, Jun 6, 2017, 20:39 Barry O'Halloran Norwegian Air is due to receive six 737 Max aircraft from Boeing this year. Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg         A technical problem will delay delivery of the first aircraft Norwegian Air planned using on its Irish-US flights but the carrier insists the service will go ahead as planned. The airline is due to begin flying from Cork, Dublin and Belfast to the northeastern US next month but a minor technical issue is holding up delivery of the first of the Boeing 737 Max craft needed to serve the routes. A Norwegian spokesman confirmed Boeing has told the airline the problem forced the US manufacturer to postpone the delivery of its first 737 Max. “This will not affect our operation or our passengers, as the upcoming launch of transatlantic routes between Ireland and the US east coast will be operated by another aircraft type,” he said. Norwegian intends using the Boeing 737-800, a similar craft to the more recently developed Max, for two to three weeks on the routes while it waits for delayed delivery. The airline is due to receive six 737 Max aircraft from Boeing this year, all of which are earmarked for the routes it is launching from here and Edinburgh in Scotland to the US. It is not clear if the delay will have a knock-on effect on the scheduled delivery of the other five aircraft. Norwegian said it can rotate up to six 737-800s from its fleet to serve the Irish routes. A spokeswoman for Boeing said deliveries occasionally run into timing problems, whether for maintenance or other reasons. “In this case, we and our customer decided to reschedule this delivery in order to resolve a minor technical issue,” she said. The manufacturer would not say what the issue was. The news comes less than a month after Boeing halted 737 Max test flights following an inspection of engines which were to be to used on the craft. However, it resolved the problem and the first Boeing 737 Max was ultimately delivered last month to Malaysian carrier Malindo Air by Irish aviation lessor Avolon. The State’s airline regulator, the Irish Aviation Authority, said Norwegian had kept it up to date with its plans and the craft it intended using on the routes met all requirements.       Topics: Irish Aviation Authority Boeing Malindo Air Norwegian Air Belfast Dublin(IE) Edinburgh Ireland Scotland United States Read More British Airways ‘working hard’ to compensate grounded passengers Iarnród Éireann ‘nearly insolvent’ due to losses More ‘nuisance’ bus changes for passengers in Dublin Bus overhaul Ryanair shares hit all-time high Wizz Air reports record profit and no signs of Brexit hit British Airways adopts brace position over IT failures Plans for Dublin runway could be about to enter holding pattern Ryanair compensation claims must be heard in the Republic says British court BA left with financial headache and battered reputation Stobart Air to add jet aircraft to fleet as part of €25m expansion  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy ECB keeps interest rates at same level Technology Are bots the new internet influencers?

This was perhaps the most positive comment about Qatar Airways' future that anybody made on Tuesday. Qatar Airways faces an existential crisis due to a diplomatic showdown after four neighbors -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain -- severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to its flag carrier's flights on Monday. CNN reported that Qatar Airways is losing more than 50 flights a day, accounting for an estimated 18% of its capacity. Not only can the airline not operate in the four countries, but also it cannot fly within their air space, a far bigger problem because the four countries largely surround Qatar. CNN said the airline must use alternative, longer routes -- primarily routes over Iran -- for flights to Europe and North America. Longer term, it's not just Qatar and its passengers who may suffer. It is also Boeing and Airbus. Boeing is having a good year. In trading Tuesday, shares were down 0.9% but have risen 20.3% year to date.  Among the 30 Dow stocks, up 7% so far in 2017, Boeing is the No. 4 performer. Nevertheless, a massive commitment to Middle East carriers has been a concern for some Boeing experts, if not for Boeing investors. Middle East carriers combined account for 544 outstanding aircraft orders, about 10% of Boeing's total. The value percentage is higher because the Middle East order books tilt to widebodies. Qatar has orders for 74 Boeing 777s and 30 Boeing 787s. Emirates has orders for 171 Boeing 777s. Etihad has orders for 26 Boeing 777s and 59 Boeing 787s. Airbus, meanwhile, has 110 outstanding orders from Qatar, 94 from Emirates and 83 from Etihad. The threat to Qatar is only the latest in a series of geopolitical events that have called the order books into question. In April, Emirates cut its U.S. flying by 20%, blaming security measures that ban laptops -- very peculiarly, only on flights from Middle East airports -- and on the Trump administration's continuing efforts to ban travelers from some Muslim-majority nations. Etihad, meanwhile, has not succeeded with a strategy of investing in troubled international carriers including Alitalia and Air Berlin. In an April report, aerospace consultant Scott Hamilton wrote, "Etihad's struggles and poor investment choices led to losses and a declining balance sheet, say those familiar with the situation. "Etihad appears so far to be hardest hit by the evolving market dynamics. It's deferred Boeing 787s from next year into 2019, according to an analysis of the Ascend data base," Hamilton wrote. "It's also pushed 787s from 2020 and 2021 into 2022 and 2023." The three Middle East carriers have an unusual business strategy. They are heavily subsidized by their governments, which seek to take advantage of a unique interpretation of Open Skies treaties with the U.S. to establish giant hubs in an area that produces minimal local traffic.

Under a recently signed contract, Boeing will provide seven Deployable Mission Readiness Trainers (DMRTs) to the Navy, starting in 2019. “Training ensures the Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance community is proficient in anti-submarine warfare. By using these trainers, crews are trained without adding flight hours to the aircraft,” said CDR. John Thoe, P-8A training systems integrated product team lead. “DMRTs will fulfill these important requirements by providing high-fidelity, crew-based training to deployed squadrons.” The proposed DMRT design is portable with low-power requirements and includes Boeing’s Weapons Tactics Trainer system, which incorporates sonobuoy and ocean acoustics modeling. The U.S. Navy trains P-8A Poseidon aircrews at naval air stations in Jacksonville, Fla., and Whidbey Island, Wash. Seventy percent of the training for P-8A aircrews takes place in simulators and other trainers; the remaining 30 percent uses the actual aircraft. Boeing is also under contract to deliver a complete P-8A training system to the Royal Australian Air Force, beginning in 2018. For more about Defense, Space & Security, visit www.boeing.com.

The order for the new 737 MAX 10 model may, however, include some aircraft originally ordered in a smaller size and upgraded to the proposed new 190-230-seat model, two of them said. Lion Air will be a launch customer for the 737 MAX 10, Lion Air Group president director Edward Sirait confirmed to Reuters. He did not immediately provide the number of planes it has ordered. Boeing declined to comment. Indian budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd also is among carriers seen as potential targets for the aircraft, a version designed to seat up to 230 people and blunt strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, two of the sources said. SpiceJet could not immediately be reached for comment. United Airlines also has been closely studying the aircraft as Boeing pitches for a marquee customer to launch the fifth variant of its 737 MAX family, two other sources said. United Airlines chief executive officer Oscar Munoz, contacted at an airlines meeting in Mexico, declined to comment. Jet Airways Ltd, India’s biggest full service carrier by market share, is in talks to buy 75 single-aisle aircraft from either Airbus or Boeing, people familiar with the matter said earlier. If the deal is awarded to Jet’s current supplier Boeing, it could include some of the new 737 MAX 10 model. None of the sources agreed to be named because the talks remain confidential. Private Indonesian carrier Lion Air ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for another 150.

Banking & Finance Construction Education Energy Healthcare Media Real Estate Retail Technology Transport Travel & Hospitality Etihad-backed Indian airline in talks to buy 50 new jets Sources say Jet Airways, in which Etihad owns a 24% stake, is keen to order Boeing 737 Max planes By Bloomberg Monday, 5 June 2017 2:25 PM Jet Airways India, the country’s biggest full-service carrier, is in talks to buy 50 narrowbody jets on top of a pending order for Boeing 737 Max aircraft, a person with direct knowledge of the plan said. The most likely model the airline is considering is the 737 Max, though it is also looking at Airbus’ A321neo jets as well as the 737 Max 10, a stretched version Boeing may introduce in Paris this month, the person said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are confidential. Jet Airways could sign the deal in the next two months for deliveries starting 2024, the person said. The order may be worth at least $5.6 billion. Jet Airways continuously reviews its fleet in response to demand, but won’t comment on speculation, a spokesman said in an email. A representative for Boeing said in an email that the planemaker is in constant communications with airlines in India about their needs but doesn’t discuss specific conversations publicly. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Jet Airways, in which Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways owns a 24 percent stake, is expanding its fleet as competition intensifies in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, where carriers offer cut-throat, below-cost fares to attract passengers. The Indian carrier made its first annual profit in seven years in the 12 months ended March 2016, mainly due to a drop in oil prices -- the biggest cost for an airline. Airlines in Asia are ordering hundreds of new planes to meet surging demand as an emerging middle class spends more of its disposable income on air travel. In India, market leader IndiGo has ordered 430 A320neo jets and is in talks to buy 50 ATR turboprop aircraft, while budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd. has ordered as many as 205 Boeing jets. The 737 Max is the fastest selling aircraft in Boeing’s history, with 3,700 orders from 87 customers from around the world, according to the Chicago-based company’s website. In 2015, Boeing said Jet Airways had an order for 75 Max 8 variants due for delivery starting 2018. The current list price of the Max 8 is $112.4 million before customary discounts for large orders. Jet Airways, which has 10 Boeing 787s on order, is also in talks with the planemaker to defer deliveries of the Dreamliners by two to three years, as the airline can use its existing relatively new 777 jets for a few more years, the person said. The carrier disclosed the 787 order in 2007 and has repeatedly delayed taking deliveries of the aircraft since 2011. In about three years, Jet’s A330s will exit its fleet, the person said.

The order for the new 737 MAX 10 model may, however, include some aircraft originally ordered in a smaller size and upgraded to the proposed new 190-230-seat model, two of them said. Lion Air will be a launch customer for the 737 MAX 10, Lion Air Group President Director Edward Sirait confirmed to Reuters. He did not immediately provide the number of planes it has ordered. Boeing declined to comment. Indian budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd also is among carriers seen as potential targets for the aircraft, a version designed to seat up to 230 people and blunt strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, two of the sources said. SpiceJet could not immediately be reached for comment. United Airlines also has been closely studying the aircraft as Boeing pitches for a marquee customer to launch the fifth variant of its 737 MAX family, two other sources said. United Airlines Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz, contacted at an airlines meeting in Mexico, declined to comment. Jet Airways Ltd, India’s biggest full service carrier by market share, is in talks to buy 75 single-aisle aircraft from either Airbus or Boeing, people familiar with the matter said earlier. If the deal is awarded to Jet’s current supplier Boeing, it could include some of the new 737 MAX 10 model. None of the sources agreed to be named because the talks remain confidential. Private Indonesian carrier Lion Air ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for another 150. Such orders typically include the right to convert between different variants of each model. Other airlines are looking at the Boeing 737 MAX 10, but some are nervous about committing to a new variant given patchy sales of some current models of the 737 MAX, whose success rests mainly on sales of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the sources said. At least one Chinese leasing company is said to be in negotiations with both manufacturers as Airbus tries to disrupt the launch, which sources say is planned for the June 19-25 air show. Airbus declined to comment on any ongoing negotiations. Airbus sales chief John Leahy earlier criticised the 737 MAX 10 as a “marginal” airplane, implying sales would be poor. Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth told Reuters some airlines want more seats than existing versions and that the MAX 10 would be 5 percent more efficient than the Airbus A321neo. Airbus says its own plane is more efficient. “It (the 737 MAX 10) is not a me-too airplane. We are focusing on a better airplane,” Tinseth said on the sidelines of the International Air Travel Association annual meeting in Cancun, Mexico. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Gloves off in spat between India's central bank, government Prasarana to generate RM17b in economic returns this year, says PM Ringgit closes lower against US dollar KL shares end lower on extended consolidation Asian currencies edge down on caution ahead of risk events Ringgit slightly higher against US dollar in early trade Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Bursa to be firmer next week Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Boeing said to woo United, Lion in bid to buttress Max 10 launch Singapore Airlines says job cuts are possible in business review Airbus sees ‘very slow year’ for orders Airline industry sees higher profits in 2017 Boeing 737 Max back in flight as first plane delivery looms Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the agreement was signed on Monday in Lagos by the Managing Director, Springfountain, Mrs. Tokunbor Fagbemi; and Head of Sales, West and Central Africa, the Boeing Company, Mr. Larry Tolliver. Speaking at the ceremony, Fagbemi said the proposed investment would be carried out through the African Aircraft Leasing Company, OEM Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Centre, African Aircraft Spare Parts Company and Aggregated Services Solutions. Fagbemi said it would cover aircraft leasing, maintenance, repair and overhaul, spares logistics and supply, as well as aggregated services solutions. She noted that the absence of such facilities and services in Africa were some of the major challenges faced by Nigerian airlines and the aviation industry. Fagbemi said, “We, as dynamic Nigerians and as patriotic citizens of this great nation, have made Nigeria our first port of call, subject to provision of all the necessary enabling environment, free of the risk of expropriation. “We believe that through this venture, we would have added our quota to ensure that Nigeria does not lose out, as African aviation is gathering momentum and countries within Africa are repositioning, developing culture, business, economy etc., around aviation and increased intra-continental air connectivity.” According to her, the facilities and services will require local skills in diverse fields ranging from piloting, aviation engineering, aviation economics and aviation law, thereby creating employment opportunities for Nigerians. On his part, the Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, congratulated Springfountain for the strategic relationship with Boeing.     Share Tweet Pin it +1 Aviation Air Peace boss urges support for FG’s change agenda FG to procure 20 aircraft for aviation college Firearms: Airport officials ready for showdown with soldiers, others VIDEO: How passengers exchanged blows on plane Aviation union pickets Landover Helicopters over staff welfare Aviation crisis deepens as Arik suspends operations – • FG may intervene, says ministry official Aviation sector needs urgent attention, says Senate committee Between tourism development and a vibrant aviation industry Trending Ritualists target bald men, believe their heads harbour gold Man loses 22-year-old wife to football ‘bet’ Who will pay these huge debts?

The investment,according to the Executive Director, SpringFountain Infrastructure Limited, Mrs. Tokunbo Fagbemi, is partnership with the United States- based aircraft manufacturer, Boeing Corporation. Speaking Monday at an agreement signing ceremony between Boeing and SpringFountain Infrastructure in Lagos, she said the aircraft leasing company,first in Africa, will create a robust window for Nigerian operators to access 200 Boeing aircraft in the next 20 years. Indigenous operators including Air Peace have described the aircraft leading window as one of the best things to happen to Nigeria, given the hurdles operators face in the bid to get aircraft from foreign lessors. She said the partnership between Boeing and Spring Fountain will assist to build capacity in blocking huge gaps in local skills in diverse fields ranging from piloting, aviation engineering, aviation economics and aviation law. Mrs. Fagbemi said with an estimated passenger traffic of 19 million, the figures could increase to over 44 million, which would require more new airplanes to meet traveling needs. She said: “If Nigeria is to have 44 million passenger departures per annum, it will require over 100 aircraft to meet this propensity to travel, Nigeria will need more aircraft. “To boost its international including intercontinental flight potential, the airlines have to improve in both the quality and quantity of the aircraft. In addition, the aircraft have to be brand new to be at par with competition within Africa at the least.” To enable the firm deliver on its proposed investment, Fagbemi said government should create an enabling environment. She said:” We cannot overemphasize for Government to create a right enabling environment for the African Aircraft Leasing Company (AALC), OEM led MRO centre, African Aircraft Spare Parts Company (AASC) and Aggregated Services Solutions provider to be able to list and trade on the NASD OTC, Nigerian Stock Exchange, Aviation Asset Backed Securities (ABS), Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates and other innovative tradeable monetary and debt instruments. “Government should provide exemption from certain charges such as customs duties and grant us pioneer status, to create a one stop shop for the processing and issuance of all necessary permits and licenses. “The AALC project will need fiscal support from the Government. The importation and clearing of aircraft spares will need to fall under a different customs clearance regime. We will need a special visa regime and dedicated immigration procedure for crew and workmen in the aviation industry. “Airport concession fees and other charges will need to be waived or differed for these brand-new aircraft and especially for the MRO bound aircraft. According to her,”Freight cargo handling and freight cargo handling procedure will need to be improved. Cargo clearance procedure will need to be harmonised especially for spares as domestic cargo. “The Federal Government should work to align Nigeria with international standards on control and compliance with aircraft noise and fuel emission. Government should invest in aviation education, skill building and skill development capacity. “The Government should also provide a dedicated space where the MRO could be located. The government should create a Special Economic Free Trade Zone (SEFTZ) for the MRO and the Spare Parts Company.” She said:” We want to work with Government and the aviation industry to bring brand new aircraft which hopefully will bring down the cost of operations for operators and bring down the cost of airfare for passengers in Africa. Speaking at the event, Minister of State, Aviation, Hadi Sirika, under need to rework its educational curriculum to provide enough professionals to man facilities and equipment in the sector. Sirika said:” Over the next 20 years, Boeing is forecasting that the world would manufacture over 39,600 airplanes valued at more than $5.9 trillion because the total number of Aircraft in year 2015 will increase from 22,510 units to 45,240 aircraft by the year 2035. This will come from the manufacture of 39,620 new units of various types of aircraft worth $5,930 billion. It is predicted that Africa will require 1,150 units valued at $ 170 billion. “What role will the Nigerian trained work force in ICT firms, aerospace manufacturers, MRO, power plants Engineers, mechanics play in various units of the aviation and aerospace manufacturing value chain? “The challenge is how many of these Aviation experts and professionals will be Nigerians and how can implement and benefit from setting up the various Infrastructure required. Is the current Nigerian University system or Technical Education system able to train, educate and produce experts and professionals that will participate in this $5.9 trillion dollar marketplace? “The challenge is how many of these Aviation experts and professionals will be Nigerians and how can implement and benefit from setting up the various Infrastructure required. Is the current Nigerian University system or Technical Education system able to train, educate and produce experts and professionals that will participate in this $5.9 trillion dollar marketplace? “It is only when we attract the best teachers to use the best infrastructure to educate our children that we can be confident that we will stand a chance to compete and get a sizable share of the For this to happen the best Aviation Education Policy must be in place, the right enactment must be prepared and passed into law. “We must create the right enabling environment for all stakeholders. We must have our eyes on allowing our children to have equal rights and the optimum exposure to the best aerospace education in terms of curriculum and teachers,” he added.

CANCUN, Mexico/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air may be a launch customer for the Boeing 737 MAX 10, a larger version of the planemaker's medium-haul family that is expected to be launched at the Paris Airshow, three people familiar with the plans said. The order may, however, include some upgrades from a smaller model, two of them said. The two companies declined to comment. Indian budget carrier SpiceJet is also among carriers seen as potential targets for the aircraft, a version designed to seat up to 230 people and blunt strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, two of the sources said. SpiceJet could not immediately be reached for comment. Lion Air, which is one of Boeing's largest customers, ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for a further 150. Such orders typically include the right to convert between different variants of each model. Other airlines are looking at the Boeing 737 MAX 10, but some are nervous about committing to a new variant given patchy sales of some current models of the 737 MAX, whose success rests mainly on sales of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the sources said. At least one Chinese leasing company is said to be in negotiations with both manufacturers as Airbus tries to disrupt the launch, which sources say is planned for the June 19-25 air show. Airbus declined to comment on any ongoing negotiations. Airbus sales chief John Leahy earlier criticised the 737 MAX 10 as a "marginal" airplane, implying sales would be poor. Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth told Reuters some airlines want more seats than existing versions and that the MAX 10 would be 5 percent more efficient than the Airbus A321neo. Airbus says its own plane is more efficient. "It (the 737 MAX 10) is not a me-too airplane. We are focusing on a better airplane," Tinseth said on the sidelines of the International Air Travel Association annual meeting in Cancun, Mexico.

Dave Majumdar June 5, 2017 TweetShareShare Boeing believes that it has an advantage over rival Lockheed Martin in the battle to secure the U.S. Air Force’s T-X advanced jet trainer contract. While the Lockheed’s T-50A offering is a based on an existing South Korean aircraft that was designed using technology from the F-16 Fighting Falcon, Boeing’s concept is custom-designed for the U.S. Air Force’s specific requirements. Because the Boeing T-X was designed specifically for the U.S. Air Force, the company believes it has an edge in the competition. “I believe what we have is a tailor-made, tailored-designed airplane for the requirement to customers that's for T-X,” Boeing chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg said at the Sanford C. Bernstein’s Strategic Decision Brokers Conference on June 1.   “We started with the requirement, a clean sheet design, designed an airplane with new digital technology that is designed for future production and support.” Moreover, Muilenburg said that he believes that Boeing’s entrant will ultimately cost less than rival aircraft such as the T-50A and the Leonardo T-100. “I believe that's ultimately going to be a lower cost solution for our customer both in terms of operating cost and delivery,” Muilenburg said. “Our confidence in that is based on the fact that we built two airplanes to that system, they are flying.” Boeing has built and flown two prototype T-X aircraft—which has given the company confidence that its design and manufacturing plans are sound. “They performed exceptionally well,” Muilenburg said. “That's part of the proposal that we have just presented to the Air Force. So that gives us very strong confidence that we can build the airplane and do it affordably.” Muilenburg asserts that while winning the T-X competition is important, it is not crucial for the company “Our future in our defense business is not dependent on any one program,” Muilenburg said. “The T-X is important. We are putting forward a very strong bid. I think it's a great value solution for our customers. And we will see how the competition plays out.” Muilenburg is probably correct in his assessment. In previous years, both the company’s F-15 and F/A-18 lines were scheduled to shutdown. However, both programs have received a new lease on life in the last couple of years. Thus, Boeing likely has enough work to survive until the Navy and the Air Force launch tenders for their next-generation fighter programs.

BUSINESS Qantas eyes longer leap as it gears up for Perth-London flights 7 Jun, 2017 2:05pm 2 minutes to read × Qantas will use a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on the Perth-London route.

The Perth-London service will start next March and the airline says there is strong demand for 14,498km flight aboard its new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. It is already thinking even bigger. "Hopefully we'll be able to fly direct from Sydney to London - we do believe that aircraft technology is going to be our friend into the future," said chief executive Alan Joyce. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. He told a media briefing on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association meeting in Cancun that the airline was talking to Boeing about the next generation of 777s and to Airbus about the ultra-long range A350. Sydney to London is just under 17,000km and New York is just under 16,000km. Joyce said other United States cities, Washington DC, Boston and Chicago would be opened up from Australia's east coast Earlier this year the world's longest non-stop commercial flight touched down in New Zealand after leaving Qatar 16 hours and 23 minutes earlier. The Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Auckland covered a total distance of 14,535 kilometres (9032 miles). The plane flew across 10 time zones during the trip. Gareth Evans, chief of Qantas International and Freight, said plane builders liked to deal with Qantas.

''There's still a long way to go but we're very excited about the technology." The Perth-London flight will take about 17 hours and will be one of the longest in the world. The Boeing 787-9 used on the route will carry 236 passengers across business, premium economy and economy cabins. Qantas flies a seasonal service from Auckland to Perth and Evans said year-round flights were a possibility. ''That's an option that's on the table for us - there are opportunities to connect New Zealand in," he said. While it was quicker to fly eastbound to Europe from New Zealand it was faster to return flying from the west and over Australia. Qantas will host the 74th IATA annual meeting next June in Sydney. • Grant Bradley travelled to Cancun with the assistance of IATA and Air New Zealand.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, June 7, 2017 Updated: 6:10 AM, June 7, 2017 CANCUN, Mexico - Bombardier Inc <BBDb.TO> said on Tuesday it was confident of winning a trade dispute with Boeing Co <BA.N> in the United States and dismissed industry suggestions that the row could slow efforts to accelerate sales of its CSeries jet. Fred Cromer, head of commercial aviation, said a CSeries order by Delta Air Lines Inc <DAL.N> that triggered a recent Boeing complaint reflected a "launch pricing" discount common in the industry and was not an ongoing commercial strategy. "Now that the aircraft is in service, the risk profile goes down and the pricing of the aircraft starts to move up," Cromer said on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting in Mexico. The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to make a preliminary ruling by June 12 on Boeing's complaint that Bombardier dumped the CSeries below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair Canadian subsidies. Cromer said Bombardier's sales and funding practices were legal and the dispute had not hurt ongoing sales efforts, which were helped by the entry into service of the CS100 last July and the CS300 last December. He declined to say if he expected to announce any orders at the Paris Air Show this month, but said the purpose of the event was mainly to showcase new products. "I don't like to predict. I think we're going to build the momentum at the Paris Air Show," Cromer said. Bombardier has not reported a new CSeries order in nearly a year, leading some analysts to question whether the aggressive response from Boeing's complaint could slow further sales and effectively close its new rival out of the narrowbody market. Cromer argued the opposite was true. "It has actually raised the interest level," he said. "This attention is really creating a situation where airlines around the world are saying this airplane is real. It's in service and it's performing well and something to be contended with." Cromer also said Bombardier was on track to ramp up CSeries production later this year after postponing deliveries at the end of 2016 due to problems at engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp <UTX.N>. "We feel very confident that Pratt is going to be there to support that delivery schedule," he said. "The calendar for 2017 was always a little bit backend-loaded, so ... we expect deliveries, per our plan, to start accelerating in the back half of the year."

The first generation of the 116-seat E195 was outsold more than three-to-one by the 100-seat E190, but a larger, re-engined version entering service in early 2019 as part of the so-called E2 lineup has attracted another level of interest. “It’s fair to say that the E195 features heavily in almost every conversation about the E2 family,” John Slattery, head of Embraer’s commercial aviation business, said in an interview late on Monday at the International Air Transport Association’s annual meeting. “There’s a distinct possibility for the E2 that the E195 outsells the E190.” The possible reversal highlights how three additional rows of seats and longer, sweeping wings have forced many airlines to take a second look at Embraer’s biggest airliner, now aimed squarely at rival Bombardier Inc’s new CSeries. For Embraer, the world’s third-largest commercial planemaker after Airbus SE and Boeing Co, the E195 is the biggest change in its E2 lineup, which has focused on its core regional aviation market as Bombardier picks bigger fights. While Bombardier sells larger CSeries aircraft against the lower end of the narrowbody families built by Boeing and Airbus, Embraer has said it has no plans for passenger jets larger than the new E195. Bombardier’s CSeries offers unparalleled range for an aircraft of its size, but even that advantage has shrunk as a new engine boosts the range of the E195 by some 600 miles (966 km) from the first generation. Last week Embraer extended the range of the E195-E2 to 2,600 miles from a previous estimate of 2,450 miles on better-than-expected aerodynamics of a prototype that started flying in March. Bombardier’s CS100 has a maximum range of 3,100 miles. The CSeries also boasts roomier cabins in a five-abreast layout, compared with Embraer’s two-and-two seating. However, Slattery said the real selling point of the new E195 is an operating cost that rivals Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies on a per-seat basis while costing about 20 percent less per trip. Extra seats and skinny wings have made the new aircraft a “profit hunter,” he said.

Well, tell that lucky person to gas up his/her car and drive to the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office in Florence, Arizona where there are 65 vacant positions. If you or your friends or your family could not come up with the money to get a second opinion on the DNA then expect to spend a long, long, long time locked up. For example, a man is suing two months in a sexual assault case because of a DNA mistake. Prosecutors dismissed charges after a later test found his DNA wasn’t linked to the crime. To better protect children authorities in Brunswick, Georgia inspect car seats.What a novel idea!!! For more details about their program and possibly starting one in Culver City call (912) 279-3350. Parents should be aware that between 1996 and 2012 about 1600 children have been treated for near strangulations in American emergency rooms per the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. It now appears almost certain the Navy has enough support to keep funding for the design and production of a new class of ballistic missile submarines to keep the $97 billion project on schedule. A former Wells Fargo Bank teller is facing a federal charge of conspiracy. The teller used a customer’s stolen information to withdraw thousands from the customer’s bank account. Can anyone tell me why anybody with an I.Q over 20 would deal with Wells Fargo? The Top Five Air Force Contractors 1.Lockheed – Martin 2.Boeing 3.Northrop – Grumman 4.Raytheon 5.L-3 Communicators The Top Five Army Contractors 1.Lockheed – Martin 2.Raytheon 3.General Dynamics 4.United Technologies 5.Northrop – Grumman Top Five Navy Contractors 1.Lockheed – Martin 2.General Dynamics 3.Boeing 4.Raytheon 5.United Technologies When Theodorsia and I are traveling around our great country and we get hungry we look for Cracker Barrel – the Old Country Store. I betcha they have well over 650 restaurant stores with good prices,good food, good service and interesting gifts for everyone on your list. The General manager of one such location is Leon Taylor from the Waycross, Georgia establishment which has been open less than nine months and is so successful the parking lot is just packed. One of his employees is Anne Wilson a real dynamo who seems to be all over the dining room taking care of customer service. These two make it happen along with others. Arkansas is proposing a grant program for students in high demand fields that would provide two years of tuition and fees in a community or technical colleges in exchange for a commitment to work full time for three years after graduating. Don’t tell those retirees who used to work at city hall and now get well north of $150,000 per year in pension, perhaps to look for a second job. The Dallas Police and Fire Pension system board voted to suspend withdrawals and payments from deferred retirement funds. You know it will not be long before its reinstituted, but its sign things need to be changed. The vote stopped more than $154 million in requested withdrawals from being distributed. Could it be they have a cash flow crisis and needed to conserve money? So where is the High Speed Rail and the Keystone Pipe Line? Can it be true? I have heard and perhaps you as well the recently passed parcel tax that is supposed to fill up the secret safe located near the very hush, hush escape exit leading to the second floor. As understand it and you can ask Mayor, Jeff Cooper the parcel tax will bring in roughly two million dollars every year and will be used to repay the loan we expect to get from Wall Street to clean up the water in the La Ballona Creek. As you recall our city is in the red over $300 million and now they are discussing getting possibly another $400 million – more or less. I believe, this is why some on the Council (Jim Clarke and Jeff Cooper) want to extend term limits? The Columbus Mississippi City Council has hired its first dedicated public defender for their Municipal Court and he will be paid $25,751 per year. Just think our city attorney receives around $350,000 in wages and benefits. It just goes to show Washington does hear. It just might take years, but eventually they get the message. The reverse mortgage companies have been messing around with seniors for years and now they will be forced to give clear disclosures. Did you read the Legal Aid Society filed a lawsuit against the New York Police Department on December 6, 2016; an effort to force the agency to disclose information, about how officers are disciplined for wrong doing on the job. Prior to 2011 NYPD made these findings available to journalists. New York City is appealing last year’s decision by a State Supreme Court judge that misconduct findings should be released.

The airline wants to have a deal for six aircraft “locked down” by the middle of July, CEO Peter Bellew said on the sidelines of the IATA AGM in Cancun. “We’ve narrowed down some aircraft, [and] we’re doing due diligence on them at the moment,” he said. The intention is for the first of the leased aircraft to arrive toward the end of the fourth quarter, with the remainder to follow by April, Bellew said. The carrier also intends to add another six leased A330s about one year later. MAB is considering A330-200s or -300s for the initial six leased aircraft, Bellew said. They will have lie-flat beds in premium class, and some will likely be equipped for onboard Wi-Fi. These aircraft will be one-for-one replacements for Boeing 737s on routes where demand warrants more seats and a better product. Certain routes to India and China are in this category, as well as flights to Hong Kong and Bali, Indonesia. Because the A330s would be replacing other aircraft being retired, they will not increase fleet size. However, these moves will help give MAB a more appropriate mix of widebody aircraft and narrowbody aircraft, Bellew said. Meanwhile, a new aircraft agreement with Airbus or Boeing appears to be much further away. The carrier has been considering an order for up to 30 aircraft for long-term fleet renewal in the 2019–25 timeframe. MAB has previously said it favors 787-9s or A330neos for this requirement. However, Bellew said the prices being quoted for the new aircraft are not yet low enough, and are at “unrealistic” levels. The airline is prepared to “bide our time” if it cannot negotiate the right price. If a deal does not eventuate, MAB can lease more used aircraft, Bellew said. MAB already has six A350s on order, with the first scheduled for delivery in December and another to follow in the same month. It will use the first two aircraft for training, and on shorter flights in Southeast Asia, Bellew said. They will then replace A380 service on one of MAB’s twice-daily London flights, possibly by February. The second daily London flight will be taken over when the third and fourth A350s have arrived. MAB was also considering putting A350s on its Auckland route, but has since changed its mind and is now considering other options for aircraft not used on the London route. MAB’s A380s will be transferred to a new charter unit the carrier is establishing, primarily for religious-pilgrimage flights. Bellew said the CEO of the charter carrier will likely be named in the next few weeks. A leading candidate has been identified, from outside the company. The rest of the senior management team is already in place. The charter unit is preparing its application for an operator’s certificate, and is close to an agreement with Airbus on the cost for reconfiguration work on the A380s. An engine maintenance agreement with Rolls-Royce is also nearly finalized. Bellew said the first of the A380s should be ready for the new unit to begin charter flights by November–December 2018. The remaining five are expected to be ready by July 2018. Adrian Schofield avweekscho@gmail.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The first generation of the 116-seat E195 was outsold more than three-to-one by the 100-seat E190, but a larger, re-engined version entering service in early 2019 as part of the so-called E2 lineup has attracted another level of interest. "It's fair to say that the E195 features heavily in almost every conversation about the E2 family," John Slattery, head of Embraer's commercial aviation business, said in an interview late on Monday at the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting. "There's a distinct possibility for the E2 that the E195 outsells the E190." The possible reversal highlights how three additional rows of seats and longer, sweeping wings have forced many airlines to take a second look at Embraer's biggest airliner, now aimed squarely at rival Bombardier Inc's new CSeries. For Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker after Airbus SE and Boeing Co, the E195 is the biggest change in its E2 lineup, which has focused on its core regional aviation market as Bombardier picks bigger fights. While Bombardier sells larger CSeries aircraft against the lower end of the narrowbody families built by Boeing and Airbus, Embraer has said it has no plans for passenger jets larger than the new E195. Bombardier's CSeries offers unparalleled range for an aircraft of its size, but even that advantage has shrunk as a new engine boosts the range of the E195 by some 600 miles (966 km) from the first generation. Last week Embraer extended the range of the E195-E2 to 2,600 miles from a previous estimate of 2,450 miles on better-than-expected aerodynamics of a prototype that started flying in March. Bombardier's CS100 has a maximum range of 3,100 miles. The CSeries also boasts roomier cabins in a five-abreast layout, compared with Embraer's two-and-two seating. However, Slattery said the real selling point of the new E195 is an operating cost that rivals Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies on a per-seat basis while costing about 20 percent less per trip. Extra seats and skinny wings have made the new aircraft a "profit hunter," he said.

The order for the new 737 MAX 10 model may, however, include some aircraft originally ordered in a smaller size and upgraded to the proposed new 190-230-seat model, two of them said. Lion Air will be a launch customer for the 737 MAX 10, Lion Air Group President Director Edward Sirait confirmed to Reuters. He did not immediately provide the number of planes it has ordered. Boeing declined to comment. Indian budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd also is among carriers seen as potential targets for the aircraft, a version designed to seat up to 230 people and blunt strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, two of the sources said. SpiceJet could not immediately be reached for comment. United Airlines also has been closely studying the aircraft as Boeing pitches for a marquee customer to launch the fifth variant of its 737 MAX family, two other sources said. United Airlines Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz, contacted at an airlines meeting in Mexico, declined to comment. Jet Airways Ltd, India's biggest full service carrier by market share, is in talks to buy 75 single-aisle aircraft from either Airbus or Boeing, people familiar with the matter said earlier. If the deal is awarded to Jet's current supplier Boeing, it could include some of the new 737 MAX 10 model. None of the sources agreed to be named because the talks remain confidential. Private Indonesian carrier Lion Air ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for another 150. Such orders typically include the right to convert between different variants of each model. Other airlines are looking at the Boeing 737 MAX 10, but some are nervous about committing to a new variant given patchy sales of some current models of the 737 MAX, whose success rests mainly on sales of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the sources said. At least one Chinese leasing company is said to be in negotiations with both manufacturers as Airbus tries to disrupt the launch, which sources say is planned for the June 19-25 air show. Airbus declined to comment on any ongoing negotiations. Airbus sales chief John Leahy earlier criticised the 737 MAX 10 as a "marginal" airplane, implying sales would be poor. Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth told Reuters some airlines want more seats than existing versions and that the MAX 10 would be 5 percent more efficient than the Airbus A321neo. Airbus says its own plane is more efficient. "It (the 737 MAX 10) is not a me-too airplane. We are focusing on a better airplane," Tinseth said on the sidelines of the International Air Travel Association annual meeting in Cancun, Mexico.

CANCUN, Mexico/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air may be an inaugural customer for a new Boeing Co plane that will become the largest member of its 737 medium-haul jet family, expected to be launched at the Paris Airshow, three people familiar with the plans said. The order for the new 737 MAX 10 model may, however, include some aircraft originally ordered in a smaller size and upgraded to the proposed new 190-230-seat model, two of them said. Lion Air will be a launch customer for the 737 MAX 10, Lion Air Group President Director Edward Sirait confirmed to Reuters. He did not immediately provide the number of planes it has ordered. Boeing declined to comment. Indian budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd also is among carriers seen as potential targets for the aircraft, a version designed to seat up to 230 people and blunt strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, two of the sources said. SpiceJet could not immediately be reached for comment. United Airlines also has been closely studying the aircraft as Boeing pitches for a marquee customer to launch the fifth variant of its 737 MAX family, two other sources said. United Airlines Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz, contacted at an airlines meeting in Mexico, declined to comment. Jet Airways Ltd, India's biggest full service carrier by market share, is in talks to buy 75 single-aisle aircraft from either Airbus or Boeing, people familiar with the matter said earlier. If the deal is awarded to Jet's current supplier Boeing, it could include some of the new 737 MAX 10 model. None of the sources agreed to be named because the talks remain confidential. Private Indonesian carrier Lion Air ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for another 150. Such orders typically include the right to convert between different variants of each model. Other airlines are looking at the Boeing 737 MAX 10, but some are nervous about committing to a new variant given patchy sales of some current models of the 737 MAX, whose success rests mainly on sales of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the sources said. At least one Chinese leasing company is said to be in negotiations with both manufacturers as Airbus tries to disrupt the launch, which sources say is planned for the June 19-25 air show. Airbus declined to comment on any ongoing negotiations. Airbus sales chief John Leahy earlier criticised the 737 MAX 10 as a "marginal" airplane, implying sales would be poor. Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth told Reuters some airlines want more seats than existing versions and that the MAX 10 would be 5 percent more efficient than the Airbus A321neo. Airbus says its own plane is more efficient. "It (the 737 MAX 10) is not a me-too airplane. We are focusing on a better airplane," Tinseth said on the sidelines of the International Air Travel Association annual meeting in Cancun, Mexico.

This was the company’s first episode highlighting a North African airline. As RAM celebrates its 60th Anniversary this year, Just Planes featured the airline’s newest addition the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which flies many routes between Africa, Asia, North and South America. The 210-minute follows the plane and its two female Moroccan pilots on one of its main routes across the North Atlantic to New York City. “Welcome aboard, here’s your pilot speaking” is the normal greeting heard when boarding a plane. In the Just Planes feature, the pilot’s voice is that of Bouchra Bernoussi, the Captain of the Boeing 787 and a woman. This Just Planes documentary films the RAM female crew during a round trip flight from Casablanca to New York. Bernoussi, with her first officer Jihane Bidass, discuss the aircraft, the flight, the route, the weather and departure and approach information . The female pilots also share with viewers their path to becoming pilots. As the first female pilot of Royal Air Maroc, Bernoussi is the face of girl power above the clouds. She was appointed a long-haul pilot-in-command and a ground operations director since June 2014, and has been flying since 1980. Bernoussi was one of the first two female pilots in Morocco to obtain her bachelor’s degree in mathematical sciences at the Omar Al Khayyam High School in Rabat. With her diploma in hand, Bernoussi applied for the national contest of the pilots of line. That year, almost 900 candidates competed for only 18 seats. Bouchra Bernoussi, was successful and was one of only two women who were part of the 11th promotion of the school. After her graduation, Bernoussi joined Royal Air Maroc where she served as co-pilot on a Boeing 727 and then on a 757. In 1991, she spent her internship in the co-pilot seat, before operating the Boeing 727 from 1992 to 1998, followed by the Boeing 737 Classic and then the Boeing 737 New Generation in 2000. With so few women sit in the cockpit, Royal Air Maroc aspires to be the exception to the rule. Most of the time, the only women encountered on a flight are the beautiful and helpful stewardesses. To break this discriminating stereotype, the Moroccan airline is paying more attention to the feminine talents, vowing to promote more female applicants. https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/201...w-documentary/ Citeer    + Reageer « Vorig onderwerp | Volgend onderwerp » Log in met je?

Share Tweet Acquisition Trial by Twitter for acquisition pros By Mark Rockwell Jun 06, 2017   The Trump administration is hoping to inject more speed and efficiency into the federal acquisition process, but that approach is still evolving and has some rough edges, according to procurement experts. Though still a volatile Twitter presence, President Donald Trump has largely ceased interjecting his views on ongoing contracts and procurements, experts noted at a June 6 event at the George Washington University Law School. However, Trump's transition tweets threatening to cancel and renegotiate aviation contracts because of pricing still have commercial vendors scratching their heads over what to expect from the administration. "We have a tweet response plan," said one top defense company lawyer speaking on background under the terms of the event. He was referring to the president's Twitter remarks last year threatening to cancel a Boeing contract for a fleet of 747s destined to replace existing Air Force One aircraft. More seriously, the defense company procurement official said contractors must adapt with a new "dealmaker mentality" in the White House. Such dealmakers, he said, aren't afraid to use leverage when they have it. The administration, however, is looking to make federal procurement run more efficiently, "which isn't a bad thing," said Robert Burton, former deputy Office of Federal Procurement Policy administrator. "This is an opportunity for government contractors," he said, because the administration wants to reduce the burden of regulations and unwieldy acquisition practices. The challenge, he said, is that "they don't know exactly what they want to do with procurement." Burton, who is now a partner at international law firm Crowell and Moring, said for all the Twitter thunder from the president about high-profile acquisitions, the administration is in the middle of developing firmer acquisition reform policy. Burton, who worked with the White House transition team on management issues, said that "there are substantive policy ideas developing in the administration."

Idaho Business Health Marijuana Nation World Photos Spokane Nearly $50 million in infrastructure improvements planned as Fairchild prepares to receive more KC-135 tankers UPDATED: Tue., June 6, 2017, 5 p.m. By Mike Prager mikep@spokesman.com(509) 459-5454 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS As Fairchild Air Force Base moves into a position of being the largest refueling tanker base in the U.S. military, commanders are facing two years of preparation to get the base ready for its expanded mission, the wing commander said Tuesday. The Air Force announced Monday that Fairchild will receive 12 primary KC-135 tankers along with three additional tankers in a backup inventory. The transfer will increase active duty staffing at Fairchild by 400 personnel, making the 92nd Air Refueling Wing the largest tanker fleet in the Air Force with nearly 60 of the so-called flying gas stations. “It’s good for the base, but I am not blind to the challenges we face,” said Col. Ryan Samuelson, commander of the 92nd Air Refueling Wing at Fairchild. Fairchild was chosen in part because the cost of upgrading facilities for the additional tankers would be lower than moving them to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, another base that was considered for the transfers. The tankers are coming from McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas, which is getting ready to deploy the new KC-46A Pegasus tankers from Boeing, a mission that Spokane leaders had sought unsuccessfully for Fairchild. The newly announced transfers will join nine other tankers brought to Fairchild from McConnell in March to make room at McConnell. That earlier move in March involved relocation of the 384th Air Refueling Squadron to Fairchild from McConnell. Samuelson said he anticipates that another squadron will be reassigned to Fairchild as part of the transfer. In the latest announcement, plans call for moving the aircraft and personnel starting in the summer of 2019 and completing the transfer by the end of 2020, Samuelson said. Fairchild’s strategic location near the Pacific Ocean was a key factor along with costs in selecting Fairchild, he said. The announcement had been delayed for several months to give incoming Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson time to review the transfer, Samuelson said. In a prepared statement, Samuelson said that the additional Air Force personnel and the tankers would generate $20 million annually for the local economy. “With this increase will come millions in military construction dollars to renovate existing facilities and construct new infrastructure,” the colonel said in the statement. In Monday’s announcement, officials said construction costs at Fairchild were estimated at $48.6 million, compared to $80.7 million at MacDill. That is on top of about $30 million in construction spending at Fairchild this year. Samuelson said the planning for the additional aircraft will include an environmental impact statement, and he pledged to ensure that the Air Force will address any potential negative impacts. He also re-emphasized his pledge to work with Airway Heights and other well owners on coming up with solutions to contamination of water supplies from aircraft firefighting chemicals. Last month, Airway Heights officials warned residents not to drink the city’s water as a result of contamination from Fairchild. Fairchild has sufficient hangar space for the additional tankers, he said. However, it will need expansion or repair of taxiways and parking areas. Also, the base will need to expand office and work areas, Samuelson said. The base commander said he has worked to consolidate the Air Force’s fleet of tankers equipped with a newer multipoint refueling system on each wing, a system used by aircraft from the Navy and coalition countries. In addition, Fairchild is the lead wing for modernization of the KC-135’s flight deck displays and autopilot systems. “This program is integral to Air Mobility Command’s plan to extend the viability of the KC-135 fleet while ensuring the aircraft remains operationally relevant well into the future…for decades to come,” Samuelson said, reading from his statement. Samuelson said one of Fairchild’s strengths is the support it gets from the Spokane region as well as the entire state of Washington. He also said the base has earned well-deserved recognition, including winning the Omaha Trophy multiple times. The tanker transfers will increase Fairchild’s operational capability by 750 sorties a year and flying time by 22,500 hours. Updated: June 6, 2017, 5 p.m.  Tags: Air Force, Col.

US Armed Service Committee reader comments 136 Share this story The US Air Force has two X-37B space planes, and since 2010 each of them has flown two missions into outer space. Those flights have ranged in length from 224 to 717 days. The X-37B, which is autonomous and looks something like a miniature version of NASA's space shuttle, launches on top of a rocket and orbits the Earth before returning and landing on a runway. For the first four missions, the Boeing-developed space plane has launched on top of an Atlas V rocket, the military's go-to vehicle manufactured by United Launch Alliance. However, on Tuesday during a meeting of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson revealed that the upcoming fifth mission of the X-37B will be launched into space by a Falcon 9 rocket. That SpaceX launch is tentatively scheduled for August. Further ReadingThe Air Force’s secretive spy plane returns after 718 days in space Wilson testified that the emergence of the commercial space industry has proven a boon for the US military. "The benefit we're seeing now is competition," she said. "There are some very exciting things happening in commercial space that bring the opportunity for assured access to space at a very competitive price." The admission came in response to a question from Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who asked about the military's capability for a rapid response to military space needs. After picking up a model of the X-37B and showing it to committee members, Wilson said the addition of companies like SpaceX, as well as other launch firms, was expanding the capacity of the military and significantly lowering costs. The US military has not said what the X-37B has been doing up in space for years at a time, beyond furthering "operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies." In addition to testing surveillance technology, some experts think the Air Force may be working on equipment that could be incorporated into a human-rated version of the vehicle that could carry a flight crew. Among the applications contemplated for the X-37B would be the recovery of satellites for repair on Earth. Further ReadingSpaceX, Blue Origin have opened a “window of opportunity” for US Air Force Some military advisers have begun urging the Air Force to embrace the commercial space industry more completely. Recently, the Air Force's Air University conducted a study that found that developments by SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other companies, such as Vulcan Aerospace and Virgin Galactic, had given the United States a definitive edge over global competitors in this new area of reusable rocket technology. However, the report warned, other countries, such as China, could copy these ideas and surpass the United States if strategic government investments are not made.

Four previous X-37B missions were launched by United LaunchAlliance Atlas 5 rockets. ULA is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). "SpaceX will be sending the next Air Force payload up into space in August," Wilson said during webcast testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. She later specified that the payload would be one of the Air Force's two X-37Bspaceplanes. Launch contracts are usually announced about two years before a flight but the Air Force did not disclose the X-37B contract until Tuesday, a mere two months before the flight. The Air Force declined to say when the contract was awarded or provide other details. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell declined to comment. SpaceX's first publicly disclosed launch contract for the Air Force was awarded last year for a next-generation Global Positioning System satellite flight in 2018. A second GPS launch contract was awarded in March. The contracts are valued at $83million and $96.5 million, respectively. In May 2016, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office disclosed it had hired SpaceX to launch a spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9. The mission, which was arranged through an intermediary, Ball Aerospace, took place last month. SpaceX is owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Musk, who is also chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

By MikeMurphy Editor Elon Musk’s SpaceX will undertake its first mission with the U.S. Air Force later this summer when it launches the secretive X-37B military spaceplane on a Falcon 9 rocket. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson announced the launch Tuesday during a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, saying “SpaceX will be sending the next Air Force payload up into space in August.” She later confirmed a SpaceX rocket would be carrying the reusable space drone. The United Launch Alliance, a joint effort owned by Boeing Co. BA, +0.40%   and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, -0.01%  , launched the four previous X-37B missions. SpaceX has battled the alliance for years in an effort to win military contracts for its Falcon 9 rockets. Southern California-based Space Exploration Technologies won its first Pentagon contract in April 2016. The Air Force has two of the X-37B spaceplanes, and the most recent flight — which lasted nearly two years in space — landed in Florida in early May. In March, SpaceX won a $96.5 million Air Force contract to launch a new Global Positioning Satellite into orbit. And in May, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched a top-secret payload for the Pentagon’s National Reconnaissance Office. Tesla shares have gained 65% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.06%  has gained 8.5%.

Foal Eagle, which began March 1 and will run through April 30 in conjunction with South Korea, includes a nuclear attack submarine, F-22s and B-2 Stealth bombers, and the nuclear-capable B-52s Stratofortress, a veteran aircraft that can drop the largest array of weapons in the U.S. inventory. The behemoth is the biggest bomber that the Air Force flies. It's so big that it takes 32 airmen more than 12 hours to wash one. The B-52 can do just about anything from nuclear weapon deployment to close air support. And this American classic has been making headlines a lot lately. Beyond the annual Foal Eagle training exercise, Americans across the nation were outraged when &quotThe Amazing Race&quot used the wreckage of a B-52 shot down in Vietnam as a prop recently, asking contestants to sing communist songs. CBS later apologized for the insensitive show. More On This... Could a military radar prevent further Newtown-style tragedies? Eerie Google images of Japanese ghost town in Fukushima Giant robot jellyfish to patrol US coasts Nanofoam could lead to new body armor, U C San Diego researchers say Amid increased rhetoric from North Korea, combat ship USS Freedom debuts in Pacific It's served the military well for more than half a century. Inside an American classic Capable of flying at altitudes of 50,000 feet, the aircraft has a 185-foot wingspan and is nearly 160 feet long. The long-range B-52 heavy bomber flies at subsonic speeds and provides a global strike capability. Just how fast is that? Built by Boeing, this aircraft can fly at Mach 0.86 -- that’s 650 miles per hour. Precision guided missiles, gravity and cluster bombs are just a few of the payloads the B-52 can deliver against targets – a single B-52 can launch a whopping 70,000 pounds of mixed ordnance. The latest version, the B-52H, can carry up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles, or nuclear weapons for precision delivery anywhere in the world. The aircraft plays other critical roles beyond attack such as providing critical surveillance and monitoring capabilities. According to the Air Force, just two B-52s can monitor 140,000 square miles in a mere two hours -- that’s like scanning an area larger than the size of Great Britain and Newfoundland combined. The aircraft can be kitted out with electro-optical viewing sensor systems and forward-looking infrared. Remarkably, the B-52 has unlimited combat range. The bomber can be refueled while in flight. A KC-135 Stratotanker, for example, can deploy to keep a mission going. Without refueling, it has a range of around 8,800 miles. In 1989, modernizing updates began, incorporating GPS and adaptations to carry 2,000-pound munitions, according to the Air Force. Developing a full array of advance weapons is also underway. New avionics, electronic defense and offensive systems, and more powerful engines updates will continue to enhance the aircraft’s utility. Only the H model is still in the Air Force inventory with aircraft assigned to the Air Force Global Strike Command at the 5th Bomb Wing at Minot AFB in North Dakota and the 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale AFB in Louisiana. B-52Hs are also assigned to Air Force Reserve Command's 307th Bomb Wing at Barksdale. Maintaining 50-year-young legends Some of the B-52s are 50 years young -- meaning the dedication of crew chiefs and maintenance crews has been essential to maintaining this legendary aircraft. After 450 hours or 24 months, the bomber’s parts are checked and rechecked. Subjected to a thorough intensive inspection, damaged pieces and key components are replaced. Often 120 people will work around the clock. These teams have ensured that the B-52s get airborne and return safely. They have kept the versatile aircraft in service for almost 60 years. Proud Deployment History Entering service in 1954, the B-52 Stratofortresses have been operating for nearly 60 years. There are different models of the B-52: the B-52A first flew in 1954, and the B model entered service in 1955. Six years later in 1961, the first of 102 B-52H's was delivered to Strategic Air Command. The B-52s delivered a whopping 40 percent of all the weapons dropped by all the coalition forces during Desert Storm, according to USAF statistics. During Operation Enduring Freedom, they provided close air support through the use of precision-guided munitions. In a single 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom night mission, the B-52Hs launched approximately 100 conventional air launched cruise missiles. The Air Force regularly deploys the B-52s with a bomber program based in Guam. Every year, the B-52s participate in a number of training exercises. The Global Strike Challenge, for example, is an opportunity for teams 96th Bomb Squadron setting up a a B-52H, aerial refueling training, flying mission at the range and landing. War week is another exercise where B-52s work on aerial refueling, weapons tactics and high altitude maneuvering. In Red Flag, another exercise with longstanding US allies, attack, air superiority, defense suppression are practiced to improve rapidly standing up combat and cooperation with partners.

According to the Minister of State for Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, if Nigeria and Nigerians are to play in the mainstream of the aerospace industry and one day join hands with the global marketplace in the virtual and actual design of various aircraft parts and eventual creation and manufacture of airplanes, the aviation education policy and implementation strategies must be addressed. Sirika and other stakeholders spoke at a seminar on ‘’aviation education infrastructure challenges and potential’’ which held in Lagos. They noted that these and many other issues must be addressed if the country must play within the $5.2tn global aviation industry. The minister said, “It should be noted that airlines alone have consistently generated a turnover in excess of $700bn per annum over the last five years, and reported profit over $30bn per annum on the average over the last five years. In this same industry, the airline and aircraft Maintenance Repairs and Overhaul organisation are expected to generate in excess of $1.8tn over the next 20 years. He added, “This turnover excludes upgrade services.  Other service providers in the aviation and aerospace industry such as Boeing, Airbus, General Electric, Pratt and Whitney, Honeywell, etc will generate far in excess of these in their capacity as aerospace and aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturers.” Sirika further explained, “The above predicted growth has implications for aviation education and education infrastructure, and Nigeria and indeed Africa needs to be properly positioned to be beneficiaries of the growth potential. “For this to happen, Nigerian colleges, universities and other approved aviation training institutions will need to define the policy and strategy that will enable them train and graduate students who will join the global industry to move this number of passengers in a safe, secure and satisfactory manner.” According to the minister, the challenge is for the concerned ministries to find a means through which Nigerian children and youths can have access to quality training institutions with appropriate infrastructure and relevant curriculum, teachers, lecturers and professors. He said this would produce Nigerian graduates that could play a part in the global aviation market place. The Executive Director, SpringFountain, Mrs. Tokunbo Fagbemi, said a viable aviation education and aviation education infrastructure would help to set up a framework to strategically address the identified skills gap and impeding challenges. Failure to do this, she said, meant that the industry would continue to use skilled expatriates directly or indirectly. “Either way, the implication of this is high cost of production, an extremely precarious situation in this slim margin industry. It is not unlikely that inadequately skilled resources may be used by some, this will definitely lead to safety and operational challenges on the long run,” she said. According to Fagbemi, as Africa’s aviation begins to gather momentum and countries within the continent reposition, develop culture, business and economy around aviation and increased intra-continental air connectivity, stakeholders need to ensure that Nigeria does not lose out.

It is also contemplating the establishment of an aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul centre, spares logistics and supply, as well as the provision of other aggregated services solutions. Its Executive Director, Spring Fountain Infrastructure Limited, Mrs Tokunbo Fagbemi, said the firm would partner the United States- based aircraft manufacturer, Boeing Corporation to roll out the services. Speaking yesterday at the agreement signing ceremony between Boeing and Spring Fountain Infrastructure in Lagos, she said the aircraft leasing firm, the first in Africa, would create a window for local operators to access 200 Boeing aircraft in the next 20 years. Indigenous operators, including Air Peace, have described the aircraft leasing window as one of the best things to happen to Nigeria, given the hurdles operators face in their bid to get aircraft from foreign lessors. Its Chairman, Allen Onyema, said the partnership between Boeing and Nigerian operators will stimulate the growth of aviation, adding that the partnership between Boeing and Spring Fountain will help to build capacity in blocking gaps in local skills in diverse fields, ranging from piloting, aviation engineering, aviation economics and aviation law. Mrs Fagbemi said with an estimated passenger traffic of 19 million, the figures could increase to over 44 million, which would require more new aeroplanes to meet travelling needs. She said: “If Nigeria is to have 44 million passenger departures per annum, it will require over 100 aircraft to meet this propensity to travel, Nigeria will need more aircraft,” adding: “To boost its international, including intercontinental flight potential, the airlines have to improve in both the quality and quantity of the aircraft. In addition, the aircraft have to be brand new to be at par with competition within Africa at the least.” Source: The Nation Comments: This article has 0 comment, leave your comment.

As we said before the gods of dementia continue to unleash their angels on the motherland intoxicating in the process the native, his goats, his rats and pigs. Jacob Mafume Mugabe once again has pulled another shocker by taking a civilian brigade of his surrogates for a holiday trip on tax payer’s account; he took with him 50 people to a United Nations-hosted oceans summit in the United States. Derangement has taken over the Munhumutapa building as well as the dungeons of Chancellor Avenue. Mugabe’s misplaced decisions are a scourge and a disease which must be fought not only by political parties but  everyone who loves this country. Mugabe’s trip defies logic, we mentioned in the press today, “unless if we want to annex a neighbouring country and administer its oceans, then what are we doing there. Maybe, Mugabe got confused when he officially opened Tokwe Mukosi Dam. He probably thought that Zimbabwe had built an ocean against the wishes of the imperialists.” The People’s Democratic Party is aware that Mugabe uses more than five million dollars to for each state visit he takes, when hospitals cannot afford to procure basic painkillers . The costs are going up considering the fact that Mugabe now prefers to hire private planes due to the depletion of the Air Zimbabwe fleet which has since been declared unsafe by many countries including the United States which is the mother country of Boeing the manufacturer of the plane which Mugabe used to take for his infinite trips abroad. We have always stated that Mugabe’s trips are an unnecessary strain on the National fiscus. We are concerned by ZANU PF’s failure to seek treatment to cure themselves from the disease called Fiscalities which is the belief that money grows on trees and that one can just continuously spend oblivious of the source. As of April 2017 the budget deficit had risen to 43% by Chinamasa’s own confirmation, such an admission could have been followed by measures of drastic expenditure retrenchment starting with unnecessary overseas trips. Surprisingly Mugabe has actually increased his propensity to travel. Then there is the issue of the raiding of depositors funds kept at the RBZ in form of RTGS balances, this act has crippled the banking sector with a liquidity crisis which has ground the economy to a halt. Mugabe and team continue to use the few dollars in circulation to fund their trips; this will only worsen the crisis much to the detriment of the working people who will have to continue sleeping on banking queues. The IMF recently warned that excessive government spending, if continued, could exacerbate the cash scarcity, further jeopardize the health of the external and financial sectors, and, ultimately, fuel inflation. This advice has again fallen on the deaf ears of Mugabe and his cabal who cannot sacrifice their personal greed for the recovery of the economy. The man from the Central Republic of Zvimba in March 2016 again left Zimbabwe for India to attend a low-key World Culture Festival leaving surprisingly leaving behind Culture Minister Abednego Ncube. He even went to India way ahead of schedule much to our amusement, that a President of a whole country can get excited by the mere idea of attending an Indian Shoko Festival. Our call goes to Zimbabweans to unite and form a formidable force against dictatorship, Mugabe must go. Deposing him is the only method which can give Zimbabwe the opportunity to open a new chapter into renaissance.

Photographer: Balint Porneczi/Bloomberg Airbus SE faces the end of an era as sales supremo John Leahy prepares to leave after racking up more than $1 trillion of aircraft deals during his career at the European planemaker. Leahy, 66, said at a briefing in Mexico that he’ll go “sooner rather than later” and confirmed that the reins of the sales operation will be handed to Kiran Rao, executive vice president of strategy and marketing at Airbus’s commercial-plane unit. New Yorker Leahy, who joked that both his wife and doctor would like him to retire, pointing to his waistline, plans to stand down before the end of this year, though he gave no specific departure date. John Leahy Photographer: Balint Porneczi/Bloomberg Leahy has outlasted more than half a dozen counterparts at arch-rival Boeing Co. since being appointed as Airbus’s chief commercial officer in 1994. He is preparing to stand down during a global lull in aircraft sales, with the manufacturers each focused on production ramp-ups as they work through record order backlogs, and no major new programs close to the crucial marketing stage. The famously hard-charging executive worked in marketing at Piper Aircraft for seven years before joining Airbus North America in 1985. He later assuming responsibility for cracking the key U.S. market, where Chicago-based Boeing once reigned supreme but most major airlines now have Airbus jets. When Leahy moved to Toulouse as commercial chief more than two decades ago the company had only an 18 percent share of the jetliner market, with Boeing controlling the rest. The fact that the two are now balanced roughly 50-50 is possibly the biggest testament to the success of his sales technique. Air Show Deals While that no-holds-barred approach sometimes led to tensions, it also allowed the executive to broker major deals at a succession of air shows, the aviation industry’s highest-profile events, where Airbus became a specialist at landing last-minute contracts guaranteed to make headlines. Leahy also proved a master at whipping up enthusiasm for new models, creating a sense of urgency that made airlines fearful of waiting too long to join the order bandwagon. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up That was illustrated with the re-engined A320neo, with which Airbus wrong-footed Boeing and garnered more than 5,000 orders at a record pace. The larger versions of the four-engined A340 model proved a tougher sell as airlines began to switch to twin-turbine jets even for very long flights, while not even Leahy’s brio has been able to drum up anything more than modest demand for the A380 superjumbo. Kiran Rao Photographer: Aidan Crawley/Bloomberg Leahy’s successor Rao, 53, was named internally as his deputy last year, people with knowledge of the promotion said in November. Born in Bangalore, India, Rao studied aeronautical engineering in London and has also held the title of executive vice president for sales and marketing. Leahy studied communications and philosophy at New York’s Fordham University, holds an MBA from Syracuse University and was named an officer of France’s Légion d’Honneur in 2012 for his services to European aviation. He commented on his planned exit from Airbus during a briefing on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association’s annual meeting in Cancun.

and by Region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of the World), Trend, Forecast, Competitive Analysis, and Growth Opportunity: 2017-2022.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160831/402975LOGO ) This strategic report, from Stratview Research, studies the composite ducting market in the global aerospace & defense industry over the period 2011 to 2022. The report provides detailed insights on the market dynamics to enable informed business decision making and growth strategy formulation based on the opportunities present in the market. The Composite Ducting Market in the Global Aerospace & Defense Industry: Highlights  As per Stratview Research, the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market offers a healthy growth opportunity during the forecast period of 2017 to 2022 and reach an estimated $774 million in 2022. The author of the report stated that increasing production rate of major aircraft programs, such as A320 family, A350XWB, B737, and B787; upcoming aircraft and introduction of variants of the existing aircraft platforms, such as C919, MC-21, B737 Max, and A320neo; continuous shift from metal ducts to composite ducts to achieve higher fuel efficiency; advancement in the ducting technology; and growing aircraft fleet size are the major growth drivers of the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market. The research's findings suggest that commercial aircraft is expected to remain the growth engine of the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market during the forecast period. The aircraft segment is also expected to witness the highest growth over the next five years, driven by increasing production rate of key aircraft programs, such as B737, A320, B787, and A350, and continuous shift from metal ducts to composite ducts in both low-pressure and high-pressure applications.  In terms of reinforcement type, glass fiber is the most widely used in the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market and is expected to remain the largest reinforcement type over the next five years as well. The fiber type is highly preferred in low-pressure applications, such as cabin air recirculation and cabin sidewall riser, as it offers good mechanical performance at a relatively low cost. However, ducting with carbon fiber is likely to witness the fastest growth over the next five years.     As per the study, North America is expected to remain the largest market for composite ducting over the next five years. This region is the manufacturing hub of the advanced composites industry with the presence of several large to small part fabricators and prepreggers, and raw material suppliers. Boeing, Bombardier, and Lockheed Martin are the major aircraft manufacturers in North America. However, Asia-Pacific is likely to experience the highest growth during the forecast period, driven by demand for composite ducting in upcoming commercial and regional aircraft, such as Comac C919 and Mitsubishi MRJ. The key composite ducting manufacturers for the aerospace & defense industry are Senior Aerospace, Triumph Group, ITT Corporation, Parker Hannifin Corporation, Arrowhead Products, AIM Aerospace, and Stelia North America. New product development, long-term contracts, and collaboration with OEMs are the major strategies adopted by the key players to gain competitive edge in the market.    Click Here and Register for Free Sample on the Aerospace & Defense Composite Ducting Market Report Features  This report provides market intelligence in the most comprehensive way.

The report provides detailed insights on the market dynamics to enable informed business decision making and growth strategy formulation based on the opportunities present in the market. The Composite Ducting Market in the Global A erospace & Defense Industry: Highlights  As per Stratview Research, the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market offers a healthy growth opportunity during the forecast period of 2017 to 2022 and reach an estimated $774 million in 2022. The author of the report stated that increasing production rate of major aircraft programs, such as A320 family, A350XWB, B737, and B787; upcoming aircraft and introduction of variants of the existing aircraft platforms, such as C919, MC-21, B737 Max, and A320neo; continuous shift from metal ducts to composite ducts to achieve higher fuel efficiency; advancement in the ducting technology; and growing aircraft fleet size are the major growth drivers of the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market. The research's findings suggest that commercial aircraft is expected to remain the growth engine of the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market during the forecast period. The aircraft segment is also expected to witness the highest growth over the next five years, driven by increasing production rate of key aircraft programs, such as B737, A320, B787, and A350, and continuous shift from metal ducts to composite ducts in both low-pressure and high-pressure applications.  In terms of reinforcement type, glass fiber is the most widely used in the global aerospace & defense composite ducting market and is expected to remain the largest reinforcement type over the next five years as well. The fiber type is highly preferred in low-pressure applications, such as cabin air recirculation and cabin sidewall riser, as it offers good mechanical performance at a relatively low cost. However, ducting with carbon fiber is likely to witness the fastest growth over the next five years.     As per the study, North America is expected to remain the largest market for composite ducting over the next five years. This region is the manufacturing hub of the advanced composites industry with the presence of several large to small part fabricators and prepreggers, and raw material suppliers. Boeing, Bombardier, and Lockheed Martin are the major aircraft manufacturers in North America. However, Asia-Pacific is likely to experience the highest growth during the forecast period, driven by demand for composite ducting in upcoming commercial and regional aircraft, such as Comac C919 and Mitsubishi MRJ. The key composite ducting manufacturers for the aerospace & defense industry are Senior Aerospace, Triumph Group, ITT Corporation, Parker Hannifin Corporation, Arrowhead Products, AIM Aerospace, and Stelia North America. New product development, long-term contracts, and collaboration with OEMs are the major strategies adopted by the key players to gain competitive edge in the market.    Click Here and Register for Free Sample on the Aerospace & Defense Composite Ducting Market Report Features  This report provides market intelligence in the most comprehensive way.

The launch saw a flawless deployment of two important satellites, including Eutelsat 172B and the massive ViaSat-2 craft for broadband-by-satellite operator ViaSat of Carlsberg, California, and the heaviest-ever satellite (at 6,418 kgs) built by Boeing. The Eutelsat satellite was insured for $241 million (€214.2m), and the ViaSat-2 insured for a thumping $545 million, and a report in trade mag Space Intel Report suggests that had the launch failed, this $545 million might not have been sufficient to re-build the ViaSat craft, such was its complexity. The insurance sector gets to keep the premiums paid for the cover which as well as the actual launch might have included payments for the first 30-60 days following launch, or beyond, to include pre-launch problems, failure in orbit, and damage to other satellites should a catastrophe occur while in orbit. But while the premiums are attractive to the insurance underwriters (just think how many house or auto premiums have to be sold to match the $786 million of cover on this particular launch), the competition for business is tough, and risky. For example, a specialist conference last October heard that the pre-launch catastrophe on September 1st 2016 when a SpaceX rocket blew up when still on the ground and whilst carrying a Israeli satellite cost the insurance sector a repayment of $200 million to cover the lost satellite alone. This, said experts at the conference, was enough to wipe out 20 years of insurance premiums on pre-launch coverage. John Munro, who heads up space projects for insurance giant Marsh, said that the entire pre-launch insurance market only generates $10-$12 million a year.  The remaining fees, covering the actual launch and first-year in orbit, cost around 4-5 per cent of the value of the satellite, depending on the rocket launch provider. Arianespace launch cover is around the 4 per cent mark, with SpaceX just a little higher, and Russia’s Proton system at the higher (5 per cent) end.

The goal was to defend the U.S. from a first-strike attack. Fast forward to 2017, and the U.S. still remains way behind in deploying technology to protect us from nuclear missile attacks. North Korea has threatened to launch a nuclear weapon at the United States. Fox News reported on May 24, 2017 that “if left unchecked -- it is ‘inevitable’ that North Korea will develop a nuclear device that has intercontinental capabilities.” Only a ground-based defense system can protect America from this type of attack on our homeland. This week, the Trump administration rolled out a budget that increases funding for defense programs to implement a national missile-defense strategy. Defense One reported on May 23, 2017, that “Donald Trump’s first defense-budget request contains large increases for weapons intended to shoot down North Korean missiles or even attack them on their launchers.” Congress will make the decisions on what recommendations they take or reject from the Trump administration’s budget, and it is important that they use the money effectively and efficiently to defend the continenetal United States. Now is the perfect time for Congress to create a solid foreign policy strategy to protect America from missile attacks and right the wrongs of the Obama administration, which obstructed the development of new technology through slow-walking the process. As a result, bureaucrats in Obama’s Pentagon were slow and inefficient in getting ground-based defenses deployed. President Trump can fix the bureaucracy problem by allowing contractors to do their job without bureaucrats slowing up the process and creating an atmosphere that leads to technology never being effectively deployed. In truth, there is only one defense technology made in America that can protect the United States from a North Korean nuclear missile or a missile from another rogue nation. According to a recent study produced by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), one superior technology is the GMD (Ground-based Midcourse Defense), produced by Boeing. There are other innovations that are more suited to be placed overseas to protect against attacks on foreign lands like the THAAD and AEGIS systems, but to protect the homeland, the ground-based systems are designed to protect American cities from attack in a safe manner. Some non-ground based systems grab headlines, but the GMD technology is the system that is designed protect the United States from attack in the most effective and efficient manner. Ground-based technologies are superior because they can intercept ballistic warheads approaching the U.S. from any direction. Given the threat that Kim Jong Un has made public, it would make sense for Washington to focus on funding the ground-based program. The United States faces emerging threats from Iran if the nuclear deal is violated. Additionally, a non-state actor like ISIS could try to launch an attack from abroad at the United States. Don’t forget that China and Russia have the capacity to launch an attack via ballistic missiles as well. To really protect America, our nation needs to invest in technologies that could save the lives of millions of Americans. Right now, we are largely defenseless if North Korea or another bad actor decides to launch an attack on us. Think about this hypothetical: North Korea engages in a surprise launch of missiles and they get past some of the early defense systems that destroy missiles in their launchers or destroy them when they are in the process of accelerating into the atmosphere. One of the only Pentagon programs that could stop an intercontinental ballistic missile warhead once it is launched and flying is the GMD system. No other current missile program is as capable of that level of defense. Another benefit of this GMD technology is that it is the only one of its type in the world that can strike enemy missiles in the outer atmosphere, preventing any health effects of a nuclear weapon from reaching the U.S. This is important because if you use a system that detonates a nuclear warhead in the atmosphere of the planet, the health and welfare of the same people you are trying to protect may be in danger. The time is now to invest in ground-based missile defenses to defend our country from foreign aggressors who have publicly vowed to destroy us. Congress can use the Trump budget submission to help fix the problem while fixing the bureaucracy problem at the Pentagon.

Thursday, 08 June 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Cartoons Interview India Has joined the World's Space Heavy Weights News ID: 1428616 Service: Science June, 06, 2017 - 12:05 TEHRAN (Tasnim) - India has joined a select number of countries able to claim membership of the "heavy-lift" rocket club after it successfully launched a communications satellite weighing over three tons into space. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to twitter to hail the launch, describing it as a proud moment for the country. To date, only the United States, Russia, China, Japan and the European Space Agency have successfully launched so-called "heavy" satellites weighing over three tons. The launch, which took place at 5.28 p.m. local time Monday from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, was the first to use the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (GSLV Mk-III) -- known as "fat boy" on account of its size, CNN reported. Estimated to weigh as much as five fully-loaded Boeing Jumbo jets, or 200 fully grown elephants, the GSLV Mk-III rocket is the largest most powerful launch vehicle India has ever produced, and considered a potential game changer for the country's space program. "Initially, we launched our satellites from abroad," said D.P. Karnik, the spokesperson for the Indian Space Research Organization. "The Indian space program is now completely indigenous." Previously, India has relied on paying the French to launch satellites that weighed more than 2,300 kilograms. The GSLV Mk III can carry up to 4,000 kilograms; almost double the previous capacity available to India's space program. In a sense, Monday's launch marks a journey of independence that has taken 25 years, said Rajeswari Rajagopalan, head of the Nuclear and Space policy initiative at the Observer Research Foundation. It is hoped the rocket's payload -- the 3,136 kilogram GSAT-19 communications satellite -- will help bolster the country's internet connectivity and speed. However, the launch represents only the first stage in a longer plan, and it will be some time before people see tangible effects on the ground, said Rajagopalan. The success of the launch is widely viewed as a major step towards the country's long term goal of becoming a leading player in the multi-billion dollar global satellite launch market. Cheap labor and government support means that India can launch satellites for a fraction of the price of rival nations. In 2014, the country launched a Mars probe for less than it cost to make the Hollywood movie Gravity. While in February this year, its space program broke a world record when it launched 104 satellites at once.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to hail the launch, describing it as a proud moment for the country. To date, only the United States, Russia, China, Japan and the European Space Agency have successfully launched so-called “heavy” satellites weighing over three tonnes. The launch, which took place at 5.28 p.m. local time from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, was the first to use the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (GSLV Mk-III) — known as “fat boy” on account of its size. Estimated to weigh as much as five fully-loaded Boeing Jumbo jets, or 200 fully grown elephants, the GSLV Mk-III rocket is the largest most powerful launch vehicle India has ever produced, and considered a potential game changer for the country’s space program. “Initially, we launched our satellites from abroad,” said D.P. Karnik, the spokesperson for the Indian Space Research Organization. “The Indian space program is now completely indigenous.” Previously, India has relied on paying the French to launch satellites that weighed more than 2,300 kilograms. The GSLV Mk III can carry up to 4,000 kilograms, almost double the previous capacity available to India’s space program. In a sense, Monday’s launch marks a journey of independence that has taken 25 years, said Rajeswari Rajagopalan, head of the Nuclear and Space policy initiative at the Observer Research Foundation. It is hoped the rocket’s payload — the 3,136 kilogram GSAT-19 communications satellite — will help bolster the country’s internet connectivity and speed. However, the launch represents only the first stage in a longer plan, and it will be some time before people see tangible effects on the ground, said Rajagopalan. The success of the launch is widely viewed as a major step towards the country’s long term goal of becoming a leading player in the multi-billion dollar global satellite launch market. Cheap labor and government support means that India can launch satellites for a fraction of the price of rival nations. In 2014, the country launched a Mars probe for less than it cost to make the Hollywood movie Gravity. While in February this year, its space program broke a world record when it launched 104 satellites at once.

It is also contemplating the establishment of an aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul centre, spares logistics and supply, as well as provision of other aggregated services solutions. Its Executive Director, Spring Fountain Infrastructure Limited, Mrs Tokunbo Fagbemi, said the firm would partner the United States- based aircraft manufacturer, Boeing Corporation to roll out the services. Speaking yesterday at the agreement signing ceremony between Boeing and Spring Fountain Infrastructure in Lagos, she said the aircraft leasing firm, the first in Africa, would create window for local operators to access  200 Boeing aircraft in the next 20 years. Indigenous operators, including Air Peace, have described the aircraft leasing window as one of the best things to happen to Nigeria, given the hurdles operators face in their bid to get aircraft from foreign lessors. Its Chairman, Allen Onyema, said the partnership between Boeing and Nigerian operators will stimulate the growth of aviation, adding that the partnership between Boeing and Spring Fountain will help to build capacity in blocking gaps in local skills in diverse fields, ranging from piloting, aviation engineering, aviation economics and aviation law. Mrs Fagbemi said with an estimated passenger traffic of 19 million, the figures could increase to over 44 million, which would require more new airplanes to meet traveling needs. She said: “If Nigeria is to have 44 million passenger departures per annum, it will require over 100 aircraft to meet this propensity to travel, Nigeria will need more aircraft,” adding: “To boost its international, including intercontinental flight potential, the airlines have to improve in both the quality and quantity of the aircraft. In addition, the aircraft have to be brand new to be at par with competition within Africa at the least.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?

Analysts said the trend in the US market was part of a pullback in most global bourses because of the potential impact of those events, both of which happen tomorrow. “The market might be a little on edge” ahead of tomorrow, said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates, who added that there was little significant economic data for the market to focus yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.2 per cent to close at 21,136.23. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.3 per cent to end the session at 2,429.33, and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also fell 0.3 per cent to finish at 6,275.06. Among blue-chip companies, Boeing, McDonald’s, Nike and Wal-Mart Stores lost one per cent or more. But oil producers ExxonMobil and Chevron gained 1.4 per cent and 1.0 per cent, respectively, as oil prices advanced. Gold producers Freeport-McMoRan and Barrick Gold jumped 3.8 per cent and 5.3 per cent as gold prices rose. Macy’s sank 8.2 per cent after executives warned at an investor day of lower profit margins in the current quarter and year.

A ceremonial groundbreaking for the $5.8 million project at Central Fields took place Tuesday, marking a more than yearlong process to improve the area east of the Muny. The project will level the 30 acres of uneven fields, install irrigation and drainage, build new visitor facilities and lay new trails connecting the area to other park attractions. “It’s a blank canvas,” Forest Park Forever President and Executive Director Lesley Hoffarth said. “It’s just grass that hasn’t gotten that extra care like other parts of the park.” St. Louis Director of Parks, Recreation and Forestry Greg Hayes said the addition of irrigation and drainage will make the turf more durable during heavy foot traffic or after torrential downpours.

His administration hyped the $110 billion deal to supply Saudi Arabia with American-made ships, planes, bombs, and other military as an diplomatic and economic success. White House spokesman Sean Spicer claimed the weapons sale and other investment deals with the Saudis would create employment for hundreds of thousands of Americans: Beyond $109b in military sales, @potus deal w US & Saudi Arabia incs another $250b commercial investment creating hundreds of 1000s US jobs — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) May 20, 2017 During his subsequent visit to the Middle Eastern kingdom, Trump and King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud participated in an signing ceremony in that seemed to seal the deal. Now it seems that the weapons trade—like so many Trump “wins”—is not what it seems. In a blistering assessment of the deal, Bruce Reidel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, writes, “It’s fake news”: I’ve spoken to contacts in the defense business and on the Hill, and all of them say the same thing: There is no $110 billion deal. Instead, there are a bunch of letters of interest or intent, but not contracts. Many are offers that the defense industry thinks the Saudis will be interested in someday. So far nothing has been notified to the Senate for review. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the arms sales wing of the Pentagon, calls them “intended sales.” None of the deals identified so far are new, all began in the Obama administration. A recent analysis by the New York Times also concludes that “Mr. Trump’s figures are inflated and premature.” A look at the fine print shows that the smaller deals that make up the supposed $110 billion arms package are “intended sales” that have not been finalized. As the Pentagon itself notes, actual arms sales will occur only after the “normal” review process, which includes officially notifying Congress. Additionally, the Times reports, the administration appears to have double counted its proposed arms deals in its tally of new Saudi investments in American companies. And Reidel says it’s not clear that Saudi Arabia can actually afford $110 billion in weapons, “due to low oil prices and the two-plus years old war in Yemen.” Some analysts noted that the Saudi arms deal was too good to be true when it was first announced. “Where are they gonna get $100 billion worth of stuff to sell? I don’t see where it is going to come from—are we going to ship our whole Navy over there?” William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, told Mother Jones in May. Hartung also predicted that the deal might prove as illusory as Trump’s other headline-grabbing stunts: “It seems like part of this is: Trump just likes big numbers. It’s like when he claims credit for jobs he didn’t really help create.” Sure enough, the White House’s claims that the arms deal will generate thousands of US jobs aren’t holding up. When the Washington Post contacted American weapons makers, none would—or could—say if they would hire more people to supply the Saudis: A spokesman for Raytheon, one of the companies that along with Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Dynamics signed memorandums of understanding with Saudi Arabia as part of the deal, was unable to even speculate as to whether or how many jobs the arms package will add. […] Lockheed Martin’s chief executive said in a statement that the deal would “support” thousands of jobs in the United States and Saudi Arabia. Boeing said the deal would “create or sustain” jobs in both countries. Neither company would put a specific number on new jobs being created in the United States. Reidel concludes that the whole thing was an exercise in wishful thinking: “What the Saudis and the administration did is put together a notional package of the Saudi wish list of possible deals and portray that as a deal. Even then the numbers don’t add up.” Yet again, the shine has quickly rubbed off of a gold-plated Trump deal. Get the scoop,  straight from Mother Jones.

Analysts said the trend in the US market was part of a pullback in most global bourses because of the potential impact of the those events, both of which happen Thursday. "The market might be a little on edge" ahead of Thursday, said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates, who added that there was little significant economic data for the market to focus on Tuesday.

Four previous X-37B missions were launched by United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets. ULA is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. "SpaceX will be sending the next Air Force payload up into space in August," Wilson said during webcast testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. She later specified that the payload would be one of the Air Force's two X-37B spaceplanes. Launch contracts are usually announced about two years before a flight but the Air Force did not disclose the X-37B contract until Tuesday, a mere two months before the flight. The Air Force declined to say when the contract was awarded or provide other details. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell declined to comment. SpaceX's first publicly disclosed launch contract for the Air Force was awarded last year for a next-generation Global Positioning System satellite flight in 2018. A second GPS launch contract was awarded in March. The contracts are valued at $83 million and $96.5 million, respectively. In May 2016, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office disclosed it had hired SpaceX to launch a spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9. The mission, which was arranged through an intermediary, Ball Aerospace, took place last month. SpaceX is owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Musk, who is also chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc.

In an interview with BusinessLine, David Lim, General Manager – India, Singapore Airlines, speaks about Singapore’s national carrier’s commitment to the Indian market, despite the tough times that the parent company is facing, and the changes he’d like to see in the domestic aviation scene. Excerpts: It’s been a difficult quarter for Singapore Airlines. Does this change strategy for markets like India? With fares falling rapidly, yields are falling for airlines and all airlines are suffering. But we are prepared for competition and for yields to continue to be under pressure. We are working on managing costs better and in recent years, we have been helped by fuel prices coming down. But it’s a difficult time for the aviation business in general. But our East-bound market is continuing to grow. Also, if you look at our financial results, we have also mentioned that we’re going into the next phase. With our portfolio size, we are able to right-size our aircraft. We’re seeing some of this (in other markets). We (Singapore Airlines) used to fly to Hangzhou in China, and we were flying to Jeddah for Haj pilgrims; now we’ve passed on both to Scoot (the low-budget division of Singapore Airlines). Between the four airlines — Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, Scoot and Tigerair — we’re able to right-size the product. Are you considering making further investments in India? No further investments for now. We’ve increased, over the last 4-5 months, the number of services we offer, we’re flying more to Ahmedabad since that market has grown. During peak periods, we are also increasing flights in sectors where there is demand. In September, during Durga Puja, we increase flights to Kolkata, and of course during Diwali. For the group, it’s 150 services a week covering 15 destinations in India, that’s a lot. I think it’s the second biggest for us after China. We also have Vistara here, and they will expand their network. Vistara is likely to start international flights next year. What synergies do you foresee? Most of these synergies will be from Delhi and Mumbai, which we can use as a connecting hub. But first and foremost, Vistara wants to bring a new flying experience to Indian travellers. We will codeshare with Vistara but the rest is up to Vistara’s management. They will map out their strategy. But I think as an airline, Vistara recognises its heritage as being part of the Singapore Airlines and the Tata group. So what can India look forward to? We’re launching our Airbus A350 – the newest aircraft in our fleet – in Mumbai on July 1 and replacing the Boeing B777-200R. We currently have 17 flights to Mumbai a week. By the end of this year, our configurations will also change. We have 19 A380s on the fleet and we’re taking delivery of another five. We’ll also be retro-fitting the older ones. So there are new products to look forward to. Once the merger of Scoot and Tigerair is complete by late July, we will be able to right-size the product portfolio for the eight destinations that this flies to in India. Some of the world’s largest airlines are now saying that the future is in unbundling services and charging customers separately for every service. For instance, allowing economy passengers to pay for lounge access at an airport. Do you agree? I think the trend is that customers want to only pay for things they enjoy. So far we don’t unbundle. It makes sense as strategy for the industry but we have to tread very carefully. We are a full-service premium airline and the lines are becoming grey between full-service and low-cost, but there are basic services we will always provide. There might be some parts that we can unbundle to provide more revenue. We’ve been refining our priority passenger service club, we’re charging for preferred seats on days of high demand. But the basic product must be there; we won’t charge for meals, or the in-flight entertainment. The lounge is sacred for us and the problem is that if we allow people to buy access, we will worry about its exclusivity. It’s been a year since you took over India operations for Singapore Airlines. What change would you like to see in the domestic aviation scene? I think the new civil aviation policy that was drafted and published last year was favourable; infrastructure, airports are improving. The new regional connectivity scheme is good for the aviation industry. But the operating costs are pretty high in India, especially with taxes. It’s among the highest in our network. In India, every year you see a lot of escalation in costs, in office space, contract rates go up in parking, ground handling, lounge costs etc. The government as a whole is trying to cap inflation in airline operating costs, so in a sense, we’re counting our blessings.

'There is no deal,' Brookings Institution Center for Middle East Policy senior fellow Bruce Riedel, who runs the organization's intelligence project, wrote Monday. Spicer, however, said there are actual contracts in place – but later conceded: 'I don't know what was actually signed.' Under tough questioning, he cited '$110 billion of Defense procurement items that were military sales with Saudi Arabia initially, that was totaled up to $350 billion over the next couple of years.' 'The immediate $110 million [sic], I believe, were signed right then' in Riyadh on May 20. Separately, a White House official told DailyMail.com on Monday that much of what Trump announced in Saudi Arabia was 'prospective in nature.' White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted on Tuesday that a Trump administration-announced $110 billion 'arms deal' with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia includes actual signed contracts for military hardware purchases The arms deal between King Salman (right) and U.S. companies is all smoke and mirrors, according to a Middle East expert who says there are no actual new defense contracts President Donald Trump claimed in a May 21 speech during the Arabic Islamic American Summit in Riyadh that he and King Salman had inked a 'landmark agreement' including ;a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase' Spicer claimed on Twitter that the agreements signed by the US. and Saudi Arabia constituted the 'largest single arms deal in US history' 'It takes months to hammer out actual arms deals,' the White House official said. 'No one in Washington actually thinks the president and King Salman had a punch list of boats and planes and missiles, complete with price tags, specs and delivery dates.' Spicer said on Tuesday, however, that 'I believe most of the Defense stuff, the initial $110 billion ... was up front and done' when President Donald Trump met with Saudi King Salman in Riyadh last month. Brookings Institution senior fellow Bruce Riedel claims the entire idea of a massive new job-creating arms deal between U.S. defense contractors and the Saudi government is 'fake news'  Riedel says it isn't so.  Citing his sources in Congress and in companies that would stand to make a profit from a gargantuan transfer of U.S. military technology to Riyadh, he declared on Monday that 'there are a bunch of letters of interest or intent, but not contracts.' The U.S. Senate, which must approve individual defense contracts, hasn't been notified of any new ones, Riedel says. The Pentagon refers only to 'intended sales.' A little-noticed May 20 fact sheet from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Pentagon agency that oversees the international sharing of military matériel and expertise, lumped Trump's announcement into six existing 'Letters of Offer and Acceptance' – the formal term for government-to-government agreements.  White House deputy press secretary Michael Short referred DailyMail.com to the National Security Council for comment on Tuesday. NSC spokesman Michael Anton did not respond to a request for information. Trump, pictured Tuesday at the White House, can ill afford a credibility lapse at a time when Middle East tensions are approaching an all-time high  The sale of Lockheed Martin's 'Multi-Mission Surface Combatant' frigate to Saudi Arabia was approved in October 2015, not during Trump's trip to Riyadh The Defense Department told Congress in August 2016 that the Saudis would spend $1.15 billion on General Dynamics hardware including new Abrams battle tanks, but that transfer of hardware was part of the Trump administration's claim of success The Saudis asked Boeing in December for permission to buy Chinook military helicopters, but Trump's team touted it as a success on their watch In a May 21 speech to the Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, Trump declared that his team had 'signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia.' 'This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase,' he said, striking a rock-solid tone on the deal that Riedel now says is paper-thin. Since then there have been few whispers in Washington about any fine print, and fewer about timetables for actual deal-making. The White House framed the arms deal in concrete terms in the wake of Trump's Saudi visit. 'That was a tremendous day,' Trump said at the top of a bilateral meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef on May 20.  'Tremendous investments in the United States. Hundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the United States and jobs, jobs, jobs.' White House press secretary Sean Spicer claimed that day on Twitter that nearly $110 billion in defense contracts represented the 'largest single arms deal in US history.' It's typical for governments to work out the minutiae of major international agreements well in advance of any public announcements. With global attention focused on Trump's May visit to the Middle East, however, the White House may have found the conditions too tempting to waste.  Riedel cited sales proposals that have been publicly identified as part of the Trump administration's Saudi weapons plan, and calls them 'old news repackaged.' One project, a $11.25 billion sale of Lockheed Martin's 'Multi-Mission Surface Combatant Ships,' was first announced in October 2015 while Trump was still in a tight race for the Republican presidential nomination.   The frigate, a specialized version of a coastal patrol ship the U.S. Navy uses, doesn't technically exist yet. Another Lockheed armament, the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense system (THAAD), is already deployed in South Korea.

Share this article Share 284 shares The Defense Security Cooperation Agency fact sheet, released in conjunction with the White House's initial boast of a jobs-boosting Saudi deal, also mentioned piggybacking on existing approvals for 153 General Dynamics Abrams tanks, 48 Boeing Chinook helicopters, 10 Lockheed Persistent Threat Detection System 'aerostat' reconnaissance blimps and an assortment of explosives and ammunition. One document describes the Pentagon notifying Congress of a possible sale of bombs and missiles to the Saudis. That agreement dates back to 2013.  Regardless of how much of the White House's promised $110 billion in military hardware sales actually materializes, Riedel argues Saudi Arabia is in no shape to write a massive check. Low oil prices and protracted military action in Yemen have put a crimp in the kingdom's purse, he notes. And Congress, Riedel says, would be hard-pressed to approve a new transfer of weapons to the Arab world without an accompanying sale 'to compensate the Israelis and preserve their qualitative edge' in the Middle East. The last big U.S.-Saudi arms deal, negotiated in 2012, required such a tit-for-tat. Even so, Riedel says, Riyadh has struggled to make its payments since global oil prices took a dive in 2015. Separately, Saudi-funded lobbyists spent $270,000 between October and March at the Trump family-owned hotel down the street from the White House  The expenditures, including $190,000 for hotel rooms, were part of a campaign to weaken a 2016 law which allows Americans to sue foreign governments that support global terrorism The stunning claim that the arms deal is a hollow one comes as the Saudi kingdom's Washington, D.C. lobbyists reported paying $270,000 to President Donald Trump's hotel just blocks from the White House in recent months. Those payments, which are unrelated to defense lobbying, are a small part of an $8.4 million campaign to undermine a 2016 law allowing U.S. citizens to sue foreign governments that sponsor terror attacks. The Daily Caller was first to report the lobbying disclosure, made with the Department of Justice in accordance with Foreign Agents Registration Act requirements.  MSLGroup, the lobby firm on the Saudis' payroll, told The Wall Street Journal that most of the expenses – which included $190,272 for lodging, $78,204 for catering and $1,568 for parking – were racked up before Trump became president on January 20.  The Trump International Hotel in Washington is part of the Trump Organization, the family business which he stepped away from running when he took office.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. Most people start their real estate career investing in residential properties. Eventually, they look to commercial investing because it is much more profitable. Before you jump into commercial real estate there is very different information you need and a different approach compared to residential investing. Six Tips to Get You Started in Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate is valued differently than residential. Residential properties derive their value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties in the neighborhood. Commercial real estate cares little about comparable sales. The value of commercial property is determined based on cash flow. Two buildings, each with 6,000 square feet and located on the same downtown block will have different asking prices. A single tenant small grocery store will have less cash flow than a four-tenant office building for attorneys and CPAs. Market and sector knowledge is critical to your success. If you have personal knowledge about a particular commercial sector, stay with that sector. If you have no knowledge about a sector, gain the knowledge you need before investing. Even if you’re only the landlord, you don’t want to invest in a hotel if you don’t know anything about the hospitality industry. Same thing with the manufacturing sector. You don’t want to own an industrial park if you don’t know the best use of the property to maximize cash flow. Different formulas are used in commercial real estate investing. Along with sector knowledge, you need to learn new profit and loss formulas before investing in commercial properties. In residential you may have only bought properties for 75% of after repair market value or rentals that cash flowed 20% above expenses. In commercial real estate, you need to understand cap rates, net operating income, loan to value ratios, and other commercial specific formulas. These are not difficult but you need to fully understand what each means and how they affect your profitability. Patience is a virtue when investing in commercial real estate. You don’t always want to invest in whatever is currently on the market just because you have the money. First, you want to determine what you want to invest in based on tip 2 above. Next, build a network of professionals involved in the type of investment you want to make. Finally, wait for the right property to come along at the right price based on the formulas in tip 3. Consider the long term impacts before investing. Besides the immediate cash flow, you need to understand what is likely to happen to commercial real estate in the surrounding area in the coming years. Is it located in a city where the core infrastructure has been neglected for years? If so, businesses will slowly begin locating elsewhere in the years ahead. Look at things such as a major employer in the area that might be struggling financially and it’s becoming questionable if they will survive. Look at the tax base of the community. Has it consistently been declining along with associated services? Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. If you’ve had success as a residential investor, keep some on your holdings in residential. The commercial and residential sectors don’t always run in the same business cycle. Whether investing in stocks and bonds or real estate, smart investors always strive for a diversified portfolio. Commercial real estate is a great way to invest to become wealthy and can provide passive income streams for retirement. Following these commercial investing tips and building a strong network greatly increases your chances at success. Please leave a comment if this article was helpful or if you have a question.

news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching video Eclipse 2017 news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching video Eclipse 2017 news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching video Eclipse 2017 Space.com Spaceflight India Just Launched Its Heaviest & Most Powerful Rocket Yet By Tariq Malik, Space.com Managing Editor | June 5, 2017 04:50pm ET MORE The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched its most powerful and heaviest rocket yet on Monday (June 5), sending a communications satellite into orbit in a successful debut flight. Called the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV MkIII), the new rocket lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India, at 7:58 a.m. EDT (1158 GMT), successfully delivering the massive GSAT-19 communications satellite into orbit. "Weighing 3,136 kg at lift-off [6,913 lbs.], GSAT-19 is the heaviest satellite launched from the Indian soil," ISRO officials wrote in a statement.

The mission launched the GSAT-19 communications satellite for India. Credit: ISRO India's GSLV MkIII rocket is an upgraded version of the country's GSLV rocket. The new version stands 141 feet tall (43 meters) and weighs 705 tons (640 metric tons) at launch liftoff. While it is slightly shorter than its predecessor — the 160-foot (49 m) GSLV Mark II — the new version is 200 tons heavier and can deliver satellites weighing up to 8,818 lbs. (4,000 kilograms) to a geostationary transfer orbit. That's nearly double the lift capacity of its predecessor. According to India Today, the GSLV MkIII is a heavy-lift rocket that weighs as much as 200 elephants, or five Boeing jumbo jets. It is powered by a liquid-fueled core stage, two strap-on solid rocket motors and a liquid-fueled upper stage. "This was the first orbital mission of GSLV MkIII which was mainly intended to evaluate the vehicle performance including that of its fully indigenous cryogenic upper stage during the flight," ISRO officials said in a statement.

Kiran Kumar said, India Today reported. "Both the GSLV MkIII and the GSAT-19 launch have been successful." In 2014, ISRO launched an experimental version of the GLSV MkIII to test a prototype of a space capsule built to carry three astronauts into space. That mission was successful, but it was a suborbital test only and not intended to reach orbit.

Credit: ISRO Monday's GSLV MkIII launch isn't the only big first for India's space program this year. In February, ISRO launched a smaller Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle packed with 104 satellites, setting a new record for the most satellites launched on a single rocket.

In March, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on large electronic devices in aircraft cabins on flights from ten airports, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. The move reportedly saw a drop in passengers. Now, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is reportedly considering an expansion of a ban on laptops and other large electronics in cabins. U.S. officials are allegedly concerned that explosives disguised as laptops could be directly detonated onboard an aircraft. But IATA General Director Alexander de Juniac said a ban extension will hurt business. If a laptop ban is extended across to Europe, Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo believes airports will be able to adapt to the new security arrangements. The issue of security has long concerned the global aviation industry. But at the Cancun meeting, the IATA raised its 2017 industry profit outlook to $31.4 billion dollars, up from a previous forecast of $29.8 billion dollars. Boeing Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth believes airlines will prove to be resistant given the security climate. The forecast underscored a new golden age for airlines’ profitability even as carriers scramble to meet fast-changing electronics restrictions, pressure to limit emissions and unprecedented scrutiny on social media over their every mistake.

Wilson also discussed the service branch’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2018 that includes the plan to acquire 46 Lockheed Martin-built F-35A Lightning II fighter jets and 15 Boeing-made KC-46A Pegasus aircraft as well as fund development work on the B-21 Raider bomber program, the Air Force reported Monday. She said the service branch intends to retain more pilots and aircrews through the implementation of a new aviation bonus structure and plans to field to Europe an F-16 Fighter Falcon fighter unit in early 2018 in support of the European Reassurance Initiative, the report added.

The military government plans to upgrade its U-Tapao airfield into a thriving commercial hub. Photo: AFP Forum U-Tapao Airport, built in 1966 by the US military to launch B-52 bombardments on Thailand’s communist insurgency-plagued neighbors – Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam – has a new mission: saving the Thai economy from its capitalism-challenged doldrums. Thailand averaged 2.4% economic growth between 2013 to 2016, while growth continues to lag this year. The country’s former communist and socialist neighbors enjoyed growth rates of 7-8% over the same period. Today, U-Tapao is on a new economic front line under military junta rule. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox “We know the country requires a new growth engine, and U-Tapao is part of that,” said Rear Admiral Worapol Tongpricha, director of U-Tapao Airport Authority (UAA). “Without U-Tapao the future growth of the national economy would be difficult,” he said. Rear Admiral Worapol Tongpricha, director of U-Tapao Airport Authority (UAA), says the airport’s conversion is crucial to Thailand’s future growth. Photo: Peter Janssen Since mid-2015, U-Tapao has been operating under a “One Airport, Two Missions” strategy. While maintaining its military functions as the Royal Thai Navy’s main airport for marine aircraft and relief operations, U-Tapao Rayong Pattaya International Airport has ambitions to become the country’s third largest commercial airport, after only Bangkok’s Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi international airports. Passenger traffic at U-Tapao jumped threefold from 170,000 in 2015, to 710,000 last year. With more airlines now servicing the airport, and a second terminal scheduled to open in August, some 1.2 million passengers are anticipated this year. The government plans to build a third terminal and a second runway which could boost the airport’s capacity to 15 million by the year 2021.

Photo: Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha U-Tapao has actually been open to commercial operations since 1990, when the government designated it an international airport to serve the Eastern Seaboard – Thailand’s industrial corridor on its eastern coast, comprising Chachoengsao, Chonburi and Rayong provinces. Sparked by the discovery of huge natural gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand, the Eastern Seaboard now hosts Thailand’s petrochemical industry, most of the country’s automotive production and an assortment of light industries in electrical appliances and electronics. The Eastern Seaboard was the main economic initiative of former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, the army general who ruled over a series of elected governments during 1980-1988 and significantly opened the economy to foreign investment and trade-driven growth. Current Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who rose to power in a May 2014 coup, has returned to the seaboard for his own future economic vision for the kingdom. Prayuth, with his chief economic lieutenant deputy premier Somkid Jatusripitak, have devised the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) program as a master plan to raise Thailand’s future growth to 4%-5% and enhance the competitiveness of its many sagging industries. A worker at the port of Bangkok, Thailand May 26, 2016. Photo: Reuters/Jorge Silva The EEC, comprising 4,800 hectares in the same three provinces that make up the Eastern Seaboard, aims to draw foreign direct investment to new value-added, higher-tech industries, with ten designated priority sectors that will receive top tax incentives and other inducements. Those include low income tax rates for foreign executives and experts from the Board of Investment (BOI), the government’s main FDI promotion office. Notably, one of the ten priority sectors is aviation-related industries and logistics, where U-Tapao promises to play an important role. With its 3,500 meter-long by 60 meters-wide runway built gratis by the US military, U-Tapao has played an important role in bailing out Bangkok’s aviation industry in the recent past. The airport, situated about 115 kilometers southeast of the capital, served as the main evacuation route for thousands of international travelers who were stranded in Bangkok during the “Yellow Shirt” protests of 2008, that shut down both Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi airports for eight days. U-Tapao saved the day again in 2011, when devastating floods inundated the capital’s Don Muang Airport, shutting down the facility for months. Boeing 747 aircraft sit in flood waters at Bangkok’s domestic Don Muang airport at dawn, November 20, 2011. Photo: Reuters/Sukree Sukplang Last year, when 32.6 million tourists visited Thailand, up 8.9% year-on-year, U-Tapao helped ease the pressure on Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi airports, both of which are straining to service the surging numbers, driven largely by Chinese tourists. Thai Air Asia, a low-cost carrier, in 2015 named U-Tapao one of its five flight bases in Thailand, opening two new routes to Nanning and Nanchang, China, to U-Tapao. Five airlines now operate out of U-Tapao and the airport’s authorities are seeking to attract more. Nearly 80% of the tourists arriving in U-Tapao head for Pattaya, Thailand’s cheap-thrills beach resort that is particularly popular among Chinese visitors, who accounted for 8.8 million, or nearly 27%, of all international visitors to Thailand last year. The Thai government’s short-term objective for U-Tapao is to facilitate more tourist arrivals, particularly from China. “Tourism is the main revenue-earner for Thailand for the time being, so they [the government] urgently require an airport to facilitate tourism growth, and there is nowhere else other than U-Tapao,” Worapol said. Chinese tourists take a s group selfie photo at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok. Photo: Reuters Currently the airport is using only 40% of its runway’s capacity, which can handle 60,000 flights a year. Built originally for B52 bombers, U-Tapao has no problem accommodating large modern Airbus 380 or Boeing 747 commercial aircraft. The airport’s second longer-term mission is to serve as a hub for aviation-related activities and logistics under the EEC program. U-Tapao has allocated 960 hectares of U-Tapao’s 2,560 hectares complex to civilian activities, including a 320-hectare plot of land that could serve as a maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) facility. Thai Airways International and Airbus SAS have signed a memorandum of understanding to conduct a feasibility study on the MRO project. Boeing, Airbus’ arch rival, has also expressed an interest in establishing a training hub at U-Tapao.

Photo: Reuters/Chaiwat Subprasom/File Photo With nearly a third of the airbase allocated to civilian activities, elements within the Thai Navy have reservations about the future of their military mission. Don Mueang Airport also started life as a military air base for the Royal Thai Air Force and was eventually transformed into Bangkok’s main civilian airport, with the Air Force’s role much diminished. “That’s one lesson we’ve learned,” Worapol said. “We want to make sure our military operation is not jeopardized, because the location of U-Tapao is very strategic for rendering stability and security in the region.” Allowing the navy to run the airport’s civilian side might prove a boon for security, as well as eliminate unscrupulous taxi scams, he said. U-Tapao’s development is just one indicator of the rising role of the Thai navy, whose annual budget is normally dwarfed by the more politically powerful army. On April 18, the Cabinet approved a 13.5 billion baht (US$393 million) for the navy to purchase a Chinese-made Yuan Class S26T submarine, the first of three to be purchased. A submarine base will need to be set up at Sattahip Navy Base, next door to U-Tapao, to accommodate the vessels. “I think the project at U-Tapao is part of the political economy for helping the navy find generators of income for itself,” said Paul Chambers, an international affairs lecturer at Thailand’s Narsuan University. “The [EEC], of which the navy facilities are a part, could lead to profits for the navy if their land could be leased. We shall see money being made that they hadn’t made in the past.” Share Tweet Linkedin Email Southeast Asia Business Thailand U-Tapao Airport tourism You May Also Like Japan’s economy well short of first quarter growth expectations; oil blamed Three reasons to buy Asian stocks Debris found in sea after Myanmar military plane goes missing New age war on terror for Southeast Asia Japan Q1 GDP revised down by more than half, analysts still upbeat Growing memory needs means more chip-making investment in 2018 Comments continue reading More on this topic Japan’s economy well short of first quarter growth expectations; oil blamed Asia Times and Reuters Three reasons to buy Asian stocks David P.

Tuesday Jun 6, 2017 at 12:11 AM Jun 6, 2017 at 12:11 AM By the time Air Force One started down the runway at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, to bring President Trump home, the Atlantic had grown markedly wider than it was when he flew to Riyadh. In a Munich beer hall Sunday, Angela Merkel confirmed it. Europe must begin to look out for itself, she said, “take our fate into our own hands. … The times in which we could rely fully on others, they are somewhat over.” Merkel’s apprehensions are understandable. A divorce could be in the cards. During his visit to NATO in Brussels and the G-7 in Sicily, Trump, with both his words and body language, revealed his thinking on who are friends and who are freeloaders. Long before arriving, Trump had cheered Brexit, the British decision to quit the EU, and shown a preference for nationalist Marine Le Pen in the French election won handily by Emmanuel Macron. But when it comes to leaders, Trump seems to prefer Deke House to student council types. He has hailed Vladimir Putin as a “strong ruler” and “very smart.” In Riyadh, Trump declared King Salman a “wise man.” He calls China’s Xi Jinping “a great guy,” and welcomed Turkish autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the Oval Office: “It is a great honor to have you with us.” When Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has imprisoned and killed thousands of the Muslim Brotherhood, came to visit, Trump said, “He’s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation.” In a phone call, Trump also praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has had narcotics dealers gunned down in the streets, for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” Trump has even found merit in Kim Jong Un, the 33-year-old dictator of North Korea, describing him as a “a pretty smart cookie.” And where Trump was photographed by the Russians grinning broadly with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, his confab with Merkel was marked by a seeming reluctance to shake hands. But the disagreements with Europe are deeper than matters of style. Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have indicated that in dealing with foreign nations, U.S. support for democratic norms and human rights will now take a back seat to strategic interests. In Riyadh, Trump signaled the Sunni King of Bahrain we will no longer be giving him instructions on how to treat his Shiite majority. We’re not “here to lecture,” Trump assured the Arab royals. After the conclave, the king’s police killed five and wounded dozens of demonstrators outside the home of a Shiite cleric, and arrested 286 of his supporters. Of greater concern to Trump and Tillerson is the retention of the Persian Gulf naval base of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain. Trump also tilts toward GOP skepticism of the threat of global warming and is considering pulling out of the Paris climate accord that is the altarpiece of the environmentalist international. In Brussels, Trump praised NATO’s decision to back the U.S. war in Afghanistan after 9/11, but did not specifically recommit to Article 5, requiring all NATO nations to treat an attack on one as an attack on all, which our nervous NATO allies had wanted to hear. Instead, they got an earful of pure Trump about how they owed back pay for NATO and that only five NATO nations were meeting their obligation to allocate 2 percent of GDP to defense. Merkel seemed to take this as an implied threat that the U.S commitment to defend Europe from a Russia with one-tenth of NATO-Europe’s GDP may be contingent, and may have a time limit on it. Moreover, France, Britain and Germany appear far more solidly committed to the Iran nuclear deal than are Trump and Congress. A U.S.-NATO collision could come here, and soon. The Iranians have signed on to purchase 100 Airbus aircraft and 80 commercial airliners from Boeing. If the Republicans impose new sanctions on Iran, or scupper the Boeing deal, Europe would have to decide whether to abandon the Airbus sales, or deliver the planes and perhaps take over the Boeing contract. That could bring a crisis. And any U.S. confrontation with Iran, pressed upon us by Saudis, Israelis and Sunni Arabs could find Europeans bailing out wholesale on the next U.S. war in the Middle East. Trump also seems less committed to the sanctions on Russia for its reannexation of Ukraine and support of pro-Russian rebels in the Donbass than does NATO Europe or Congress. From his rough remarks, Trump sees the Europeans as freeloaders on U.S. defense, laggards on their NATO contributions, and mercantilists who craft policies to run endless trade surpluses at our expense, especially the Germans who are “bad, very bad.” The European half of Trump’s trip should be taken as a fire-bell-in-the-night warning: Shape up, Europe, or you may find yourselves on your own when it comes to the defense of your continent. For we Americans have had about enough.

In a statement, ex-finance minister Tendai Biti’s party said the 93 year old leader may have mistaken Tokwe-Mukosi dam for an ocean. The Zimbabwean leader officially commissioned the country's largest inland dam in Masvingo few weeks ago. “Unless if we want to annex a neighbouring country and administer its oceans, then what are we doing there,” said the party on Monday. “Maybe, Mugabe got confused when he officially opened Tokwe Mukosi Dam. He probably thought that Zimbabwe had built an ocean against the wishes of the imperialists.” PDP said Mugabe’s endless foreign jaunts were draining the fiscus. The party further noted that while the President’s trips were already a cost to the country, Mugabe’s recent trips have turned even more expensive as the veteran leader has been forced to charter expensive planes from outside following the banning of the national carrier Air Zimbabwe from flying into other countries. “The People’s Democratic Party is aware that Mugabe uses more than five million dollars to for each state visit he takes, when hospitals cannot afford to procure basic painkillers. “The costs are going up considering the fact that Mugabe now prefers to hire private planes due to the depletion of the Air Zimbabwe fleet which has since been declared unsafe by many countries including the United States which is the mother country of Boeing the manufacturer of the plane which Mugabe used to take for his infinite trips abroad," said PDP.  Biti’s party has described President Mugabe’s love for foreign trips as a demonstration of madness which requires all political players to unite against. With only six months into the year, Mugabe has been out of the country for 77 days prior to the current trip which is his 10th out of the country for the ageing leader.

(Photo Credit: Sean Kimmons) VIEW ORIGINAL HOUSTON -- Like the out-of-this-world missions they train for, the career paths taken by the Army's only two active-duty astronauts may also boggle the mind. Lt. Col. Drew Morgan, a Ranger-tabbed doctor with several years of experience in Special Forces, now heads the Army Space and Missile Defense Command's small but skilled astronaut force. And while he once fed his adventurous spirit by flying into stadiums as part of West Point's parachute team, he looks forward to the ultimate adrenaline rush -- being blasted off into space. His comrade, Maj. Anne McClain, has also acquired a stacked resume in her 14 years of Army service. With over 2,000 flight hours on 20 different rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, along with piloting a Kiowa Warrior helicopter in combat, she's no stranger to air travel. On top of that, she was a Marshall scholar who earned two master's degrees while studying in England. During her time across the pond, she also fine-tuned her rugby play before later landing a spot on the U.S. women's national rugby squad. Both Morgan and McClain agreed that without the Army, those unique opportunities likely would not have happened. "I owe that back to the Army," the 41-year-old Morgan said of his accomplishments during his past two decades in uniform. "Everything that made me a good candidate to become a good astronaut came from the Army." McClain also joined the Army first and foremost to serve the nation, not necessarily to travel in space. "It was the path I wanted to take even if I had not become an astronaut," the 37-year-old said. "The Army is probably going to have to kick me out at some point because I'm not going anywhere." SPACE SOLDIERS The talented duo is part of a team of nearly 50 astronauts, some of whom are retired Army officers, in NASA's human spaceflight program. One of those seasoned officers, retired Col. Patrick Forrester, profoundly influenced McClain's military career years before she was selected for the program in 2013, along with Morgan and six others. At the time, McClain, a 19-year-old cadet from Spokane, Washington, listened to Forrester speak about his experience during a visit to West Point. He told the cadets that the Army was too important to simply be a stepping stone to something greater, and if they truly paid attention to their job and did the right thing for their Soldiers, they would be rewarded. "It'll work out for you in the end if you do that," she recalled of his speech. "That was best advice I could have gotten at that time and he was absolutely right." Shortly before coming to Johnson Space Center as an astronaut candidate, she was surprised to see Forrester's familiar name again in her reporting instructions. The person who had inspired her 15 years ago was now the supervisor of her class. "To me, that was just full circle," she said. Almost 20 Soldiers have become astronauts since Maj. Robert Stewart paved the way in 1979, before he went on to do the first untethered mission in space using a jetpack in 1984. "They were people that I looked up to and followed their careers from afar as I was growing up as a young cadet and young officer in the Army," Morgan said of Forrester, former Col. Jeff Williams and the others who came before him. As the years have passed, so have the missions, especially when the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Today, American astronauts are launched into space on Russian Soyuz rockets and typically stay in space for six months to help maintain and conduct science experiments on the International Space Station with other foreign partners. Army astronauts have embraced the longer trips, as shown in their almost continuous presence in space over the past two years. "We're very well suited for that," Morgan said of the lengthy missions. "The Army has quite a good reputation in the astronaut corps, and I look forward to seeing more Army presence on the International Space Station." IN TRAINING While they wait to be assigned to a space mission, Morgan and McClain constantly train so that they are prepared for when their time comes. Recently, inside a simulator dome with a 180-degree viewing angle, McClain practiced grabbing a cargo load with the space station's robotic arm. While peering out of a mock cupola, a multi-windowed observatory attached to the space station, McClain operated the controls and brought in supplies from a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that would normally deliver food, clothing and science experiments to the crew every six months or so. The day before, Morgan had used virtual training equipment to mimic maneuvering outside the space station with a jetpack. Although such a spacewalk is one of the most difficult and dangerous tasks to do in space, he said, he'd still jump at the chance to do one in real life. "It's an exciting, tense and physically demanding period of time while you're out there outside the space station for six or seven hours," said Morgan, who was born to a military family in a city with whom he shares his namesake -- Morgantown, West Virginia. In preparing for a spacewalk, astronauts also train at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, which is basically a huge pool that holds a replica of the space station. Using a specialized spacesuit that simulates microgravity, astronauts stay underwater for hours completing tasks, such as replacing the station's heavy batteries. Astronauts also train to fly a T-38 Talon jet trainer, learn about space systems and a whole new set of acronyms, and receive in-depth lessons on the Russian language, which along with English are the official languages onboard the station. "One of the most challenging and cool things we do at NASA is that we don't do the same thing any two days," McClain said. With all sorts of moving pieces going on, astronauts must rely on an elevated level of teamwork. The ability to lead, but also to follow, are strong traits for an astronaut to have when working in close quarters for long periods of time on specialized, costly missions. Already well-trained, Soldiers come to NASA with a good exposure to these types of teams, according to Chris Looper, a NASA training integrator who helps instruct astronauts. "Being able to bring that team together so it can be a high-performing team, and not just a group of individuals who are all trying to perform at a high level, that makes a big difference," he explained. A successful astronaut, he said, should have an easy-going attitude and be able to roll with the punches when things don't go right. Another helpful characteristic is endless thirst to be proficient in their tasks through continuous training. "[So,] when you do something real in space, it will feel like a practice run," Looper said. FUTURE SPACEFLIGHT While the space station mission has been a top priority for the past 17 years, other added elements to NASA's human spaceflight program may be in the near future. In February, NASA officials announced a study to look at launching two crew members around the moon in 2019, as part of the Orion spacecraft's maiden flight with a NASA rocket. The ambitious goal for the spacecraft is to one day enable human exploration of asteroids and deep-space destinations, including Mars. NASA's Commercial Crew Program also has SpaceX and Boeing developing two launch vehicles to send astronauts into space, rather than sharing rides on Russian Soyuz rockets. "We're on the cusp of some pretty amazing times in the space program," McClain said, "and we're going to see things that we've never seen before." The current space station mission, a joint effort of 15 nations, is projected to last until 2024. But for Morgan and McClain, it doesn't really matter what mission they end up serving. An optimistic McClain said that there are no bad assignments. "When I look at all of the different jobs I could do, I'd be thrilled to get any of them," she said. After all, she didn't expect to end up in her current role when she first learned she had been selected while working as a test pilot at the Redstone Test Center in Alabama. It was bittersweet for her to leave the Army ranks and not be able to wear her military uniform every day, she said. But whatever she does as an astronaut, she still brings a little "hooah" with her. "The space program has always been so inspirational to me and I love contributing to it," she said. "But what really makes it special for me is to be able to do it as a Soldier. "There are many paths to being a Soldier, and this is [just] one of them."

The deal would have been facilitated by a $1.7 billion investment from Softbank, but it was contingent on a go-ahead from at least 85 percent of the bondholders. In a statement, OneWeb founder Greg Wyler said his company “remains on the fast track to bridge the digital divide” despite the setback, and still plans to deploy a low-Earth-orbit satellite constellation to provide global internet access. He said a production facility in France would start manufacturing satellites “in just a few weeks,” and launches would begin about 10 months later. OneWeb’s global service rollout would start with Alaska in 2019, he said. SpaceX and Boeing are among the other companies pursuing plans to provide global satellite broadband services.

The guarantees, approved by the cabinet, will cover $525 million owed to the U.S. Exim Bank and the rest to local lenders, said the document seen by Reuters. The airline, partly-owned by Air France KLM and the Kenyan government, has struggled to return to profit after tourist traffic slumped four years ago following a spate of attacks by Somalia-based Islamist militants. The government will also convert its existing loans to the carrier into equity, it said. It was not immediately clear how much it has lent the carrier, but a source at the airline said it was a "significant" amount lent over time. The plan to guarantee the existing debt will be taken to the National Assembly for approval, the government said. "The guarantees would be in exchange for material concessions to be provided as part of the financial restructuring which would secure future funding for the company," the cabinet document said, without giving details on the concessions. ALSO READ: Kenya Airways' posts Sh10.2billion full year loss from Sh26.1b in 2015 The government would not provide additional cash as part of the restructuring of the airline, it added. The debt owed to the U.S Exim bank is related to the financing of the purchase of the carrier's Boeing planes. Kenya Airways says the financial restructuring will involve restructuring debt and securing additional capital to help dig itself out of a position of negative equity, and attain a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments.

Scott Ceremonially Signs Triumph Gulf Coast Bills In Pensacola House, Senate To Convene Wednesday Afternoon Gov. Scott Ceremonially Signs Triumph Gulf Coast Bills In Pensacola June 6, 2017 With the first check — for $300 million — on the way, Northwest Florida leaders know they must wisely invest the money across the region to ensure state lawmakers keep the BP settlement cash tap open. After Gov. Rick Scott signed legislation Friday, the non-profit organization Triumph Gulf Coast is expected to eventually handle three-quarters of the $2 billion the state will receive over the next 13 years from BP in a settlement stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Triumph Gulf Coast board members said Monday the Legislature can always alter future payments if they fail to properly make economic-development and educational investments with the first batch of money. “If we do a poor job with the first $300 (million) that’s not going to help us down the road,” said Allan Bense, a former state House speaker from Panama City who also chairs Triumph Gulf Coast. “There is $1.2 billion still out there. I’m mindful of the fact that the Legislature can pull that $1.2 billion. They can get that future money.” Bense’s comments came as Gov. Rick Scott conducted the first of two ceremonial bill signings on Monday — in Panama City and Pensacola — for measures (HB 7077 and HB 7079) tied to the BP settlement. Scott signed the bills on Friday. Scott said by wisely investing the money in infrastructure and education, Panhandle counties should be able to compete for manufacturing jobs against other Southern states. “People love to be in the Panhandle, we should win those types of jobs,” Scott said. “On top of that, we should be able to get good back-office jobs, regional offices and corporate offices. All of these are things we have opportunity to do if we are wise to how we spend our money.” The House and Senate spent much of this year’s regular legislative session battling over how the money could be used before ultimately reaching agreement. Rep. Jay Trumbull, a Panama City Republican who oversaw the issue in the House, expressed optimism Monday. “I’m very pleased with the way to the board is set up,” Trumbull said. “This is going to be essentially a business entity. They’re a governmental entity, but the fact that they’re going to have the ability to look at each individual project. I truly believe that in the next 10 to 15 years, the Panhandle you see today, we’re going to see extraordinary growth directly because of Triumph.” In addition to the money, the measures set minimums for how much each county — Bay, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Wakulla and Walton — will receive and expands the Triumph board from five to seven members to provide more representation from less-populated counties. Jorge Gonzalez, CEO of The St. Joe Company, said the money will help the region make up for years of economic development hindered by the devastating spill, which dumped millions of gallons of oil less than 100 miles off the Florida coast just as the region was emerging from the recession. “It’s been a long seven years for many of us,” Gonzalez said. “This legislation is about creating jobs. It’s not about building buildings.” Bense would like to see the money eventually help attract a large company such as Boeing. “That’s what I would love, but in the meantime you have to hit singles and doubles,” Bense said. However, no funding decisions or project vetting will be done until House and Senate leaders make their appointments to bring the Triumph board to seven, he said. “I want to allocate as much as I can to economic development,” Bense said. “I don’t foresee us funding boat ramps or gun ranges, or things like that. I think those are county and city obligations.” Pictured top: Gov. Rick Scott with local leaders at a ceremonial bill signing in Pensacola Monday afternoon.

The announcement was made in light of several Gulf Arab countries cutting off all land and air connections with Qatar because of political tensions. This was revealed in a statement issued by PIA CEO Nayyar Hayat who ordered the commencement of special flights to bring back stranded Pakistani travelers. He asked PIA’s Country Manager to Qatar to help out the stranded Pakistanis there. PIA’s officials in Doha have also been asked to contact the Pakistani embassy in the city. Pakistani pilgrims headed towards Saudi Arabia for Umrah got stuck in Doha after several countries cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. These countries include: Saudi Arabia Bahrain Egypt United Arab Emirates Yemen Libya Maldives Gulf States Cutting Ties With Qatar According to news reports, Saudi Arabia has cut all land, sea and air contact with Qatar. Doha called the decision ‘unjustified.’ The above mentioned countries blame Qatar for supporting the jihadist groups (including some backed by Iran) aiming to destabilize the Middle East region. The move has affected Qatar’s food supply, 40% of which comes through Saudi Arabia. Reports indicate that Iran is going to provide the food for the time being. It should be noted that Qatar has the largest US air base in the region and is also on track to host the 2022 edition of the Football World Cup. PIA Flight Stuck in Paris In other news, passengers on board PIA flight PK-770 heading to Barcelona from Islamabad was stranded at Paris. The Boeing 777 aircraft carrying the passengers suffered a technical fault. Another flight carrying a team of engineers and equipment for repairing the Boeing plane was also delayed due to Benazir Bhutto International Airport being closed at that time. The airport was closed off for cleaning.

 10 things you need to know before European markets open Ben Moshinsky Jun. 6, 2017, 12:48 AM 491 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters / Peter Nicholls Good morning! Here's what you need to know.  1. US President Donald Trump pressed his controversial travel ban plans, calling for an expedited judicial review and urging his administration to seek a tougher version of the proposal. "The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.," Trump, referring to the US Supreme Court, wrote in a series of tweets on the issue. 2. The global economy is set to post solid growth this year, amid improving world trade and better performance by large emerging markets, but key risks could still threaten the outlook, the World Bank said. The report said that "despite substantial policy uncertainty," the global economy still is expected to grow by 2.7% for 2017, rising to 2.9% in 2018 and 2019. 3. Gold touched its highest in more than six weeks on Tuesday as Asian stock markets and the US dollar weakened ahead of the UK national election and a European Central Bank meeting scheduled for Thursday. Also on Thursday, James Comey, former head of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, is due to appear before a Senate committee for the first time. 4. Apple and Amazon will join Foxconn's bid for Toshiba's semiconductor business, the Nikkei business daily quoted Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou as saying. The two US technology giants plan to "chip in funds", Gou said, according the interview with the newspaper. 5. Oil prices reversed gains to trade down on concerns that the cutting of ties with Qatar by top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and other Arab states could hamper a global deal to reduce oil production. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain closed transport links with top liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate shipper Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremism and undermining regional stability. 6. Goldman Sachs turned down a request from Caracas to convert $5 billion in sovereign bonds into marketable securities partly because it would mean dealing directly with a Venezuelan state bank, Reuters reported. The complexity of the operation was the primary concern for Goldman, but the Wall Street bank also weighed reputational risks after opposition politicians called it to warn about the potential damage of being seen as aiding President Nicolas Maduro's administration. 7. An explosion rocked a petrochemical plant in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong, but the cause and extent of damage was unknown, the state news agency Xinhua reported. Deadly accidents are relatively common at industrial plants in China, and anger over lax standards has grown after three decades of swift economic growth marred by incidents from mining disasters to factory fires. 8. Banks in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not received any regulatory guidelines about their dealings with Qatari lenders despite the rift in diplomatic ties, Reuters reported. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting terrorism. 9. Jet Airways, India's biggest full service carrier by market share, is in talks to buy 75 single aisle aircraft with an option to purchase another 75. Jet Airways, part owned by Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, is likely to consider placing an order for either Boeing's 737 MAX planes or aircraft from Airbus SE's A320neo family. 10. Oil majors BP and Eni are deepening their foray into blockchain technology, starting to run blockchain trades in parallel with their live trading systems, according to developer BTL Group. The energy traders, together with Austria's Wien Energie, had previously tested BTL's Interbit blockchain platform over 12 weeks, carrying out trades in European natural gas.

As Europe’s legacy airlines face stormy weather, low-cost carriers (LCCs) are faring better and Ryanair in particular is proving itself ready to pounce at the first sign of weakness from a competitor. Last month, as it released its financial results, the LCC said it was engaged in a fleet review with Boeing, was extending 10 of its planned lease returns in 2018-19 and would add ...
