A global trade war could be bad news for America's largest manufacturing exporter and its top supplier. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Nov 14, 2016 at 4:25PM Donald Trump rode a protectionist ideology to the U.S. presidency last week. While some aspects of his platform are business-friendly, such as lower corporate taxes and less regulation, his vehement opposition to various trade deals could be bad news for export-oriented companies. Boeing (NYSE:BA), as the largest manufacturing exporter in the U.S., clearly has a lot to lose. So does Spirit Aerosystems (NYSE:SPR), its largest supplier. Let's take a look at the potential risks a Trump presidency poses to these two companies. Boeing relies heavily on exports these days. Image source: Boeing. Trump could spark trade wars The biggest target of president-elect Trump's protectionist rhetoric has been the NAFTA treaty. Trump believes that free trade with Mexico in particular has cost the U.S. many jobs. If the U.S. withdraws from NAFTA, it could spark a trade war between the U.S. and Mexico. But this might not impact Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems much. Aeromexico is the only major Boeing customer in Mexico. While it has dozens of planes on order, even a complete loss of that business to Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) -- the worst-case scenario -- wouldn't have a material impact on Boeing's output. By contrast, a trade war with China, Donald Trump's other main rhetorical target, could have a severe impact on Boeing's business. Trump has said that as president, he will declare China a currency manipulator and penalize it for depressing the value of the yuan to boost Chinese exports. This accusation has no basis in fact. The yuan is losing value against the dollar due to market forces, and China's government is actually intervening to try to stabilize its value. Be that as it may, if the U.S. imposes big tariffs on imports from China, it would be natural for China to retaliate by slapping tariffs on imports from the U.S. That would be bad news for Boeing, given that China is expected to need more than 6,800 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years, 17% of the global total. In addition to the usual competition from Airbus, Boeing will also face off against COMAC (a homegrown Chinese aircraft manufacturer) in the coming years. COMAC's C919, a direct competitor to the Boeing 737, is just a few years from entering service. Will Trump back the major airlines? Another risk for Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems is that the Trump administration will crack down on foreign airlines that are expanding rapidly in the U.S. The Partnership for Open and Fair Skies -- a lobbying group for the three largest U.S. airlines -- has already asked Trump to crack down on state-owned Middle Eastern airlines Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways. There's a fair amount of evidence that Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways are state-subsidized airlines. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's in the national interest to block them from expanding. The Middle Eastern airline giants have hundreds of Boeing airplanes on order, worth more than $100 billion at list prices. Middle Eastern airlines have ordered hundreds of Boeing wide-body planes. Image source: Etihad Airways. It's not clear if Trump's administration will side with the U.S. airlines and prevent the Middle Eastern airline giants from expanding further. But if it does, those airlines may retaliate by canceling some of their orders with Boeing and buying more Airbus planes. What it means for Boeing The good news for Boeing is that in the short run, airlines may not have any alternatives. Airbus is a fierce competitor, but it has a massive order backlog, especially for its most popular models: the A320neo single-aisle family and the A350 wide-body family. Airbus is in the midst of dramatically increasing production of both aircraft families. It could probably raise output further in 2020 and beyond if there were enough demand. But Airbus can't steal much business from Boeing over the next three to five years because it doesn't have many open delivery slots and doesn't have much near-term production flexibility. Smaller upstarts like Bombardier and COMAC could also steal some business from Boeing, but those are even longer-term threats. In short, the Boeing-Airbus duopoly is so firmly entrenched that rapid market share swings are nearly impossible. That said, in the long run, a return to protectionism in the U.S. could lead to permanent market share losses and a big decrease in profitability for Boeing. What it means for Spirit Aerosystems Bad news for Boeing is almost certainly bad news for Spirit Aerosystems, which is a spinoff of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Boeing aircraft programs represented 84% of Spirit's revenue last year. Spirit Aerosystems has been gradually gaining work on various Airbus aircraft programs and other programs at smaller aircraft manufacturers. It is even making a push to get more involved in defense programs. However, none of these growth opportunities would be enough to offset big production cuts at Boeing over the next 10 years. Donald Trump has said that he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Sparking trade wars that could hurt Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems -- two key U.S. manufacturers -- would be inconsistent with that agenda. Nevertheless, shareholders of both companies need to watch carefully after inauguration day to see how Donald Trump's actions as president compare to his rhetoric as a candidate.

Story continues below Related Soft local economy empties shelves at Calgary Veterans Food Bank Cancelled corporate Calgary Christmas parties could benefit local charities The scale is set up alongside a Boeing 737 at SAIT’s Aero Centre at the Calgary International Airport  in a food drive the students call “Fill the Boeing.” “We’re planning on filling the Boeing to its maximum takeoff capacity,” student Liana Buessecker explained, “which is about 55,000 pounds of food.” “It’s mind-blowing,” student Matthew Holland said. “It’s a lot of food.” Student Mattew Granley got some perspective on the size of the challenge when he first brought it up with his family. “My dad flies (Boeing 737s) for Westjet,” Granley said. “He was, like, ‘what? That’s crazy. I doubt you’d be able to do that.’” But Granley feels it’s a challenge well worth taking on. “I do have a lot of friends, I do have a lot of family who have served in the military, so it hits home for me.” The students are collecting donations of food and money until Dec. 7, with collection points at the Aero Centre and on SAIT’s main campus. Volunteers can also pick up large donations – anyone who wants to contribute that way can call 403-284-7018 to make arrangements. “If there’s a will, there’s a way,” Holland said. And as for Granley’s doubting dad, the 737 pilot: “I told him, ‘you know what?” Granley said. “We’ll show you. We’ll do it.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

The multi-billion dollar deal is allowed under the nuclear agreement between the U.S., Iran and other countries. Congress has been debating the issue for months, and a National Review Online story from September noted that two-thirds of Boeing's political donations flow to Republicans who oppose the Iran deal but quietly support the Boeing deal.  Iran Air claims it would use the aircraft for commercial purposes but some think tanks and special interest groups have said Iran shouldn't be trusted. "We have no control over what goes on in Iran and we do know that civilian aircraft have been used for non-civilian aircraft," Diane Katz of The Heritage Foundation told OneNewsNow in September. "In fact, the carrier that's buying the planes is a government-owned carrier. So the government of Iran is going to have control of these aircraft." President Obama has expressed confidence in Iran but Katz said she doesn't trust the regime. "And I think there is a lot of other people, both in the United States and around the world," she says, "who also don't have much confidence in Iran."

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com KENNEDY SPACE CENTER VISITOR COMPLEX, FL – America’s pioneering astronauts who braved the perils of the unknown and put their lives on the line at the dawn of the space age atop mighty rockets that propelled our hopes and dreams into the new frontier of outer space and culminated with NASA’s Apollo lunar landings, are being honored with the eye popping new ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC) in Florida. With fanfare and a fireworks display perfectly timed for Veterans Day, ‘Heroes and Legends’ opened its doors to the public on Friday, November 11, 2016, during a gala ceremony attended by more than 25 veteran and current NASA astronauts, including revered Gemini and Apollo space program astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell, Charlie Duke, Tom Stafford, Dave Scott, Walt Cunningham and Al Worden – and throngs of thrilled members of the general public who traveled here as eyewitnesses from all across the globe. Aldrin, Scott, and Duke walked on the Moon during the Apollo 11, 15 and 16 missions. Also on hand were the adult children of the late-astronauts Alan Shepard (first American in space) and Neil Armstrong (first man to walk on the Moon), as well as representatives from NASA, The Boeing Company (sponsor) and park operator Delaware North – for the engaging program hosted by Master of Ceremonies John Zarrella, CNN’s well known and now retired space correspondent.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The stunning new ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction is perfectly positioned just inside the entrance to the KSC Visitor Complex to greet visitors upon their arrival with an awe inspiring sense of what it was like to embark on the very first human journey’s into space by the pioneers who made it all possible ! And when every step along the way unveiled heretofore unknown treasures into the origin of us and our place in the Universe. Upon entering the park visitors will immediately and surely be mesmerized by a gigantic bas relief sculpture recreating an iconic photo of America’s first astronauts – the Mercury 7 astronauts; Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. “With all the drama of an actual trip to space, guests of Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida will be greeted with a dramatic sense of arrival with the new Heroes & Legends featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame® presented by Boeing. Positioned just inside the entrance, the attraction sets the stage for a richer park experience by providing the emotional background and context for space exploration and the legendary men and women who pioneered our journey into space,” according to a description from Delaware North Companies Parks and Resorts, which operates the KSC visitor complex. “Designed to be the first stop upon entering Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Heroes & Legends uses the early years of the space program to explore the concept of heroism, and the qualities that define the individuals who inspired their generation.” Astronauts cut the ribbon during Grand opening ceremony for the ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction on Nov. 11, 2016 at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida, led by Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle astronaut and member of the Astronaut Hall of Fame, during the ceremony. Credit: Julian Leek “I hope that all of you, when you get to see Heroes and Legends, you’re inspired,” said Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle astronaut and member of the Astronaut Hall of Fame, during the ceremony. “The children today can see that there is so much more they can reach for if they apply themselves and do well.” “I think people a thousand years from now are going to be happy to see these artifacts and relics,” Apollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden told the crowd. “We have so much on display here with a Saturn V, Space Shuttle Atlantis. People will think back and see the wonderful days we had here. And I guess in that same vein, that makes me a relic too.” Grand opening ceremony for the ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction on Nov. 11, 2016 at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida and attended by more than 25 veteran and current NASA astronauts. Credit: Julian Leek Furthermore, ‘Heroes and Legends’ is now very conveniently housed inside the new home of the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame (AHOF) – making for a unified space exploration experience for park visitors. AHOF previously was located at another off site park facility some seven miles outside and west of the Visitor Complex. The bas relief measures 30 feet tall and 40 feet wide. It is made put of fiberglass and was digitally sculpted, carved by CNC machines and juts out from the side of the new into the new 37,000 square foot U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame (AHOF) structure. To date 93 astronauts have been inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame spanning the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. “I don’t consider myself a hero like say, Charles Lindbergh,” said Jim Lovell, a member of the Astronaut Hall of Fame and Apollo 13 commander, when asked by Zarrella what it feels like to be considered an American space hero. “I just did what was proper and exciting — something for my country and my family. I guess I’m just a lucky guy.” The astronauts are also quick to say that they were supported by hundreds of thousands of dedicated people working in the space program to make Apollo happen. “It important to remember all the dedication and hard work that it took from those of us involved in the astronaut program, but also the support we received from Kennedy and all the contractors involved in Apollo,” said Apollo 16 moonwalker Charlie Duke. “400,000 people made it possible for 24 of us to go to the Moon.” “So dream big, aim high!” exclaimed Duke. “Hopefully this is an inspiration to you and your kids and grandkids.” Construction of the facility by Falcon’s Treehouse, an Orlando-based design firm began in the fall of 2015. “We’re focusing on a story to create what we consider a ‘launch pad’ for our visitors,” said Therrin Protze, the Delaware North chief operating officer of the Visitor Complex. “This is an opportunity to learn about the amazing attributes of our heroes behind the historical events that have shaped the way we look at space, the world and the future. “We are grateful to NASA for allowing us to tell the NASA story to millions of guests from all over the world,” Protze said. Visitors walk up a sweeping ramp to enter the Heroes and Legends experience. After visitors walk through the doors, they will be immersed by two successive video presentations and finally the Hall of Fame exhibit hall. Here’s a detailed description: • In the stunning 360-degree discovery bay, What is a Hero?, guests will explore how society defines heroism through diverse perspectives. Each examination of heroism starts with the following questions: What is a hero; Who are the heroes of our time; and What does it take to be a hero? During the seven-minute presentation, the historic beginning of the space race is acknowledged as the impetus for America’s push to the stars in NASA’s early years and the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. • Through the Eyes of a Hero is a custom-built theater featuring a multi-sensory experience during which guests will vicariously join NASA’s heroes and legends on the most perilous stages of their adventures. Artistically choreographed lighting and 3D imagery will be enhanced by intense, deeply resonant sound effects to create the sensation of being “in the moment.” The seven and one-half minute show takes guests on an intimate journey with four space-age heroes to fully immerse them in the awe, excitement and dangers of the first crewed space program missions. • The third experience, A Hero Is…, offers interactive exhibits that highlight the nine different attributes of our history making astronauts: inspired, curious, passionate, tenacious, disciplined, confident, courageous, principled and selfless. A collection of nine exhibit modules will explore each aforementioned attribute, through the actual experiences of NASA’s astronauts. Their stories are enhanced with memorabilia from the astronaut or the space program. A statue of astronaut Alan Shepard, America’s first person in space, stands just inside the doors to the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. The exhibit is housed in a rotunda and connects the visitor to each of the astronaut inductees through state-of-the-art interactive technology.

Share & Embed Construction Underway for the Army's High-Tech Future Helicopter for 2030s - First Flight Next Year Kris Osborn Sunday at 2:52 PM / Originally published onWarrior The Army is considering two new, high-tech designs. First flight tests are slated for 2017. The new helicopter will feature new, future-oriented sensors, weapons and guidance technologies. The Army is preparing for the first official flights of two high-tech, next-generation aircraft now being designed with a wide range of abilities to include flying faster, flying farther without needing to refuel, operating in high-hot conditions and having an ability to both reach high speeds and hover like a helicopter. The new aircraft are part of an Army-led effort, called Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator, aimed at paving the way toward ultimately engineering a new fleet of aircraft for all the services to take flight by 2030. Construction of two different high-tech, future oriented demonstrator helicopters is already underway in anticipation of ground testing later this year and initial flight testing next year, Dan Bailey, JMR TD program director, told Scout Warrior in an interview several months ago.  “Things are moving along very well. We are on schedule with exactly what our industry partners have planned,” he said. While some of the eventual requirements for the new aircraft have yet to be defined, there are some notional characteristics currently being sought after by the program. They include an ability to travel at airplane-like speeds greater than 230 knots, achieve a combat radius of 434 kilometers, use a stronger engine and operate in what’s called “high-hot” conditions of 6,000-feet and 95-degrees Fahrenheit. “We had set 230 as the speed requirement because we wanted to push the technology.  We wanted people to bring new ideas and new configurations to the table,” Bailey said in an interview with Scout Warrior several months ago. A faster, more manueverable helicopter that can fly farther on one tank of fuel would enable forces in combat to more effectively engage in longer combat operations such as destroying enemy targets or transporting small groups of mobile, lethal ground fighters. The new helicopter will also be designed to use next-generation sensors to find enemies on the move and employ next-generation weapons to attack them, Army officials describe.  The JMR TD technology effort will inform a planned program of record called Future Vertical Lift, or FVL, which will design, build and test a series of next-generation aircraft for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. “FVL is a high priority. We have identified capability gaps. We need technologies and designs that are different than what the current fleet has. It will carry more equipment, perform in high-hot conditions, be more maneuverable within the area of operations and execute missions at longer ranges,” Rich Kretzschmar, project manager for the FVL effort, told Scout Warrior in an interview several months ago. .The first flights of the demonstrator aircraft, slated for 2017, will include developmental helicopter/aircraft from two industry teams – Bell Helicopter and a Sikorsky-Boeing team.  TWO HELICOPTER DESIGNS  The Bell offering, called the V-280 Valor, seeks to advance tilt-rotor technology, wherein a winged-aircraft with two rotor blades over each wing seeks to achieve airplane speeds and retain an ability to hover and maneuver like a helicopter. Bell’s V-280 has finished what’s called a system-level design review where Army and Bell developers refine and prepare the design of the air vehicle. “They have an air vehicle concept demonstrator that they call the third-generation tilt-rotor. Their fuselage was completed and it is being delivered to Bell for the build-up of the aircraft,” Bailey said. Along with Boeing, Bell makes the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft which is currently praised by military members for its excellent operational performance in recent years. The Osprey has two rotating rotor blades which align vertically when the aircraft is in helicopter mode and then move to a horizontal position when the aircraft enters airplane mode and reaches speeds greater than 280 knots. The V-280 Valor also has two propellers which rotate from horizontal airplane mode to a vertical position, which allows for helicopter mode.  Bell officials have said their new aircraft will be able to reach speeds of 280 knots. Bell and Army officials explain that their V-280 Valor substantially advances tilt-rotor technology. “What Bell has done is taking its historical V-22 aircraft, and all the demonstrators before that, and applies them to this next-generation tilt-rotor. It is a straight wing versus a V-22 which is not straight. This reduces complexity,” Bailey explained. “They are also building additional flapping into the rotor system and individual controls that should allow for increased low-speed maneuverability.” The Sikorsky-Boeing demonstrator, called the SB>1 Defiant, uses a coaxial rotor system configuration. This is a design structure, referred to as a compound configuration, which relies upon two counter-rotating rotor blades on top of the aircraft and a thrusting mechanism in the rear. “To make a rotorcraft go fast you have to off-load the rotor lift onto something else or else you run into problems when you try to reduce the speed of that rotor. Typically, you do that with a wing but Sikorsky-Boeing came up with a lift-offset design,” Bailey added. The pusher-prop on the back of the aircraft is a small propeller behind the counter-rotating rotor heads. It is what can give the aircraft airplane-like speeds.  It operates with what’s called positive and negative pitch, allowing the aircraft to lean up or down and move both forwards and backwards, Boeing officials have said. MISSION EQUIPMENT The JMR TD program and the follow-on FVL effort will also integrate a wide range of next-generation sensors, weapons and avionics, Army officials explained.  Some of these technologies will include a “fly-by-wire” technology allowing for a measure of autonomy or automation so that the helicopter can fly along a particular course by itself in the event that a pilot is injured or incapacitated. This is the kind of technology which could, in the future, allow for unmanned helicopter operations. Along these lines, the Army is looking for technical solutions or mission equipment which increases a pilot's cognitive decision-making capability by effectively managing the flow of information from an array of sensors into the cockpit, Army program managers have explained in previous statements on the Army's website - Army.mil Army JMR TD development documents describe autonomous capability in terms of the need to develop a Human Machine Interface, HMI, wherein advanced cockpit software and computing technologies are able to autonomously perform a greater range of functions such as on-board navigation, sensing and threat detection, thus lessening the burden placed upon pilots and crew, Army experts have explained. In particular, cognitive decision-aiding technologies explored for 4th-generation JMR cockpit will develop algorithms able to track, prioritize organize and deliver incoming on- and off-board sensory information by optimizing visual, 3-D audio and tactile informational cues, prior statements on Army.mil have said.  The idea is to manage the volume of information flowing into the aircraft and explore how to best deliver this information without creating sensory overload. Some of this information may be displayed in the cockpit and some of it may be built into a helmet display, Army officials said. Manned-Unmanned teaming, also discussed by Army developers, constitutes a significant portion of this capability; the state of the art with this capability allows helicopter pilots to not only view video feeds from nearby UAS from the cockpit of the aircraft, but it also gives them an ability to control the UAS flight path and sensor payloads as well. Future iterations of this technology may seek to implement successively greater levels of autonomy, potentially involving scenarios wherein an unmanned helicopter is able to perform these functions working in tandem with nearby UAS.  COUNTERMEASURE SYSTEMS Integration is key to the Army's Mission Systems strategy, as the overall approach is aimed at fielding an integrated suite of sensors and countermeasure technologies designed to work in tandem to identify and in some cases deter a wide range of potential incoming threats, from small arms fire to RPGs, shoulder-fired missiles and other types of attacks, Army statements have said.  One such example of these technologies is called Common Infrared Countermeasure, or CIRCM, a light-weight, high-tech laser-jammer engineered to divert incoming missiles by throwing them off course. CIRCM is a lighter-weight, improved version of the Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures, known as ATIRCM, system currently deployed on aircraft. CIRCM, which will be fielded by 2018, represents the state of the art in countermeasure technology, officials said. Future iterations of this kind of capability envisioned for 2030 may or may not be similar to CIRCM, Army developers have said. Future survivability solutions will be designed to push the envelope toward the next-generation of technology, servcie information explains.  The mission equipment for the new aircraft will be tailored to the new emerging designs, service developers said. Additional countermeasure solutions proposed by industry could include various types of laser technology and Directed Energy applications as well as missile-launch and ground-fire detection systems, Army officials said. SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES The new helicopter program is also working with its industry partners to develop a new technology which might improve upon the state-of-the-art Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor, or MTADS, systems currently deployed on helicopters; MTADS sensing and targeting technology provide helicopters thermal imaging infrared cameras as well stabilized electro-optical sensors, laser rangefinders and laser target designators, according to Army statements.  The current, upgraded MTADS currently deployed on aircraft throughout the Army were engineered to accommodate the size, weight and power dimensions of today's aircraft, dimensions which will likely change with the arrival of a new Air Vehicle built for the new JMR demonstrator aircraft. WEAPONS SYSTEMS JMR Weapons Systems Integration is a critical part of this effort. The JMR aircraft will be engineered to integrate weapons and sensor systems to autonomously detect, designate and track targets, perform targeting operations during high-speed maneuvers, conduct off-axis engagements, track multiple targets simultaneously and optimize fire-control performance such that ballistic weapons can accommodate environmental effects such as wind and temperature, Army documents on the aircraft have stated. AUTOMATIC AVOIDANCE Air-to-Air "tracking" capability is another solution sought by the Army, comprised of advanced software and sensors able to inform pilots of obstacles such as a UAS or nearby aircraft; this technology will likely include Identify Friend or Foe, or IFF, transponders which cue pilots regarding nearby aircraft, Army officials have said. Technical solutions able to provide another important obstacle avoidance "sensing" capability called Controlled Flight Into Terrain, or CFIT, are also being explored; in this instance, sensors, advanced mapping technology and digital flight controls would be engineered to protect an aircraft from nearby terrain such as trees, mountains, telephone wires and other low-visibility items by providing pilots with sufficient warning of an upcoming obstacle and, in some instances, offering them course-correcting flight options.  Using sensors and other technologies to help pilots navigate through "brown-outs" or other conditions involving what's called a "Degraded Visual Environment" is a key area of emphasis as well, according to Army officials.  The Army is looking at a range of solutions such as radar, electro-optical equipment, lasers, sensors, software, avionics and communications equipment to see what the right architecture is and how we would integrate all these things together.  PROGRESS THUS FAR In addition to conducting the first official Army-industry flight of the two demonstrators, the program is working on a Material Development Decision, designed to pave the way for the FVL acquisition program. This effort conducts a thorough examination of all the available technologies and their performance through what is called an “analysis of alternatives.”   A key advantage of a joint FVL program is that it will engender further inter-operability between the services and, for example, allow an Army helicopter to easily be serviced with maintenance at a Marine Corps Forward Operating Base, Bailey explained. Bell and Sikorsky-Boeing teams are both done with their subsystem critical design review and the components are in fabrication and safety flight testing, Bailey explained. “Bell has a completed fuselage that is undergoing the nuances of getting landing gear attached to it and holes for wiring. They are complete with their wing build and they are just starting to make it to the engine itself,” Bailey said. Bell engineers have been mounting  the wing to the fuselage. “It really is starting to look like major components to the aircraft. By May it will likely look like a complete aircraft but it will not have all the subsystems,” he added. The Sikorsky-Boeing – fuselage is complete as well, Bailey said. “The transmission, main rotor and hubs have been forged and cast – they are in the process of preparing for final assembly,” he explained. Both companies we have completed the final design and risk review, which is the government review of their process to say the Army understands the final design and the risks going forward. “The demonstrators help to inform the feasibility both from the technical and affordability aspects of a future program of record,” Bailey said.

The double-aisle Airbus A330 that was deployed, puts the airline in a niche club of Indian carriers that boast of such large aircraft (Jet Airways has Boeing 777s too), enabling them to fly long routes, non-stop. Only in this case, the airline found huge demand in the domestic market itself, compelling it to ply one of its big boys. According to Jet Airways Chief Commercial Officer Jayaraj Shanmugam, “The Indian domestic sector is witnessing breakneck growth in demand. Our fleet mix comprising both wide-body and narrow-body aircraft is our strength, and helps us respond to market conditions and provide enhanced travel options to our guests.” Joining Jet Airways in the wide-body boat is flag carrier Air India, which boasts of wide connectivity to Europe and the US, thanks to its fleet of Boeing 747s, 777s, and 787s. Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani says, “Our profitability mantra is ‘fill more, fly more!’ We are bullish on increasing occupancy and flying to more destinations.” Indeed, India has taken off to a flying start with a burgeoning airline industry. The sector has opened to a big blue sky of opportunities, owing to a series of measures taken by the government, along with the economy itself welcoming several trends that have propelled it further. Amar Abrol, the CEO of young budget carrier AirAsia India, explains that India’s civil aviation industry is on a high-growth trajectory. “India aims to become the third-largest aviation market by 2020, and the largest by 2030. Factors such as low-cost carriers, FDI in domestic airlines, advanced IT interventions and growing emphasis on regional connectivity have given a new lease of life to the growth of the Indian aviation sector,” he opines. Despite such high scope for growth, the airline industry throws many questions that require some deep thought and analysis. It is imperative to understand the uniqueness of this market, as well as introspect its challenges, and find solutions. Fleet-finding mission Firstly, except for Jet Airways and Air India, it is interesting to note that while India’s airline market is huge, mostly narrow-body, single-aisle aircraft supply the demand. Vinod Singel, Founder and Managing Director of aviation consultancy Aerosource India, tells DH that while it is a strategic decision to fly certain aircraft in certain sectors, the idea is to ensure up to 100% load factor at competitive costs. “What you don’t want is flying at 50% load factor. If a Boeing 787 with 250 seats sees 50% load factor, it’s as good as 90% on a smaller 737. The plan is to see all operational costs become less,” he explains. Load factor plays a major role for an airline in ascertaining flights on a particular route, post which, it would determine the right aircraft fit for the journey, after gauging all economies of scale and other required considerations. Basically, with more traffic on a particular route, given the demand, an airline may decide whether it would want one large aircraft carrying more passengers on fewer flights, or several smaller aircraft carrying the same number of passengers between them on more flights. Hence, airlines that have dedicated demand on specific routes opt for one or two types of aircraft as feasible to fulfil it. Recently, Emirates moved to an all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet, in line with its vision to offer superior passenger experience, and improve environmental performance. “When you have one type of aircraft, there is commonality in the crew required to fly it,” Singel says. For instance, if an A330 belonging to a small fleet develops a snag, finding a replacement aircraft or crew easily could be challenging. Flying home With regard to India, experts have exuded immense confidence in the domestic sector opening up in a big way. A number of routes have unlocked themselves on the country’s map, and carriers want to find them. Over the last few years, India has seen a rise in the number of regional carriers that have come into existence. In May 2016, domestic air passenger traffic rose 21.63% to 8.67 million, from 7.13 million during the same month, last year. Passenger traffic during FY2015-16 increased at a rate of 21.3% to 85.57 million, from 70.54 million in the FY2014-15. In March 2016, total aircraft movements at all Indian airports stood at 160,830, which was 14.9% higher than March 2015. India is among the five fastest-growing aviation markets globally, with 275 million new passengers. “The current domestic market itself is so large that homegrown carriers will first want to tap it,” Singel says. And for connecting towns within the country, airlines (especially budget ones) mostly fly single-aisle aircraft. Sharing AirAsia India’s strategy in the country, Abrol says, “Currently, we operate eight A320 aircraft across our domestic network, which offers a range of over four hours flying. So, anything that comes within that radius from cities in India, we will try and connect to. We will focus on strengthening our presence in India, before we scale our operations to fly international.” To further guess the emphasis that carriers have laid on India’s domestic airspace, one must note that market leader IndiGo — which also flies international, and operates one aircraft type — ordered 250 A320neo planes from Airbus, last year. Do you see the runway? While the Indian airline industry is seeing its share of domestic successes, one cannot ignore few important facts. A major issue surrounds connectivity, both in terms of infrastructure and reach. To put it in perspective, the population of India is 1.25 billion, compared with the US’ 300 million. Yet, the former has only around 400-450 airliners between its different carriers, compared with the latter’s whopping 4,000. “Today, only 60 out of the 400 available airports in India have fully-functional infrastructure — 24X7 services, night landing facilities, new terminals, security, and logistics. If new airports open, there’ll be people to fly from them,” Singel adds. Opening new airports wherever feasible will also move some stress away from busier hubs. “The aviation ecosystem in India did not anticipate nor plan for such high growth. Most of the major airports are almost reaching saturation. New Delhi is a good example; capacity constraints in terms of terminals and ramp-side remain a major concern for airlines in India,” explains Abrol. Another area that needs mention is the high fuel costs. “Over a year ago, ATF (Aviation Turbine Fuel) costed Rs 75 a litre. Though, today, it’s moderated to Rs 40, it is still quite highly priced,” informs Singel. He goes on to add that airport costs must also be looked at. “At Airports Authority of India-owned (AAI) airports, rates are as low as 120th of that at private airports. For instance, a government airport will charge over Rs 7 per hour for parking a small (turboprop) plane, against a private airport’s fee of over Rs 250,” he says. However, with a view to grow the sector, the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP 2016) has set forth many new ideas, foremost of all being to push regional flights. Also, progressive steps like the 0/20 rule replacing 5/20, is a great leap forward for more Indian carriers wanting to fly international. So where does India stand in the sky? Experts say that the country has the potential to become a major transit hub for airlines, much like Singapore and Dubai. Also, in the future, one may expect more people on a flight, along with more airports to take off from and land at, and obviously more planes, with Airbus forecasting a need for over 1,600 passenger aircraft in the next 20 years. So will one get to see an Airbus A380 or A350 in India soon? Answer is, ‘Sky’s the limit!’   Go to Top Tweet Videos Demonetisation effect: Church comes to public's rescue,...

Donald Trump’s promises trigger fears of a trade war that would damage Washington’s economy By John Webster johnwe@spokesman.com(509) 459-5421 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Related topics China reportedly pumping brakes on U.S. deal-making after Trump win If President Donald Trump keeps the promises of candidate Donald Trump, he could trigger a trade war with China, dissolve tariff-reduction deals around the Pacific Rim, and inflict a “disastrous” blow to the economy of trade-dependent Washington state. So says Democrat Gary Locke, the Chinese-American trade expert who served eight years as Washington state governor, two years as U.S. secretary of commerce and three years as U.S. ambassador to China. But out in Eastern Washington’s crop-growing country, which voted strongly in favor of Trump, farmers feel optimistic that they can persuade the new president to govern differently than he campaigned. John Stuhlmiller, CEO of the conservative Washington state Farm Bureau, said it is true that China has a history of the retaliation Locke predicts – a retaliation that “would be terrible for our economy, absolutely.” But the need to avoid a trade war is why, Stuhlmiller said, “I would submit there is room for movement from rhetoric to reality.” Stuhlmiller said Trump’s policy advisers already have told the Farm Bureau that Trump will repeal the Obama administration’s Clean Water Act rules concerning runoff – rules that many farmers consider damaging and excessive. The president-elect’s responsiveness to farmers on that issue makes farmers optimistic that Trump will respond favorably to farmers’ concerns regarding foreign trade, Stuhlmiller said. Bigger even than agriculture is Boeing. It sells jets, made in Washington, around the world. In 2015, Washington made and exported $86.3 billion worth of merchandise. More than half – $51 billion – was civilian aircraft. The largest market for Washington state products? China, at $20.7 billion in purchases during 2014. Those purchases include Boeing jets, fresh Wenatchee cherries that fly to China by the planeload, Yakima Valley hops for the brewers of Asian beer, and frozen french fries made in Moses Lake from local potatoes and devoured by the ton at China’s more than 2,200 McDonald’s restaurants. Other buyers of Washington state exports include Canada at $9.3 billion in purchases, Japan at $7.4 billion, and Mexico at $2.7 billion. The manufacture and shipping of these export products account for 1 in 3 of Washington state’s jobs, according to the state Department of Commerce. Those jobs are in Boeing’s factories, Eastern Washington’s family wheat farms, Columbia Valley’s wineries, Central Washington’s orchards and the thriving Port of Moses Lake, where more than 2,500 workers assemble semiconductors for Intel, carbon-fiber body panels for BMW’s electric cars, Genie construction lifts and more. Those jobs, said Locke, are what is at stake – along with the U.S. trade deficit, which gets better when Washington’s exports improve and worse when they decline. What is it, exactly, that candidate Trump said to provoke these Washington state concerns? He promised repeatedly to impose a 45 percent tariff on goods made in China and sold to the United States. He also said he would scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama administration trade pact involving 12 Pacific Rim countries; the deal awaits final approval in Congress, where leaders last week were calling it dead. China is not a party to the TPP, but many other Washington state trading partners are would-be members. He said he would renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he lambasted as a job-killing deal that gutted American manufacturing since its passage in the 1990s. Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, explained in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports would be a “strategic negotiating strategy to stop China … from cheating on international trade deals.” China, Navarro wrote, “has been waging an undeclared trade war on the U.S. since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. The casualties are obvious: More than 50,000 American factories shuttered.” Meanwhile, Navarro wrote, “the unfair trade advantages China reaps from lax environmental and health and safety regulations are written in blood: More than 60,000 Chinese workers perished in workplace accidents in 2014 and up to a half-million people die prematurely because of China’s horrific air pollution.” Robert Hamilton, senior trade policy adviser in the Washington state Department of Commerce, said if Trump imposes an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on Chinese products, it “would be a blatant violation of WTO rules. Does he intend to pull out of the WTO? He hasn’t said so, so it is unclear how he would proceed against China, Washington’s largest export market,” Hamilton said. Further, Hamilton said, “I understand President-elect Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, but he has provided no details about what he would propose. Moreover, Canada and Mexico will be at the table, too, and they will not just give concessions to the United States.” According to former Gov. Locke, if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, “China will reciprocate and put a similar tax on goods from Washington – whether it’s wheat, hops or Boeing airplanes. That will force Chinese buyers to buy from Brazil or Chile or Australia in terms of agricultural products and from Europe in terms of airplanes.” “They don’t have to buy from Boeing,” Locke added. The market for passenger jets is competitive; Airbus eagerly would sell to China if retaliatory Chinese taxes and tariffs made Boeing’s U.S.-made jets uncompetitive in price. If retaliatory trade policies block Washington state companies from selling to China, “it means layoffs” for Washington workers, Locke said. “It could be quite disastrous for jobs in the state of Washington,” he said. In addition, Trump’s threatened tariff on Chinese products would raise the price of the merchandise Americans buy at stores like Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Macy’s, Locke said. “That will be taken out of the pockets of American workers.” Primary provisions of the TPP, Locke said, are agreements to lower tariffs currently imposed by U.S. trading partners, and to bind those countries to improve the treatment of their own workers and cut down on the use of hazardous agricultural chemicals. In return for those agreements, nations in the TPP secure the mutual benefits of freer trade, Locke said. If other countries “can make things without health and human safety standards, it puts American companies at a disadvantage,” Locke said, because U.S. producers do invest in higher standards of health and safety. “That’s what TPP is trying to address, is level the playing field” so U.S. products have a fair shot in the competition for foreign buyers. Regarding the TPP, the Farm Bureau agreed: In its meetings with the new Trump administration, Stuhlmiller said, “Ag is going to be saying ‘Please support it.’ ” Under terms of the TPP, stringent U.S. environmental standards “would be a base for others to have to attain to. Others would have to pay more to produce crops, and that gives us an advantage; our products must become more cost-competitive,” Stuhlmiller said. “Where we excel is we have the world’s safest and best food supply. It goes at a premium,” Stuhlmiller said. This premium quality has contributed to the worldwide success of Washington’s big-money crops such as apples, cherries and wheat, he said. But it takes a level playing field, with lower tariffs and comparable production rules, for trade fully to benefit makers and buyers alike, he said. According to the Farm Bureau, the TPP would increase Washington state’s export income by $246 million per year and add more than 1,350 jobs to the state’s economy. Boeing, like the Farm Bureau, has expressed the hope it can work out concerns with the president-elect. After Trump’s election victory, the company issued this formal statement: “We congratulate president-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that U.S. companies can compete, win and grow our economy to provide good jobs to U.S. workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security.” Will Trump, who campaigned to increase U.S. jobs and reduce the deficit in U.S. trade, respond to the concerns of Washington state export industries? Stuhlmiller predicted he will: During campaign season “rhetoric is rhetoric.” But governing, he said, is a different story. “We hope we will be able to reason our way through these things and find the right policy path forward. Farmers are the eternal optimists. We put everything at risk every year and hope the Lord provides the rain.” Published: Nov. 13, 2016, 6:15 a.m.  Tags: apples, Boeing, cherries, china, Donald Trump, farm bureau, foreign trade, jobs, NAFTA, Washington state economy, wheat Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Victoria Kinney/U.S. Navy  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By Jerry Siebenmark | The Wichita Eagle (Tribune News Service) | Published: November 10, 2016 Spirit AeroSystems sees a chance to expand its business in military aircraft and even space structures, chief executive Tom Gentile told a packed Wichita Aero Club luncheon on Thursday. Gentile, who joined Spirit in April from a long career at GE, said Wichita’s largest employer recognizes that the current, record cycle for commercial airplane orders from Airbus and Boeing will someday slow. And there are a number of other industries within aerospace where Spirit can grow its business. Military aircraft structures is one, he said, including fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and tilt-rotors, and drones. “All of those markets seem to be fairly robust, and potentially with the election … thinking that maybe a Trump presidency might result in more defense spending,” Gentile said. “We will see. But the need for replenishment of military aerospace structures and craft definitely is there and will continue.” Gentile said Spirit estimates that business at $88 billion over the next 10 years for aerostructures alone. Among the types of military aircraft, drones “are a growing part of the industry,” and Spirit, he said, has something to offer since many of those craft are made of composite structures. Missiles, too, could be a new part of growth for the company, “a chance for us to leverage our commercial expertise and translate that into the military market,” he said. “We haven’t been very involved in military in the past, but this represents a very big opportunity for us.” Spirit’s current portfolio of defense work includes manufacturing fuselages, wing parts and engine structures for programs including the Navy’s P-8 Poseidon jet, the Boeing KC-46 air refueling tanker, the Air Force’s new B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber and the Sikorsky CH-53K heavy lift helicopter for the Marines. Gentile also said Spirit is looking at ways to get into building structures for rockets that travel to space. To that end, it is currently bidding for work on some space structures, he said. “Not because it’s a big market today,” he said. “It could be a very big market in the future.” He also said bidding on space work will inform the company about the industry and the skills it will need to have to expand its work in that sector. It’s “going to push us in terms of the scientific envelopes about what’s necessary from a standpoint of weight and heat absorption and other technical aspects to make us better,” Gentile said. ——— ©2016 The Wichita Eagle (Wichita, Kan.)

Resend activation e-mail Ministry of Innovation / Business of Technology China threatens to end iPhone sales if Trump imposes stiff tariffs China warns US president-elect it will nix Boeing orders, car deals, and food imports. by Tom Mendelsohn - Nov 14, 2016 1:13 pm UTC Login to bookmark 637 Gage Skidmore China has threatened to stifle American trade if US president-elect Donald Trump makes good on his campaign promise to impose massive tariffs on the country's imports. One of the most regular pledges that Trump made during the run-up to the election was to impose what he called "defensive" tariffs of 45 percent on Chinese imports and to have Beijing officially declare a currency manipulator, "the greatest in the world." At a rally in Florida in August, the Republican suggested these tariffs would force China to "stop the cheating." In an excoriating op-ed, China's state-run newspaper, Global Times, warned that the People's Republic would adopt "a tit-for-tat approach," and would simply stop buying American goods, including the Apple products that are so popular there. It said: A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve. None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it's most consistent with the overall interests of the US, and it's most acceptable to US society. There were an estimated 131 million iPhones in use in China at the end of 2015, more than any other manufacturer. Data released by the Chinese government suggests that Apple had 16.8 percent of the market, a point higher than Samsung, and 1.2 percent more than China-based Xiaomi. Trump has already spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping in a call to congratulate him on his election. A statement released afterwards said: "During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and president-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward." Shortly after Barack Obama was elected president for the first time, the US instituted a 35 percent import tariff on Chinese tyres, which prompted retaliatory tariffs on chicken and car exports. "Both China and the US suffered losses as a result," the Global Times said. "From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralysed." Ars has asked Apple for comment. The state-backed editorial, which was released after the call between the one-time reality star and China's president, concluded: "If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance, and incompetence." China-based Foxconn—which employs nearly 1.5 million workers—is the main site where Apple's iPhone is produced. Arguably, China could step in and halt or disrupt production if Trump's threatened tariffs kick in. Expand full story Reader comments 637 You must login or create an account to comment.

Now the candidate has become the President-Elect, and all that political posturing seems a bit distant. That, however, hasn't stopped China from making sure that what is said on the campaign trail stays on the campaign trail. Why advertise with us?

A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US." The office of the US President-elect confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that Trump had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a Sunday night phone call in which the two leaders established a "clear sense of mutual respect". Chinese state news broadcaster CCTV elaborated on the call, citing Xi as saying that cooperation was the "sole correct choice" of the two nations, and that such cooperation in the past had yielded benefits for both. On the campaign trail, Trump had slammed US allies, including Japan and South Korea, of basically living under America's protective umbrella without paying for it. When Trump was elected last week, tensions rose in both Asian countries, especially as Chinese saber-rattling is at an all-time high, and North Korea continues to be as volatile as ever. In an interview last week following his election, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that while he had heard from most leaders, he had yet to speak with Xi. Chinese state media said Xi congratulated Trump by telegram shortly after his election. CCTV said both leaders would keep in contact and aim to meet soon.

Boeing said Friday the 29-year company veteran will succeed Jim O’Neill, who will retire in 2017 after more than 30 years with Boeing. “Pat’s experience across commercial and defense programs will help us grow a stable of strong development programs on the foundation that Jim put in place,” said Leanne Caret, who was appointed president and CEO of Boeing’s defense, space and security segment in February. Goggin, who previously served as VP of Boeing’s Development Program Excellence initiative, will take on his new role in December as part of the transition period. The BDS development segment is responsible for the pre-production stages of space and defense programs. Goggin’s appointment comes nearly two months after Boeing promoted Jim Chilton to president of the aerospace company’s network and space systems business that generates nearly $7.8 billion in annual revenue.

"China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US," said the editorial in the state controlled Global Times if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Throwing light on the incidents in the Barack Obama administration, the editorial read: "Not long after Barack Obama took office, US trade and commerce authorities announced a 35 percent import tariff on Chinese tires. In response, China took retaliatory steps of imposing tariffs on US chicken and automotive products. Both China and the US suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China." The editorial said that Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naive. "None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it's most consistent with the overall interests of the US, and it's most acceptable to US society." Trump cannot change the pattern of interests between China and the US. "The gigantic China-US trade is based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation. Even as president, Trump can exert limited influence on it," it said. The article warned that if Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired which will lead to condemnation for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. To impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. Other than that, a US president can only demand a tariff increase on individual commodities, it said. During the bitter race for the White House Trump repeatedly lashed out at China, vowing to punish Beijing with 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and to officially declare it a currency manipulator. "When they see that they will stop the cheating," the billionaire Republican, who has accused Beijing of "the greatest theft in the history of the world", told a rally in August. Meanwhile, in an interview on Friday, when questioned as to whether Trump will formally declare China a currency manipulator, Judy Shelton, one of Trump's economic advisers, said "he is someone going to carry through on what he says."  SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

They immediately switched off some non-essential electrical equipment in the cockpit and then managed to make a safe precautionary landing at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. "The pilots first saw some smoke in the cockpit and then there was a strong burning smell. They checked with the crew if the same was being reported by passengers. However, the problem seemed limited to the cockpit," said a source. The crew then declared an emergency and proceeded to Delhi. En route, they followed the check list and switched off some non-essential electrical items. "Following this, the smoke and smell did not increase. The plane made a safe landing in Delhi. Passengers alighted at the terminal and then the plane was towed to a remote bay," said the source. AI engineering then inspected the plane and immediately got in touch with Boeing. Preliminary check, said sources, suggested that the cabin air compressor(CAC), which pumps air inside the aircraft, of the cockpit may have failed. "We informed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation who asked AI to carry out the repairs on Monday as they want to oversee what will be done," said a source. AI has in recent days witnessed a number of CAC failures in its Dreamliners. However, Sunday's was the first instance of smoke and smell being caused due to that. "We are expecting to hear from Boeing on this issue and see how this can be resolved," said a source. In fact, AI's troubles with the Dreamliners have erupted after two to three years of relative quiet. The airline saw about five instances of windshield cracks of the B-787 in past few months. The airline has sought compensation from the US aircraft major for the windshield problem. AI started getting the Dreamliners four years ago and has now got 22 of the 27 B-787s it ordered. "The first batch of this plane AI got had some technical issues. Then Boeing upgraded all our first few deliveries and the subsequent ones were delivered after making the required changes. Last two years were okay but now we are again witnessing a rise in issues regarding B-787. While the aircraft is perfectly safe, snags grounding the aircraft time and again means a huge loss to AI," said a senior official.

Another thundered overhead, moments later, so low the local children could almost reach up and touch the wheels. Then another. In the village high street, nobody covered their ears. The earth didn’t shake from the battering of the four gigantic propellors on each plane. In fact, the blades of grass in the meadows didn’t even tremble. These weren’t actual World War II bombers, but computer-generated images, projected on to the scene like a digital slideshow. And they looked about as real as the trampolining foxes in the John Lewis ad. That proved to be the failure of this entire drama, a boyhood memoir set in 1943. None of it was quite believable. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Lily Donaldson shows off her cleavage and legs in a daring... 'I eat pasta a lot!' Amy Schumer posts selfies showing her... Share this article Share The situation was historically accurate: American airmen arrived at a base near the north-south border, and stirred tensions with the villagers — many of them IRA sympathisers who regarded the British, not the Germans, as their enemy. But the story was as computer-generated as the aircraft. Hattie Morahan played Rose, who ran the local stores, while her husband Michael (Owen McDonnell) took care of the pub. ITV's The Next Great Magician was as if a giant trick had been played on the viewer Rose was English, an outsider, so naturally the Republicans, with their cloth caps, scrawny scarves and glowers, would gather around her shop counter to buy tobacco in a threatening manner. Even Michael treated her as if she didn’t belong. Rose felt lonely — and being lonely, went for windswept coastal walks. Where, inevitably, she met a handsome American airforce captain with sad eyes. Aaron Staton, best known for playing the ad exec with an eyepatch in Mad Men, was the captain. He made a dutiful appearance on BBC Breakfast last Friday, when every question seemed to surprise him. WEEKEND'S BAD TIMING:  Dan Snow trekked to the northernmost peaks of the Rockies at the climax of Operation Gold Rush (BBC2).  Trouble was, there were better mountains over on BBC1’s Planet Earth II – with snow leopards and grizzly bears.  Sorry Dan, you peaked on the wrong day.  I thought that was just the actor’s ‘Aw shucks’ persona, but he’s exactly like that in the drama, too, so perhaps he was in character. While Aaron was being flummoxed by the Irish accents and everything else, the other airmen were wasting no time. They drank the pub dry, they taunted the menfolk over Eire’s neutrality, and fulfilled every Yanks-go-home cliche short of handing out nylons. Rose’s 16-year-old daughter was swept off her innocent feet, of course, to her parents’ disapproval. ‘She is far too young to even consider a serious relationship,’ declared Rose, lapsing into the jargon of 21st-century therapists. Meanwhile, her adolescent son watched it all, silently and quite creepily, as boys planning to write their memoirs do. If you ever find an unspeaking 12-year-old gazing intently at you, beware — he’s storing you up to be a character in a second-rate costume drama. Silent, intense schoolboys often grow up to become conjurors, and there were half a dozen of them on The Next Great Magician (ITV) — plus one ex-schoolgirl. Katherine Mills was easily the best of the acts, with a comic routine where she took an unsuspecting member of the public on a date that turned into an on-the-spot wedding. But the act crowned winners was a couple of Scottish stand-up comedians whose ‘magic’ consisted of vomiting up liquids. It was not just unpleasant, it was unimpressive. Why they were chosen was not explained. There were no judges, and no public vote: the magicians picked a winner among themselves, in a backroom. Since they were discussing the secrets of magic, we were not privileged to eavesdrop. That left the whole show feeling like a trick had been played on viewers. And probably it had, since the overall winner will be granted an hour-long TV special — ITV bosses are hardly likely to leave that to the whim of a bunch of illusionists. There were celebrities in the audience to add some pizzazz, though more care should have been taken to book people who actually like watching magic. Jim Carter, of Downton Abbey, stared at a series of card tricks, rumbling: ‘This is very annoying.’ Carson the butler wouldn’t have stood for such foolery either.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Modifications to the attack helicopters now allow for the firing of the Rafael Spike anti-tank guided missile. The program began in 2014 following the halting by Washington of a shipment of Hellfire missiles to Israel during Operation Protective Edge. The offensive, which saw IDF forces conduct several weeks of operations in the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas rocket fire, has drawn international criticism on both sides. Keep reading for the whole story with recent events put in context Israeli AH-64D (click to view full) Israel’s attack helicopter fleet still flies AH-1 Cobras, but larger and more heavily armored AH-64 Apache helicopters began arriving in 1990, and have distinguished themselves in a number of war since. The country received 44 AH-64A helicopters from 1990 – 1993. Additional buys, conversions, and losses placed the fleet at 45 helicopters as of Flight Global’s World Air Forces 2013 report, split between AH-64As and more modern AH-64D Longbows. The AH-64D Longbow’s sophisticated mast-mounted radar can quickly pick up tanks and other dangerous targets, but isn’t designed to distinguish civilians from combatants, or to hover close over the deck in highly populated areas. Confronted by asymmetrical urban warfare and budget priority issues, and faced with a lack of cooperation from the Obama administration, the IAF decided in 2010 to forego AH-64D upgrades for their remaining helicopters. On the other hand, the type’s consistent usefulness has led Israeli to make extensive improvements of their own, to the point where Israel has effectively created their own improved AH-64A configuration… Advertisement Contracts & Key Events Israeli AH-64s November 14/16: AH-64 Apaches operated by Israel now have an anti-tank capability. Modifications to the attack helicopters now allow for the firing of the Rafael Spike anti-tank guided missile. The program began in 2014 following the halting by Washington of a shipment of Hellfire missiles to Israel during Operation Protective Edge. The offensive, which saw IDF forces conduct several weeks of operations in the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas rocket fire, has drawn international criticism on both sides. March 14/14: AH-64Ai. Israel has reportedly upgraded its AH-64As to its own improved configuration, which approaches the American AH-64D standard in sophistication but isn’t the same. Improvements reportedly include Israeli electronic warfare and self-protection systems, improved avionics, compatibility with modern Israeli battle management & communications systems, and “several new” Israeli missiles. Carriage of RAFAEL’s Spike-LR missiles as alternatives to AGM-114 Hellfires would be expected, along with Elbit Systems’ GATR-L laser-guided 70mm rockets. There are also reports that South Korea will be integrating the long-range Spike NLOS and its 25+ km reach onto its new AW159 Wildcat naval helicopters, and that kind of missile would be an equally excellent complement to Israeli AH-64s. All sources would say was: “They are based on the huge operational experience of the force in using the Apache Longbow in a variety of combat scenarios,” an officer, identified only as Maj. Yonatan…. The upgrade has been developed amid the U.S. refusal to modernize Israel’s Apache fleet, employed in attacks on the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. The sources said the administration of President Barack Obama blocked Israeli efforts to modernize the Apaches or purchase new helicopters from Boeing.” Sources: World Tribune, “Israel upgrades Apache helicopters after U.S. blocked their modernization”. Oct 8/13: AH-64A+. The commander of the IAF’s “Unit 22” says that Israel’s AH-64As are undergoing comprehensive upgrades in Israel. This includes replacing original wiring and some main computers, and a new unit-designed compartment beneath the fuselage that houses additional electronics. Israel still flies a number of AH-64A models, after deciding not to upgrade the entire fleet to the AH-64D standard. Flight Global’s Ascend databases places the number at 26 / 48 helicopters, but it may not fully account for casualties. Sources: FlightGlobal, “Israeli Apache upgrade adds avionics pod”. Dec 31/10: Weapons. Israel is reportedly looking to equip its AH-64 helicopters with guided 70mm rockets, and is reportedly considering whether tho use the American Hydra or Canadian CRV-7 as its base. That’s an odd contention, because Israel’s Elbit Systems Ltd. partnered with America’s ATK on July 9/08 to create a 70mm GATR-L laser-guided rocket. It’s based on the Hydra, and reportedly had successful Israeli flight trials in June 2009. Sources: Jerusalem Post, “Rapid-fire rocket system aims to reduce civilian casualties”. IAF AH-64 (click to view full) June 30/10. Israel abandons plans to upgrade its entire AH-64 fleet to the AH-64D Longbow configuration, and will choose to improve the helicopters’ weapon options instead. They’ll also continue operating their CH-53D helicopters until the CH-53K is available to replace them. Sources: Flight Global, “Israel ditches Apache upgrade plan, commits to CH-53K”. No more AH-64D upgrades Aug 4/09: After analyzing their AH-64D fleet’s participation during Operation “Cast Lead” against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the IAF has decided to upgrade all of its AH-64As to the AH-64D configuration. That’s fine with Boeing, who has been urging customer to upgrade to AH-64D Block II standard before the US military stops supporting the AH-64A. Sources: Flight Global, “Israel, Boeing negotiate Apache Longbow upgrade”. May 27/09: US blocks AH-64s. The Obama administration blocks Israel’s request for 6 more AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopters, using the old “interagency review” gambit. Israel had lost 2 AH-64s during the 2006 war with Hizbullah. Sources: World Tribune, “Administration blocks helicopters for Israel due to civilian casualties in Gaza”. US blockage April 12/05: The left-wing Ha’aretz publishes an article debating whether or not new rotor aircraft platforms such as the AH-64 Apache Longbow – of which Israeli just bought 18 – are worth the cost. Their immediate security threats are widely considered to be terrorism-related these days, rather than the historic threat of Syrian tank columns. Given their cost, are the really necessary? The report says that the Israeli debate mirrors the U.S. debate that led to the shelving of Boeing and Sikorsky’s RAH-66 Comanche program. A cost of $600 million recently bought Israel the 18 Longbows, plus 9 new Apaches and newly-scheduled upgrades for previously purchased Apaches. Israeli Longbow purchase opponents – many who would like to see the money put into land forces and ground security purchases – point to the expensive mission in Karbala, Iraq during the campaign that overthrew Saddam Hussein, where small arms managed to seriously hurt 28 of 30 Apaches as they hovered to acquire targets. Among aviators, much of the Karbala damage has been blamed on intelligence that failed to alert pilots that the terrain south of Baghdad was so heavily populated. Apache and Longbow supporters have also used the Karbala incident to boost their case, pointing out just how much lead the craft were able to absorb while still remaining in the air. Sources: Ha’aretz, “The Longbow – yes and no”. Additional Readings IAF – Boeing AH-64 Apache (Hebrew nickname: ‘Peten’ (‘Adder’), ‘Saraph’). AH-64As are Adders. AH-64Ds are Saraphs.

Charles Slate cslate@thesunnews.com i Janice Key Guest Columnist LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Columbia, SC Study after study shows a clear link between the health of our kids and their educational success. That’s not just because kids who are obese are more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions such as asthma or diabetes, which can keep them home during the school year. Obesity also has an impact on a child’s self-esteem. And whether they are overweight or not, kids who are active and eat healthy meals are better students. __________ How one Columbia school changed itself to fight off childhood obesity Why our kids are out of shape and African kids are the fittest __________ So when the Center for Disease Control and Prevention released its National Survey of Children’s Health in 2011 showing that South Carolina had the second highest rate of childhood obesity in the nation, it was clear that we had a lot of work to do as a state. Today, thanks to the Medical University of South Carolina’s Boeing Center for Children’s Wellness and schools across South Carolina, we are tackling this problem. Working together, we have created a school wellness checklist to help schools institute evidence-based strategies and policy recommendations on everything from increasing the amount of physical activity students get each day to helping school lunch programs create more nutritious menus. During the past school year alone, 243 schools serving more than S.C. 160,000 students participated in this effort. During the past school year alone, 243 schools serving more than 160,000 students participated in this effort. One hundred ten of those schools have planted school gardens as part of the farm-to-school initiative. This program incorporates hands-on learning with cooking classes and school gardening activities. Student participants not only learn about healthy living, but also have higher math and science test scores than their peers. This year, we are working to expand this program to serve even more students. The programs that started in Charleston now serve 15 school districts in South Carolina as well as 25 schools in Pottstown, Pa. Our program recently achieved national recognition by receiving the 2016 Wellness Frontiers Award from the Healthcare Leadership Council. None of this could have happened without Boeing’s support. And it is just one of the many partnerships the company has created to help build a better South Carolina. One that helps improve our kids’ health and allows the Palmetto State’s youth to achieve their potential. When Bill Boeing started the company in 1916, he recognized that investing in the community would pay dividends in the long-term and was the right thing to do. When Bill Boeing started the company in 1916, he recognized that investing in the community would pay dividends in the long-term and was the right thing to do. That’s why he paid for the University of Washington to build a wind tunnel to test airplanes and helped the school create a new program focused on the science of aeronautics. And it’s why Boeing helped establish the Center for Children’s Wellness at MUSC. Since 2010, Boeing has donated $4 million to help the center promote health and wellness in schools across South Carolina, with the goal of reducing childhood obesity. That’s not going to show up in anyone’s quarterly earnings report. But over the long haul, it will help ensure our state has a strong, educated workforce. And that creates new opportunities for S.C. businesses including Boeing to grow and thrive — just what the company will need as it kicks off its second 100 years of innovation.

That's China's state-run newspaper, threatening to hit - among others - Apple where it hurts. I don't think American companies are going to, uh, just allow Trump and his administration to carry out this promise he made to voters - one of his core promises, I might add.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Aerospace execs gear up to pitch their planes as Liberals expected to hold competition for CF-18 replacement David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen  11.14.2016 An F-35A fighter aircraft sits on the tarmac ahead of the Abbotsford International Airshow, in Abbotsford, B.C., on Aug. 11, 2016. A U.S. Navy F/A 18 Super Hornet performs at the Canadian International Air Show at the CNE in Toronto, Sept. 4, 2016. ShareAdjustCommentPrint Canadian firms have now won $1 billion worth of work on the F-35 fighter jet, a selling point that aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin hopes to use as it prepares for an expected competition to replace the CF-18 fleet. Cabinet officials met recently to discuss the way forward on a CF-18 fighter replacement and industry sources say they now expect the Liberal government to eventually proceed to a competition to buy new aircraft. Aerospace firms are shifting into high gear for that event, although the timing of an announcement is unknown. Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin’s CEO, will be in Ottawa Tuesday for a major aerospace conference and various meetings, while Pratt and Whitney officials will be highlighting details about the F-35 engine the firm builds. Shelley Lavender, the president of Boeing Military Aircraft, will be in Ottawa on Thursday for the same conference. Lavender was program manager for Boeing’s Super Hornet aircraft, one of the F-35’s rivals in any Canadian competition. Jordan Owens, spokeswoman for Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, said Monday that work is still underway on determining how to replace the CF-18. Sajjan has said the procurement strategy would be decided in months, not years, as the CF-18s need to be replaced quickly. The minister has noted he prefers an open competition. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power pledging the Liberals would hold a competition for a new fighter jet but, at the same time, said it would not buy the F-35. Trudeau has yet to explain that contradiction. Lockheed Martin said Monday that while in Canada, Hewson will meet with company employees and “numerous Canadian stakeholders to Lockheed Martin.” Jack Crisler, one of Lockheed Martin’s senior F-35 officials, told Postmedia in August that it looked like the F-35 would be included in any competition. The stealth fighter became a political nightmare for the Conservative government after it pledged to buy 65 of the planes. The F-35 was plagued with technology problems. U.S. lawmakers were complaining about its cost. Last year Donald Trump, then one of a number of Republican presidential candidates, complained about the cost of the F-35 and the technology issues affecting the aircraft. “I do hear that it’s not very good,” he said during an October 2015 radio interview. “I’m hearing that our existing planes are better.” But Trump, now president-elect, has not indicated what, if anything, he will do about the F-35 program. However, stock market analysts are seeing positive news for defence company stocks, including Lockheed Martin, because of Trump’s election, as he has promised to revamp the U.S. military. Lockheed Martin officials are keen for a competition since they believe their aircraft can readily beat other planes. The F-35 won in competitions in Denmark, Japan and South Korea, they add. In June, Lockheed Martin almost saw its hopes of selling planes to Canada disappear completely. The government was close to moving on an interim purchase of Super Hornet jets from Boeing and Trudeau claimed the F-35 “does not work and is far from working.” That prompted Lockheed Martin to warn that Canadian companies who had contracts on the F-35 would suffer. After that, plans for a Super Hornet interim deal seemed to disappear. The F-35 has been declared ready for combat by the U.S. Air Force although critics have pointed out that much work still needs to be done on the aircraft. Two F-35s visited Canada for the first time at the August airshow in Abbotsford, B.C. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

These extreme claims gathered support by those who were tired of the status quo and desired change. One of Trump’s claims was of a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods being imported into the US. The tax on Chinese goods can also negatively affect the sales of US goods as well as Apple iPhones. According to the Global Times (Chinese newspaper), “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback,” and as a response the Chinese government will take a “tit-for-tat approach” to combat the change in the trade between the two countries. So if we do happen to raise the taxes on imported goods from China to 45% then only time will tell how China will respond to the change. Luckily, the laws in the US limit tariffs to 15% on all imports and will last for up to 150 days if put forth by the President. Therefore, the chances of Donald Trump imposing the 45% tax on all of China’s imported goods is unlikely. In 2009 there was a tax tariff on imported tires from China of 35% and as a response China raised taxes on goods coming in from the US. According to the Global Times the trade between the US and China will be paralyzed as a result of the tax tariffs. This would further hurt our relations with the second largest economy in the world (China housing an $11.3 trillion economy) and in effect be detrimental to both economies. So far with President-elect Donald Trump proposing different plans in relation to his claims while on the campaign trail, we can’t be certain whether or not he was serious about imposing the 45% tax tariff on imported goods from China. Regardless, it would be good to keep in mind the results in proceeding either way. arterius2 ROFL. As a Chinese I almost wanted Trump to do it. DO IT TRUMP! For me though?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple will ‘suffer’ if Trump starts trade war, Chinese government-backed media warns By Michelle Quinn / November 14, 2016 at 11:47 AM Will the iPhone and other devices manufactured in China be harmed by a Trump presidency? Possibly, warns an editorial from the Global Times, a Chinese state-run publication, if a Trump presidency follows through on its campaign promises when it comes to the Communist nation. As the GOP presidential candidate, Trump campaigned on getting tough on what he called “cheating China” when it comes to trade. He said he would impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. If that happens, a trade war would be certain. The editorial predicted: China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve. None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it’s most consistent with the overall interests of the US, and it’s most acceptable to US society. Trump cannot change the pattern of interests between China and the US. The gigantic China-US trade is based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation. Even as president, Trump can exert limited influence on it. If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. But since his election win, President-elect Trump has dialed down some of the rhetoric around foreign engagement, something the editorial noted. “Trump is not obstinate with regard to ties with China,” the editorial said. “Making things difficult for China politically will do him no good.” China’s president, Xi Jinping, spoke to Trump recently, congratulating him on his election victory. According to The Guardian, China experts say that Beijing is rattled by what a Trump presidency means but have learned that while candidates may campaign on an anti-China message, the tune changes once they are in office. While saber-rattling, the editorial may not represent the Chinese government’s positions, suggests Engadget: If China really wanted to drop some not-so subtle warnings about international relations, it’d use Global Times’ parent the People’s Daily, or Xinhua News. This byline-free editorial is more of a rebuke to the accusation that China is a currency manipulator. The stuff about blocking the iPhone and Boeing seem to be baseless conjecture than anything else. Photo: An Apple store in central Beijing, China.  (Alexander F.

By Michael Havis / Published 14th November 2016 GETTY FACE OFF: Donald Trump's tough talk has fallen foul of China The President elect previously pledged a 45% tariff to force up the cost of Chinese imports to the US. But now Beijing has issued a stinging rebuke, warning the billionaire businessman that if he wants a trade war, he’ll get one. An editorial in the regime-run Global Times newspaper warned that China would hit the US hard if Trump enacted new tariffs. GETTY READY FOR EXPORT: Chinese goods ready to be sent overseas from Lianyungang, China “The new president will be condemned... and bear all the consequences” Chinese government newspaper "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback," it said. "US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US". The newspaper, quoted by CNBC, added that in 2009 Beijing had proved its willingness to respond to Barack Obama. It highlighted how a 35% tariff on Chinese tyres had been met with tariffs on US car parts and chicken. Melania Trump: Former model and First Lady-elect Wednesday, 9th November 2016 Former model Melania Trump is married to American businessman and designated 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump. 1 / 13 It said Trump was a "shrewd" operator and was unlikely to start a trade war, but that doing so would mean punishment for the US. "The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences," it said. "We’re very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by American media to trip up the new president." Trump has previously proposed the tariffs saying "the only power that we have with China is massive trade." Quotes by CBS News, he said: "I would tax China on products coming in. I would do a tariff, yes – and they do it to us." He has also proposed a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico, in response to the suggestion Ford would move manufacturing south of the border.

Apple said in a lawsuit filed Monday, Oct. 17, 2016, that it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them are counterfeit. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) 1 41 Follow Share Tweet The election of Donald Trump to the presidency has already had a major impact on United States trade policy, as President Obama announced over the weekend that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal — which was slated to be his signature second-term accomplishment — is all but dead, politically. President-elect Trump made criticism of trade deals a central plank of his campaign, and he repeatedly singled out the nations of China and Mexico as unfair trade partners while on the trail. In a controversial interview with the New York Times editorial board, Trump suggested that he would impose high tariffs on China, throwing out a rate of 45 percent as a hypothetical starting point for negotiations on a new trade deal. Many news media outlets reporting on the interview claimed that Trump supported a firm 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, a claim that Trump immediately denied on the campaign trail. The Chinese government has not waited for Trump’s inauguration to begin its public relations battle with the incoming Trump administration. According to CNBC, a Chinese state-run newspaper has published threats of retaliation if a Trump administration attempts to impose any punitive measures such as tariffs: A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S. Boeing’s corporate headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois, and they employ thousands of Americans at manufacturing and service facilities across the United States. Airbus is headquartered in France and has manufacturing facilities in France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. China is a major importer of food products from the United States; however, in recent years, China has gained ground as an exporter of certain food products as well. U.S. trade policy with respect to China has been a contentious political issue for decades, since the Chinese were granted “most favored nation” status in 1979. China’s record on human rights abuses have made this status a contentious one politically, especially since the Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 angered the American public. The American business community has successfully lobbied the United States government to keep trade negotiations with China separate from human rights negotiations, because China is a major importer of U.S. goods. Former President Bill Clinton acceded to these lobbying efforts when he reversed a campaign pledge in 1994 and again granted China most favored nation status. The term “most favored nation” status was revised to “permanent normal trade relations” in 1998, and this status was granted to China in 2001. In recent years, the focus of controversy regarding United States trade with China has moved from China’s alleged human rights abuses to China’s alleged unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation and flaunting of international intellectual property law. Trump made these practices a central focus of his campaign, leading to speculation that he might start a trade war with China after his inauguration.

If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralyzed. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback […] The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. Global Times also believes that Trump will not have the authority needed to apply a 45% tariff. To impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. Other than that, a US president can only demand a tariff increase on individual commodities. In addition, The Guardian is reporting that it’s not just the Chinese who are hoping that the trade war threat was just a joke. Paul Haenle, a veteran US diplomat who is director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua centre at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, warned the introduction of protectionist measures would immediately “inject friction” into already fraught US-China ties as well as harming America’s own economy. “If he follows through on a 45% trade tariff then I think it will be damaging to our own interests and we will have fallout that will affect our own companies and our own economy and it won’t be effective. It will not achieve what he is setting out to achieve. So from that standpoint he is going to have to moderate some of that rhetoric as he puts together actual concrete policies.” Tags: Apple, China, Donald Trump, trade war About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Teamster UPS Aircraft Mechanics Vote To Strike The airline maintenance workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike after three years of negotiations during which UPS has continued to demand huge health care concessions. In total, 80 percent, 950 of the company’s 1,200 maintenance employees, participated in the strike vote, and 98 percent of those workers voted in favor of a strike. The workers voted in October and November by mail-in ballot. The strike vote comes after UPS announced earlier this month that it beat third quarter earnings expectations with revenue of more than $14.9 billion. UPS will ship some 700 million packages during the holiday shopping season, the peak period for UPS, and an increase of more than 16 percent over last year. The company also announced plans to purchase 14 jumbo aircraft from Boeing Co. between 2017 and 2020—the first such order by UPS since 2008. The 14 Boeing 747-8s cost a total of $5.3 billion before discounts that may have been negotiated. “We’re glad that UPS can afford to invest in beefing up its international fleet,” said Jim Kelley, a 29-year aircraft mechanic at UPS’s Louisville, Ky. gateway. “But if UPS can afford major capital investments and huge raises for top brass, then UPS can also choose to invest in the maintenance workers who do strenuous and dangerous work every day to make its success possible. No one wants to go on strike, but I voted to strike because UPS mechanics and our families deserve better from UPS.” UPS posted $4.84 billion in profits last year and is the world’s largest delivery company. The company’s stock was upgraded by many analysts following the strong third quarter and seven consecutive quarters of double-digit international profits. In September, UPS announced additional stock incentives and 10 percent raises for its top executives: Chairman and CEO David P. Abney, Senior Vice President and CFO Richard N. Peretz, CCO Alan Gershenhorn and President of U.S. Operations Myron A. Gray. Despite record profits, UPS is calling for massive reductions in health benefits for 1,200 maintenance workers who are critical to the company’s supply chain. UPS aircraft mechanics and other maintenance workers do physically demanding and often dangerous work around jet engine aircrafts and equipment and toxic chemicals and exhaust. UPS is also calling for a devastating reduction in benefits for retirees who spent their lives servicing the company’s planes. Under UPS’s proposal, health coverage for a retiree and his or her spouse would skyrocket to more than $19,000 per year in the first year with further increases each year thereafter. “We work hard to make sure UPS planes are operational, on time, and above all safe. It’s a responsibility we take seriously and don’t expect much in return,” said Juan Flores, a 15-year aircraft mechanic at UPS’s Dallas gateway, who voted to authorize a strike. “All we’re asking is to keep the health care we count on so we can stay healthy and keep UPS’s planes running for millions of customers around the globe. Voting to strike isn’t an easy decision, but I had to stand up for good, middle class jobs and the health of my family.” A UPS aircraft mechanics strike would halt UPS’s global shipping operation. Last month, dozens of UPS mechanics picketed outside a major Amazon distribution center in Jeffersonville, Indiana to show executives at UPS and Amazon—a major UPS customer—that workers were united and committed to protecting their health and jobs. Protests and informational pickets will continue throughout the holiday season at locations across the country. UPS pilots have expressed their support for the mechanics and other maintenance workers in their effort to settle a fair contract. In a recent letter to the mechanics, Independent Pilot Association President Robert Travis wrote, “Please be assured that you have the full support of the 2,600 professional airline pilots who fly worldwide for UPS.” “Dedicated aircraft maintenance workers are simply asking to keep the benefits they already have so they can keep UPS planes running effectively,” said Tim Boyle, President of Teamsters Local 2727, the workers’ union. “No one wants to strike, but members voted overwhelming to authorize a strike because UPS is refusing to work with us. We’ll do whatever it takes to protect good, middle class jobs, our health and our families.” Many UPS gateways operate with just one aircraft mechanic per shift, meaning he or she works alone around massive aircraft parts and equipment, sometimes for up to 39 hours straight. Lifting injuries and accidents are common. Repetitive stress injuries, hearing loss, inhaling toxic exhaust, and jet engine blasts are among other health risks UPS aircraft maintenance workers face. In 2008, OSHA cited UPS for violations that led to, among other injuries, a worker breaking his neck when a truck he was parked in was blown over by the jet blast of a Boeing 747 aircraft. Recent OSHA complaints assert these and other dangerous conditions persist.

Teamsters Local 2727 Nov 14, 2016, 11:19 ET Share this article LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Airline maintenance technicians and related classifications who maintain UPS's (NYSE: UPS) fleet of jet engine aircrafts announced Monday that they have authorized a strike at the shipping giant. The airline maintenance workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike after three years of negotiations during which UPS has continued to demand huge health care concessions. In total, 80 percent, 950 of the company's 1,200 maintenance employees, participated in the strike vote, and 98 percent of those workers voted in favor of a strike. The workers voted in October and November by mail-in ballot. The strike vote comes after UPS announced earlier this month that it beat third quarter earnings expectations with revenue of more than $14.9 billion. UPS will ship some 700 million packages during the holiday shopping season, the peak period for UPS, and an increase of more than 16 percent over last year. The company also announced plans to purchase 14 jumbo aircraft from Boeing Co. between 2017 and 2020—the first such order by UPS since 2008. The 14 Boeing 747-8s cost a total of $5.3 billion before discounts that may have been negotiated. "We're glad that UPS can afford to invest in beefing up its international fleet," said Jim Kelley, a 29-year aircraft mechanic at UPS's Louisville, Ky. gateway. "But if UPS can afford major capital investments and huge raises for top brass, then UPS can also choose to invest in the maintenance workers who do strenuous and dangerous work every day to make its success possible. No one wants to go on strike, but I voted to strike because UPS mechanics and our families deserve better from UPS." UPS posted $4.84 billion in profits last year and is the world's largest delivery company. The company's stock was upgraded by many analysts following the strong third quarter and seven consecutive quarters of double-digit international profits. In September, UPS announced additional stock incentives and 10 percent raises for its top executives: Chairman and CEO David P. Abney, Senior Vice President and CFO Richard N. Peretz, CCO Alan Gershenhorn and President of U.S. Operations Myron A. Gray. Despite record profits, UPS is calling for massive reductions in health benefits for 1,200 maintenance workers who are critical to the company's supply chain. UPS aircraft mechanics and other maintenance workers do physically demanding and often dangerous work around jet engine aircrafts and equipment and toxic chemicals and exhaust. UPS is also calling for a devastating reduction in benefits for retirees who spent their lives servicing the company's planes. Under UPS's proposal, health coverage for a retiree and his or her spouse would skyrocket to more than $19,000 per year in the first year with further increases each year thereafter. "We work hard to make sure UPS planes are operational, on time, and above all safe. It's a responsibility we take seriously and don't expect much in return," said Juan Flores, a 15-year aircraft mechanic at UPS's Dallas gateway, who voted to authorize a strike. "All we're asking is to keep the health care we count on so we can stay healthy and keep UPS's planes running for millions of customers around the globe. Voting to strike isn't an easy decision, but I had to stand up for good, middle class jobs and the health of my family." A UPS aircraft mechanics strike would halt UPS's global shipping operation. Last month, dozens of UPS mechanics picketed outside a major Amazon distribution center in Jeffersonville, Indiana to show executives at UPS and Amazon—a major UPS customer—that workers were united and committed to protecting their health and jobs. Protests and informational pickets will continue throughout the holiday season at locations across the country. UPS pilots have expressed their support for the mechanics and other maintenance workers in their effort to settle a fair contract. In a recent letter to the mechanics, Independent Pilot Association President Robert Travis wrote, "Please be assured that you have the full support of the 2,600 professional airline pilots who fly worldwide for UPS." "Dedicated aircraft maintenance workers are simply asking to keep the benefits they already have so they can keep UPS planes running effectively," said Tim Boyle, President of Teamsters Local 2727, the workers' union. "No one wants to strike, but members voted overwhelming to authorize a strike because UPS is refusing to work with us. We'll do whatever it takes to protect good, middle class jobs, our health and our families." Many UPS gateways operate with just one aircraft mechanic per shift, meaning he or she works alone around massive aircraft parts and equipment, sometimes for up to 39 hours straight. Lifting injuries and accidents are common. Repetitive stress injuries, hearing loss, inhaling toxic exhaust, and jet engine blasts are among other health risks UPS aircraft maintenance workers face. In 2008, OSHA cited UPS for violations that led to, among other injuries, a worker breaking his neck when a truck he was parked in was blown over by the jet blast of a Boeing 747 aircraft. Recent OSHA complaints assert these and other dangerous conditions persist.

The airline said it plans to introduce 10-abreast seating on 25 777s, increasing the economy-class cabin from 216 to 252 seats. It will trim the business-class cabin from 40 to 32 seats but double the premium-economy cabin to 48 seats. The company said the new 777 configuration, increasing its accommodation from 280 to 332 seats, will be introduced in early 2018, and will provide more economical unit seat costs compared with those on Norwegian´s Boeing 787s, which the Scandinavian carrier uses at Gatwick. British Airways is the flag carrier of the United Kingdom and is based in Waterside near its main hub at London Heathrow Airport.

Today, the country’s state-run Global Times warned such a move would result in repercussions that will affect the sale of iPhones and US cars in China. The Times says (via The Guardian) that the president-elect would be “naïve” to follow through on his election promises of introducing the tariff and officially declaring China a currency manipulator. "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then," the newspaper said in an editorial. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US." The paper goes on to say that maintaining the current trade agreement between the countries is “a win-win situation,” and if Trump does decide to change things, then “the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences." Trump spoke to Chinese president, Xi Jinping, just before the editorial was published. It was the first time that the two men had communicated with each other. In a statement, Trump’s staff said: “During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward.” As president, Trump could impose tariffs on specific goods, but no more than 15 percent and only for 150 days on all imported good – unless a state of emergency is declared. Like many of his pre-election statements, whether he follows through with the promise remains to be seen. Last week, Tim Cook become the latest silicon valley leader to address Trump’s presidency. The Apple CEO sent out an internal memo calling for unity among his employees. Trump spoke out against Apple’s decision not to help the FBI unlock the San Bernardino iPhone earlier this year, and said he would force the company to make all of its devices in the US if he became president.

During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a "tit-for-tat approach", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party. Apple iPhone 7 mobile phones being sold. Getty Images. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Apple has not responded to CNBC's request for comment. But the Chinese newspaper was not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it "merely campaign rhetoric" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports, As an example of earlier tariff-tit-for-tats, the Global Times pointed toward the 35 percent tariffs imposed in 2009 on Chinese tires by outgoing U.S. president Barack Obama. China retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. car parts and chicken. "Both China and the U.S. suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," the Global Times said. The opinion piece said Trump was a "shrewd businessman" and would not be naïve, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries. "The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president," the Global Times wrote. America's relationship with China is in focus after Trump slammed the world's second-largest economy during his campaign. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump spoke over the phone on Sunday. "During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward," a statement from Trump's presidential transition team said.

Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence,” the newspaper wrote in an editorial. The article listed Boeing airplanes, iPhones and crops such as maize and soybeans as goods that would be affected by Chinese countermeasures. It also stated that the number of Chinese students studying abroad in the U.S. could be cut if Trump adopted policies harmful to its trade with China, which the author described as "based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation." Trump claimed on the campaign trail he intended to limit China's influence on the U.S. economy by encouraging companies to manufacture at home. One of Trump's economic advisors, Judy Shelton, declared Friday that Trump would carry through with his campaign promises, but Wilbur Ross, one of Trump's senior policy advisors, told Yahoo Finance that the president-elect would avoid unnecessary conflict.

Chinese President Xi Jinping called Trump after his electoral victory Wednesday to congratulate the next president and discuss economic and military policies.

According to Chinese newspaper Global Times, these actions will not only negatively affect China's reputation, but "the trade atmosphere between China and the US will become more tense" (via The Guardian). In retaliation for the potential trade war, Global Times said that China "will take a tit-for-tat approach," and singled out the airline, automobile, and smartphone industries as some of the first potential targets of the tense relationship between the two countries if Trump decides to commit to his trade plan. Specifically, in regards to Apple and the iPhone, the newspaper said that China will cut iPhone sales in the country and subsequently the device "will suffer a setback" if all of this goes through. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Trump cannot change the pattern of interests between China and the US. The gigantic China-US trade is based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation. Even as president, Trump can exert limited influence on it. Despite the potential for such a disruption, Global Sun thinks there's a possibility that the 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports could have simply been outlandish "campaign rhetoric" and won't be put into action during Trump's presidency. The newspaper ends noting that "the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences" if such a trade war does begin. For Apple, the company has been consistently bolstering its presence in China, most recently announcing a new R&D center in Shenzhen to attract software developers. This year, China lost ground to Europe as Apple's third most profitable market, but Tim Cook remains steadily "optimistic" about Apple's presence in China, saying that "China is not as weak as has been talked about. We may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's more stable than the common view of it."

Trump has stated and clarified many times that during trade NEGOTIATIONS tariffs are ON THE TABLE to encourage WIN-WIN outcomes more so than the ONE WAY outcomes we have now. It was the policy of President Bill Clinton to enact GLOBALIZATION in order to export middle class lifestyles to communist and war ravaged countries like China, Vietnam, South Korea and others. It worked. It was never turned off or ramped down, and it resulted in WHOLESALE exportation of our manufacturing base to those countries and others like Mexico. Now to be fair those countries are now more civil, less warlike, and more interconnected with the world. Yes. However the cost to our domestic economy was two decades of wage stagnation and a long decline in GDP growth and money velocity. Check my links.

Chinese newspaper the Global Times, which has been accused of having a pro-government stance, has set out a short and sharp warning to Trump and other supporters of 45% tariffs imposed on Chinese goods and services entering the US; screw China and China will screw you harder. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” In short, tariff us and we will be tariffing you back hard and fast. The protectionist policy employed by Trump throughout the election campaign would appear to be more than a political soundbite to attract interest from citizens consumed by national pride or those who have found themselves unprepared for globalization and the emergence of the digital economy. Speaking during an interview with Bloomberg, Judy Shelton, economic advisor to President Elect Trump, indicated the policy would be taken forward: “He is someone going to carry through on what he says. He’s always very straight-forward and honest. I expect him to be consistent.” Let’s assume the Chinese market isn’t crucial for the growth of American businesses for the moment, Trump is not necessarily stopping with the Chinese, they have just felt the sharpest end of the stick. A 35% tariff has been proposed for other nations also. Like the Chinese, Korea, India, Japan, the EU, the UK, etc. are unlikely to take these tariffs lying down should the situation arise. Trump must have immense confidence in the strength of the US domestic market if it is to replace trade potential lost to these nations through tariffs. Risk to technology industry One of the biggest risks will be for the technology industry, not so much on the consumer side of things however. Sure, iPhone sales may suffer for a lack of international opportunity, however tariffs placed on foreign businesses could create a gap in the market for new US brands to enter the fold. Just because wallets are being squeezed a bit at the moment doesn’t mean the millennials are going to go that long without replacing their smartphones. The risk here will be undertaken by companies like Dell Technologies, VMWare, Intel, IBM etc. who are only looking internationally for growth. The US market is stagnant; new projects and customers are coming from the likes of China, India, South America and Eastern Europe, the very countries Trump is sizing up for a trade war. The US has a lot more to lose than the rest of the world. In a list of the top 20 US exporters for 2015, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco Systems represent the technology world; only Oil & Gas has a higher number of representatives. Electronic equipment also represented $163.1 billion of outgoing international trade, an increase of 36.9% since 2011, and 11.3% of the total export of US industry last year. Risk to the Rest of the World Aside from the obvious risk to the US economy, China Topix points out there could be a significant risk to numerous other nations, as well as the possibility of a worldwide recession should a trade war escalate. A slowdown in China could see the country spending less internationally. The immediate ripples would be felt in countries like South Korea, Japan, and Brazil, where China is the biggest market for exports. Ripples would be felt further and it would only be a matter of time before they hit the US again. Trump could reverse years of progress achieved through free-trade and set into motion a downward spiral. It’s very doom and gloom, but a realistic possibility. “For many countries around the world, China is now the biggest trading partner, so this kind of tit-for-tat trade protectionism with China will dampen the atmosphere for the international trading community,” said Yorizumi Watanabe, Economics Professor at Japan’s Keio University. An escalating trade war is certainly a long-way off however it is becoming a distinct possibility. Before Trump angers the rest of the world, he and his administration would have to negotiate around other politicians, as well as an army of lobbyists who are unlikely to be thrilled by such an idea as pissing off the Chinese. All-in-all, protectionism is a simple policy to attract interest from some of the more short-sighted demographics in the electorate. If the US policy continues down this route it’s unlikely to be good news for anyone. Despite it being a long way off and there being significant hurdles in the way, if there was one person who is determined enough to do it, America has found him.

This completely misses the psyche of those voting Trump. They are the ones who have seen jobs exported abroad to cheap, unregulated countries in the Global corporations pursuit of ever increasing profits. These are the people who’s wealth has been stolen by the Financial industry and those at the top of the corporation ladder, paying themselves ever greater salaries for “performance” figures that are just about how many American workers they have fired. This is a disgraceful attemot to paint those frustrated and disenchanted men and women as some form of ill prepared or digitally illiterate class. Those working in the lower echelons of the various tech savvy companies do not fare that well with salaries in America but at least they have jobs. Your view that somehow this band of Technically literate millenials are embracing a successful future is rubbish. As with those in the many industries that have grown and then fallen, once their labour costs get too much, the corporations will simply offshore them using free trade agreements dreamt up by lobbyists working for corporate heads. Jamie Davies 14/11/2016 @ 2:21 pm Reply Hi Peter Western societies have shifted towards a service-driven economy with the majority of schools and training programmes built around working the same service-driven economy, so it should come as little surprise manufacturing jobs are being outsourced to countries where these skills are much cheaper. You have a valid point and there are disenfranchised populations in Western societies, however the point of the article is that protectionism will not lead to any positive outcomes for anyone involved. It sounds like you are pro-protectionism/anti-globalisation – do you think the corporations should be banned from outsourcing labour to cheaper international markets? The downside would be a more expensive product which would mean the organization is less competitive globally, ultimately limiting the potential of the organization in the long-run. Would be good to hear you thoughts Thanks Jamie Kenneth Hoyt 15/11/2016 @ 2:55 am Reply Excuse me, you are jumping the gun by 170 days. Trump is more than 2 months from inauguration. Then come his first 100 days. There is so much that will occur before he meets Mr Xi somewhere in the world. Please take a deep breath. Stop recycling the same old anti/Trump speculation. Start by watching for the coming surpises. Elections do have consequences as Barrack once reminded us all.

Donald Trump’s 45% Tariff on China Exports Could Backfire Against the iPhone GO Communist party-backed Chinese newspaper warns that an import tariff imposed by the US could have serious consequences Nov 14, 2016 12:29 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  One of the promises made by president-elect Donald Trump during the presidential race was a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese products, as he wanted US companies to rely more on local workforce and less on overseas production. And now that Trump has been elected President, China warns that should the large import tariff go through, it can have serious consequences on the country’s relationship with China. An article published in the Global Times, a Communist party-backed newspaper, names the iPhone as one of the products that would be hurt if Donald Trump goes forward with his plan for the hefty tax on Chinese imports. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” the article reads, according to CNBC. How exactly the iPhone can “suffer a setback” is not yet known, but US companies could in their turn be forced to pay additional taxes, with Apple likely to suffer a major hit given the fact that it sources many of its parts from China. The article warns that China is ready to go for a “tit-for-tat” strategy with the United States, emphasizing that any US decision that affects the relationship with the country will be followed by a similar one from the Beijing government. “Trump won’t do that” The Chinese newspaper, which evokes the thoughts of the Communist party leaders, points out that Donald Trump is unlikely to propose the 45 percent tariff, as it believes that it was only a political move during the presidential campaign. “The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president,” the Global Times pointed out. Apple itself is already experiencing difficulties in doing business in China, partly because of the relationship with the Beijing government. Earlier this year, it was revealed that China wanted access to iOS source code, a demand that Apple quickly rejected, as the company pledged to protect users and refuse to collaborate with authorities on any efforts that could affect security. In April, Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks stores were banned all of a sudden for a reason that was not disclosed, while in May, the Chinese government started an investigation against the firm over unnamed security concerns. #Apple#China#Donald Trump#iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 Apple’s CEO on Trump Elected President of the US: It’s OK to Be Disappointed How Much Does an iPhone 7 Really Cost?

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Hilton Introduces Board of Directors for Park Hotels & Resorts MCLEAN, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–As Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) (“Hilton”) prepares to spin off the bulk of its real estate and timeshare businesses into two separate publicly traded companies, the company is proud to introduce the expected members of the Board of Directors of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (“Park”). After a comprehensive review of personal and professional qualifications, directors were chosen based upon the specific needs of Park. Upon completion of the spin-off, expected at or around year-end, Park will be one of the largest lodging real estate companies, with a diverse portfolio of iconic and market-leading hotels and resorts with significant underlying real estate value. The portfolio will consist of 67 premium-branded hotels and resorts with over 35,000 rooms located in prime U.S. and international markets with high barriers to entry. Hilton will continue to be led by the current president and chief executive officer (CEO), Christopher J. Nassetta. At this time, there are no planned changes to the Hilton Board of Directors as a result of the spin-off. Thomas J.

November 14 AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 China says iPhone sales ‘will suffer’ if Trump goes ahead with threatened trade war Ben Lovejoy - 2 days ago @benlovejoy Apple china Trump Apple Store, Shanghai View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Chinese government, through the state-run Global Times newspaper, has said that iPhone sales ‘will suffer’ if president-elect Trump follows through on his threatened trade war when he takes office. The comment was made in response to Trump’s campaign promise to apply 45% tariffs to Chinese imports. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralyzed. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback […] The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. The Global Times editorial also claimed that Trump would not in any case have the authority needed to apply the 45% tariff … To impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. Other than that, a US president can only demand a tariff increase on individual commodities. The piece appears to be pitched directly to Trump, stating that ‘a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve’ and even suggesting that ‘the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president.’ The Guardian reports that it is not just the Chinese who are hoping that the trade war threat was just empty talk. Paul Haenle, a veteran US diplomat who is director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua centre at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, warned the introduction of protectionist measures would immediately “inject friction” into already fraught US-China ties as well as harming America’s own economy. “If he follows through on a 45% trade tariff then I think it will be damaging to our own interests and we will have fallout that will affect our own companies and our own economy and it won’t be effective. It will not achieve what he is setting out to achieve. So from that standpoint he is going to have to moderate some of that rhetoric as he puts together actual concrete policies.” China is a hugely important market to Apple. A weak Chinese economy mean that predictions of China overtaking the USA as Apple’s largest market haven’t yet come to pass, but it has already happened on the software side. Apple has been working on developing ever-closer ties with China, with not just one but two R&D centers in the works. Also on the campaign rhetoric front, Trump claimed back in January that he would get Apple to start building ‘their damn computers and things’ in the U.S. rather than China. The editorial didn’t trouble itself with addressing this.

(CARLO ALLEGRI/REUTERS) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks on stage during a campaign event in Dimondale, Michigan, U.S., August 19, 2016. (CARLO ALLEGRI/REUTERS) KONRAD YAKABUSKI Gone for good: Why Trump’s jobs promise will fall flat Add to ... Konrad Yakabuski The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 4:11PM EST Last updated Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 6:18PM EST Comments Print / License AA So much for the new economy. Donald Trump’s path to the White House ran through a handful of old economy states whose voters are presumably now counting on the Republican president-elect to bring back all those auto, steel and coal-mining jobs that once powered their region. What are the odds of that? During the campaign, Mr. Trump identified the North American free-trade agreement as the main source of the Rust Belt ills. This struck a chord with working-class voters in Michigan, a state that hadn’t voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988, and which strongly backed President Barack Obama (who presided over the 2009 auto bailouts) in 2012 over native son (and auto-industry antagonist) Mitt Romney. Of all the economic challenges facing the Rust Belt, however, free trade may be the least threatening. Today, manufacturing accounts for 8 per cent of U.S. employment, compared to a quarter of all jobs in the 1960s. Factory output continues to increase, but manufacturing employment, at about 12.3 million in October, does not. For every manufacturing job lost to trade in recent years, eight have been lost to automation. At least free trade produces additional jobs in export-competitive sectors. Mr. Trump can’t unwind the robot trend any more than he can reverse the geographical shift of U.S. manufacturing from Rust Belt states to southern ones with friendlier (for business) tax and labour laws. From Boeing to BMW, corporations have displayed a net preference for building greenfield factories in the South. To make their states more competitive, Republican governors in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin have focused on cutting taxes, not renegotiating trade deals. They’ve claimed some success, boasting lower-than-average unemployment rates. Mr. Trump has vowed to renegotiate NAFTA, failing which he would scrap it and slap tariffs of as much as 35 per cent on Mexican goods entering the United States. Since NAFTA trade is bi- or tri-directional, increasingly so given the role of continental supply chains in North American manufacturing, this would whack U.S. exports as hard as it would imports. It would also raise prices for everything from cars to air conditioners, hurting American consumers. Similarly, the 45-per-cent tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened to slap on Chinese goods, especially steel, would hurt low-income Americans most without repatriating many jobs. Employment would shift to other Asian countries. But such a move would be tantamount to kicking China when it’s down, throwing an economy already plagued by slowing growth and overcapacity into a tailspin that sucks the rest of the globe down the tubes with it. Besides, Pittsburgh will never again be the hub of the global steel industry. Nor would it want to be, having bet on more lucrative (and cleaner) technology and health-care jobs. It will take years to absorb the global steel glut, with more than 700 million tonnes of current excess capacity swishing around. Mr. Trump promises to end the “war on coal” waged by Mr. Obama, who has proposed strict regulations to limit coal-based electricity production – mind you, their implementation has been held up by the courts. The market, not Mr. Obama, is responsible for the U.S. coal industry’s decline, as cheaper natural gas displaces coal in power production. U.S. coal output slumped 10 per cent in 2015 and was down 20 per cent in the first 10 months of 2016. At 66,000, there are fewer U.S. coal mining jobs now than at any time since the Energy Information Administration began keeping employment records in 1978. This trend will accelerate if Mr. Trump carries through with his promise to ease fracking regulations, a move that is only likely to increase the cost advantage of natural gas over coal. Mr. Trump might extend the life of a few coal plants by scrapping subsidies and other incentives for renewable energy – although even some Republicans in Congress might not be especially eager to grant him his wish. But it would take a lot more than that to make coal king again. Perhaps some of the voters who backed Mr. Trump know intuitively that he can’t bring back those old economy jobs. Perhaps they’re just happy to see a politician give ‘em hell for a change, even if they recognize much of it as bluster. Unlike the news media, they don’t get hung up on the details. “The press takes [Mr. Trump] literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally,” the Atlantic’s Salena Zito wrote insightfully in September. So maybe it doesn’t matter to those supporters whether Mr. Trump can actually bring back the jobs. All they care about is that they’ve found a politician who takes them seriously. Maybe even literally, too.

During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a "tit-for-tat approach", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Apple has not responded to CNBC's request for comment. Thomas Peter | Reuters A man holds his new iPhone 7 at an Apple store in Beijing, China. But the Chinese newspaper was not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it "merely campaign rhetoric" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. As an example of earlier tariff-tit-for-tats, the Global Times pointed toward the 35 percent tariffs imposed in 2009 on Chinese tires. China retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. car parts and chicken. "Both China and the U.S. suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," theGlobal Times said. The opinion piece said Trump was a "shrewd businessman" and would not be naive, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries. "The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president," the Global Times wrote. America's relationship with China is in focus after Trump slammed the world's second-largest economy during his campaign. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump spoke over the phone on Sunday. "During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward," a statement from Trump's presidential transition team said.

In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect’s name and his support for a DAMAC project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other US firms are strong. The United States imported $32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing and a number of US defence firms. The Gulf’s sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of US investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump’s campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding which has stakes in US firms including Citigroup and Twitter, called him a “disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America”. However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: “President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency.” Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump’s Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the US if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump’s comments on Muslims “were for the election only” and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. FAIR COMPETITOR Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al Ardhi, Executive Chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp, which has billions of dollars in US real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. “Investcorp knows that Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal,” Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewellery firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 per cent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major US cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest $35 billion in the US over five years. UNCERTAINTY FOR AIRLINES Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with US carriers. A group including American Airlines and United Airlines say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates and Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favour US interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. “It’s so important for our business that the liberalization that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues,” Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on October 18, adding Trump “may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade”. A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways’ Group Chief Executive Akbar al Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. “Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position,” he said in a statement. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Companies drilling black gold go a little green With Trump, focus may drift back to Fed, inflation → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman welcomes Yemen ceasefire HM receives greetings from Fahd Higher Committee for Conferences meets Kerry concludes oman visit Read More ...

In an editorial published on Sunday, the Global Times said it would be "naive" for Trump to follow through on his campaign promises to implement a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the US and to declare the country a currency manipulator. Trump repeatedly targeted China during his presidential campaign, vowing to take a tougher stance on trade in the hopes of reviving manufacturing in the US. In its editorial, the Global Times dismissed the notion that Trump alone could implement a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports, though it warned that any protectionist measure could leave trade "paralyzed." "China will take a tit-for-tat approach." "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then," the editorial reads. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US." As president, Trump would be able to implement tariffs on specific goods, though he can impose a tariff of no more than 15 percent on all goods — and only for 150 days — unless a state of emergency is declared. Trump has dismissed concerns from economists and policymakers over a potential trade war with China, the country's biggest trading partner, saying at a June rally: "We already have a trade war. And we’re losing, badly." As with many of his other campaign promises, it's unclear whether the president-elect will be as aggressive against China when he gets to office. In its editorial, the Global Times said that "as a shrewd businessman," Trump "will not be so naïve." "If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired," the paper said. "Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences." Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with Trump on a phone call Monday, telling the president-elect that "cooperation is the only correct choice for China and the United States," according to state-run media. The two men agreed to maintain close communication and meet "at an early date," Chinese media reported.

Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump's Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the US if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump's comments on Muslims "were for the election only" and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favour of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the US Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers. Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of 2015: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC on Thursday told Reuters that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al-Ardhi, executive chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp, which has billions of dollars in US real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. "Investcorp knows that Mr Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal," Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewellery firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$US792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 per cent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major US cities. The Qatar Investment Authority in September 2015 said it would help the Gulf state invest $US35 billion in the USover five years. Spokesmen for the QIA and ADIA declined to comment on the election. Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with US carriers. A group including American Airlines and United Airlines say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favour US interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. "It's so important for our business that the liberalisation that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues," Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on October 18, adding that Trump "may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade". A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways' Group chief executive Akbar al-Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. "Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position," he said in a statement to Reuters. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Domino's hails 'world's first' drone pizzaAAP Domino's claims it has completed the world's first pizza delivery by drone.

In Dubai, boards displaying Trump’s name and his support for a DAMAC Properties project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other US firms are strong. The US imported US$32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries last year and the region is the most important client base for Boeing Co and a number of US defense firms. The Gulf’s sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of US investments. However, Arab business figures were angry about Trump’s campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the US, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December last year. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding, which has stakes in US firms including Citigroup Inc and Twitter Inc, called him a “disgrace not only to the GOP [Grand Old Party] but to all America.” However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: “President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency.” Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al-Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency.

Nicknamed the “Superfortress,” the B-29 was the most technologically-advanced bomber in the world at the time – obliterating the enemy’s ability to make war. The most famous, of course, was the Enola Gay, that dropped the first atomic bomb. Mazzolini was a flight engineer on a B-29 during the Korean War. By then, the jet age had nearly rendered the legendary bomber obsolete. Those that hadn’t been lost in combat were usually scrapped, or sent to the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in California’s Mojave Desert, where the once-proud bombers were used for target practice. “They were just in millions of pieces,” Mazzolini said. “Kind of an undignified end,” said Cowan. “It is, to quite a historic aircraft.” Everyone told Mazzolini any B-29 worth saving had been saved already; there were none left. But they were wrong. Out in that desert boneyard he found a B-29 named “Doc” -- defiantly, inexplicably, still in one piece, as if it had never given up the will to fly. It had become, Mazzolini said, “a sanctuary for some of the desert birds and critters.” “Doc” is rescued from an airplane graveyard. CBS News With the help of a few dozen bomber buffs, Mazzolini managed to tug ol’ Doc out of the desert. Slowly, piece by giant piece, it was shipped back to the former Boeing plant in Wichita, Kansas -- the very same plant where Doc rolled off the assembly line back in 1945. “My mother, father, grandmother all worked on ‘em; my mom started the day after she turned 16 years old,” said airplane mechanic T.J. Norman, one of a long line of B-29 mechanics. And Doc became his patient. His job wasn’t just to make the plane a static display in a museum. Nope. What he had to do seemed impossible: To get Doc flying again. Soon, volunteers started showing up to help Norman out. And they kept coming, by the hundreds. Some older than Doc himself, like Connie Palocioz. “You know, it’s kind of hard to believe that I would be here,” said the 91-year-old, one of the original Rosie the Riveters who worked at the Wichita Boeing plant during World War II. In fact, she put the rivets in Doc herself. They’re still as good as they day she put them there. “Really proud of this plane. It means a lot to me,” she said. Connie and the rest of the volunteers, known collectively as Doc’s Friends, spent hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours, not to mention hundreds of thousands of donated dollars, to get Doc ready for its hometown debut -- nearly 30 years after it was rescued. Few were as awestruck as Army Corps veteran Charles Chauncey. He’s 92, and a former B-29 pilot. “I don’t know how many are left of us, but it’s getting pretty small,” he said. He flew 35 missions over Japan. Cowan asked, “What does it feel like when you’re in there and you start up all four of these engines?” “Oh, noisy!” Chauncey laughed. He wasn’t kidding; the Earth actually moves as they belch to life. It was the day of Doc’s first test flight, and the air in Wichita was thick with nervous anticipation. Mazzolini, Chauncey, everybody was there -- Connie Palocioz, too, appropriately dressed as Rosie. As Doc lumbered by, there were more than a few tears. Mazzolini joined Palocioz at the end of the runway to wait and watch. It had been 60 years since that plane left the ground -- everything was on the line. And then, it happened ... Rescuing a B-29 named “Doc” from the boneyard and returning it to the skies was a mission for Tony Mazzolini and hundreds of volunteers. Facebook “It’s up!! It’s up!!! All right!! It’s up, by God, it’s up!!” That’s all Mazzolini could say. There were cheers all around... “I’m telling ya’, I am absolutely delighted at this,” he said. “This has been one great day. I couldn’t believe it. I feel like doing a dance right now!” “It’s up by God it’s up!!” Mazzolini had done it, and there it was: a B-29 back among clouds, a tangible piece of flying history. But Mazzolini’s real gift was to veterans like Chauncey, who quietly, away from all the pomp and circumstance, said more than we ever could. “Oh, it’s great. Ol’ Doc. Yeah!” Chauncey said, pumping his fist in the air.          For more info: B-29 “Doc”: Restoring History Docs Friends on Facebook © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

They say Trump’s plans to halt illegal immigration and redo trade pacts struck a powerful chord. Share story By Jim Brunner and David Gutman Seattle Times staff reporters Jason Swendt says he wouldn’t want his three daughters to date someone who has treated women like President-elect Donald Trump has. Nevertheless, Swendt marked his ballot for Trump — and has pinned great hopes on the incoming Republican president’s plans to scuttle and reshape international trade deals and halt illegal immigration. Swendt, 43, works at Intalco’s Ferndale aluminum smelter, in an industry buffeted by sagging aluminum prices and foreign competition. “If he stays true to his word … I believe we’ve got a great shot here,” said Swendt, who thinks steel mills and other manufacturing jobs can come back under a Trump administration. “I truly believe that he does want the best for the American worker.” Related story Donald Trump’s election could have dire consequences for “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants brought here as children. With Trump threatening to end the program that allows them to stay legally in the U.S., some feel shock, fear and an urgent desire to make themselves known. Read more here. In Washington state, where Trump took just 38 percent of the vote — and especially in King County, where he won a scant 22 percent — many found Tuesday’s election results unfathomable. But in interviews last week, Trump supporters here echoed sentiments of swing voters in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which flipped from Democrat to Republican this year. They’ve been angered by immigration, cultural changes and misguided trade pacts they see as brought on by an arrogant Washington, D.C., elite that has grown out of touch with the average American. Watching Trump’s Tuesday night acceptance speech, Cynthia Cole was struck by the magnitude of what just took place. “He really hit a lot of people who thought the government was not listening to their needs,” said Cole, 62, of Bellevue, a retired Boeing employee who led the company’s engineering union for four years. “The people who are Trump supporters got tired of being told they were stupid and they’re racist or bigoted if they were supporting Trump.” Now that he is headed to the White House, Trump supporters here say they expect him to follow through on his big pledges: protectionist trade policies, repeal of the Affordable Care Act, building a wall on the Mexican border, halting refugees from Syria and slashing corporate taxes. State Sen. Don Benton, R-Vancouver, a Trump adviser who ran his campaign in Washington, has been in touch with Trump’s family and members of the transition team since the election. Despite whispers that Trump’s border wall with Mexico was more campaign talk than concrete proposal, Benton says it’s happening. “Mr. Trump says he is going to build a wall and believe me, when he says something he means it,” Benton said. “He’s a man of his word.” But there already are signs Trump may break some of his campaign promises. On Friday, he told The Wall Street Journal he’s willing to keep part of the federal health-care law he’s spent the last year denouncing. And senior Trump adviser Newt Gingrich said Trump may not spend much time getting Mexico to pay for the border wall, calling that pledge “a great campaign device.” “Family-wage jobs” In Washington, as nationally, Trump drew his strongest support from whites, especially white men without college degrees. Exit polls showed a majority of Americans believed Trump was not qualified and did not have the right temperament to be president. Some put aside those concerns and voted for him anyway — seeing bigger flaws in Democrat Hillary Clinton. Before the election, Trump was accused by multiple women of unwanted advances and sexual assault, charges he denied. A leaked tape also emerged of Trump boasting in 2005 of groping women without permission. Clinton won handily among all female voters nationally, according to exit polls, taking 54 percent of their votes to Trump’s 42 percent. But, among just white women, Trump won by nearly as large a margin, 53 percent to 43 percent. Steve Altick, an ordained minister and Vietnam veteran, said he wasn’t crazy about some of Trump’s comments, but in the end he had to make a choice. “The negative on Trump were the things he said,” Altick, 73, of Auburn, said. “The negatives on Secretary Clinton were the things she did. It was someone who was ethically not sound versus someone who talks before he thinks.” Altick, who runs a Christian camp after 23 years in the Air Force, said the military, under Obama, has become “somewhat of a social experiment.” He cited the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and the opening of all combat roles to women. While Trump lost big in Washington state, he flipped four rural Washington counties that had a history of voting Democratic. That included Grays Harbor County, where the 8.2 percent jobless rate is double that of King County. “This is an area that has been down for a long time,” said Jim Walsh, chairman of the Grays Harbor Republican Party. Good-paying jobs in the timber industry and in commercial fishing have faded away in the Pacific Coast county. And Walsh said locals don’t believe the “clean-energy economy” talked up by Seattle-area Democrats will be a sufficient replacement. “We want to see real industries that generate family-wage jobs again,” Walsh said. Immigration University of Washington political science professor Christopher Parker rejected the idea that Trump’s soaring support among whites was based on economic populism, citing national exit polls showing Trump winning every income bracket above $50,000 annually. Parker, who wrote a book on the tea party and who has been a Trump critic, sees racism behind the election result. “This is not about people who are hurting economically, that is what people tell themselves, but it’s not true,” he said. “This is all about the idea that they are losing their country, that the America they’ve come to know and love is vanishing.” Trump launched his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants rapists and last year called for ban on Muslims entering the U.S., citing terrorism concerns. Trump supporters resent being labeled intolerant, and say it’s unfair, for example, to tie their candidate or them to white nationalist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, that supported him. Altick said many Trump controversies were overblown by the media. Still, he said he understands the fears some minorities have of the president-elect. “The other side has couched what he has said to scare people,” he said. “That was all part of the campaign, but now that the campaign’s over, he’s got to try to reassure people.” Despite the racially divisive campaign, exit polls show Trump winning the same share of the Latino vote as Mitt Romney in 2012. (As a group, Latinos still overwhelming voted Democratic.) Trump supporter Rachelle Ramirez, of Blaine, was born in the U.S. but said her grandmother came here illegally from Mexico. She agrees with Trump that immigration laws should be enforced. “There is a right way and a wrong way to get in here,” Ramirez said. “If you have nothing to hide, you should be fine, right? The only people who have anything to worry about are people who probably shouldn’t be here.” Ramirez pointed to Clinton’s email controversy and the Benghazi terrorist attacks as disqualifiers for the former secretary of state. Like Swendt, Ramirez works in a union job at the Intalco smelter, a plant that has been threatened with closure due to economic conditions in the aluminum industry. Wenatchee’s Alcoa smelter was idled in January, costing more than 400 people their jobs. Intalco was only saved through government intervention, including a $3 million state grant and a renegotiated deal with the Bonneville Power Administration. Washington is a major beneficiary of international trade, and some experts have warned the state will suffer dire consequences if Trump imposes protectionist policies, such as high tariffs, that ignite a trade war. But Trump’s trade stance hit a chord with some unionized manufacturing workers who see their jobs at risk under trade deals like the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a pact negotiated by the Obama administration that Trump’s election is certain to scuttle. Trade Ryan Leenders, of Everett, a member of the International Association of Machinists (IAM), grew up a Democrat and says he voted for Obama in 2008. But Leenders, 31, was drawn to Trump early in the 2016 campaign when he heard the candidate denounce the 1994 NAFTA deal and other international trade agreements. While unions including IAM formally endorsed Clinton this year, Leenders said there was plenty of support for Trump among rank and file union members. “It’s pretty amazing how many people support him within the union. The headquarters over on the East Coast decided for us without taking a vote,” Leenders said of the Clinton endorsement. Trump’s trade criticism was similar to that of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the runner-up to Clinton in the Democratic presidential race. Leenders said he and other Trump supporters could maybe have gotten behind Sanders on that basis. “At least I respected him as a person,” he said. By the time Trump’s leaked comments about women emerged last month, Leenders said he had more than enough information on the candidates, and Clinton was not an option. “I had pretty much already made up my mind,” Leenders said. “He would have had to have done something, to use her words, pretty ‘deplorable’ to sway my opinion.” Jim Brunner: 206-515-5628 or jbrunner@seattletimes.com.

President of ­America. In the footsteps of Lincoln and Kennedy. The Kid from Queens. Wouldya believe it? I can hear him ­saying it now. Like many successful businessmen, The Donald always said he knew how to make America Great again. Reuters 7 Making a point … the fierce face of Donald Trump He told me this many times during the two weeks I spent with him filming a documentary for British ­television in 1995. He had not given any broadcaster this kind of access before. I was introduced to his business associates in the penthouse suite at New York’s Trump Tower, where he greeted me as “the legendary Selina Scott, partner in our deal”, inviting me to fly in his helicopter above the Manhattan skyline, outlining his vision of the way his property empire reshaped the city. He introduced me to his mother Mary, the daughter of a crofter from the Western Isles who he adored and revered, and bade me join him on many a glamorous social occasion. In the hurly burly of this remarkable odyssey between the personal, the private and the professional, I believe I gained a deep insight into this extraordinary man. I quickly realised he could switch between the charm of a George Clooney — “I like beautiful things which is why I like you, Selina” — to the naked, the venomous and the vindictive. He could switch like a light from social chit-chat to corporate or political dialogue. “Look at Japan and China,” he would rage out of nowhere. “They’re laughing at us. Look at Mexico and Michigan. They used to make cars in Michigan and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. “Now they make cars in Mexico and you can’t drink the water in Michigan. “To hell with that. If I was President we’d soon turn that around, and boy would I love to be in the White House. Then we’d see some changes.” And now he has got the chance to make his boasts come true. Grampian Television 7 Documented … Selina and The Donald filmed a documentary for British ­television in 1995. He’s got plenty of people knocking him, but he always did have. The Trump I got to know has a very clear philosophy. He divides the world into winners and losers. If there’s something you want, go out and take it. Washington is about to find out. I would love to be a fly on the wall of the Oval Office come January. I know what he will say when Russia and its expansionist President Putin is on the agenda. “We need a strategy, Mr President,” the generals will say to him. “Yeah, I will tell you my strategy,” he will say, echoing Ronnie Reagan. “They lose, we win.” The reason he admires Putin is because he is cut from the same cloth. Trump sees Putin as a guy who kicks ass. A tough guy. And most of all, Trump wants the world to see HIM as a tough guy. Let me tell you a story. Trump had invited me on board his Boeing jet to fly to Mar-a-Lago — his Florida mansion — to attend a glittering party by the pool. He had already shown me the white leather bed, the well-stocked bar, the on-board cinema and all his other toys when the conversation turned to a high-profile New York female journalist who he thought had stabbed him in the back. “I’m going to get that b****. I am going to break her,” he said. I said, “But Donald, it’s only an article, she is a journalist. What does it matter?” “It does matter,” he replied. “It’s a question of honour. If someone comes after me they’ve gotta know I’m gonna turn on them and it’s gonna be them or me.” One person about to find that out is Barack Obama, who Trump hates and who has ridiculed him. Getty Images 7 Hot and cold … Trump could switch like a light from social chit-chat to corporate or political dialogue Related stories 'BUILD THAT WALL!'

Trump sees Putin as a guy who kicks ass. A tough guy Trump has pledged to reverse everything Obama has achieved — health care for the poor, gun reform, trade deals that he views as beneficial to everyone but America, the nuclear treaty with Iran and climate accord. He says he will reverse Obama’s armistice for those immigrants already in the country. And then there is the Wall between America and Mexico. I believe he has every intention on his first day in office of ordering the first brick to be laid. Even though it’s estimated at costing £9billion. I think he will put women in his cabinet to show he is not a misogynist. One of them will almost certainly be Sarah Palin, the flaky former Governor of Alaska. My observation of Trump at close quarters is — despite some of the horrible things he has said about women, such as “I grab them by the p****. They’ll let you do anything when you are a star” — he has a stunted emotional growth which makes praise he receives from women important to him. Is the world safe with his finger on the nuclear button? This is the question not just the West is asking but Vladimir Putin also. Nato is weak. Many observers feel if Russia moves to occupy the Baltic States, Nato would not respond for fear of starting a war. Would Trump’s tough guy mentality take over and would he do something stupid in order to show Putin just how tough he is? It’s not just the world that waits with uncertainty but the Kremlin as well. AP:Associated Press 7 Ladie’s man … Trump will put women in his cabinet to show he is not a misogynist On his first day as president when he lays out what he wants done, he will be told: “This isn’t possible”, “That isn’t possible”. But Trump will be ready for them. He has a notoriously short attention span. This may be of great help. He will be good at cutting through the diplomatic waffle and at making deals because that’s what he loves. And despite Theresa May being only tenth on his list of phone calls to world leaders, he has a deep affection for the UK, or Scotland where his mother was born. I think that will become a very important part of Downing Street’s relationship with the 45th President. Mind you, the Prime Minister will have to have her bulls**t radar switched on. During my documentary I discovered he had a distant relationship with the truth. He said he owned 100 per cent of the Empire State Building. He later confessed his stake had shrunk to 40 per cent then, miraculously, 20 per cent. Who knows what the truth was? Even so, I backed him to survive the financial problems he was experiencing at the time as bankruptcy loomed. And on ITV’s This Morning this week, I prophesied he would win the election. Trump’s will to win, his command of the stage, his almost mystical ability to undermine Clinton’s confidence, allied to his own brilliant prosecution of his own mantra, convinced me nothing could stop him. Getty Images 7 Soothsayer … on ITV’s This Morning this week, Selina prophesied Trump would win the election So I wasn’t surprised when he carried the country but I can’t pretend I was overjoyed. I have been appalled by his “locker room” language — but we are where we are. So if Trump is unable to carry out all his promises to the white/blue collar fraternity who feel they have been left behind, how will he explain this away? Trump is nothing if not plausible. He will tell them he needs more time. He will tell them he needs another term. And with his luck he will probably get it.   Donald Trump shifts Obamacare stance and praises Clintons on 60 Minutes   For more Trump talk, don't miss Paul Ross from 11am on your new speech radio station.

He said the first strategy was developing and updating the aircraft fleet and developing the airlines work in general. This strategy has been implemented, as the company aims to have around 200 new airplanes by 2020, targets around 45 million passengers per year, and around 1,000 flights everyday. Al-Jasser mentioned that in 2016, 29 aircraft were added to the fleet and the goal next year is to add around 30 more airplanes. Saudia is getting rid of several types of aircraft, including 747 and Embraer plane fleet. By Dec. 1, the last plane from the Embraer fleet will have its last traveling flight from Riyadh to Dammam and after that, the company will not use this type of the aircraft again. Saudia intends to sell some parts of these decommissioned airplanes or sell the whole aircraft. “The second strategy that we will be working on to achieve, is increasing the productivity as well as the performance efficiency of the employees through several ways, including some initiatives,” Al-Jasser said. The third strategy is to enhance the services as well as the whole passengers experiences through training the employees, while the fourth strategy is focusing and aligning between products and different customer segments. He added that the fifth strategy would be on focusing on human resources, which includes having a suitable working environment and measuring the performance. Finally, investing in technology and improving it, he noted. Al-Jasser moreover said that Saudia is also launching new flight destination this year. Ankara would be the new destination and after few days from this opening, Algeria would be another new destination for the airlines. By 2017, other new destinations will be opened too.

In what analysts described as an early warning shot, Chinese state media suggested Beijing could slash imports of American goods -- including iPhones -- if the U.S. imposed steeper tariffs. "Large orders for Boeing planes would switch to Europe, U.S. auto sales in China would face setbacks, Apple phones would essentially be crowded out, and U.S. soybeans and corn would be eradicated from China," the Global Times wrote in an editorial. Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Trump on his election and said cooperation was the "only correct choice" for China and the U.S., the world's two biggest economies. "At present, there is an important opportunity and huge potential in China-U.S. cooperation," Xi told Trump, according to the reports.

On Tuesday, The Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on self-driving cars as apart of its Disruptors Series.  Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Texas), the chair of the subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade, is holding the hearing, which will be preceded by self driving car demos by Tesla Motors, BMW Group, and Audi of America, Inc. on Capitol Hill. ADVERTISEMENT "Members will explore the potential impact of self-driving cars on driver and roadway safety and how this emerging technology could improve mobility, increase vehicle efficiency, and create new opportunities including economic growth and transportation access for the disabled and underserved communities," according to a release. Congress is also set to have two tech hearings on Wednesday. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce will hold a meeting regarding last month's massive cyberattack against Dyn, a domain name system (DNS) provider.  The hearing will be jointly held by the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology chaired by Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade chaired Burgess.

TECH'S MESSAGE TO TRUMP: The Internet Association, a trade association representing major tech companies like Amazon, eBay and Google penned a letter to President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpHerman Cain: 'Steve Bannon is not a white supremacist’ Armstrong Williams op-ed: Carson influential inside or outside of government Graham: Trump should 'think long and hard' about immigration move MORE Monday. The letter outlined suggestions that the tech industry has for the Trump administration when he takes office. The 12-page letter spanned policy recommendations on issues like STEM education, patent reform and encryption issues. Donald Trump has not addressed many tech policy issues yet, but when he has, he's taken positions unpopular with tech interests. COPYRIGHT OR COPYWRONG?: The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) and the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) voiced their concerns on internet service providers' responsibility for users who infringe copyright laws in an amicus brief today to the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The groups argued that Cox was wrongly held liable for not policing Internet content. The case involves Cox Communications, which was hit with a $25 million penalty, after a judge found it liable for illegal music downloads by its customers. "It is critical in a democracy that juries and our legal system correctly follow existing copyright law on secondary liability," CCIA President & CEO Ed Black said. "U.S. copyright law is balanced with liability protections for companies to respond quickly to infringement without resorting to policing all online sharing and commentary for copyright infringement. We value free speech and what it represents and it would be unwise to abandon that principle and balance for extremist copyright enforcement measures." TRADE WAR(NING): China will retaliate "tit-for-tat" if President-elect Donald Trump seeks to start a trade war, according to the Chinese Communist party-controlled newspaper, The Global Times. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus," the Global Times wrote. "US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted." Unsurprisingly, investors were not pleased by this. Traders unloaded Apple shares, causing the stock to fall by 2.5 percent, double the average S&P 500 loss on Monday. ON TAP: At 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on self-driving cars. The event will be preceded by a self-driving car demo at 9:00 a.m. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Tech news was still happening while you thinking about the election. Fear not, here are some gems from it. Curious about what Obama regulations Trump could change? The Hill details 14 of them, including net neutrality. Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) made his debut as an Uber driver over the weekend. Facebook is denying a report they created a tool to stop fake news and then nixed it in fear of a conservative backlash. The company has faced substantial scrutiny in 2016 over fake news stories on their platform, conservative allegations of bias and liberal criticisms that they should have enforced hate speech policies on Donald Trump. Google is having fake news problems of its own. Searching "election results" on Monday showed users a story linking to incorrect election results favoring Trump. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told everyone how he really feels about whistleblower Edward Snowden. Spoiler: It's exactly what you think.  Tags Richard Blumenthal, Chuck Grassley, Patrick Leahy, Susan Collins, Donald Trump, Mark Warner, John Thune   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President-elect Donald Trump says he will forgo his $400,000 (£319,500) salary President-elect Donald Trump has announced he will give up his presidential salary of $400,000 (£319,500) and take just $1 a year. He revealed his plan to receive nominal pay during an interview with 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl on CBS News. Though he was unaware of how much a president made, Mr Trump said he thought he was required to take $1. After Ms Stahl told him it was $400,000, he said: "No, I'm not going to take the salary. I'm not taking it." The president-elect is following through on a promise he made while on the campaign trail. He told a crowd last September that salary was "not a big deal" for him. Have other leaders given up their annual salary? Mr Trump is not the first US leader to extend the symbolic gesture of forgoing a salary. Herbert Hoover, who made his fortune in mining before taking office, and John F Kennedy, who inherited his wealth, both gave up their salaries and donated them to charity. Image copyright PA Image caption JFK belonged to one of the 20th Century's most prominent US political dynasties Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney also gave up their executive pay for a buck. Mark Zuckerberg is Facebook's lowest-paid employee and among many billionaire CEOs earning $1 in pay. Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page have been taking a $1 salary for about a decade while Oracle's Larry Ellison took the same cut for several years while he was CEO. Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman also uses the same strategy. But it's worth noting these aforementioned business leaders received pay by other means, including equity stakes in their companies and other performance-based compensation. Jose Mujica: The world's poorest president How world leaders react to Trump's upset What do other international leaders make? In addition to the $400,000, the US president also has a tax-free expense account worth $50,000, according to a statute. By comparison, the Canadian Prime Minister took a salary of C$340,800 (£201,202) last year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel made $242,000 (£193,976) while French President Francois Hollande earned $198,700 (£158,000), according to a CNN Money report in August. Mr Hollande took a 30% pay cut when he assumed office in 2012. Image copyright Reuters Image caption UK PM Theresa May earns $186,119 (£143,462) The UK prime minister Theresa May earns $186,119 (£143,462) annually, although in the wake of the Brexit vote it has dropped in dollar worth. Former Prime Minister David Cameron faced sharp criticism for taking a 10% pay rise in 2015, but he said "the right thing to do is to be paid the rate for the job", adding that it "gives you the opportunity to do more in terms of charitable giving and things like that." When did the concept become popular? Though Apple founder Steve Jobs popularised the $1 salary concept in Silicon Valley after returning to the company's helm in 1997, business executives have sacrificed their salaries since WWI and WWII. Image copyright Justin Sullivan Image caption Apple founder Steve Jobs popularised the $1 a year salary The "dollar-a-year men" consisted of prominent executives, bankers and manufacturers who volunteered to serve in government roles to help the war effort during WWI. Since US law prohibits unpaid work, these leaders accepted a token salary of only $1 a year. The idea re-emerged during WWII, with executives hailing from such industry giants as Lockheed, Chrysler and Boeing stepping forward to serve their patriotic duty. Will Donald Trump have other sources of income? Yes, and some have already come under scrutiny. Mr Trump's financial arrangements have raised questions after he announced his three children - Donald Jr, Eric, and Ivanka - and Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner, were appointed to his transition committee. Mr Trump is not required to sell his assets, which are estimated in the billions, and has said he would leave his business empire in a blind trust managed by his children. However, the trust is arguably no longer blind, or under the control of an independent trustee, given that his children are involved his presidential transition. So far, Mr Trump has refused to release his taxes, and it is unclear if his holdings in foreign countries will impact on US relations or shape his policy, underscoring a host of potential conflicts of interest.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:20 AM, November 15, 2016 Updated: 6:50 AM, November 15, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO - Apple's <AAPL.O> stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com <AMZN.O>, Facebook <FB.O> and Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's <.SPX> 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of "tit-for-tat" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. "A batch of Boeing <BA.N> orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted," the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. "You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements," Morgan said.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has enough problems with the iPhone. But a trade war with China would — ahem — trump them all. That’s why a recent editorial from a Chinese state-controlled newspaper is chilling if you’re invested in AAPL stock right now. Source: Yuanbin Du Via Flickr Global Times isn’t the most serious of newspapers in China, but it is influential, according to Financial Times. The nationalist tabloid has 15 million readers in print and online combined and counts itself as the third-largest news site in the country. Most troubling of all, it’s a government mouthpiece of sorts. From Financial Times: “The English-language edition has become a favored, if unofficial, platform for broadcasting Beijing’s version of events to an international audience, thanks to a bolder and more readable style than most other state media. That puts the paper at a historic high in terms of influence, [the editor claims].” So when this newspaper runs an editorial warning of the repercussions of a trade war, investors would do well to listen. On Monday, it recapped what happened last time the U.S. and China got into a trade spat and what would follow should it go this route again. From Global Times: “Not long after Barack Obama took office, US trade and commerce authorities announced a 35 percent import tariff on Chinese tires. In response, China took retaliatory steps of imposing tariffs on US chicken and automotive products. Both China and the US suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralyzed. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” A New Risk for AAPL Stock None of these worries are new to investors in Apple stock. Shares in the company have been sliding since the election. Even if the new president is serious — and there’s reason to believe he is not — the office has limited control of trade policy. It could sting anyway.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File) WASHINGTON - In a story Nov. 14 about President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Michael Meese is a former chief operating officer of American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association. He is currently the chief operating officer of the non-profit organization. A corrected version of the story is below: Trump's transition team signals return to GOP establishment President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is rich with lobbyists and includes a climate change-denier and an ex-federal prosecutor involved in the mass firings of U.S. attorneys By VIVIAN SALAMA Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is rich with lobbyists and includes a climate change-denier and an ex-federal prosecutor involved in the mass firings of U.S. attorneys. Some of the individuals listed in an organizational chart of Trump's top transition personnel, obtained by The Associated Press: Defence AND NATIONAL SECURITY Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg has been working closely with Trump adviser and retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, advising the Trump campaign on matters relating to foreign policy and national security. He was chief operating officer of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, the interim governing body following the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. He previously worked as executive vice-president of research and technology for Virginia-based information technology firm CACI International, which works as a contractor for defence, intelligence and homeland security agencies. ___ Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has been named to the executive committee of Trump's transition committee. In the role, Nunes said he would help advise the president-elect on appointing individuals to Cabinet and other top positions in the next administration. ___ Retired Lt. Gen. Ron Burgess served in the Army for 38 years. He spent most of his tenure working in top military intelligence and security assignments. He was director of the Defence Intelligence Agency from 2009 until July 2012. In the fall, he lamented in a speech in Alexander City, Alabama, that new U.S. military recruits will likely be fighting in the Middle East for years to come. He wished current policymakers well and said, "We can't just keep playing this same military version of whack-a-mole." ___ Mira Ricardel has served as acting assistant secretary of defence for international security policy during the George W. Bush administration from 2003 to 2005. She is a former vice-president of business development for Boeing Strategic Missile & Defence Systems, a company that receives a steady flow of contracts from the Defence Department and is a major player in the defence industry. ___ Retired Brig. Gen. Michael Meese is among the individuals leading the transition for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2005, he served as executive director of the secretary of the Army's transition team. He is also the chief operating officer for the American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association, a 136-year-old non-profit organization that assists the armed forces community with insurance, financial planning, survivor assistance and other benefits. ___ Mike Rogers is taking the lead on crafting Trump's national security team. The former Michigan congressman chaired the House intelligence committee. Rogers is a former U.S. Army officer and FBI special agent. He is a board member of IronNet Cybersecurity, a consultancy run by former NSA director Keith Alexander. STATE DEPARTMENT Jim Carafano is the Heritage Foundation's vice-president for foreign and defence policy studies and is tasked with transforming the State Department. A 25-year Army veteran, Carafano has been advising Trump on terrorism and border security. In a recent radio interview, Carafano said he told Trump that the next administration must pay more attention to transnational criminal cartels, work more closely with state and local governments to enforce border security, and fight al-Qaida globally. TREASURY DEPARTMENT David R. Malpass is the founder and president of Encima Global LLC, an economic research and consulting firm based in New York City. He served as deputy assistant treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan and deputy assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush. Malpass spent 15 years at Bear Stearns. In a 2007 Wall Street Journal editorial, published nine months before the collapse of his own firm, he wrote: "Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation. It's more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years." ___ Bill Walton is a senior fellow of the Center on Wealth, Poverty and Morality at the Discovery Institute and vice-president of the Council for National Policy. He is also chairman of Rush River Entertainment, which focuses on producing feature films. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT Kevin O'Connor served as U.S. attorney in Connecticut from 2002 to 2008, overseeing the office that secured a corruption guilty plea from ex-Gov. John Rowland. He served briefly as chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, a George W. Bush appointee who resigned from the Justice Department in 2007 amid a scandal over the firing of U.S. attorneys. After working as a partner at the Bracewell & Giuliani law firm, O'Connor is now managing director and general counsel for Point72 Asset Management, which manages the personal wealth of billionaire hedge fund executive Steven A. Cohen. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Myron Ebell is the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Sometimes called a climate "denier-in-chief," he has long had ties to the fossil fuel industry. Ebell has called for abolition of the EPA and wants to scrap the Paris climate treaty, a deal Trump has vowed to withdraw from. Labour DEPARTMENT J. Steven Hart is a former Justice Department special assistant in charge of processing federal judicial nominations under President Ronald Reagan. He is the chairman of Williams & Jensen, a tax and business lobby group in Washington. His biography says he was named one of Washington's top lobbyists by Washingtonian magazine and The Hill newspaper. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Andrew Bremberg is a policy adviser and a member of the counsel on nominations for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A former policy director for the Republican presidential campaign of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Bremberg has also served as a chief of staff at the Office of Public Health and Science, Department of Health and Human Services, according to his LinkedIn profile. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT Shirley Ybarra previously served as Virginia's transportation secretary from 1998 to 2002, and was a senior policy adviser at the U.S. Department of Transportation under the George H.W. Bush administration. She is best known for her advocacy of "public-private partnerships" to raise money for major transportation infrastructure projects and she is a proponent of toll roads. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT Ray Washburne is a longtime Republican fundraiser and former finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. Based in Dallas, Washburne runs a boutique investment firm that owns shopping centres and a chain of Mexican restaurants. Before backing Trump, Washburne was the finance chief for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign. INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCIES Paul Atkins is an avowed opponent of regulating Wall Street and served as Securities and Exchange commissioner from 2002 and 2008. During that period, he backed lifting restrictions on leverage taken by investment banks, a move that some blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Michael Korbey was a senior adviser to the Social Security Administration under the tenure of President George W. Bush. He helped spearhead a public campaign to rally support behind privatizing Social Security. Before that, he worked for the lobbyist group United Seniors Association. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT Williamson (Bill) Evers was an adviser to U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings in 2007 under President George W. Bush. A fellow at the Hoover institution, Evers is a strong critic of the standardized curriculum known as "common core," which he has described as "undemocratic." AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Michael Torrey is a top Washington agriculture lobbyist and founder of Michael Torrey Associates. He served for one year as deputy chief of staff at the Agriculture Department under the George W. Bush administration and as a deputy assistant secretary of congressional relations at the department for a year prior to that. ___ Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Jeff Horwitz and Michael Biesecker contributed to this report.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this Aug. 17, 2016, file photo, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump participates in a roundtable discussion on national security in his offices in Trump Tower in New York, with Ret.

Will then President Trump adhere to promises that he made during the campaign or will he take a more measured approach to appease a larger slice of the American populace? But it’s not just those within the United States that are a little on edge; some nations around the world are concerned about the power that President Trump will wield. One of Trump’s frequent targets on the campaign trail was China. He relentlessly assailed the country and its trade practices, often in very unflattering terms. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country and that’s what they’re doing. It’s the greatest theft in the history of the world,” said Trump in May. Trump even went so far as to say that China was manipulating its currency. When pressed to qualify his statement, he countered, “Frankly, as far as China's concerned, everyone knows that's true, and it gets the point across.” China’s state-run newspaper, the Global Times, has taken issue with Trump pledge to rein in China with respect to trade in an effort to revive the Unites States’ manufacturing business. In an editorial, the paper openly criticized the President-elect, stating that his currency manipulation accusations could mean that “China's reputation will be affected, and the trade atmosphere between China and the US will become more tense.” The proposed 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports is even greater than the 35 percent tariff that was enacted shortly after President Barack Obama first took office. That trade war didn’t last, however, after both countries found it mutually beneficial to call a truce. The paper goes on to state that China will be forced to cut off local sales of some of America’s hottest exports if these tariffs were to be enacted. In fact, China is willing to use the “nuclear option” with regards to trade. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus,” writes the paper. “US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” The Global Times doesn’t hold back, taking further swipes at the President-elect, stating that he is not “naive” and that as a “shrewd businessman” he should do what’s in the best interests of both countries. “If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired,” the paper continues. “The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences.” Those are some pretty harsh words for our incoming President, but perhaps we should take a wait and see approach on Trump’s trade policies. He has already walked back or at least tempered some of his campaign pledges, so this rant might be a bit premature.

Fuller The next helicopter in line for an Aurora Flight Sciences autonomy upgrade is the Bell Helicopter UH-1H Huey, the company said. The new Huey upgrade will include integration between the Autonomous Aerial Cargo Utility System (AACUS) program and its Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS). Demonstrations could be seen in the next year or two. Aurora demonstrated a manned Bell 206 performing an AACUS flight test Thursday in northern Virginia. The helicopter showed the perception and planning capabilities required for autonomous takeoff, transit and landing. Three piloted 206s were used previously to demonstrate TALOS, in addition to a Boeing H-6U Unmanned Little Bird. The Huey will be Aurora's third test platform frame. TALOS is being developed as a part of the Office of Naval Research’s AACUS program. However, Aurora is also researching commercial applications for TALOS.

During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a “tit-for-tat approach”, according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” the Global Times article read.

My clients are "coastal elites" and "international elites." Most of us did not vote for Donald Trump last week, and none of us expected that he would actually win. I believe that Trump probably didn't think he'd win. For me, Election Day afternoon progressed from comfortable certainty about Hillary Clinton's chances, to concern around dinnertime, to disbelief by 11 p.m., to shock and horror by midnight. I went to bed at 2 a.m., woke up at 4 a.m. and arrived at my office by 6 a.m. to address what I knew would be a cascade of distraught phone calls and emails from my clients. Gabriel Bouys | AFP | Getty Images Here were some comments: "David, if you can call earlier than 8 a.m. tomorrow, please do so. Need to discuss liquidating first thing in the morning." "In the event my holdings are still worth a few coins, I'd like to touch base with you." "Please sell everything now. I'd rather miss further upside now than risk selling after an event that points to the long-term disaster that this administration could turn out to be." In times of stress — for example, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and after the failure of Lehman Brothers — one of the most important things a financial advisor can do is get out in front of the clients with information. To that point, advisors need to convey a plan. Here's what we know; here's what we don't know; here's what we're trying to figure out. For example, the team at my advisory firm had a bulletin out to our clients within 30 minutes of the Boston Marathon bombing a few years ago. We were proactive this time around, as well. Our commentary "Confounding All Expectations, Donald J. Trump Elected U.S. President" hit our clients' inboxes by 8 a.m. on November 9. More from FA Playbook: 6 ways Trump will affect your wallet Potential market impact of a Trump White House How Trump's tax plans might affect your return We then began returning clients' phone calls. Though we expected the markets to fall by 5 percent, perhaps even as much as 10 percent at the open, our counsel was: "There's no point in selling into this morning's decline. Ultimately, the stock market only cares about corporate revenues and earnings and interest rates. Just because we received bad news today doesn't mean that McDonald's stops flipping burgers, Pfizer stops researching medicine, Boeing stops building aircraft. Corporations will adapt to the unexpected new environment because that's what managers are paid to do." Our clients responded to our commentary. Here are some examples: "There go the paintings, silver and furniture. Thanks for the note. Feel somewhat better." "Well stated, David. A great perspective. I hope all is well." "Thank you, David. I needed your perspective today. Hugs, H." "THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!!! It is one of the few things that have made me feel better (at least for me, if not the country)." "Hi David, thanks for the comments, very interesting. You can tell others that one of your clients says 'the market goes up and down. The best strategy seems to be to buy companies which have value and where managers have a longer term view of their job. Good luck!' And BTW, I am also among the devastated!" "Buy into the hysteria! — Dave, wherever possible, please take advantage of this buying opportunity." "Our early morning commentary and rapid return of phone calls enabled us to calm clients to the point where we could make good decisions on their behalf." Unexpectedly, stocks rallied for two days straight. For every disappointed investor among the 60,467,245 Americans who voted for Clinton, there was an exhilarated investor among the 60,071,650 Americans who voted for Trump. There was another factor: For the last two months, U.S. stocks traded in a 1 percent to 2 percent range while investors waited for Election Day. Post-election, sidelined cash suddenly came back into stocks. Certainly, there is reason for concern over the next few years. Trump's proposed tax cuts, implemented without adjustment, would cause the national debt to soar 75 percent in four years. To implement such cuts, Trump has to earn the votes of debt crusaders like Paul Ryan, so it's not a foregone conclusion.

Privacy Policy. As we often tell clients, "It's always something." For the moment, we talked most of our clients out of precipitous selling and satisfied one by raising $100,000 in cash. Over the next several months, we'll see how Trump's transition team proceeds, get a sense of the Republican legislative agenda in 2017 and then, only after preparing an informed strategy, will we start selling and buying among our companies. Our early morning commentary and rapid return of phone calls enabled us to calm clients to the point where we could make good decisions on their behalf. Any advisor who can't do this for his or her clients shouldn't be in the business. — By David Edwards, founder/president of Heron Financial Group Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change MCD --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft, Apple and Google Aim to Extend Touch Technologies to a World of new Devices and Applications | Main | Samsung Aggressively Gets into Apple's Face with Moves into AI and Telematics with Harman Acquisition » November 14, 2016 Chinese State Publication Warns President Elect Trump that any Tariffs on Chinese Goods Would be bad News for Apple   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Chinese Cyber Security Law goes into Effect in June 2017 that may Require Apple to surrender iOS Source Code." The report noted that "China has green-lit a sweeping and controversial law that may grant Beijing unprecedented access to foreign companies' technology and hamstring their operations in the world's second-largest economy." So unilaterally China appears to be threatening U.S. tech companies by such new legislation. With President Elect Trump wanting to push back against China's monetary manipulation and unfair trade practices, a Chinese state publication sent a message out to President-Elect Trump that they have the cards to hurt the U.S. in any trade war.   The fear mongering rhetoric has already kicked into high gear this morning in China as a State-backed newspaper decided to do a little saber rattling of their own towards President Elect-Trump. CNBC reports that the publication has clearly stated that "Apple iPhones and other U.S. goods could suffer sales hits in China if president-elect Donald Trump goes through with his 'naïve' plan of slapping a large import tariff on Chinese products." So it appears that China will use Apple as a bargaining chip in any negotiations with Trump.   During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a "tit-for-tat approach", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party.   "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read.   But the Chinese newspaper was not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it "merely campaign rhetoric" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports,   The report further noted that "If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," the Global Times said.   Lastly the CNBC report stated that "The opinion piece said Trump was a 'shrewd businessman' and would not be naïve, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

So who are they? Bannon’s appointment caused concern: his website has been charged with carrying racist, antisemitic and sexist stories and peddling conspiracy theories. He was also accused by his ex-wife of making antisemitic remarks, faced domestic violence charges that were dropped and was found to have been registered to vote in Florida at an empty house where he did not live, though he subsequently changed his registration. He and Priebus were said to be working as “equal partners”. Reince Priebus and Stephen Bannon to lead Trump’s White House Trump talks deportation, supreme court picks Trump made a number of policy suggestions in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, and also admitted that his promised wall on the border with Mexico will partially consist of fencing. He plans to deport as many as three million people, which seems at odds with statements made by House speaker Paul Ryan. Trump also said he wants to appoint supreme court justices who will send abortion rights “back to the states”, but said same-sex marriage was “done”.

Donald Trump’s immigration plans: start by deporting 3 million ‘criminals’ Facebook Twitter Pinterest 3 million ‘criminal’ immigrants to be deported, says Donald Trump Advocates worry for gun restrictions Advocates say they expect Congress to pass a federal right-to-carry law that would dismantle restrictions in states including New York, New Jersey, Maryland, California and Hawaii. Trump has endorsed a reciprocity law that would make concealed carry permits valid in all 50 states. Gun control groups call this “a threat to public safety”. Gun rights advocates say it would be a victory for civil rights. Local gun-carrying restrictions may be wiped out under Trump, advocates say Labor movement braces for three-front battle The labor movement fears that Trump, the Republican-controlled Congress and the supreme court will take steps to hobble unions, ranging from appointing a National Labor Relations Board that does business’s bidding to erasing an array of Obama administration regulations, including one making overtime pay available to millions more workers. Labor movement braces for three-front battle with Trump, Congress and courts Will Obama’s criminal justice reform progress survive? Barack Obama’s presidency has seen issues with the US criminal justice system gain national media attention and his administration has looked to address the problem.

By: FE Online | Updated: November 14, 2016 6:19 PM During his campaign for presidential elections, Donald Trump had continuously lashed out at China saying that Beijing will be punished with ‘defensive’ 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and officially declared a currency manipulator.(Reuters) China’s state-run newspaper has said that if ‘naive fool’ Donald Trump launches an all-out trade war against China, it would reply with counter-measures. During his campaign for presidential elections, Trump had continuously lashed out at China saying that Beijing will be punished with ‘defensive’ 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and officially declared a currency manipulator. President-elect Trump had then said,”When they see that they will stop the cheating. He accused China of doing ‘the greatest theft in the history of the world.’ An editorial came in a state-run newspaper right after Trump spoke to Chinese president Xi Jinping. Global Times, a State-run newspaper warned the US that it would be a grave mistake to take such measures. It said that such a move by a ‘shrewd businessman’, to change tariffs will be replied with a tit-for-tat approach. The newspaper wrote, “If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally, the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence.

Virgin Australia, which is challenging Qantas at every opportunity, was also a big winner in the awards, taking out Best Business Class and Best Cabin Crew. Virgin Australia’s Best Business Class win is a first for the airline and is a result of its new The Business suite, which is more First Class than Business Class. That suite is now available on all its A330s and international Boeing 777s. Business Class on Virgin Australia is more like First Class, says Airlineratings.com The Best Cabin Crew win is the third for the airline. AirlineRatings.com editors said the airline’s cabin crew "treat every passenger whether in row 1 or at the back of the aircraft as a special guest". Singapore Airlines, which is always in the winner’s circle, picked up Best Long Haul Airline (Asia/Pacific) and Best Economy. Scoot, Singapore Airlines’ low-cost subsidiary, won Best Low-Cost Airline Asia. Etihad Airways won Best First Class and Best Long Haul Carrier (Middle East/Africa), while Emirates won Best In-Flight Entertainment. Etihad's 787 Dreamliner. In the AirlineRatings.com global rankings, Air New Zealand was first, Qantas second, Singapore Airlines third, Cathay Pacific Airways fourth, Virgin Australia fifth and Etihad Airways seventh. To be named in the agency’s Top Ten, airlines must achieve a seven-star safety rating and demonstrate leadership in innovation for passenger comfort. AirlineRatings.com developed its unique seven-star ratings system after two years of evaluation and consultation with the industry’s governing body, the International Civil Aviation Organization. Singapore Airlines and its low-cost Scoot featured in the awards.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor OPINION: What’s the worst thing that could happen to NASA under Trump’s presidency? Jason Rhian November 13th, 2016 Donald Trump on the campaign trail. Photo Credit: Gage Skidmore A Trump presidency, often joked about and derided, is now a reality. With Donald Trump often described as the “ultimate outsider”, what should, or rather, what shouldn’t the president-elect do regarding space policy? While many analysts have laid out what the agency should expect from Trump, what the newly minted leader of the free world should avoid has not been discussed. Oddly enough, the greatest concern for NASA is that Trump might behave just as President Barack Obama did when he was elected into office eight years ago. Candidate Obama promised to support NASA’s efforts, claiming he was one of the agency’s biggest fans and even co-opted the space agency’s crewed program-of-record at that time (Constellation) when he used the phrase, “Moon, Mars and beyond.” Upon election, he worked to cancel that very program. In fact, had it not been for the actions of Congress, he would probably have set NASA’s efforts to send crews beyond the orbit of Earth back decades. NASA has seen numerous cuts to its budget under Obama’s regime. Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons Obama visited Kennedy Space Center in April of 2010 and skipped visiting Launch Complex 39, Space Launch Complex 37, and SLC-41. He skipped all of them and only visited SLC-40 – the launch site of SpaceX. These actions spoke volumes. However, given that NASA was placed dead last during his inaugural parade, even behind the “World Famous Lawn Rangers” and their brightly-colored lawnmowers, his true view of NASA has been rather obvious. As was noted on USA Today, experts blame Obama for the slowed pace of sending astronauts to Mars, with even Bill Nye criticizing Obama’s efforts. This was just for the 2017 NASA budget. In 2012, Space.com noted that NASA’s Planetary Sciences division was targeted to receive a rather heavy cut. As each year under his tenure has elapsed, those within the agency, both privately and publicly, have asked, “Why does he hate us so much?” While derided in some space circles as the “Senate Launch System” – for it was a design mandated by congress after the cancellation of Constellation – NASA’s Space Launch System will provide the agency with a super heavy-lift capability and a ticket to beyond-Earth orbit. Its first uncrewed flight is scheduled for late 2018. Oddly, Obama’s NASA programs of choice compliment the path NASA is aiming for – the path to Mars. Obama has shown interest in bolstering the agency’s initiative’s commercial efforts. However, if President Trump behaves as President Obama did, if Trump’s penchant for holding grudges drifts in NASA’s direction and he opts to return the favor, it could set a pattern into place that is unlikely to be broken. If every new president tries to undo what his predecessor has done, NASA will be rendered incapable of accomplishing anything. The agency is only just now seeing the vision of its two-tiered approach to crewed space flight take shape. Under that concept, NASA has empowered several private companies to produce spacecraft and launch systems to send crews to the International Space Station. These include Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner, which would be launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 422 rocket, and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft atop its Falcon 9 rocket. While these companies would handle the delivery of astronauts to the orbiting lab, another set has already begun ferrying cargo, crew supplies, and experiments to the ISS. SpaceX again is among these with the cargo variant of its Dragon spacecraft as well as the Falcon 9. SpaceX is joined by Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft and Antares launch vehicle in launching cargo. Soon, these companies will be joined by the cargo variant of Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Dream Chaser space plane. By all accounts, Trump’s administration will likely allow both the low-Earth orbit and beyond Earth orbit efforts NASA is currently working on to continue. However, long noted as a climate change skeptic, Trump will likely cut NASA’s Earth sciences initiatives. What remains may even be moved over to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an effort to streamline budgets. Much as we weren’t allowed to keep our doctors, Obama likely won’t get to keep the legacy he wanted. However, in terms of NASA, efforts to salvage something after Obama’s attempt to end NASA’s crewed exploration initiatives have helped forge an agency with a bright future. While Hillary Clinton’s supporters appear unwilling or unable to accept that she lost and having not gotten their way are throwing a national temper tantrum, attacking people, setting fires, and rioting – this is not the behavior of adults. Nor should it be the policy of a president. Accepting what has occurred and working with it is the sign of a rational, mature mentality. Obama should have modified Constellation and allowed NASA to continue on. He didn’t. He set a precedent that needs to be relegated, as was parts of the Constellation Program, to the trash heap of history. Trump now has to accept what has been done to NASA and show that he can behave better than Obama did. Using an Obama philosophy of cancelling whatever your predecessor has initiated would see a NASA which has its “goal-line” always set out of reach and that is a legacy NASA can do without.   Tagged: Barack Obama Commercial Crew Program Constellation Donald Trump NASA Space Launch System space policy The Range Jason Rhian Jason Rhian spent several years honing his skills with internships at NASA, the National Space Society and other organizations.

Related Reading Reader Comments Laurence Klein November 13, 2016 11:55 am In 2010, following the previous President’s cancellation the the Space Shuttle program, the President stated his plan for a heavy lift launch vehicle, a crew vehicle, and to send people into the solar system, rather than focus on a return to the Moon. Since then, the President’s proposed budget to Congress each year has included funding for the heavy lift vehicle, crew vehicle, their launch facility, as well as for commercial crew and cargo. Congress underfunded commercial crew for many years, while providing a small percentage increase over the President’s manned deep space budget. I think that we owe the President our gratitude for his consistent support of the U.S. manned space program. Reply Rodger Raubach November 13, 2016 2:58 pm NASA currently has too may irons in the fire to satisfy many internal constituencies. There needs be some program rationalization in order to accomplish anything other than spending taxpayer dollars. The SLS seems, at this juncture, a vehicle without a really well defined mission other than the asteroid retrieval project–which is viewed by many with a great deal of skepticism. NASA would best serve the long term goals of deep space exploration by eliminating the earth science program and allowing NOAA to take over that goal. The proposed Mars sample return mission should be melded into the manned missions to Mars, and perhaps a joint venture with SpaceX makes more sense than developing a similar and competitive booster system at a higher taxpayer cost? Maybe–just maybe–NASA could help underwrite one of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy launches to the Red Planet and begin developing a Nuclear Reactor which could be flown there for a non-solar power option for the projected Mars Base I. Development of a Mars-suitable space suit; advanced rover technology for human use? Lots to think about! Reply Nicholas November 14, 2016 6:01 am You couldn’t be more correct. In my opinion, after it was proven that the reusability is feasible, the SLS looks like a pile of money ready to be burnt at each launch without a really good reason, like a permanent base on the Moon or very elaborated missions to the Jovian and Saturnian Moons. Reply Alex November 14, 2016 2:21 am I disagree. I agree Obama should have not cancelled Constellation, but Trump should absolutely cancel SLS. Even when built, even if you don’t consider it WILL run behind schedule and be needing more money(NASA’s already admitted their Orion craft is behind schedule and searching for alternatives from SpaceX and others), the cost to operate the SLS rocket will be insane compared to what you can get out of the commercial sector. He should cancel SLS, and bypass NASA altogether for building rockets for the goernment right now, while mandating they purchase a fully assembled heavy lifter or rides from SpaceX or BO. NASA should NOT be working on building things that the commercial sector is more efficient at, cheaper, AND much newer tech and are already doing anyway. They should maintain an R&D department into researching future space travel technology, new engines, and methods for interstellar space travel. For our solar system, all the money from SLS should be funneled into SpaceX and Bue Origin for their heavy lift boosters. Reply Victor Brown November 14, 2016 3:45 am I should like to see more unmanned flights to the outer planets. There is much more to be learned about their environments. Maintain the manned program for Mars. Reply Peter November 14, 2016 9:38 am Lets just hope that President Trump provides NASA with more opportunities in future budget planning,,,and that he leaves politics out of future space planning… Reply Al Ready November 14, 2016 2:46 pm NASA isn’t building SLS or Orion, that’s Boeing & Lockheed Martin. Your statement NASA is building SLS/Orion is either a display of ignorance or a lie. Given Obama tried to cancel all of NASA’s crewed exploration initiatives? Maybe it’d serve you right if Trump cut funding to SpaceX. It makes no sense to send any more money to SpaceX until they can figure out how to launch something without it blowing up. Blue Origin has only shown it can reach sub orbit. Neither have launched a single human being anywhere (not even sub orbit). That is why NASA is working with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, these organizations have launched crews – yours haven’t. Your argument isn’t just factually-devoid, it’s selfish and stupid. While I get you’re a NewSpace fan boy and acting solely on your love of those companies, your argument is shallow and transparent. The article states both efforts, including the ones that fund “your” companies, should be maintained. That’s shows a heck of a lot more grace than your comment did. Rather than show your appreciation for and acknowledge that, you choose to continue with the behavior which has cost your side so much this year. Unwise. America has spoken and it said it’s had enough of such displays of arrogance. Until your companies launch somebody, anybody, somewhere without the rocket blowing itself up – you don’t get the big contracts. Understand? As of November 8th the shoe is on the other foot and you could find yourselves in the funding crosshairs. Maybe it’d help you understand how many of us felt when Obama tried to flush everything we’d been working on for years, if Trump cancelled “your” programs. Reply Rodger Raubach November 14, 2016 5:03 pm The re have been comments here and on other sites that the SLS will probably never accomplish the asteroid retrieval mission–which is pretty pointless anyway. So far, Orbital ATK and SpaceX have flown supply missions to ISS, whereas BO has done a number of suborbital demonstration flights. My understanding is–SpaceX gets paid for actual deliveries, and no R & D funding; ditto Orbital. SpaceX has had 2 explosions in something like 26 missions, and Orbital had one very spectacular failure. NASA itself lost 2 Space Shuttles, and the crew of Apollo I. The track records are all about what one would expect in this field of endeavor. My suggestion: cancel the SLS, which is horrendously expensive and see whether or not the Obama cancelled Ares I can be salvaged/resurrected n order to reclaim some of the money spent? That was powered by an Orbital ATK solid booster, I seem to recall? This whole start-stop system accomplishes nothing other than burn up lots of taxpayer dollars. The whole “cost plus” funding model is at the hear of things; pay only for performance at the completion and successful outcome of projects, or at stage achievement goals. And, neither SpaceX nor Orbital ATK have lost astronauts; NASA and the Shuttle HAVE> Reply Al Ready November 14, 2016 6:39 pm I agree with some of what you have to say, however, your comment that: “And, neither SpaceX nor Orbital ATK have lost astronauts; NASA and the Shuttle HAVE>” is transparent/disingenuous. It’s hard to lose someone when you’ve launched no one – sorry that argument is meaningless and kinda sad (Orbital ATK isn’t even involved on CCP – I don’t know what you were thinking by suggesting otherwise). From what I’m told, due to it being fueled after crew would board Dragon? Many astronauts consider SpaceX’s design to be a flying coffin and they’ve got two accidents in 14 months validating those fears. To that, two accidents in 14 months versus three accidents over the course of 36 YEARS. I understand, I really do, folks make inaccurate comparisons and ignore certain facts all the time and this was probably just a mistake on your part. However, you also downplay SpaceX’s own “spectacular failures.” Anyone who watches what happened to the Falcon 9 back on September 1 would have to do some impressive mental gymnastics to NOT call that spectacular and given that a Dragon spacecraft is currently serving as an artificial reef at the bottom of the Atlantic – ditto for the catastrophic CRS-7 mission. I fail to see the point of resurrecting Ares 1? Why just that rocket? Why not the Ares V as well? It seems you’re “path forward” is to merely funnel funds to only LEO operations – where we’ve been stuck since 1972. I want the agency to actually do something again. The only thing the continued NewSpace gravy train accomplishes is duplicating what we produced back in the 1960s. That doesn’t sound like much of a future to me and a great many others, sorry, we’ll take a pass on that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlj2BW8AtUQ Reply Rodger Raubach November 14, 2016 9:11 pm OK, I believe we are somewhat on the same page in many of these issues. I understand the concerns regarding the newSpace corporations haven’t yet built up the track record you would like to see. Before anyone rides to orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 v.1.2, there will be at least 2 more test flights in order to fly the Dragon manned capsule version and to test the abort system. There will also be several more Falcon 9 unmanned flights taking loads to the ISS and inserting comsats into GTOs. Other than SpaceX and Boeing, there isn’t any other option than reliance on the Russians. I too am pushing for getting out of LEO and doing something exciting. What NASA has contracted for thus far is a truck line making deliveries to the ISS, and nothing else. I’m a huge supporter of the Mars Direct or Mars Semi Direct models for further exploration. The NASA Mars Sample Return mission is about as complicated and convoluted as they can make it–just to support many of the internal groups who would otherwise be irrelevant. What NASA really lacks is a clearly defined mission; not some cockamamie asteroid retrieval, but either a return to the Moon, but better to Mars. I simply suggested resurrecting Ares I as a starting point and using a cheaper technology for the deep space probes instead of this massive SLS that will break the budget in a manner similar to how the ISS has monopolized the NASA budgets. Not really wanting to argue, but simply use this forum as a sounding board for some ideas. Reply Al Ready November 14, 2016 10:21 pm Totally agree we need to end our dependence on Russia. However, for me, this isn’t about “doing something exciting.” This is about the preservation of the human race. You nailed it, NASA has no clearly defined mission and it needs one. One that isn’t messed with by (as this article suggests) any new president coming in (as the big “O” did). Moon first, develop it as a staging area for Mars. I just don’t see how resurrecting Ares 1 will do anything. My take? Redevelop/rebudget SLS to make it more affordable. If you want to launch crew on a separate vehicle, maybe the Falcon Heavy (once SpaceX un”bleeps” itself). Not trying to argue either and I have to say, having someone willing to meet in the middle is rather refreshing! Thanks! Reply Rodger Raubach November 14, 2016 10:56 pm For me, doing something exciting is defined by doing science on a planetary surface, preferably Mars. By “doing science,” that means looking for life either past or present. I would not be doing the field science, were I to be on an expedition, but running a laboratory seeking out complex organic molecules which are either metabolic building blocks or evidence of life past. The Miller-Urey experiment indicated that amino acids are formed by UV irradiation and spark discharge in an atmosphere composed of Carbon Dioxide, Ammonia, and water. Miller’s experiments neglected to include hydrogen sulfide, otherwise even more than 16 amino acids could have formed. Looking for traces of amino acids carbohydrates, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and other bio indicators would be thrilling for me. There isn’t the excitement for me scientifically in a return to the Moon. My background is actually chemistry, but with a strong aerospace engineering foundation. Good conversation here, and thanks to you too. Reply Larry Klaes November 15, 2016 9:14 am Interesting that the National Geographic Channel’s new series on Mars focuses on SpaceX in the first episode and hardly mentions NASA, according to this piece from TPS: http://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/2016/1114-natgeos-new-mars-miniseries-begins-tonight.html Reply Karol November 15, 2016 11:47 am Excellent analysis and commentary Jason! Given the years that you have devoted to “speaking truth to power”, I’m sure that you realized that your unvarnished factual presentation would raise the usual firestorm, especially from disciples of “The Musksiaah”. Cancellation of the Vision for Space Exploration was a costly error. Hopefully the Trump administration will be given the oppoetunity to make NASA great again, and hopefully the “Bernie-Sanders-never-a-nickel-for-NASA,-haven’t-seen-the-social-program-I-didn’t-love” bunch will stop their whining and wimpering for the cancellation of the realistic AMERICAN human spaceflight program with SLS/Orion in favor of the MuskMyth. Cancellation of our SLS/Orion is about as likely as Lori Garver being appointed Chief Administrator of NASA.

Supporters leading the charge to build a 100th anniversary celebration park at Fort Jackson say they are lining up funding and in-kind service commitments with hopes for a dedication in June. The Gateway to the Army Association projects it will need $3 million or more to complete the 3-acre Fort Jackson Centennial Park, to be built at the site previously occupied by the old Post Headquarters. The park, announced this summer, has received about $50,000 in donations so far, association officials said, with promises of another $150,000 of in-kind donations. Supporters are preparing to ratchet up solicitations from local city and county governments, large corporations across the state and the public. The city of Columbia has already agreed to contribute $300,000. Founded in 1917, when the U.S. was gearing up for World War I, Fort Jackson has become the Army’s prime production center for basic training, turning out 50 percent of Army basic trainees along with 60 percent of the women who enter the Army annually. “What the community has done so far shows what a great community this is,” said Bryan Hilferty, a U.S. Army Central Command retired colonel and Gateway association board member. When completed, the park will stand as a permanent testament of the community’s support for the base, a key component in the consideration of base closures, Hilferty noted. Local governments are among the first major fundraising targets for the park project, base officials said. Association members plan to approach Richland and Lexington counties in their fundraising efforts, the town of Lexington, Forest Acres, Kershaw County and other local entities, according to retired Command Sgt. Maj. Marty Wells, who came up with the idea for a centennial park at the Fort. “We just felt that Columbia leading the way (as a public donor) would serve as a signal to the rest of the legislative bodies,” said Wells, who spearheads the park project. Corporate sponsors will also be key to the park’s success, Hilferty said. “We’re still asking large corporations such Boeing and BMW (for contributions), and military-related ones like Lockheed-Martin to help donate to this great project,” he said. More corporate sponsors are coming on board, including iHeartRadio, which has given the project more than $1 million in free publicity, Hilferty said, including seven on-air spots a day on each of its six local-area broadcast stations over a six-month period, and The State newspaper. Other corporate sponsors include USAA, and Wells Fargo and Allsouth banks, he said. The public can contribute by purchasing pavers, being sold for $200 each, Hilferty said, or by making donations directly at gatewaytothearmy.org. Contributions can be mailed to Gateway to the Army Association, 4611 Hardscrabble Road, Suite 172, Columbia, S.C. 29229. The association has also been working with the post to gain more convenient public access to the park once it is completed, Wells said. The site is in the early preparation stages for construction of the park, Hilferty said. Park architect Ron Clamp who designed the 9/11 memorial in Columbia, has visited the site with potential contractors, many of whom are also expected to provide work on an in-kind, or pro bono basis, or at the very least, at reduced rates, Hilferty said. The park will be built in three phases, which will help facilitate fundraising, Fort officials said. The park will include a Walkway of Heroes, an amphitheater overlooking a 20-foot granite Soldier’s Statue of male and female drill sergeants and gazebos, among other features. The Fort Jackson centennial year culminates next year with the Army Ball on June 10. Association officials are pushing for a park dedication of the first phase on June 3, Wells said, but completion of the park will depend upon fundraising.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out business Search Industries Small Business Money Farming World Better Business Nurture Change 2016 Opinion & Analysis Tools Donald Trump: Day one winners and losers piling up fast across the globe PHIL KUNTZ Last updated 09:53, November 10 2016 Al Jazeera From Mexico City, Mexicans tell Al Jazeera their views on Donald Trump winning the US presidential vote. Donald Trump's stunning victory is already creating winners and losers in markets and governments around the world, from miners in America's Appalachian Mountains heartened by his devotion to coal, to Mexican peso traders stunned by the selloff. READ MORE: * Live - Trump vs Clinton, the day after * President Donald Trump and New Zealand - can we all just get along? * Markets recover after nightmare on Wall Street Many changes will play out slowly. Others took little time to manifest. Here are some: JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS Donald Trump has vowed to reduce financial regulation, and banks are already benefiting. WINNERS Private prisons: Corrections Corp of America was up as much as 60 per cent in intraday trading and the GEO Group. climbed as much as 35 per cent on speculation that Trump will use existing private lockups to detain immigrants. Defence contractors: Trump pledged to bolster US defence spending. Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon posted the biggest share gains since the financial crisis.  "Defence gives investors a place to put their cash -- it's a safe haven," said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group. A restriction on Muslim immigration, however, would make Middle Eastern countries less likely to be customers of US companies, he said. Supplied Fresh life has been breathed into coal, an industry struggling with debt and a price slump. Coal: Trump's election breathed fresh life into an industry struggling with debt and the worst price slump in decades. Coal tycoon Robert Murray said in a statement that the election marked a "great day for America" and he looked forward to a national policy that puts all energy sources on a level playing field. Bonds of his company, Murray Energy, surged to their highest in 16 months. Oil and natural gas drillers: Remember 2008's "drill, baby, drill"? Trump, who's bullish on fracking, has pledged to roll back regulations and open more federal land to extraction industries. Pharma stocks: With Republicans retaining both houses of Congress and Trump in the White House, Democratic threats of price controls are no longer a concern. Investors made stocks such as Pfizer some of the biggest winners in early trading. MIKE BLAKE/REUTERS Lockheed Martin and other defence-related companies got a boost from Trump's win. China: After a campaign highlighted by trade threats from Trump, China's territorial ambitions have received a boost by his election. His ambivalence about military commitments to Japan and South Korea could embolden President Xi Jinping's ambitions in the East and South China Seas, sore topics in the region's knotty geopolitics. Ad Feedback Russian stocks: The benchmark Micex index surged the most in nine months on speculation that Trump - who's referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader - will lift sanctions imposed on companies after the takeover of Crimea. Bank stocks: Trump has vowed to reduce financial regulation, and banks are already benefiting. Bank of America gained the most since May. Steelmakers: US Steel and Nucor soared as Trump's promise to favour American manufacturers led investors to believe that domestic prices for the metal will increase. Nucor gained the most in more than seven years; US Steel climbed more than 20 per cent. Right-wing populists: France's National Front leader Marine Le Pen was one of the first European politicians to congratulate Trump after his victory. (Putin beat her to it.) Polls - if we can still believe them - show she'll be the winner in the first round of presidential voting in April. Geert Wilders, head of Netherlands's Freedom Party, has promised to hold a vote on exiting the European Union and close its borders to Muslims if he wins parliamentary elections in March. "Politics will never be the same," he tweeted after yesterday's result. LOSERS Mexican peso: The currency was headed to its biggest drop in more than two decades as angst swept across a country that was often the focus of Trump's harsh campaign rhetoric. For President Enrique Pena Nieto, the outcome was particularly painful. His popularity sank to record lows in August after he invited the Republican nominee to a meeting in Mexico City that turned into an embarrassing exchange of angry words. On Wednesday, Pena Nieto took to Twitter to say he's ready to work with Trump. Treasuries: They'd been expected to soar in an investor flight to safety, but instead they're falling amid speculation Republicans will ramp up spending to boost the economy. Renewable energy: Denmark-based Vestas Wind Systems, the world's biggest builder of wind turbines, fell as much as 13 per cent, while solar companies took a hammering. San Jose-based SunPower dropped by as much as 14 per cent. Mergers & Acquisitions: Trump has vowed to block AT&T's US$85.4 billion (NZ$116.2 billion) deal for Time Warner - the largest transaction announced this year - calling it "poison" to democracy. A survey by Intralinks Holdings before the election showed that 56 per cent of global deal-making executives said Trump would be bad for M&A. Gunmakers: Sturm Ruger & Co posted the biggest intraday decline in seven years as the Trump win eased concerns of weapons restrictions. Sales have surged, and any discussion of gun control by political leaders can cause shares of gunmakers to spike. Smith & Wesson fell in the biggest intraday drop since April. Aircraft deals: Trump's ascension raised doubts about the sales and leases of as many as 230 Boeing and Airbus jetliners to Iranian carriers. Renewed trade restrictions could unravel the transactions, valued at an estimated US$17.6b for Boeing and US$27b for Airbus, based on list prices. Petro Poroshenko: The Ukrainian president has relied on US political and financial support to help him battle Russian-backed separatists. Any warming of relations between the US and Putin would jeopardise that backing. Of particular concern is the US resolve to maintain sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea two years ago. The Baltic nations: Trump questioned the US commitment to NATO, putting Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and her counterparts in Latvia and Estonia on the hot seat. While Estonia meets NATO defence-spending requirements, the other two Baltic countries, which embraced the EU after breaking free from the Soviet Union, have plans to do likewise only in the coming years.   - With assistance from Julie Johnsson Helene Fouquet Jenny Surane Rebecca Penty Richard Clough Manuel Baigorri Eric Pfanner Patrick Donahue Ian Wishart Andrew Langley Celeste Perri and Kartikay Mehrotra trump-winners-losers  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next World story: US election: US stocks and global markets recover after Donald Trump victory Business Homepage Comments business headlines Fraught scenes at arms talk Quake cows will live How to spend $20b on defence Banks offer earthquake help Watering hole seeks name Why some jobs satisfy more Defence Force HQ 'uninhabitable' From dream home to caravan Winners at the Waverley A & P Show Working with top farmers a privilege How to help after the quake Burgen 'virgin' ruled OK Sky TV sues over rugby World milk price to stay up Retailers face shake up Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented Live: 7.5 New Zealand earthquake Earthquake: Slow process to freedom for stranded tourists in Kaikoura Second Wellington building cracks after magnitude 7.5 quake New storm heads for Wellington, snow warning for passes Earthquake: Damage to quake-hit Wellington building is getting 'incrementally worse' Weta 'IT geek' captures Wellington tsunami surge after earthquake rocks New Zealand Earthquake: More cows stranded on an outcrop of land after three saved A warning to expect the worst Earthquake: International flotilla and aircraft drafted in to help with humanitarian relief in Kaikoura Wellington: What you need to know - Wednesday Photos: Widespread damage after large earthquake hits NZ Earthquake: Slow process to freedom for stranded tourists in Kaikoura Earthquake: More cows stranded on an outcrop of land after three saved Earthquake: International flotilla and aircraft drafted in to help with humanitarian relief in Kaikoura New storm heads for Wellington, snow warning for passes Famous seal breeding ground destroyed by quake Don Henley announces New Zealand tour with singer Jewel Earthquake: Damage to quake-hit Wellington building is getting 'incrementally worse' Divers and volunteers band together to save stranded shellfish and sea life Defence Force headquarters closed, reportedly 'uninhabitable' special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | A-Z Directories | Online Advertising | Print Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Trade Me | Jobs | Property | Motors | Accommodation | Personals | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

Share story By Mike Rosenberg Seattle Times business reporter In Seattle’s feverish world of real estate, much of the focus on foreign investment has been centered on international buyers scooping up homes. But most of the foreign money is actually flowing into other parts of the market, from Amazon offices to new apartment towers. Historically seen as a second-tier city to foreign interests, Seattle and its suburbs are now being looked at much more closely by overseas developers and commercial real-estate investors, data and broker interviews show. And while Europe and Canada are still eyeing Seattle, the biggest increase seems to be coming from China and other Asian countries. Excluding houses, foreign investors have bought more than $4 billion worth of big-ticket buildings like offices, apartment and condo complexes, and warehouses in King County since 2015.

That’s more than triple the rate from earlier in the decade, according to the local Economic Development Council. And it’s more money than what foreign buyers spent on local homes during that span. Earlier this year, the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate named Seattle as the No. 5 city in the United States for foreign investment, up from eighth a year prior. But another change is that foreign interests aren’t just buying what local developers have already built. Some international companies are constructing projects themselves — and at least one developer from China even relocated here to set up his new home base locally. Among the biggest fish lured to the area is Vanke, China’s largest homebuilder, which earlier this year agreed to its first Seattle venture. Economic lure Saying it was enticed by the area’s growing economy, it plans to team up with a California developer to build a $200 million, 43-story apartment tower in the Denny Triangle. But smaller builders are attracted to the area, as well. Allen Zeng, a developer in China for seven years, recently moved to Bellevue with his family and began construction this fall on a 244-unit condo complex in the University District. “Ten years ago, Seattle (was) not too famous for Chinese. They just know San Francisco and Los Angeles,” Zeng said at his office in Bellevue. Now, “I believe that Chinese will like Seattle more and more.” Create World, another Chinese group, broke ground last year on a $65 million Bellevue apartment tower. It now plans a second high-rise, this time across from Pike Place Market, after paying $17.1 million for the land. “We’re on their radar screen,” Gordon Ahalt, senior director of the Cushman & Wakefield/Commerce brokerage in Seattle, said of foreign buyers. “We’re on everyone’s top hit list right now. I don’t see this as a short-term deal.” Of course, the election of Donald Trump as president could alter the real or perceived value of U.S. real estate for foreign investors, but local experts say it’s too soon to know what impact the election might have. Developers, brokers and commercial real-estate buyers say they’re attracted to the Seattle area for the same reason as foreign homebuyers: The Puget Sound region offers much cheaper land and building prices than places like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Vancouver, B.C., which have traditionally been more popular with foreign companies. Not all the projects have gone as planned: The most contentious was the $190 million, 41-story Potala Tower apartment project in Belltown, where local developer Lobsang Dargey was accused of diverting foreign investors’ money for his own personal use. Hundreds of individual investors from China, who put $83 million into the project in hopes of getting a green card through the federal EB-5 visa program, were in danger of losing their money and citizenship dreams. After a recent court settlement, the project in October resumed construction under new management — with even more foreign investment. Now, China’s Binjiang Tower Corp. and a Las Vegas firm are funneling $30 million into the tower as its new owners, with the foreign EB-5 investors still on board. That’s part of a broader trend: For years, many smaller foreign investors have used the controversial EB-5 program to spend more than $2 billion on Seattle projects, typically in chunks of $500,000 apiece. Big purchases Despite all the development activity, most foreign real-estate interests are still choosing to simply buy completed projects and keep them intact, holding onto the buildings as a pure investment. Local officials say that while Seattle has always been on the global map for well-heeled companies from abroad, the interest level has jumped up a notch lately. “I think we’re getting to the point, though we’re not quite there, that we have the same international reputation as a San Francisco or a Boston. We’re getting more visible,” said Don Wise, CEO of Seattle-based Metzler Real Estate and secretary of the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate. “There clearly is more offshore capital coming to Seattle.” The biggest recent purchase came last year, when Hong Kong-based Gow Capital Partners spent $711 million to buy Columbia Center, Seattle’s tallest building, in what is believed to be the third-largest real-estate deal in the region’s history. Then this summer came a pair of big-ticket deals: South Korea’s Mirae Asset Global Investment spent $247 million on an Amazon office building in South Lake Union. And downtown’s Safeco Plaza — known as “the box the Space Needle came in” — sold for $387 million to a partnership between Germany’s GLL Real Estate and South Korea’s Vestas Investment Management. And in October, the Chinese conglomerate HNA bought 10 local Oki golf courses for $137 million. “On the map” Suzanne Dale Estey, president and CEO of the local economic-development council, cited the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks and Costco as putting the region on the map internationally. “We have these brands that are world-renowned,” Dale Estey said. Of course, most of the attention on foreign investment in local real estate has been on the housing market, because of its perceived effect on housing prices. With commercial properties, it’s also unclear how big a role foreign buyers have played in rising prices for things like apartment and office rents. It’s still somewhat a mystery who some of these foreign investors are. Often they don’t have local websites or publicly listed contacts, and several companies contacted directly or through intermediaries did not respond to requests for comment. One foreign developer who agreed to a sit-down interview was Zeng, head of Bellevue’s ZQH Investments. Manageable size He cited the stable, growing local economy as his prime reason for focusing here, and said another advantage Seattle has over other international hot spots is its relatively small size, making it easier for him to get to know the area and its key players. “I feel it’s a little difficult to find a way to business (in bigger cities). In Seattle, it’s a little simpler,” he said. “I feel comfortable working here.” But the region’s biggest selling point is its (relatively) low prices compared with California, Vancouver, B.C., and New York. “Seattle (has) less risk for me,” Zeng said. He said it’s still much more complex to build here than in China, where projects tend to spring up more quickly. In a statement, Vanke’s U.S. division called Seattle one of the country’s top-performing markets (it has previously invested in other American cities). The company said it was impressed with the region’s diversified economic base, tech-job growth, relative affordability and “quality of life that attracts a talented workforce.” How long will the frenzy last? There are some signs the activity is dwindling — the investment dollar amount locally has dropped so far in 2016 compared with last year. Dale Estey said she’s heard most experts saying that, in baseball terms, the region is in the seventh inning of the cycle’s upswing. Skip Whitney, head of China Services in San Francisco for the Kidder Mathews brokerage firm, thinks Seattle will remain near the top of the list of most sought-after cities for foreign capital even after the current real-estate uptick wanes. “I think it’s the beginning that will continue indefinitely,” Whitney said.

The first one leaves just after midnight and the last one leaves just before. So there are trains going through the day to cover the 524 km distance. There is an airport in Ahmedabad from where there are about 10 daily flights to Mumbai. Ahmedabad and Mumbai are part of the Golden Quadrilateral highway network with six lane expressways on which travel by road is as fast as travel by train. It is possibly the best connected route in India. I am writing this because prime minister Narendra Modi is in Japan, where he finalised a deal for a bullet train with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. The train will run from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and design work will begin in a few days. The project will cost around Rs 1 lakh crore. The cost is officially said to be Rs 97,636 crore, but reports said a Rs 10,000 crore additional cost may be incurred. Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe. PTI To put the figure in perspective, we should know that it is three times the size of India's health budget. India is a country where 38 percent of all children are malnourished and stunted at the age of two. This means they will have less physical and intellectual capacity than healthy children and they will never be able to lead a fulfilling life. The bullet train will cost more than we spend annually on the education budget of India. Again, we have some of the lowest literacy rates in the world. And we have a very poor quality of literacy, about which I have written before. The other aspect is that even within the transport industry, our investment does not seem to be made with any sort of attention to the poor and those most in need. In 2005, the BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh shut down the state transport bus system. The reason was that the buses did not make a profit — but how are the poor expected to travel? Of course this profitability is not expected of the bullet train and other projects because, like the giant statues of Vallabhbhai Patel and Chhatrapati Shivaji coming up in Ahmedabad and Mumbai, these are projects that will add to national pride. One justification for the bullet train is that it will also service two other Gujarati cities on the route — Vadodara, which is 110 km from Ahmedabad and Surat, which is another 120 km down the road. Vadodara also has many flights to Mumbai. I used to regularly visit my parents in Surat because there was a single flight from Bangalore, but now I cannot because there is no flight. On 6 November, 2014, a SpiceJet Boeing had an accident at Surat airport. A report said the plane "hit a buffalo that had strayed on to the runway because of a hole in the airport’s boundary wall. The engine of the Boeing 737 aircraft was severely damaged by the hit and the plane stopped. The buffalo was killed". The report added that the "civil aviation ministry has ordered two inquiries, by the director general of civil aviation and the Airports Authority of India. A perimeter security review of airports across the country has been ordered" and "minister Ashok Gajapati Raju held a 2-hour meeting this morning and ordered, sources say, that all airports should be secured by a concrete boundary, not fencing or brick walls". The government seems to be keen on spending money for the transport of the rich, on the assumption that this will grow the economy and ultimately benefit the nation. If so, it will help to have a functional and safe airport in Surat that connects it to the rest of the world, rather than a bullet train taking one only to and from Mumbai. This buffalo episode highlights the inability of India to secure and sanitise spaces. That additional cost of Rs 10,000 crore referred to earlier is for an elevated corridor, meaning the bullet train will run high above the chaos of India. It will be a vanity project, sucking money that could be used for health and education. And of absolutely no use to the vast majority of Indians. It will be of no particular use even to those living in and between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, already the best connected part of India.

The carrier is also facing a slump in business in key markets including mainland China due to a crackdown on “zero dollar” tours, THAI president Charamporn Jotikasthira said. “The airline is now operating with very low yield because of tough competition in the global market. Meanwhile, the average cabin factor for the entire year should be 75 per cent, lower than the target of 80 per cent,” he told the media on Friday. Charamporn said the company was continuing with the second phrase of its rehabilitation plan especially for sales and fare management, as these strategies were reliant on the airline’s network expansion and route management as well as its overall future strengthening plans.  The news follows moves by major airlines in the Middle East to cut airfares to lure passengers while some airlines operating between Thailand and China have suspended operations due to little demand after Thai authorities cracked down on illegal tour operators and related businesses over last few months. The Chinese market contributes 6 per cent of THAI’s total revenue but the market dropped 25 per cent over the last few months. As of Friday, the airline’s average cabin factor was 73 per cent. However, there is potential to attract healthy numbers of free individual travellers from China and better penetrate substitute markets Australia and Europe. Due to many negative factors, Charamporn said the national carrier has high risks and will not reach this year’s revenue projection at Bt180 billion. THAI and its subsidiaries’ financial performances for the third quarter had an combined operating loss of Bt836 million, Bt3.4 billion better than the same period last year, or an 80.3 per cent improvement. The main reason for that was fuel expenses decreasing Bt5.5 billion (33.6 per cent) due to the price of jet fuel dropping 15.3 per cent and better fuel-risk management. Non-fuel operating expenses increased by 6.7 per cent due to more traffic production, maintenance and overhaul expenses as a result of a higher engine maintenance rate and an increase in the number of repaired-engine spare parts compared to the same period last year. The decreased fuel surcharge was the result of a reduction in passengers and excess baggage revenue of Bt919 million (2.5 per cent). Freight and mail revenue, however, increased Bt189 million (4.3 per cent) and all business units had more revenue than the same period last year. Transformation plan in place The company continues to operate under a transformation plan which resulted in a Bt4.5 billion operating profit for the first nine months in 2016. It posted a Bt4.5 billion loss in the same period last year. Charamporn said the company’s board of directors approved a plan to spend Bt6.1 billion to upgrade 15 old aircraft next year in order to improve onboard products and service to meet passenger demands. THAI will spend Bt2.8 billion to upgrade six of its Boeing 777-200 ER and Bt1.3 billion to upgrade six Boeing 787-8, while nearly Bt2 billion has been earmarked for its Airbus A330-300s. All the planes will have new seats installed and will be equipped with WiFi. During the third quarter, THAI took delivery of an Airbus A350-900XWB on August 29 and decommissioned a leased Boeing 777-200 operating lease aircraft, resulting in it operating 94 active aircraft – one fewer than on September 30, 2015.  Its aircraft utilisation increased from 10.8 hours last year to 11.6 hours this year with 5.50 million passengers carried, representing a 7.6 per cent increase. Next year, seven aircraft – two Boeing 787-9s and five Airbus A350s – will be delivered, resulting in more flights to Australia. The airline plans to sell 19 aircraft next year. By final quarter, THAI should finish a feasibility study on a new aircraft-maintenance centre. THAI will most likely develop the centre with aviation alliances.    Tags Thai Airways International revenue target slump in business “zero dollar” tours THAI president Charamporn Jotikasthira Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Thousands queue as Culture Ministry distributes free books commemorati...

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases United Airlines Further Improves Airport Security Experience with the Opening of Automated Screening Lanes at Chicago O’Hare “As the first and only U.S.-based airline to launch automated screening lanes in multiple airports, United continues its commitment to using the latest technology to meet the changing needs of our customers and improve the airport experience,” said Greg Hart, United’s executive vice president and chief operations officer. “We are very appreciative of the ongoing collaboration between TSA and our industry partners such as United,” said TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger. “Working together in our efforts to deploy effective, state-of-the-art technologies such as these automated lanes in Terminal 1 at O’Hare furthers TSA’s ability to fulfill its security mission while also enhancing the travel experience.” “Establishing these automated screening lanes at TSA checkpoints is an important part of sustaining the success we achieved since last spring,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “We’ve gone from an unacceptable 104 minute wait time at peak hours at O’Hare to some of the shortest in the country among major airports. With the will, and the right technology, we will continue this progress. And I want to thank United Airlines for opening the latest automated screening lanes here at O’Hare.” The opening of the newly redesigned security checkpoint and three automated screening lanes at O’Hare marks the latest step in United’s ongoing strategy to use the latest technology to ensure customers have a reliable experience during their travels. Last month, the airline launched automated screening lanes at its hub in Los Angeles and expects to open automated lanes at Newark Liberty International Airport, the airline’s premier Trans-Atlantic gateway, before Thanksgiving. When United, in collaboration with the TSA, completes the installation, the newly centralized security checkpoint at Terminal C in Newark Liberty will feature 17 automated lanes. In addition to installing automated screening lanes, United is building and redesigning checkpoints at several hubs throughout the airline’s network that will dramatically improve the customer experience. Key initiatives include: Installing audio and visual enhancements utilizing cutting-edge technology in the security queuing area to provide customers with more information. Consolidating four checkpoints into one new, centralized checkpoint at Newark Liberty. Redesigning security checkpoints at Chicago O’Hare. Constructing a new, state-of-the-art customer check-in area and a consolidated security screening checkpoint in Terminal 7 at Los Angeles International Airport. About United United Airlines and United Express operate more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents. In 2015, United and United Express operated more than 1.5 million flights carrying more than 140 million customers. United is proud to have the world’s most comprehensive route network, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
