Follow Hot Topics: Sean Spicer Syria Surveillance Media and the Left Create Laughably Wrong MOAB Cost Calamity By Tom Blumer | April 16, 2017 | 5:47 PM EDT Share it Tweet it 0 shares Shortly after the U.S. military dropped a MOAB (Mother Of All Bombs) on an ISIS tunnel complex in Nangahar Province in Afghanistan, the media began citing the alleged costs involved. The exaggerations, some by a factor of over 1,000, even after considering all of the mission's likely direct costs, were laughably wild, and resulted from a combination of sloppy thinking and ignorant reporting. <<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>> DONATE The original Thursday coverage at the New York Times by reporters Helene Cooper and Mujib Mashal made it appear to the casual reader as if their quoted costs came from the military (bolds are mine throughout this post): Thursday’s strike in Afghanistan — using a 20,000-pound bomb that cost $16 million, and more than $300 million to develop — hit a tunnel complex in the Achin district of Nangarhar Province, according to a statement from the United States military in Afghanistan. To the surprise of no one familiar with the Old Gray Lady's slippery ways, the U.S. military's statement on the strike did not cite any cost figure. Other establishment press outlets initially ran with single-bomb cost figures north of $300 million, leading to a Twitterstorm of complaints about how that money could have been better spent here at home. Examples: "Trump just blew up a 314 million #MOAB in #Afghanistan while gutting social programs like any red blooded sociopath would." (from a Florida University professor) "The Moab bomb cost $ 314 million. They could have been alternatively allocated to research, healthcare or education." "The bomb Trump just dropped on Afghanistan cost $314 million. Enough money to fix the water crisis in Flint almost three times over." The walkback began when several people noticed a 2011 Los Angeles Times article discussing the delivery of 20 heavy-duty bombs: Boeing delivers first batch of 30,000-pound bombs to Air Force Aerospace giant Boeing Co. has delivered the first batch of 30,000-pound bombs, each nearly five tons heavier than anything else in the military's arsenal, to the U.S. Air Force to pulverize underground enemy hide-outs. At a total cost of about $314 million, the military has developed and ordered 20 of the GPS-guided bombs, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators. As a result, many outlets "corrected" their stories to reflect a unit cost of $16 million. But the bombs discussed in the story's early paragraphs weren't MOABs, as a later paragraph in that same story indicated: The weapon's explosive power is 10 times greater than its bunker-buster predecessor, the BLU-109. And it is nearly five tons heavier than the 22,600-pound GBU-43 MOAB surface bomb, sometimes called the "mother of all bombs." Surprise. A "Massive Ordinance Penetrator," designed to be a bunker-buster exploding on impact, is not the same as the MOAB, which explodes above the ground. So what is the real cost of the MOAB? According to a report carried at Business Insider, based on a discussion with an Air Force official, it's — well, just read on: The US's Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb does not cost $314 million, or $16 million, but $170,000 a unit, the US Air Force told Business Insider on Friday. The weapon, whose acronym inspired the nickname "Mother of All Bombs," was produced by the Air Force, not by a third party like Lockheed or Boeing, "so we don't have a standard procurement cost associated with them," an Air Force official said. The $170,000 figure makes sense considering a general-purpose 1,000-pound MK-83 costs about $12,000. The MOAB simply features more high explosives and larger fins to direct the GPS-guided munition. Many outlets, including The New York Times and Business Insider, inaccurately stated the cost of the MOAB as being in the millions. Business Insider's article has since been corrected to reflect this information. By contrast, the claims at the New York Times that the MOAB itself cost $16 million and that development costs were "more than $300 million" had not been corrected as of 4 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday. It should be obvious that the actual $170,000 cost wouldn't make anything resembling a dent in the federal government's multibillion-dollar social programs, or its research, healthcare, or education the leftist tweeters above cited. It would only fund 0.08 percent of the year-ago estimated $216 million cost of fixing Flint, Michigan's water system. But what about that $300 million in development costs? Assuming that the figure is even valid — I could not find any evidence that it is — shouldn't those costs be included? Absolutely not. The video seen at the Times story reveals something quite important that "strangely" (no, not really) didn't make it into the Cooper's and Mashal's print story: The Air Force developed the MOAB in 2002 and 2003 as part of the Iraq War's shock-and-awe strategy. It produced 14 of these bombs, two of which were shipped to the Persian Gulf. But by the time they arrived, officials decided they no longer needed to deploy such massive force. So if $300 million was really spent to develop the MOAB — separate from the cost of the materials, labor, factory overhead and explosives involved in production — it took place 14-15 years ago. Deciding not to use the MOAB last week wouldn't have gotten any of that money back to spend in other areas. Beyond that, the fact that the MOAB was developed as part of shock-and-awe would seem to indicate that the $300 million (again, if that's even a valid number) was spread over several weapons development efforts. If so, it would be incorrect to assign the entire cost to MOAB. There were other marginal costs involved in the mission beyond the $170,000 the Air Force cited, but they would seem to be small. The troops are already deployed, so there would be no additional personnel, infrastructure or logistics costs, leaving only the fuel it took to conduct the mission and the wear and tear on the plane involved (or planes/jets, if the cargo plane with the MOAB had an escort). Increasing the Air Force's cited cost to $300,000 for these factors would seem to be a stretch. But if we use that figure, it means that the press initially overstated the attack's total cost, first by a factor of over 1,000 (over $300 million divided by $300,000). Then in many (but not all) cases, it "corrected" the overstatement to over 50 times actual ($16 million divided by $300,000). Finally some (but far from all) outlets are coming around to the Air Force's figure — or doing their level best to pretend they never reported a cost figure in the first place. As to the New York Times, its errors stand uncorrected. In light of embarrassments like this, it would be nice if we could once and for all be spared all of the tired lectures about "fake news." It won't happen. Cross-posted at BizzyBlog.com.

David Lauderdale dlauderdale@islandpacket.com 1 of 4 Homepage April 16, 2017 6:52 PM Year of South Carolina at RBC Heritage By David Lauderdale dlauderdale@islandpacket.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story It was the year of South Carolina at the 2017 RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing. We should have known it the minute state Secretary of Agriculture Hugh Weathers sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” a cappella at the opening ceremony. We knew it for sure when 27-year-old PGA Tour rookie Wesley Bryan — telling CBS Sports anchor Jim Nantz that Easter Sunday should not be about him but about God — became the first native of South Carolina to win the Heritage. When it all started on Monday, tournament chairman Doug Smith of Spartanburg started mentioning all its connections to his hometown, including the wife of the secretary of agriculture who is from Gramling, and the Rev. John Wall of Hilton Head Island, who delivered the invocation, calling on his education at Wofford College in Spartanburg. The point was made with bagpipers from The Citadel in Charleston, PGA Tour players cruising in courtesy BMW’s made in Greer, and presenting sponsor Boeing flying a 787 Dreamliner assembled in North Charleston down the 18th fairway at the Harbour Town Golf Links on Saturday afternoon. And what could be more South Carolina than the tournament attracting people waving Confederate flags at Sea Pines Circle to push their cause? Or the small plane flying over the 18th fairway, even as a monstrous Boeing 787-9 was due to arrive, pulling a sign saying, “Fix The Damn Roads.” On Sunday, South Carolina boys Kevin Kisner of Aiken and William McGirt of, yes, Spartanburg, were riding high on the leader board. And former Clemson University golfer Sam Saunders set the fuse for a cannon blast at the opening ceremony to honor his late grandfather, Arnold Palmer, who won the first Heritage and gave it instant cache. This is not a little old island tournament. That was the message of Doug Smith, former speaker pro tem of the state House of Representatives, as we chatted in the shade Sunday afternoon as the players’ fight for the plaid jacket started to sizzle. He said perfect weather played a big role in what he thinks will be a year of record ticket sales, especially walk-up sales. And he said South Carolina is lucky to have the Heritage, as well as the Darlington 500 NASCAR race, and every citizen and business in the state needs to realize that and throw a lot more support their way. At the same time, he said, Hilton Head needs to be more open to others statewide who can help the Heritage. “This was a year we like to have,” he said, “and we’ve been needing one like this.” For the home folks, it was a year for little Morgan Mattson, 4, to practice his golf swing with a stick as the last groups came through the 16th hole. It was a year for Briana Wynn to come home to help her parents, Greg and Terry Wynn, recover from Hurricane Matthew. Thirty-one years ago, Eric Horan took a picture of her as an infant at the Heritage. It was a year that I could tease Hilton Head native Thomas C. Barnwell Jr. that the marshal on the 15th fairway was the first person to ever get him to be quiet. So he whispered: “I remember making 50 cents an hour working for (Heritage founder) Charles Fraser, and now I come out and buy a pass and enjoy what people from all over the world came to enjoy. “But we still have problems. People need housing.” It was the year that longtime volunteer Norm Reeves, at 100, held up a “Quiet” sign from his seat by the 13th green on Saturday. It was the year that George Evans retired from the Sea Pines Security, so we didn’t get to see the bearded man in 1,000 pounds of Scottish regalia wave us through. Sue Haupt did a fine job in her tartan outfit that looked a lot more comfortable. It was the year that the Charter One Realty served more than 3,000 Moon Pie minis to clients dropping by its hospitality villa on the first fairway. And veteran Realtor James Wedgeworth said the Heritage still does what it was created out of whole, almost tartan, cloth to do in 1969. It sells real estate. It was something that all of South Carolina could proudly hail.

(Liz Martin/The Gazette) By Alwyn Scott, Reuters Apr 13, 2017 at 4:29 pm | Print View SEATTLE — Rockwell Collins Inc will try to sell more aircraft seats and interiors directly to plane makers, rather than airlines, now that it has acquired interiors maker B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said on Thursday. “This is an area where I think we can do more standard equipment with the OEMs,” he said in an interview, referring to plane makers such as Boeing and Airbus. “I think we can do more with Boeing as they look at what part of the interiors they want to standardize,” he added. Rockwell, an aircraft component maker, on Thursday said it closed on its $8.6 billion acquisition of B/E Aerospace, giving it exposure to that market. Boeing last year chose privately held LIFT by EnCore as exclusive supplier of standard seats for the 737 aircraft, including the 737 MAX, which had a first flight on Thursday. Airlines typically are responsible for buying seats, but delays in seat delivery by some suppliers prompted Boeing to begin buying directly to ensure that seats would arrive at its factories on time for installation. “I certainly have intentions of putting some offers in front of all of our OEMs on how we could do more standard equipment for them,” Ortberg said. Ortberg also said Rockwell’s revenue could take a hit from delay of a Delta Air Lines order for Airbus twin-aisle aircraft but that he does not think demand for big planes is weakening more than expected. “If they move those airplanes to the right, then the revenues for the avionics and the interiors that go with those airplanes are going to move to the right,” Ortberg said, referring to the potential delay of delivery of the widebody planes. Delta said on Wednesday it was reviewing widebody orders with plane makers. “We continue to see excess capacity in widebodies,” Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on a post-earnings conference call. Ortberg said he expects demand for large planes to improve after 2020, when Boeing’s twin-aisle 777X enters service. Sales of large jetliners slowed sharply in recent years.

The agreement also includes options for 32 additional aircraft, as well as money for long-lead parts for future orders.  After exercising all options, the total contract value will be $6.8 billion. “The P-8A is a textbook example of Boeing’s commercial derivative expertise,” said Jamie Burgess, vice president of Boeing Military Aircraft’s Mobility, Surveillance & Engagement division and the P-8 program manager. “Every day our customers get to fly incredible aircraft that perform exceptionally well and are built by the best of Boeing.” The Navy will receive 11 aircraft, while Australia will expand its P-8A fleet with four more. The U.K.’s first two P-8A jets are part of the agreement, with first delivery set for 2019. Boeing so far has delivered 53 Poseidons to the Navy and two to the Royal Australian Air Force. Based on Boeing’s Next-Generation 737-800 commercial airplane, the P-8A offers advanced anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The U.S. Navy has deployed multiple squadrons around the globe since operations began in 2013, accumulating more than 96,000 flight hours to date.

China does it with a famous (and famously expensive) high-speed train network. Last week, Boeing and JetBlue Airways invested in another idea: electric planes. If their bet pans out, travelers could start making their first trips in the Teslas of the air in a decade. That could transform the way great swathes of the world get from point A to point B -- to everyone’s benefit. Electric planes aren’t a new idea, of course; evangelists have promised their imminent arrival for decades now. But recent advances, particularly in batteries and electric propulsion, make the possibility far more realistic. Boeing and JetBlue were confident enough in the technology to back Zunum Aero, a Washington-based startup that hopes to complete a battery-powered jet by 2020. The need is very real. In theory, by virtually eliminating fuel costs, electric planes would make currently unprofitable routes viable. According to the US Federal Aviation Administration, roughly 70 percent of US commercial passenger air traffic passes through just 30 airports. This hub-and-spoke system leaves the commuters who use small, regional airports stranded. Airfares at these smaller airports tend to be significantly higher and, in many cases, subsidized by the government. (The Trump administration wants to end those subsidies.) Rather than flying, Americans thus take slow-moving cars for more than half of all trips under 1,200 kilometers (or drive long distances to cheaper, busier airports) in order to save money. That’s not only inefficient, it’s also terrible for the environment: Cars generally burn more fuel per passenger than planes. Big developing countries such as India and China are only now beginning to develop long-distance car cultures. If they follow the US model, at far greater scale, both their already smoggy skies and their ambitious emissions targets will suffer. Electric jets could help them accelerate the process of building aviation links to less-developed rural areas. In effect, such planes could become the high-speed, low-carbon competition for long car rides, expensive commuter rails and trans-city buses. Until quite recently, electric-powered flight seemed like a stunt more than a pathway to the transportation future. Solar-powered aircraft, for example, are great at raising awareness, but not at moving people around, much less in comfort. Yet advances in lightweight materials, electric motors and, most importantly, batteries have opened up new possibilities. In 2011, a battery-powered, two-seater aircraft built by the University of Stuttgart flew 100 kilometers on 25 kilowatt-hours of electricity that cost around $3. Three years later, Airbus SE followed with the E-Fan, an all-electric, lithium-battery-powered two-seater. Like automakers, plane manufacturers are focusing now on hybrid technologies that could extend the range of electric planes and be implemented more quickly. Citing recent advances in electric-propulsion technologies, for instance, Airbus announced last week that it was dropping plans to produce the E-Fan in favor of a hybrid-electric regional jet that could fly within the next three years. NASA, too, is pursuing a 60- to 90-seat hybrid jet, working closely with Hyannis-based Cape Air, the largest private regional airline in the US. NASA scientists took baseline flight and fuel-economy data on an Italian commuter plane the airline was considering, and are in the process of retrofitting it into an electric plane with new wings and engines. NASA estimates that the electrical upgrade should trim operational costs by 30 percent and result in zero in-flight carbon emissions. Tests should commence this year. With their investments in 4-year-old Zunum Aero, Boeing and JetBlue are looking to a hybrid future that extends the range of electric aircraft to over 1,100 kilometers. Zunum is planning 10- and 50-seat planes that are 40 to 80 percent cheaper to operate than conventional counterparts. That’s not all: Its technology map also includes the possibility of 100-seat airliner that would debut in the 2030s. For now, the biggest roadblock remains battery technology. Recent advances are due in large part to batteries becoming lighter and more efficient. If Zunum and other electric-plane companies are to realize their sci-fi dreams, they’ll need today’s capacities to double over the next few years. That’s not entirely crazy: Battery energy density has improved by around 8 percent annually for the last 30 years, and massive investments by Tesla and other technology companies should help the improvements keep coming. Don’t be surprised if one day soon, your next plane turns out to be a plug-in. By Adam Minter Adam Minter is a Bloomberg View columnist. -- Ed.

Passengers’ hand luggage in the overhead bins? Of course. But there may be flight and cabin crew slumbering away right on top of you too. The 787 can fly huge distances – Aussie carrier Qantas begins a direct 17hr, 9,061-mile London to Perth service in 2018. And on these longer trips, the crew are required to take rest breaks.

"Silk Way’s success and profitability is a direct result of investing in its fleet and services and growing its regional and international footprint," said Zaur Akhundov, president, Silk Way Group of Companies. "I am confident we will maintain our rate of growth, supported by 10 new Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplanes."

"We value our partnership with Silk Way and are grateful for their enduring confidence in the Boeing products." Azerbaijan-based Silk Way Group includes 23 companies working in the aviation industry and related services including passenger and cargo airlines.

The name evokes an image of a little fighter jet taking on America’s giant Boeing B-52 bomber. But actually, the name “Boeing Killer” refers to a rather dubious accomplishment of the Su-15: shooting down two Boeing civilian airliners, including Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983. It’s the title of the 2015 book Sukhoi Su-15: The Boeing Killer by Yefim Gordon, perhaps the most prolific historian of Soviet military aircraft. The Su-15, NATO code name “Flagon,” began life in the early 1960s, when the Sukhoi design bureau was in trouble. The engines of its single-engine Su-9 “Fishpot” and Su-11 “Fishpot-C” air-defense interceptors had proven unreliable. The Soviet air defense command (PVO) wanted twin-engined interceptors such as the Yakovlev-28 “Firebar"and Tupolev-128 “Fiddler,” which were thought to be more reliable. At the same time, the United States was deploying the high-altitude B-52 Stratofortress and the (never-built) Mach 3 B-70 Valkyrie. Sukhoi proposed a twin-engined Mach-2 interceptor armed with better radar and two AA-3 “Anab” air-to-air guided missiles. Like many Soviet interceptors, the Flagon was a something of a manned missile, with ground control expected to guide the aircraft close enough to the target to use its onboard radar and missiles. The Soviets feared they would face both slow, high-flying bombers, which interceptors could attack from behind, and fast Mach 2 bombers (like the U.S. B-58 Hustler), according to Gordon’s book. “Without a significant advantage in speed the interceptor stood no chance of destroying such targets in pursuit mode; hence high-speed targets were to be intercepted in head-on mode, and both tactics would be used against slower aircraft.” For high-flying targets above the Su-15’s maximum ceiling of sixty thousand feet, the interceptor ascend into a zoom climb and then fire missiles from below. “The military was not entirely happy with the performance of the production Su-15,” Gordon notes. There were problems with the flight controls and engines. Just as crucial, its radar lacked a “look down” capability to detect the new generation of low-flying bombers. Still, some 1,290 were built between 1965 and 1979, becoming one of PVO’s primary interceptors. It complemented the speedier MiG-25 “Foxbat,” with the latter used to intercept faster bombers. The Flagon was retired in Russian service in 1993, though it flew on for the Ukrainian Air Force until 1996. The Su-15 never saw combat with other warplanes (and neither did its U.S. counterpart, the F-106, though its predecessor the F-102 did see combat in Vietnam). But as a primary air defense fighter during the Cold War, it was involved in many intercepts of aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace. On July 18, 1981, a Canadair CL-44 freighter, flown by an Argentine crew, crossed the Iranian border into Soviet territory. Its mission was to carry Israeli arms to Iran to sustain Iran’s war with Iraq. The CL-44 was intercepted by an Su-15, which signaled the intruder to land. What happened next is debated. The Flagon pilot claimed that he was unable to fire a missile before the freighter left Soviet airspace, and therefore rammed the CL-44, causing it to crash. (However, American aviation historian James Oberg suggests the Soviet pilot accidentally collided with his target and covered up the mistake.) And the “Boeing Killer” moniker? On April 20, 1978, a Korean Air Lines 707 en route from Paris to Seoul entered Soviet airspace near Murmansk. It was intercepted by an Su-15. The Soviets claimed the plane was on a spy mission and ignored commands to land. The South Koreans claimed it was an accidental overflight and the Soviets were trigger-happy. Regardless of the reason, the Su-15 fired two R-60 missiles, one of which hit. The Korean pilot managed to land the 707 on a frozen lake, but two people were killed. The next incident was the most notorious in the history of the Su-15—and Soviet air defense. On September 1, 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007, en route from Seoul to Tokyo, entered Soviet airspace over Sakhalin Island near Japan. The 747 was intercepted by Su-15s, which fired warning shots (the shells were invisible in the darkness to the Korean pilots because the interceptors’ cannon lacked tracer rounds). Before the 747 left Soviet airspace, the Su-15s were ordered to shoot it down. Hit by two missiles, the airliner crashed, killing all 269 passengers and crew (including a hawkish U.S. congressman who was president of the John Birch Society). The Soviets claimed KAL 707 was on a spy mission and ignored orders to land, but President Ronald Reagan denounced the incident as Soviet barbarism. Ilya Grinberg, who writes on Soviet aviation history, doubts that the Soviets referred to the Su-15 as the “Boeing Killer.” “Soviet aircraft did not have such nicknames,” he told the National Interest. “They would be called affectionate names like ‘Sushka’ [‘biscuit’] and ‘Sukharik’ [‘crouton’] for the Su- types.” Unfortunately for the luckless Flagon, it became famous for another reason. It was an Su-15 that collided in 1968 with a MiG-15 flown by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. The collision killed the first human being to fly into outer space.

Trump, who as a candidate said he didn’t think the bank needed to exist, named former New Jersey Representative Scott Garrett, one of the biggest recipients of Wall Street donations among House members, to be the bank’s chairman and president. He tapped former Alabama Representative Spencer Bachus for a seat on the bank’s board of directors. Both positions require Senate confirmation. Trump hinted at a shift in his position on Ex-Im during an interview on April 12. “Actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money; it can make a lot of money,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies.” In 2015, Trump told Bloomberg that the bank’s role amounted to “featherbedding” for some politicians and companies. They guarantee loans for international buyers of products from US companies. Boeing Co Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg is said to have helped change the president’s view of the agency. Boeing is by far the largest beneficiary of the bank among exporters, to the tune of several billion dollars annually, followed by General Electric Co. No quorum Small-government conservatives shut down the bank in 2015 by blocking its reauthorisation. While the bank was revived, its five-member board has lacked a quorum, which restricted it from granting loans of more than US$10 million. Former President Barack Obama’s late-term nominees were blocked by Senate Republicans, including Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. In Garrett, Trump has chosen a critic of a government agency to run it — similar to his appointment of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. “The Export-Import Bank’s long legacy of crony capitalism has hurt the livelihoods and businesses of many Americans who don’t get special treatment from this misguided government programme,” Garrett said in a 2015 statement. Conservative groups, including Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity, oppose the bank for similar reasons. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, urged senators to reject Garrett’s nomination because of his past stance. ‘Act of sabotage’ “In Scott Garrett, the president has nominated someone who helped lead the charge to shut down the Export-Import Bank in Congress against a super-majority that was in favour of keeping it open so it could continue creating and supporting American jobs and exports,” Hoyer said in a statement. “If former Representative Garrett is confirmed to lead the Bank, it would be the ultimate act of sabotage.” Garrett, 57, failed to win re-election in 2016 after seven terms in Congress. He lost the backing of major Wall Street donors after a report that he’d told fellow Republican lawmakers he wouldn’t give money to the party’s congressional campaign arm because it supported openly gay candidates. Bachus, a former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has previously supported the Ex-Im bank, sponsoring a 2012 law that reauthorized the bank. Bachus retired from Congress in 2015. Backers of the bank say that most of its lending supports small and medium-sized businesses. In fiscal 2014, the bank’s last full year of operation, it backed US$27.5 billion in exports — somewhat less than 2 per cent of the US total. This financing supported 164,000 American jobs that year, according to the bank, and about 90 per cent of the bank’s deals helped small businesses. The US Chamber of Commerce has pushed for the bank’s lending powers to be fully restored, saying that without it, jobs might be lost to competitors in China or Russia. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit opens at 4.4010/4050 against US greenback Gold hits five-month peak on rising geopolitical worries KL shares open slightly higher this morning China GDP grows faster, steel output hits record KL shares extend earlier gains, end morning session on firm note Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Village Grocer buys up Ben’s Independent Grocer Petronas pitches RM4.4b offshore gas project stake to oil firms, sources say United Airlines CEO won’t resign Bank Negara said to mull enforcing foreign insurer ownership cap Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Coolest drone trick shots ‘The Last Jedi’ meets ‘The Force Awakens’ Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles In about-face, Trump nominates new head of export bank Obama to US business-owners: Press congress to renew Ex-Im Bank Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The much-talked about price per unit for the MOAB bomb was never confirmed by the US military, although many outlets including the New York Times and Business Insider inaccurately stated that the cost of the MOAB was in the millions. Several Trump critics and celebs across social media quickly showed dissent for cited multi-million dollar cost to drop the “mother of all bombs” on an ISIS target in Afghanistan. So, how much does the ‘Mother of all bombs’ MOAB cost? On Friday, an Air Force representative revealed to the Business Insider that one MOAB unit costs $170,000. Where did $314 million dollars per MOAB unit originate? The LA Times published a 2011 article detailing the delivery of a batch of 30,000-pound bombs. The total cost for this batch in 2011 was cited at $314 million. The Daily Caller added that the number was then picked up by various media outlets. “Many news organizations, including TIME and CNBC, also cited Deagel.com, a site with extensive lists of weapons assets owned by multiple countries, which claims the MOAB costs $16 million per unit, the same amount as the reported cost of the MOP.” The Business Insider’s article has since been corrected to maintain that the Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) does not cost the heavily cited $314 million or even $16 million. The "mother of all bombs" dropped today in Afghanistan cost the US taxpayer $314 million. And yet America can't afford meals on wheels. — James Melville (@JamesMelville) April 13, 2017 A third party like Lockheed or the aerospace giant like Boeing Co. did not produce the MOAB bomb. In the LA Times 2011 article, the B-52 Stratofortress long-range bomber was Boeing-made. The weapon, whose acronym, MOAB, inspired the nickname, the “Mother of All Bombs,” was produced by the Air Force. According to an Air Force official. “… We don’t have a standard procurement cost associated with them.” The Air Force has not confirmed the development costs associated with the larger weapons system. The $170,000 cost for the MOAB seems accurate considering a general-purpose 1,000-pound MK-83 would cost about $12,000. The U.S. bomb was dropped on an ISIS tunnel complex in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. The “mother of all bombs” was dubbed from the ear-splitting blast from the weapon. U.S. forces in Afghanistan on Thursday struck an Islamic State tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan with the largest non-nuclear weapon every used in combat by the U.S. military, Pentagon officials said. [Image by U.S. Department of Defense/AP Images] The image above is from an April 13, 2017, video that was released by the U.S. Department of Defense. The photo shows a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb strike on an Islamic State militant cave and tunnel systems in the Achin district of the Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan. The MOAB features additional high explosives and larger fins intended to precisely direct the GPS-guided munition. The image above reveals a GBU-43B, or massive ordnance air blast weapon, the U.S. military’s largest non-nuclear bomb, which contains 11 tons of explosives. A Pentagon spokesman said this was the first-ever combat use of the bomb. [Image by Eglin Air Force Base/AP Images] Many Trump critics and celebs used Twitter to express their frustration at the administration’s authorization of using such an expensive bomb. However, the unverified cost believed to have been associated with the entire development program ran rampant on social media. This million dollar number was never confirmed by the US military, which has developed 20 such bombs. Nearly 100 ISIS Militants Killed After MOAB Airstrike In Afghanistan The Afghan Ministry of Defense has reported that over 90 ISIS militants were killed following the release of the ‘mother of all bombs.’ The ISIS target resided in a remote part of Afghanistan, according to the Pentagon. The massive MOAB bomb is nearly nine feet in length and weighs in at almost 10,000 kgs. According to the DoD the MOAB is the largest non-nuclear conventional weapon in existence. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the goal was to destroy “a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters used to move around freely, making it easier for them to target US military advisers and Afghan forces in the area.” According to the Daily Mail, ISIS fighters were networking through a series of underground tunnels. The MOAB bomb also destroyed weapons and ammunition. A Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed that no civilians were hurt. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai considered the attack to be “an inhuman and most brutal misuse of our country.” The ministry added the bomb struck a village near Momand valley. The incredible blast emanating from the massive bomb is equivalent to 11 tons of dynamite. The nuclear weapon which was dropped on Hiroshima had a full blast yield of 15 tons of TNT. An Afghan army soldier who was driving toward the targeted area affected by the MOAB bomb revealed to the Guardian what the explosion felt like. “The explosion felt like a big earthquake, even in the surrounding districts.” [Featured Image by USAF/Getty Images] Now Read This: Murder Suspect, Angelo Colon-Ortiz Arrested In Google Employee Vanessa Marcotte Attack In Massachusetts Share 33 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Ashley Hoffman Tags: afghanistan, Isis, isis attack, MOAB April 14, 2017 ‘Destiny’: Xur’s Exotic Goods For April 14, The Last Word Via Bundle April 12, 2017 ‘ARK: Survival Evolved’ Volcano Will Go Active Soon, Players Should Plan To Move ISIS 3 hours ago The ‘Mother Of All Bombs’ (MOAB) Does Not Cost $314 Million Per Unit Says US Air Force Official 2 days ago MOAB: ISIS Death Toll From ‘Mother Of All Bombs’ Rises To 94, Afghan Authorities Say Comments LATEST HEADLINES Orlando Bloom Dating Nina Dobrev?

Bush But Racist By Jonathan Chait Share Facebook iconShare Twitter iconTweet Google Plus iconShare Pinterest iconPin It Email iconEmail Comment iconComment Print icon Print Donald Trump meets with police officers. Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Donald Trump ran an ethnonationalist cult-of-personality presidential campaign, in which his status as a (real) nonpolitician and (imaginary) business genius would allow him to transcend and solve every policy problem. He has retained the ethnonationalist themes, while abandoning, one by one, almost every other populist element differentiating him from the generic Republican brand. The neutering of the nonracial elements of Trump’s populism has been a continuous process. “After listening for ten minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal this week. He was specifically referring to North Korea, which he had believed China could handle quickly and easily — but, after a short historical education, realized is a knotty issue replete with trade-offs. Yet that line could easily be applied to every issue Trump has been educated about. As he has come into contact with a concrete agenda, every heterodox promise has given way to conventional GOP positions. Trump’s pledge not to cut Medicaid while replacing Obamacare with a terrific plan that would include “insurance for everybody,” with better coverage than they have now, turned into endorsement of a conventional Republican plan that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid and throw tens of millions of people off their insurance. He has oriented his domestic policy around traditional Republican priorities: deregulation, especially of the financial sector and fossil fuels, and regressive tax cuts. Report after report finds chief executive officers streaming into the White House and essentially dictating policy. The economic-nationalist elements of Trump’s agenda have all either quietly disappeared or been reversed outright. He has ignored his loud promise to renegotiate NAFTA. He has admitted that China, another longtime bête noir, is not, in fact, a currency manipulator. He came out in favor of the Export-Import Bank, after Boeing’s CEO educated him on it (“Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing?’” he told The Wall Street Journal. “It turns out that … lots of small companies are really helped!”) and turned his ballyhooed lobbyist ban into Swiss cheese. On economic policy, Trump has become a conventional party man whose ideas reflect the agenda of the lobbyists and wealthy individuals who have his ear. His reversal on foreign policy is more dramatic. Having once denounced NATO, he now praises it. (“It was once obsolete; it is no longer obsolete.”) He has brought Russia hawks into his administration and ceased lavishing Vladimir Putin with praise (in part because doing so lends even more credence to the ongoing investigation of his campaign’s cooperation with Russia’s election interference). After repeatedly lambasting the Obama administration for intervening in Syria, which he called a “quagmire” — noting, “Assad is killing ISIS” — he attacked Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians. Eli Lake reports that H. R. McMaster, Trump’s chief national security adviser, is formulating plans to send tens of thousands of ground troops to Syria for an extended campaign to destroy ISIS and allow for reconstruction afterward — i.e., an occupation. That is an astonishing turn for a president who has not only presented himself as an original opponent of the Iraq War, but endlessly lamented the sums spent on the war and the occupation, which he said could have been used for rebuilding the United States. Indeed, Trump used his imagined status as farsighted Iraq War–opponent to beat back every attack on his manifest ignorance of foreign policy, during both the primary and the general election. There is no telling whether Trump will follow McMaster’s plan; but the mere fact that he has ceded so much authority to a conventionally hawkish interventionist, after having ridiculed his party’s neoconservative wing, shows how far he has lurched already. The ideological distance between Trump’s economic and foreign policy and George W. Bush’s has collapsed. From the perspective of 2017, more than eight years after Bush departed office, the comparison between the two presidents may sound comforting. That is largely because Bush has disappeared into his painting studio, his reputation benefitting from both his general absence from the political scene and the particular contrast with his frightening, orange quasi-nemesis. It is easy to look back on Bush’s tenure as comparatively benign — but Bush’s presidency was a period of gross misgovernance. His legacy includes not only Iraq and Katrina, but his obsession with cutting taxes for the rich, a comprehensive fealty to the business lobby, rampant corruption, refusal to take any steps to limit climate change, and a deregulatory agenda that set the conditions for the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The Bush presidency was the most comprehensive governing failure of any administration since at least Herbert Hoover, and it ought to have poisoned the party’s national brand as deeply as it did Hoover’s GOP (which did not win another presidential election for twenty years). But the Republican Party managed to largely skirt the reputational fallout from the Bush catastrophe. It did so, in part, through the tea party: Conservatives hailed right-wing protests against Barack Obama as a call for ideological purity, cleansing the supposed big-government, cronyist tendencies of the Bush administration. The Republican Party of the Obama era insisted it had learned the lessons of the Bush years, when its agenda had devolved into little more than shoveling cash to K Street. The post-Bush GOP was allegedly sadder and wiser and filled with righteous abhorrence for the temptations of lobbyists and deficit spending. Those lessons have all been forgotten. The Republican government, under Trump, has retraced the steps it took under Bush — from the obsession with tax cuts for the rich, to the vanishing line between the party’s paid lobbyists and its public servants. The reality is that, contrary to the willful misreading of conservatives elites, the tea-party revolution was not fundamentally a reaction against deficits or crony capitalism: It was a heavily racialized backlash against social change. And that spirit — the true animating spirit of the grassroots right — has lived on in Trump’s presidency. My magazine story from a few weeks ago identified Trump’s ethnonationalism as the one clearly successful strand of his presidency. Trump has drawn from a relatively continuous line of thought, running from his early history as a landlord who excluded African-Americans, to a demagogue who publicly demanded the execution of five innocent minority teenagers, to a politician who ultimately brought the alt-right into the Republican coalition. His agenda for law enforcement, immigration, and national identity has reinforced the unifying ethnonationalist theme that allowed him to prevail over his more orthodox Republican competitors. In the weeks since my piece was published, that agenda has continued to race forward. The Department of Homeland Security is ramping up its capacity to assemble Trump’s promised deportation force. And the Department of Justice is eliminating a commission on forensic science, which had refuted some questionable methods used by law enforcement. As my essay argued, Trump’s ethnonationalism reverses a trend in the Republican Party: Beginning with Bush, it had repudiated its Southern strategy and attempted to craft a racially inclusive message that would broaden the constituency for its oligarchic economic agenda. Bush and his ideological heirs sought to compromise on immigration while taking seriously minority concerns about discriminatory law enforcement. Trump has reversed Bush’s aspiration for a racially inclusive party completely, while rediscovering his economic blueprint. The Trumpian mix of K Street economics and Breitbartian racial messaging is not a perfectly natural one. Trump’s vicious ethnonationalism makes his wealthy advisers and donors (many of them the same people) uncomfortable, especially the portions that disrupt their transborder workforce. And Trump’s elitist economic policy is the opposite of what his downscale white base thought he would deliver. But it fits together closely enough to function. The political reality Trump has discovered through trial and error is that he is delivering each constituency the thing it most craves. Trump’s white-identity politics satisfy his voting base enough to make his plutocratic economics tolerable. And the financial and political elite are willing to swallow their qualms about his ugly ethnonationalism because they are going to get paid. If you thought George W. Bush was generally swell, but too racially inclusive, you are going to like Trump’s presidency.

Kelly Ortberg Rockwell Collins Matthew Patane More stories from Matthew Apr 13, 2017 at 4:27 pm | Print View Rockwell Collins officially added 10,000 employees under its name Thursday having finished the acquisition of B/E Aerospace, a Florida-based maker of airplane interiors. Rockwell CEO Kelly Ortberg said the inclusion of B/E’s interior products will give the company diversity to weather ups and downs in the aviation industry. Cedar Rapids-based Rockwell mainly manufactures avionics technology used in cockpits and flight decks for commercial and defense aircraft. Wellington, Fla.-headquartred B/E Aerospace manufactures seating, lighting, galleys and other interior products for commercial and business aircraft. “Just the scale and the opportunity is going to allow us to grow faster,” he said in a phone interview with The Gazette while in Winston-Salem, N.C., B/E’s largest base of employees. The combination of the two companies is not expected to affect employees in Cedar Rapids, Ortberg said. “We are not closing facilities in other locations and bringing work into Cedar Rapids, but likewise we are not moving work from Cedar Rapids into any of the B/E locations,” Ortberg said. Some positions involved with the administration of the two public companies may be cut, he said. “Those will go through workforce reductions as we eliminate those positions. People understand that and they’ll be taken care of as part of that integration plan,” Ortberg said. Rockwell is now expected to have more than $8 billion in annual revenue. With the purchase, Rockwell will try to sell more aircraft seats and interiors directly to plane makers, rather than airlines, Ortberg told Reuters Thursday. “This is an area where I think we can do more standard equipment with the OEMs,” he said, referring to plane makers such as Boeing and Airbus. “I think we can do more with Boeing as they look at what part of the interiors they want to standardize,” he added. The company first announced the acquisition last October. A month later, activist fund Starboard Value pressured Rockwell to drop the bid and consider selling itself instead. Shareholders approved the deal in March, however, and regulators with the European Union signing off earlier this month. B/E Aerospace rebranded immediately Thursday as Rockwell Collins. Its president and CEO, Werner Lieberherr, became executive vice president and chief operating officer for a new interior systems division within Rockwell. The deal, valued at $8.6 billion with debt, is the largest in Rockwell’s history. It brings together Rockwell’s 20,000 global employees with 10,000 from B/E Aerospace. Cedar Rapids, with about 8,000 people, remains the largest concentration of employees for Rockwell, a spokesman said in an email. The second biggest is now Batangas, a province in the Philippines, with about 1,900 employees. In addition to Cedar Rapids, Rockwell Collins has another 1,350 employees in Eastern Iowa. l Comments: (319) 398-8366; matthew.patane@thegazette.com Like what you're reading?

A White House statement also named Spencer Bachus, another Republican former congressman, to be a member of the board of directors of the bank. Both were named for four-year terms. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on last Wednesday he would fill the two vacancies on the bank’s five-member board that have prevented it from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. His picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing Co and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who worked in Congress to kill the institution, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump’s backing of the bank represents a victory for manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric Co, which have overseas customers that use the agency’s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump told the Journal the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank as being “featherbedding” for wealthy corporations. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Left, right or centre — French economy may decide Z-Corp organises chess training programme → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent ‘Israa and Miraj’ holiday on April 25 Pay more on ticket ‘refund’ and ‘reissue’ Submit voluntary projects for award from May 1 Oman, China seek to enhance cooperation in journalism Read More ...

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest Apprenticeships could solve tech’s diversity problem Sylvain Kalache, Holberton School@SylvainKalache April 16, 2017 10:25 AM Tags: Airbnb, apprentice, apprenticeships, Donald Trump, Google, Howard University, Howard West, Marc Benioff, Salesforce Image Credit: Shutterstock In case you missed it, Howard University and Google recently announced that they were partnering to attract more African American students to study computer science, targeting a segment of the tech population that is notoriously underrepresented (along with women). The Google/Howard partnership is a small step (albeit an important one) with a specific goal — to bring more people of color into the tech workforce. The industry is truly missing out on a lot of great talent. However, the fact is that only by changing the way we recruit, inspire, and educate (train) students from the outdated “lecture and regurgitate” mode to a more progressive model, where students learn practical skills and improve their problem solving and collaboration skills via hands-on projects, can we hope to begin filling all the jobs now and in the future. Google’s step follows a series of moves by corporations, wealthy individuals, and entrepreneurs to attract more talent to the tech industry. Paul Allen donated $40 million to the University of Washington’s computer science department, while Boeing awarded $6 million in grants to reinforce STEM education in Washington. Last year, SalesForce CEO Marc Benioff announced that SalesForce donated $8.5 million to San Francisco Unified School District and $2.5 million to Oakland Unified School District to hire STEM teachers, as well as buying the computer systems they need. Businesses need more skilled STEM workers. There are a quarter-million job openings for software developers in the U.S. alone and half a million unfilled jobs that require tech skills — and the forecast predicts 2.4 million unfilled STEM jobs by 2018. If you take a closer look at our education system, it’s immediately apparent that little has really changed since the 19th century, when the standard methodology was to get the rural population ready to work in factories. While this type of education fits some people and institutions, it does not favor everyone. And, more often than not, those not favored are branded as failures or see themselves as failures. In fact, it’s the cookie cutter methodology developed more than a century ago that continues to fail them. Since the tech industry requires a diverse and qualified pool of workers, it wants to bring alternative, and specifically, more practical, training back to the table. Benioff, who is actively investing in Bay Area education, now aims to take his ideas national. He recently ensured that his new moonshot — to get the U.S. government to create five million apprenticeship opportunities within the next five years — was right on track. He met with President Trump, who agreed his request made sense. If this initiative does happen, it might drastically change the U.S. job market, which currently only has half a million apprentices. And the initiative follows a trend: Microsoft recently announced an apprenticeship program to train the next generation of software engineers, which aligns with its commitment to train 30,000 new apprentices by 2020. Airbnb started a similar program last year, explaining that the company would build better products if its team was as diverse as the community it serves. Learning by doing, which has been considered for decades as the only way for tradespeople to develop skills, is gaining converts. Often associated with blue collar jobs, its practices are well-suited to the STEM fields, especially engineering, which represents a big part of current white collar jobs. “Apprenticeship has proven to be very efficient in countries like Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, which have among the lowest youth unemployment rates in the world,“ says Kristin Keveloh, head of strategic partnership at the Global Apprenticeships Network. “While the term ‘apprenticeship’ does not have a good reputation elsewhere, the model forms an essential part of the education and training landscape in these countries, and I increasingly see corporate and government leaders discovering this model as great training for the next generation of workers.” Apprenticeships, progressive education, and vocational training get students to a level of proficiency and experience that makes them productive on the job from the start. Additionally, it brings to the table people who have not been drilled in the rote learning methodology most Universities use. “One big issue that we have with standard college education is the lack of focus on practical knowledge,” says Neha Jain, senior software engineer at LinkedIn. “Students who realize this limitation and start working on side projects or contributing to open source end up doing better. Spending time honing the craft of writing good code is greatly more valuable than trying to learn theory only.” Initiatives like the Google-Howard University partnership and Salesforce’s push for alternative education will help grow and foster diversity in the tech industry.  And it’s encouraging to see that tech can count President Trump as an unexpected ally in its quest for apprenticeships. Who knows, perhaps President Trump and his administration might actually help make America (and the tech industry) great again.

The reason for this drastic change is in order for him to be able to win the support of the U.S. aristocracy, who had overwhelmingly favored Hillary Clinton during the Presidential contest, and who (and whose ‘news’media) have been trying to portray Trump as “Putin’s fool” or even as “Putin’s Manchurian candidate” and thus as an illegitimate President or even traitor who is beholden to ‘America’s enemy’ (which to them is Russia) for Trump’s having won the U.S. Presidency — which they had tried to block from happening. (And, actually, even Republican billionaires generally preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump — and almost all of them hate Putin, who insists upon Russia’s independence, which the U.S. aristocracy call by all sorts of bad names, so that any American who even so much as merely questions the characterization of Russia as being an ‘enemy’ nation, is considered to be ‘unAmerican’, like in the days of communism and Joseph R. McCarthy, as if communism and the U.S.S.R. and its Warsaw Pact that mirrored America’s NATO military alliance, even existed today, which they obviously don’t. So: the U.S. Establishment’s portrayal of current international reality is so bizarre, it can be believed only by fools, but enough such fools exist so as to enable that Establishment to do horrific things, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the 2011 invasion of Libya, just to name two examples, which got rid of two national leaders who were friendly toward Russia.)  After Trump ditched his National Security Advisor Mike Flynn (whom Obama had fired for not being sufficiently anti-Russian, but Trump then hired) and replaced him with the rabidly anti-Russian H.R. McMaster (whom the aristocracy’s people were recommending to Trump), Trump was expecting to be relieved from the aristocracy’s intensifying campaign to impeach him or otherwise replace him and make the President his clearly pro-aristocratic Vice President Mike Pence, but the overthrow-Trump campaign continued even after McMaster became installed replacing Flynn. Then, perhaps because the replacement of Flynn by McMaster failed to satisfy the aristocracy, Trump additionally ousted Stephen Bannon and simultaneously bombed Syrian government forces, and now the campaign to overthrow Trump seems finally to have subsided, at least a bit, at least for now.  Trump’s domestic enemies have been variously called “neoconservatives,” “Zionists,” “Democrats,” “liberals,” “Republicans,” and other such misleading categories, all of which ‘sides’ are now actually controlled by, and representing, only one side, the world’s roughly 2,000 billionaires (and this Forbes list doesn’t even include royalty, who are the topmost of all, such as the King of Saudi Arabia, whose net worth is in the trillions). These are the individuals who control all of the ‘news’ media that have significantly large audiences, and who also control Wall Street, and who also control the giant oil companies, and who also control the top 100 U.S. government contracting firms, the top 25 of which are shown, in the ranking of the “Top 100 Contractors of the U.S. federal government”, as being: 1: Lockheed Martin. 2: Boeing. 3: General Dynamics. 4: Raytheon. 5: Northrop Grumman. 6: McKesson. 7: United Technologies. 8: L-3. 9: Bechtel. 10: BAE. 11: Huntington Ingalls. 12: Humana. 13: SAIC. 14: Booz Allen Hamilton. 15: Healthnet. 16: Computer Sciences. 17: UnitedHealth. 18: Aecom. 19: Leidos. 20: Harris. 21: General Atomics. 22: Hewlett-Packard. 23: Battelle. 24: United Launch Alliance. 25 Los Alamos National Lab.  Those 25 firms are about 35% of the total, but they’re almost 100% ‘Defense’ Department suppliers, and so they show the extreme extent to which the extraordinary entity that President Dwight Eisenhower had called (only when he was leaving office — he had been too scared to say it while still in the White House) “the military-industrial complex”, has come to be the aristocracy that’s now joined-at-the-head to the behind-the-scenes U.S. government, and that uses, and is used by, that government (its politicians), in order to protect and increase their personal wealth.  They thrive on war, because war is the ultimate government-expense. (Aristocrats have, over the centuries, benefited from government expenses, because those expenses are extracted from the public, and become income to the aristocracy.) And, then, after a war is over, the entity who own the debt that the taxpayers will need to pay back, for all of those government-purchases, from all of those government contractors (basically the manufacturers of the machines for mass-killing) is whom? The megabanks had been lending to those weapons-makers, of course, so as to enable these manufacturers to ramp-up production. The money that was lent to make those weapons, comes back to these megabanks, with interest, charged to those weapons-makers, who profited from these weapons-sales. Thus, it’s not just those weapons-manufacturing firms but also the megabanks, that grow from wars. In addition, the government has issued bonds to pay to the weapons-makers to purchase those weapons. Those enormous debts, which had been paid to the weapons-makers, are now owed by taxpayers to the government to pay to the owners of those government bonds, which often are investment-firms, either the megabanks themselves, or clients of the megabanks. Ultimately, these debts often become assets on the mega-banks’ balance-sheets — and the same aristocratic families can (and often do) own or control both government contractors and megabanks, and sometimes also the investment-firms. This is the safe way, the low-risk way, for billionaires to become multi-billionaires. Virtually all of the risks of wars are borne by the general public, but all of the profits from wars go to the aristocrats. It’s a certain type of game, in which the billionaires are the players, and the public are the toys, which are played with; and, from which, multiple extractions are made, as the game is played. It’s like raising “game” (in the animal-sense) in order to shoot, and eat it. Even the world’s biggest bookstore-owner, Jeff Bezos, became a major contractor to the ‘Defense’ Department, by providing cloud-based computing services to the war-machine, and then he arranged to purchase the world’s top neoconservative ‘news’paper, the Washington Post, to boost and to suppress the careers of whichever federal politicians have proven to be the most and the least cooperative with regard to expanding the budget for the only U.S. Cabinet Department that’s so corrupt it can’t even be audited: the ‘Defense’ Department. A retailer, such as Bezos, doesn’t generally have much clout, unless he either owns a ‘news’ medium (such as the Washington Post) or hires effective lobbyists. At that high a level, things are very interconnected, and a player needs to have agents in each crucial part of the power-machine. So, Bezos does. But, so, too, do other high-tech leaders, such as the billionaires at Alphabet Inc., formerly called “Google.” They were heavily involved in 2011 helping Hillary Clinton’s State Department draw up the plans to overthrow two heads-of-state that allied with Russia: Yanukovych in Ukraine, and Assad in Syria. Of course, ownership of almost all large corporations is usually hidden by layers of ownership, and sometimes only one class of stock actually controls the company, while other classes of stock are purely passive investors in the given firm and they have no real control over it. But, regardless, anyone who is paying serious attention to textbook versions of economic theory (‘economic competition’) is thinking about a mere fantasy world, a fantasy-game, not the real-world game; not the real world, at all — and the aristocracy also gets to decide who writes those textbooks (the rules of the fantasy-game), to make sure they distract the public from what’s happening in the real world.  So, within that tiny society at the top of this planet’s power-pyramid, are being made the person-to-person deals that determine peace or war, life or death, for the general population, at any given time. These are the few people who will take their cut, no matter what. But, they need this cycle, of war, debt, and politics, to continue going ’round and ’round, in order to achieve what, for them, is “progress,” and to keep it going — ’round and ’round, like in centuries past, for themselves, and for their heirs. It’s a way of life; it is a tiny sub-culture, at the very top; and it remains remarkably constant, from decade to decade, and even from century to century. The illusion that the players care about the toys, is needed, in order to keep the game going, so that extractions can continue to be made from the toys, forever, and the aristocracy can thus become evermore bloated (“successful”), from this ‘progress’. Here, at the following links, is a brief history of how this game has been proceeding, during recent decades, starting from current times, and going backward through the decades: “America’s Secret Planned Conquest of Russia” “How America Double-Crossed Russia and Shamed the West” “During the Cold War the US was ready to sacrifice 40 million Americans to destroy Russia” So: Trump has decided to do what he thinks he must do, in order to be able to stay in power. In order to stay in power, he must be a type of President that, in some crucial respects, is more like what Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were, than what he had promised his voters he would be. And the reason that this is so, is that this is what America’s aristocracy demands, in today’s American ‘democracy’.

In a well-timed statement, just as tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program and potential US airstrikes run wild, the NNSA said that in conjunction with the US Air Force, it had completed the first qualification flight test of B61-12 gravity nuclear bomb on March 14 at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. In the press release, the NNSA said that the “non-nuclear assembly test” was dropped from an F-16 based at Nellis Air Force Base and was intended to evaluate “both the weapon’s non-nuclear functions as well as the aircraft’s capability to deliver the weapon.” This test was the first of a series that will be conducted over the next three years to qualify the B61-12 for service. Three successful development flight tests were conducted in 2015. “This demonstration of effective end-to-end system performance in a realistic ballistic flight environment marks another on-time achievement for the B61-12 Life Extension Program,” said Brig. Gen. Michael Lutton, NNSA’s principal assistant deputy administrator for military application. “The successful test provides critical qualification data to validate that the baseline design meets military requirements. It reflects the nation’s continued commitment to our national security and that of our allies and partners.” The flight test included hardware designed by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, manufactured by the Nuclear Security Enterprise plants, and mated to the tail-kit assembly section, designed by the Boeing Company under contract with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. Phil Hoover, an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, shows off a flight test body for a B61-12 nuclear weapon The B61-12 consolidates and replaces four B61 bomb variants in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. The first production unit is scheduled to be completed by March 2020. The original B61 gravity bomb is the mainstay of the Air Force’s nuclear arsenal and one of the legs of the so-called nuclear triad, along with the intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed from either ground-based silos or oceangoing submarines. The B61 nuclear gravity bomb, deployed from U.S. Air Force and NATO bases, has almost 50 years of service, “making it the oldest and most versatile weapon in the enduring U.S. stockpile.” Numerous modifications have been made to improve the B61’s safety, security, and reliability since the first B61 entered service in 1968, and four B61 variants remain in the stockpile: the 3, 4, 7, and 11. However, the aging weapon system requires a life extension to continue deterring potential adversaries and reassuring our allies and partners of our security commitments to them. The B61-12 LEP will refurbish, reuse, or replace all of the bomb’s nuclear and non?nuclear components to extend the service life of the B61 by at least 20 years, “and to improve the bomb’s safety,  effectiveness, and security” according to the NNSA. The B61-12 first production unit will occur in FY 2020. The bomb will be approximately 12 feet long and weigh approximately 825 pounds. The bomb will be air-delivered in either ballistic gravity or guided drop modes, and is being certified for delivery on current strategic (B-2A) and dual capable aircraft (F-15E, F-16C/D & MLU, PA-200) as well as future aircraft platforms (F-35, B-21). President Trump has endorsed the ambitious and expensive plan to modernize the US nuclear triad, begun under his predecessor. The March test of the B61-12 was the first in a series to take place over the next three years, with the final design review due in September 2018 and the first production unit scheduled for completion by March 2020. Once the bomb is authorized for use in 2020, the US plans to deploy some 180 of the B61-12 precision-guided thermonuclear bombs to five European countries as follows: Belgium – 20; Germany -20; Italy – 70; Netherlands – 20; Turkey -50; … although in light of recent developments, and this weekend’s Turkish referendum which may grant Erdogan what are effectively dictatorial powers, it may consider reassessing the Turkish deployment.

Irvington Road. The AOP is helping clean up a superfund site on the south side of Tucson. Thursday March 09, 2017 Buy Now Mamta Popat / Arizona Daily Star A Tucson Water official talks to Sunnyside High School students about the treatment facility. “We need a younger generation to have the knowledge,” says local activist Yolanda Herrera. Advancements in the treatment of contaminated south-side water have left Tucson Water officials looking to shut down a 22-year-old plant they say is no longer necessary, but still required by law. A newer treatment plant completed in 2014 removes all the same contaminants as its older counterpart in addition to the carcinogen 1,4-dioxane, which was recently found to be more dangerous than previously thought, said Jeff Biggs, Tucson Water’s administrator of strategic initiatives. The progress has rendered the old plant obsolete, he said. “It’s redundant now and it’s costing money unnecessarily,” he said. Contaminated water has plagued the lower-income, largely Hispanic south-side community since the 1950s when defense-related industries used the carcinogen trichloroethylene, known as TCE, as an industrial degreaser and dumped it into the soil and unlined wells. For almost 30 years, south-side residents unknowingly drank and bathed in contaminated water. Studies link long-term exposure to TCE to diseases like kidney cancer, liver cancer and blood cancer. Tucson Water began operating a treatment plant, funded by the industries that originally polluted the groundwater, at the Tucson International Airport Area Superfund Site Area A in 1994. The area contains the contaminated groundwater plume that extends north from Los Reales Road to just past Irvington Road. The plume is bounded on the west by Interstate 19 and the Santa Cruz River, and on the east by South Sixth Avenue and Nogales Highway. Over the past 22 years, 5,303 pounds of TCE have been removed from the water. The first engineers of the original TIAA Superfund site plant believed enough TCE would have been removed by now to close the plant. But it could be another 30 years before enough TCE is removed to halt the treatment system, estimates Chad LaPora, the environmental and regulatory compliance supervisor for Tucson Water. The original treatment plant stripped water of contaminants of concern including TCE but did not remove the carcinogen 1,4-dioxane from the water. That wasn’t a problem until the EPA discovered 1,4-dioxane was more dangerous than previously thought. Tucson Water built the new Advanced Oxidation Plant to target both TCE and 1,4-dioxane using ultraviolet light combined with hydrogen peroxide to rid the groundwater of toxic chemicals. The groundwater plume near Tucson International Airport was declared a federal Superfund site in 1983. The parties responsible for polluting the water at the TIAA Superfund Site Area A and now legally bound to clean it up are the U.S. Air Force; city of Tucson; Tucson Airport Authority; Hughes Aircraft Co., acquired by Raytheon in 1997; and McDonnell-Douglas Corp., acquired by Boeing in 1997. Last month the EPA held a public forum at El Pueblo Activity Center to propose amendments to the 1988 record of decision, which laid out cleanup plans for the Superfund site. The EPA’s proposed amendments would allow for the closure of the older treatment plant and add 1,4-dioxane to the list of contaminants of concern. The EPA will accept public comment on proposed changes to the Superfund site by letter or email until April 21. RESIDENTS DON’T TRUST WATER The legacy of toxic dumping in the south side has left some residents suspicious of treated water coming from the Superfund site. At last month’s forum, residents voiced fears about continuing family health issues including cancers and the chronic autoimmune disease known as lupus. Some demanded the EPA conduct a study to determine whether these diseases are linked to the contaminants. EPA toxicologist Gerry Hiatt responded at the forum that although the EPA uses health-risk assessments to make decisions at Superfund sites, the EPA is not a health agency. “We don’t have physicians working for us that can go into a community and evaluate the health status of a community or talk to people who’ve had health issues and may have been affected by the contamination,” Hiatt said. Together with Tucson toxicologist Dr. Farshad Shirazi, south-side resident Linda Robles is in the process of creating a house survey to take to her neighbors to find how many illnesses have resulted from the water contamination. She’s also started a community group called the Environmental Task Force. “They just keep finding more chemicals,” Robles said. “Where are these coming from?” CHROMIUM-6 Tucson Water is also braced for the possibility that another chemical may require treatment at the Superfund site. Chromium-6, the carcinogen featured in the 2000 movie “Erin Brockovich,” has been under scrutiny by the EPA since 2010. The agency told PBS in 2013 that it would release findings from its review of chromium-6’s health effects this year, but it has not yet done so. EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones did not respond to the Star’s questions about when the study will be released. In November, Tucson Water found chromium-6 concentrations of up to 8.8 parts per billion in TIAA Superfund Site Area A wells, which water officials say is safe. Concentrations are even lower — 1.6 parts per billion — after the groundwater is mixed with Colorado River water before distribution for drinking, LaPora said. The EPA hasn’t yet established a threshold for safe consumption of the carcinogen, but California established a legal level of 10 parts per billion and a public health goal of .02 parts per billion. In the event that chromium-6 levels rise at the Superfund site or the EPA’s review finds the contaminant more dangerous than previously thought, Tucson Water will need to construct a new plant to treat the water for that chemical, Biggs said. Tucsonan Yolanda Herrera, 64, has watched the south-side water cleanup from the beginning. She applauded Tucson Water for its cleanup efforts. “I was glad they were more proactive than reactive,” Herrera said. While Herrera said she would support a health-survey effort, she said her neighbors’ distrust of the cleanliness of Tucson Water is misguided. She co-chairs the Unified Community Advisory Board that meets quarterly with Tucson Water officials and representatives from the industries responsible for contaminating south-side water to talk about the cleanup progress. A second-generation board member, she has seen first-hand the damaging effects of TCE. Her mother developed a cancerous tumor after drinking the contaminated water and had to have part of her jaw removed. She suffers immense pain every day, Herrera said. Herrera said some of her siblings have also gotten cancer and her family has experienced stillborn babies and had others born with heart and kidney problems. EDUCATING YOUTH University of Arizona College of Education associate professor Kristin Gunckel developed a high school curriculum, with funding from the National Science Foundation, that uses computer modeling to teach students about the TIAA Superfund site groundwater contamination. Over the past school year, she’s worked with science teachers from Desert View and Sunnyside high schools to teach students about their groundwater. “They didn’t really know about it,” Gunckel said of the water contamination, “but as they started learning about it they became much more interested and engaged.” On March 9, five Sunnyside high schoolers took a tour of the two plants at TIAA Superfund Site Area A. Quiet and reserved, the students let the information of the history of south side’s water contamination seep in. Sunnyside senior Francisco Martinez said he felt it was important to learn about the water contamination. His grandmother lived off Drexel Road when the tap water was contaminated, so he was familiar with the issue. Local activist Herrera tagged along on the tour and spoke to the kids about her advisory board, whose members are aging, she said. “I think it’s imperative that we do have kids at the table,” Herrera said. “We need the younger generation to have the knowledge to hold the government agencies’ feet to the fire.” Michelle Jaquette is a University of Arizona journalism student and an apprentice at the Star. Submit your comments The EPA will accept public comment on proposed changes to the Tucson airport Superfund site area A until April 21. Email comments to Aycock.Mary@epa.gov, or send comments to: Mary Aycock, EPA Region 9, Mail Code SFD 8-1, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA 94105 Timeline 1940s-1980s — Defense-related industries near the Tucson International Airport Area use products containing the carcinogen trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,4-dioxane as industrial solvents. Companies including Hughes Aircraft Co. dispose improperly of the solvents, dumping them into unlined wells. 1981 — The city of Tucson and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency run tests and discover hazardous levels of TCE in the drinking water near the Tucson airport. Numerous municipal wells are shut down and private well owners are warned of the risks. 1983 — The EPA declares land near the Tucson airport a federal Superfund site. 1988 — The EPA, along with city officials and the parties responsible for polluting the water, decide on a long-term plan for cleanup of the site, called the "record of decision." 1994 — The Tucson Airport Remediation Project plant begins treating water from the contaminated groundwater plume. Treated water is served as drinking water to south-side residents. 1995 — Unified Community Advisory Board formed with community members and government agencies to keep watch over groundwater cleanup. 2011 — A federal study finds 1,4-dioxane is more dangerous than previously thought. The EPA lowers its its threshold for what's considered safe consumption of the contaminant. 2012 — Tucson Water begins building its Advanced Oxidation Plant to treat the water for TCE and 1,4-dioxane. 2014 — The new plant is finished. Water is now stripped of both TCE and 1,4-dioxane by the new plant before running through original 1994 plant. 2017 — EPA proposes amendment to 1988 record of decision, which would allow for the 1994 plant to be shut down. If the amendment goes through, Tucson Water will still need to negotiate with the parties responsible for the pollution to create a new legal consent decree stating how much money the polluters must pay for the operating and management costs of the new plant.

The market for military simulators is mainly driven by their use in mission training and armed forces training. North America commands the global market, whereas the market in the Asia-Pacific is estimated to grow at the highest CAGR. The aviation industry in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to witness strong growth over the forecast period. The favorable growth is attributed to the rising demand for new aircraft deliveries and growing air traffic in this region.

(Photo: Lockheed Martin). Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk April 12, 2017 The Air Force has authorized Lockheed Martin Corp. to extend the life of the F-16 multi-role fighter for decades longer, officials announced Wednesday. The modification program would boost the overall flight hours of the jet from 8,000 to 12,000, Lockheed said in a release. “Following F-16 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) structural modifications, the U.S. Air Force could safely operate Block 40-52 aircraft to 2048 and beyond,” the release said. The world’s largest defense contractor, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said the move would also lower life sustainment costs on the jet, but didn’t provide a projected savings figure. The program would extend the flight hour limit of up to 300 F-16C/D Block 40-52 aircraft, and would supplement both U.S. and allied combat air fleets as they integrate with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the announcement said.   The Air Force issued a solicitation last year for companies interested in participating in SLEP for the F-16 fleet, according to Air Force Magazine. “Combined with F-16 avionics modernization programs like the F-16V, SLEP modifications demonstrate that the Fighting Falcon remains a highly capable and affordable 4th Generation option for the U.S. Air Force and international F-16 customers,” said Susan Ouzts, vice president of Lockheed Martin’s F-16 program. The latest update comes after Air Force officials have said the F-16 is intended to replace the F-15C/D variants. Both the active-duty component and Air National Guard are considering retiring the Boeing-made Eagle, service officials told the House Armed Services Subcommittee during a hearing on March 22. The F-16 Fighting Falcon could take over missions from the F-15, they said. “Because they’re talking about retiring aircraft that are in the Guard, those are primarily the ones that would be doing the air sovereignty mission, the U.S. air defense,” a defense analyst in Washington, D.C. told Military.com on background recently. RELATED: Did the Air Force Dash Hopes for Building More F-22s? “You don’t need a sophisticated fighter for that,” he said of the mission, headed by Northern Command, to dispatch planes when they get to close to U.S. borders, need to go up and identify an aircraft, or escort, for example, a civilian plane out of a temporarily restricted fly zone. “The F-16 could fit into that role well even if it’s not optimized for air superiority” beyond that mission, he added. That same week, officials at Lockheed told DefenseOne it plans to move the F-16 production line to South Carolina from Fort Worth, Texas, where it built the single-engine fighters for more than 40 years. As of Sept. 30, the Air Force had 949 Fighting Falcons, according to Air Force inventory figures obtained by Military.com. The Air Force claims it has the capacity in the F-16C community “to recapitalize … radar to serve the same function as the F-15 has done and thereby reduce the different systems that we have to sustain and operate, so that makes it more efficient,” said Maj. Gen. Scott D. West, director of current operations and the service’s deputy chief of staff for operations at the Pentagon. The effort will help minimize the number of systems pilots operate, West said during the hearing on Capitol Hill.

The Flying Chickens are headed to national championships this May. Jackson Dittrich, Matthew Dittrich, Sebastian Grammas, Hunter Grammas, Sawyer Shepherd, Dakota Caton and coach, Carolynn Grammas (team member missing – Shepherd Thorpe) First Lego League robotics team, The Flying Chickens, from Annapolis, MD, edged out more than 72 other teams who had advanced from a field of 400 teams through 20 qualifiers, to win 2nd place during State Championships on February, 25, 2017 at UMBC in Catonsville, MD. This win advances the team to compete against 71 other teams at a National Championship in Fayetteville, Arkansas, at the end of May. The Flying Chickens are comprised of seven students attending Annapolis Area Christian School in 4th-7th grades. More than 30,000 teams compete world-wide with top finishers awarded the chance to compete on a national stage. The team is seeking financial assistance to make their trip a reality.  The Flying Chickens chose their name because they were aimed at solving a real world problem – bird strikes on airplanes. Large-diameter, compressed-air cannons are used to fire a standard-size cooking chicken to test the strength of aircraft fuselage and windshields, as well as the safety of jet engines.  This test simulates the effect of an actual bird strike and why they choose this as their team name. The First Lego League challenge this year was “Animal Allies.”   Teams had to identify ways people and animals interact and design a solution that makes the interaction better.  The Flying Chickens spent months researching bird strikes and their interest only grew after seeing the movie “Sully.”  They have spent numerous hours researching the FAA’s Wildlife Hazard Management at Airports Manual for Airport Personnel and reading articles from Boeing, the United States Air Force, BBC News, and National Geographic. After researching, meeting, and touring with officials and experts from BWI and Dulles airports, the team had a much better understanding of how dangerous bird strikes can be to humans.  The team began working on coming up with ideas about how to help stop – or reduce – the amount of bird strikes, and came up with two solutions which they presented to the airport experts. In addition to solving a real world problem, teams must learn to work together as a team. think critically and develop presentation skills – all while applying science, engineering and math concepts.  The Flying Chickens designed, built and programmed a Lego Mindstorms robot to perform autonomous missions on a playing field.   The Flying Chickens won 1st Place in robot design at their qualifier in January.

But I can hardly bring myself to say "Happy Easter." That's because the world is once again rushing towards war -- the antithesis of the holiday's celebration of life. And it's being led in that direction by a nation where 70-75% claim to somehow follow the risen Christ. [BTW did you notice that just last Thursday Christian fundamentalists dropped (on Afghanistan tribal lands) the largest Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD) since Hiroshima and Nagasaki?] - Advertisement - What hypocrisy! But why the bombing in Syria? Get ready . . . It's because of our "enemy's" deployment of weapons of mass destruction! In Syria, it's about chemical weapons! It's about a leader who absolutely must be removed from office because he so resembles Adolph Hitler. Sound familiar? What's his name again? - Advertisement - Wrong if you say Saddam Hussein or Slobodan Milosevic, or Manuel Noriega. This time it's Bashar al-Assad. What a beast! He's killed so many children! But what about the victims of their WMDs, you ask -- the children poisoned? What about the poisoned children in Flint Michigan, I might respond? We stand by silent as they're allowed to drink water contaminated by lead. Oh, but I forgot; those are American children -- and they're mostly black. And as we all know, black lives don't matter. They're on their own. We obviously have greater responsibility for poisoned Syrian kids. (Imagine the unborn fetuses that were killed!) We simply must protect them all from death at the hands of the dictator du jour. Apparently we've forgotten about the 500,000 children our sanctions killed in Iraq during the 1990s. That was o.k. It must have been. Madeleine Albright said so. Apparently we've forgotten about the millions (!) of children in Yemen currently threatened by famine directly induced by the U.S.-Saudi coalition which has been bombing that country non-stop for more than two years. We do nothing for them except continue the mayhem. But that's o.k. too. After all, our leaders tell us bombing is the solution to any problem you might care to name. It's all justified. And besides Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East. Poor people (especially so far away) don't really matter either. It's the arms manufacturers Raytheon, Motorola, Boeing, and their billionaire owners who really count. They're our neighbors -- on Wall Street. Have you noticed; the stock market is soaring? - Advertisement - And, of course, the record shows that our leaders have been right -- in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia. Aren't we proud of the freedom, democracy, and peace our own WMDs have brought those benighted lands? And (once again!) the press is cheerleading it all. Check the newspapers. Look at CNN. Hardly a single editorial has criticized the rush to war. Brian Williams finds our Cruise Missiles "beautiful."

Rather, it's a "Mother!"

This echoes the old and evil belief that all evil can be blamed on women. We men kill but the women drive us to it! Easter, in pagan mythology, is about rebirth, represented by the egg. Today, Easter is about pretending our blood-red world is all pastel and cheery. The only rebirth our nation is participating in today is the rebirth of death and despair. We need a new nation, a nation based on equality and brotherhood. First, we must tear of the old masks, the false flags by which we pretend not to be living in a world of deceit and destruction. Oddly, I am hopeful based on 1) the evil being exposed and 2) the younger generation throwing off the old masks of fake patriotism, American exceptionalism, and the equation of democracy with capitalism. The rebirth awaits only the death of the generations that have bought into the narrative of American entitlement, the right to murder, the right to control.

The nickname comes from MOAB, which has different meaning, and people like to give nicknames based on coincidences.

And he looked at what he had created and pronounced it all good. ALL GOOD! No one seems to remember or much less think deeply (or at all) of the meaning.

The most Christian people in America are also the most supportive of mass murder/war. The God of the OT is an evil prick, and the propaganda of the NT only masks the evil he perpetrated. So the best I can say, this morning, is: Happy f*cking Easter!

It’s the second-heaviest non-nuclear bomb in the American arsenal. A bigger version can be packed into the B-2 stealth bomber based at Whiteman Air Force Base near Knob Noster, Mo. That 30,000-pound satellite-guided bomb — the Pentagon calls it the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) — might be considered the father of all bombs. The 22,000-pound bomb used in Afghanistan is the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or MOAB. It’s typically fused to detonate above its target and uses shock waves to destroy things on and below the ground. In contrast, the MOP was built to burrow into the ground and then explode. A B-2, which can carry up to 160 smaller bombs, can carry just two on a flight. Special cranes are needed to load the behemoths. In a recent interview with The Kansas City Star at Whiteman, B-2 pilot Lt. Col. Justin “Vapor” Grieve compared releasing 500-pound weapons like those used in a January attack over Libya to letting go of the 30,000-pound bombs in testing and training exercises. “The 500-pound weapon is pretty anti-climactic. What is exciting is when we release our 30,000-pound MOP, the Massive Ordnance Penetrator,” he said. “When you release that, you can feel it. The plane will actually raise up about 100 feet, and then it’ll settle back down. It’s pretty cool. It’s fun.” Some published reports suggest the MOP could dig 200 feet into the earth before its 5,300 pounds of explosives detonate. Analysts differ on whether that’s realistic. The bomb’s metal needed to be strong enough to withstand being dropped on a bunker, a target that might be made of steel-reinforced concrete, and its shape had to be slender enough to pierce the ground like a needle into your skin. The relatively skinny shape — they stretch 20.5 feet long with a 31.5-inch diameter — is why the heavier bomb made for the B-2 can carry less than a third as much H6 explosive as the MOAB. A 2005 paper published by the Union of Concerned Scientists discussed the potential damage of bunker-busting and its limits. “By exploding just a few meters underground instead of at or above the surface, a much larger fraction of the energy of the explosion is transmitted to the ground,” the document said. “The explosion creates a strong seismic shock wave that propagates and can crush or damage an underground bunker. … “Nevertheless, even nuclear weapons have limited effectiveness at destroying the deepest or widely separated underground bunkers,” the report continued. “For example, an earth penetrating weapon using the 1.2 megaton B83 warhead — the highest yield weapon in the U.S. nuclear stockpile — could crush underground bunkers to a depth of about 1,000 feet. Deeper bunkers can be constructed with modern tunneling equipment, and are essentially invulnerable to nuclear attack.” Boeing made 20 of the B-2’s bunker busters, delivered and tested in 2011, for $30 million. The Air Force has not said how many remain in the arsenal after testing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Analysts have long seen the MOP as a potential weapon to be used on deeply buried nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea. That’s one reason why they’ve been fitted to the B-2 bomber. The stealth jet is used rarely, typically on targets where air defenses pose a significant threat and a plane virtually invisible to radar can sneak through on a first-strike bombing run. In the recent Afghanistan bombing, the MOAB was dropped from an MC-130 cargo plane. Islamic State fighters on the ground had no way to shoot down a plane. That meant there would be little need to risk one of Whiteman’s 20 B-2s, jets that cost $2 billion — and — counting and are essentially irreplaceable. In Iran or North Korea, a jet without radar-dodging powers might easily get shot down. That makes the B-2 a more likely candidate — along with standoff weapons like the Tomahawk cruise missiles used earlier in April on a Syrian airfield. The MOAB was largely designed for what the military strategists consider “softer” targets — infantry troops and non-armored vehicles. It also could prove devastating for the sort of compound hit in Afghanistan, a relatively primitive tunnel complex that lacked the steel- or concrete-hardened bunkers found at critical locations in Iran or North Korea. “So if you’re trying to block cave entrances or collapse rudimentary tunnel complexes, you might use the MOAB,” said Mark Gunzinger, a former B-52 pilot and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “If you’re trying to penetrate a very hardened, very deep structure, you might want something to penetrate into the target or to a deep enough depth that you cause damage inside. “You have to select the kind of weapon you want to use,” he said. “It’s not always a bigger blast.” Discuss Print Posted in Mct, National and World on Sunday, April 16, 2017 6:00 am.

The water year that began in October now ranks as the fourth-wettest in recorded Seattle history, with nearly 43 inches of rain as of Thursday. Enjoy the sun. But first, check out our review of local tech news: —This week, we brought you news of a new early-stage venture fund being organized in Seattle by a trio of angel investors. The people behind Flying Fish Partners aren’t saying much yet, but they do note investments in three local startups. —Seattle-based international money transfer provider Remitly has added the United Kingdom as its third “send” country, allowing people living there to send money to India and the Philippines. Remitly already offers its services in the U.S. and Canada. Here’s a recent story on Remitly’s efforts to advocate for immigrants and immigration policy reform. —Seattle-based VR startup Pluto VR raised $13.9 million from Seattle-area venture firms. As GeekWire reports, the Series A funding round was led by Maveron, whose co-founder, Dan Levitan, joins the board. Madrona Venture Group and Trilogy Equity Partners participated in the funding, as well as individual investors. —Microsoft is pursuing a novel electricity-buying arrangement in Washington that would allow it to contract directly with renewable energy producers instead of buying power through investor-owned utility Puget Sound Energy. As The Seattle Times’ reports, Microsoft’s pursuit of carbon-free power “shows how the private sector can help push suppliers toward alternative-power sources, even as the Trump administration calls for production of fossil fuels.” —The University of Washington and Tohoku University of Japan announced a new effort to collaborate on research and education in areas including clean energy technology for transportation, materials, and seismic engineering. The two institutions have strengths in similar fields. The regions where they’re located also share substantial earthquake risks. As noted in a news release announcing the collaboration: “Tohoku University is home to the International Research Institute of Disaster Science, established shortly after the region saw heavy damage and loss of life in the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011. A similar event could strike the Pacific Northwest at any time.” The Academic Open Space, as this more formalized pan-Pacific effort is being called, will build on existing collaborations between researchers at the two universities in aerospace design and composite materials. The effort is being led by Fumio Ohuchi, interim chair of the UW Department of Materials Science & Engineering. “By location, faculty expertise, industrial partners, and even shared seismic hazards, there are many ways that these two universities complement one another and can work well together,” Ohuchi said in a news release. —Speaking of seismic risk and Tohoku, the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network announced the release of a “production prototype” of the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system for Washington and Oregon. The prototype became available in California last year. It’s designed to give government agencies, utilities, and companies—and eventually the general public, if funding materializes—at least a few seconds of advance notice that shaking is about to begin, and how severe it’s expected to be. The system has been available to a group of beta users including Boeing, Microsoft, Sound Transit, and others since 2015. This week, the PNSN said early users are now integrating the alerts into earthquake response systems to automate the shutdown of critical infrastructure upon receipt of a warning. As the video below explains, the ShakeAlert system is designed to work like this: Monitoring stations detect the faster-moving but less-damaging seismic waves that emit from beneath an earthquake’s epicenter, triggering warnings that are sent out to users before the slower but larger-amplitude damaging waves arrive. The idea is this would give people enough time to “drop, cover, and hold on,” step away from dangerous machines or chemical storage, and shut off gas and electrical supplies to reduce potential damage from the quake. Various government agencies receiving the alerts can also stop traffic on roads, rails, and airport runways; stop surgeries; and prepare for emergency response. Of course, the amount of warning anyone receives will depend on their distance from the epicenter. The system has been funded thus far through public-private partnerships including the U.S. Geological Survey, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, the California Geological Survey, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the California Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Washington, the University of Oregon, the University of Nevada at Reno and Central Washington University. The USGS says another $38.3 million is needed to develop the system to the point where it can issue public alerts. It will require a $16.1 million annual budget for operations and maintenance. In March, the U.S. House passed the Pacific Northwest Earthquake Preparedness Act of 2017, which, among other things, directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency to fund an earthquake early warning system.

Image Credit: James Vaughan / SpaceFlight Insider The NASA Office of Inspector General has issued an audit detailing that the space agency’s Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) will likely not take to the Florida skies in 2018. However, this might be a moot point as NASA is considering flying EM-1 with a crew, which would push the launch to 2019 at the earliest. These are just some of a myriad of issues facing the first flight of the agency’s new super-heavy-lift launch system. The 77-page report, titled NASA’s Plans For Human Exploration Beyond Low Earth Orbit, was released on Thursday, April 13. It noted that the first astronauts to use the rocket as their means of transportation to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit will likely not do so until 2021 at the earliest.

Crew safety is something that NASA and its fleet of contractors take seriously and, as such, concerns for the well-being of astronauts who will use the Orion spacecraft (which will be launched atop the SLS) were also reviewed in the OIG document. According to page 25 of the report: To achieve a crewed EM-1 flight, in our judgment NASA must address not only the additional risks associated with human travel but also a host of existing risks to planned missions. For example, as noted earlier in this report, NASA is working to mitigate risks relating to the Orion’s environmental control system and to the EUS for the current EM-2 flight profile scheduled to launch no earlier than 2021 and more likely in 2023. Even if NASA does not use the EUS on an accelerated EM-1 crewed flight, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage will need to be certified to carry astronauts, and significantly the integrated SLS/Orion system, Orion’s heat shield, and ESD software will not undergo a test flight before astronauts are placed on board. Meanwhile, representatives from the space agency have noted that NASA is monitoring a wide range of factors that could potentially impact the super-heavy-lift rocket’s first flight. “NASA is reviewing the production schedules across the enterprise, taking into account factors such as integrated manufacturing, test, and processing schedules based on assumptions relating to FY 2017 appropriations and the President’s 2018 budget request, projection of European Service Module delivery, first time production issues related to the core stage, and the historic tornado that directly impacted the Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in Louisiana in February,” NASA’s Bob Jacobs told SpaceFlight Insider. “Following this review, NASA will update the integrated schedule and the EM-1 launch readiness date.” As Jacobs noted, EM-1 has been dealt delays both from partnerships and nature. In February of this year, 2017, NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) was struck by a tornado. The MAF is where the core stage of the agency’s SLS booster is being produced. Meanwhile, another delay, one involving the Orion spacecraft, has cropped up with the vehicle’s Service Module that is being produced by the European Space Agency (ESA). The OIG report noted in its September 2016 report that it has undergone design changes and will likely be delivered to NASA five to 10 months later than planned. “Because the new Orion service module differs from the module flown during the first Orion test flight in December 2014, assembly integration, and processing of the new module may delay the transfer of Orion to the [Ground Systems Development and Operations] program for integration with the SLS,” the report reads. Indeed, representatives with NASA have stated that these issues will likely cause the flight of EM-1 to “likely slide well into 2019”. The OIG also noted that the cost for the space agency’s proposed “Journey to Mars” will be an expensive one if the U.S. opts to undertake the effort unilaterally. According to the OIG: In addition to the technical and health-related challenges of deep space missions, such a multi-decadal venture will be very expensive, with NASA’s budget projections for human exploration to Mars exceeding $210 billion by 2033. However, NASA representatives have repeatedly noted that any mission(s) to Mars would and should likely be international affairs – something on the order of what the U.S. space agency has planned will require the contributions of multiple countries. At present, NASA is operating under a two-tiered approach to crewed space exploration. Private companies Boeing and SpaceX are developing their CST-100 Starliner and Crew Dragon spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station, while NASA will use the SLS to explore much farther than low-Earth orbit that these private firms would operate in.   Tagged: EM-1 European Space Agency Lead Stories NASA NASA Office Inspector General Orion Space Launch System Jason Rhian Jason Rhian spent several years honing his skills with internships at NASA, the National Space Society and other organizations.
