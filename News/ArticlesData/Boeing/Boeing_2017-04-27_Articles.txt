(Xinhua/Zhao Yun) Spring may be the planting season for farmers, but this year it is the season that the world's major aircraft makers harvest what they have sown. In March and April, Airbus, Boeing and Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) have all announced milestones that their aircraft have passed on the way to production. On Sunday, COMAC put its C919 through a trial run on the tarmac, testing the aircraft's capabilities to take off. The test took the jet down the runway to the point where its nose landing gear came off the ground - a crucial test to pass before an aircraft can take its maiden flight. So far, C919 has received 570 orders from 23 customers. Domestic media has covered every step of the C919's progress toward that flight, which has been twice delayed due to production issues. Still, the most recent reports have stated that the single-aisle passenger jet could undertake its inaugural flight at the beginning of May. The maiden flight marks the beginning of a comprehensive sequence of test flights and diagnostics that an aircraft needs to get certified. The C919's recent test followed news that Boeing's 737 MAX 9 had completed its maiden flight earlier in April. The 737 MAX 9 is the second member of Boeing's 737 MAX family. The narrow-body passenger jet can carry up to 220 passengers and can fly as far as 3,515 nautical miles. A few weeks earlier at the end of March, the Airbus A319neo completed its maiden flight. The aircraft, the smallest member of Airbus' A320neo family, took off from Hamburg, Germany, and landed in Toulouse, France, after a five-hour flight. The history of the 737 MAX and A320neo families serves as something of a road map for how to advance aircraft development. About a decade ago, the two aerospace giants both found themselves in need of revamping their aging but popular single-aisle aircraft: the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320. In 2010, Airbus launched the A320neo with a new engine. Airlines applauded the new design, which received a multitude of orders. Under pressure from Airbus' new aircraft, Boeing responded the following year with its 737 MAX program. Boeing promoted the new design as being more fuel efficient than the A320neo. Airbus has received more than 5,000 A320neo orders from more than 90 customers. The first 737 MAX 8 came off the production line at the end of 2015. In March, U.S.-based Boeing announced that U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had certified the 737 MAX 8 for commercial use. The company is now in the final stage of preparing for the first 737 MAX 8 deliveries in the second quarter of this year, several months ahead of schedule. Although the first 737 MAX came out a year later than the first A320neo, the Boeing jet was still a hit with customers. Boeing has received more than 3,700 orders from 86 customers worldwide for the aircraft, making it the fastest-selling plane in Boeing's history. Boeing also said it will have more Boeing 737 MAX aircraft coming out of its factory in Zhoushan, East China's Zhejiang Province. Despite Boeing's success with the 737 MAX, Airbus has managed to take a big share of the market for single-aisle passenger jets with its A320neo family. Airbus has called the aircraft family the world's best-selling single-aisle product line. 12> Also in the News Showbiz2016/06/16 13:58April 28 2017 15:03:59 Nicole Kidman Recalls Oscar Glory: Loneliest Time Attending Shanghai International Film Festival, Nicole Kidman talks about her role in "Grace of Monaco".

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, April 28, 2017 ANKARA - IranAir has abandoned plans to take early delivery of a Boeing <BA.N> 777-300ER jetliner because the passenger plane is no longer available, the head of the Islamic Republic's national flag carrier was quoted as saying by Iranian media. Iran had been expected to receive the first of 80 aircraft ordered from the U.S. planemaker in April or May 2018, but Iranian media and industry sources said this month it might get the first Boeing jet a year earlier than expected under a proposal to swap deliveries with Turkish Airlines <THYAO.IS>. "Boeing had proposed to hand over a 777-300ER by summer after Turkish Airlines withdrew its order for it. We welcomed it ... However, when we were almost certain that we wanted the plane, it was no longer available," Chairman Farhad Parvaresh was quoted by Iran's English language Press TV as saying. Industry sources had said Boeing was in negotiations to release at least one 777-300ER originally built for Turkish Airlines, which is deferring deliveries due to weaker traffic following last year's failed coup attempt in Turkey. "We have currently stopped our negotiations in absence of the plane," Parvaresh was quoted as saying. Boeing said it does not comment on specific deliveries. "Boeing and Iran Air continue to work on implementing the sales contract for commercial passenger airplanes signed in December 2016, at which time we announced first deliveries are scheduled to start in 2018," a spokesman said. "We continue to follow the lead of the U.S. government on all our dealings with approved Iranian airlines." Since last year, when most sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers, Tehran has joined a long waiting list for new airplanes and the swap would have allowed it to speed up its fleet renewal. IranAir has also ordered 100 aircraft from Europe's Airbus <AIR.PA> under a deal to lift most sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program, and has taken three deliveries. Iran's return to the aviation market after decades of sanctions is a boon to planemakers trying to dispose of some new planes discarded by airlines facing economic difficulties. But Western banks continue to shy away from financing deals between IranAir and Western companies, fearing U.S. banking sanctions that remain in force or a new chill in relations between Tehran and the West under U.S. President Donald Trump.

The world’s second-largest planemaker after Boeing said adjusted operating profit fell to €240 million ($261.7 million) as revenues rose 7 percent to 12.988 billion. Analysts were on average expecting adjusted operating income of 344 million euros, down 31 percent, and 5.5 percent higher revenues of 12.857 billion, according to a Reuters poll. Airbus said it was still worried about problems with temperamental engines for its new A320neo passenger plane from Pratt & Whitney, and commercial exposure on the troubled A400M military aircraft program. It expects deliveries of the A320neo once again to fall predominantly in the latter part of the year, but has said it hopes to avoid the last-minute rush seen in December last year. The engine issues “need to be resolved,” Airbus said in a statement. The Airbus planemaking business saw 31 percent lower profit despite a 13 percent rise in revenues. The Toulouse-based firm said this reflected a different mix of aircraft, with more of the new A350s delivered in the first quarter, “transition pricing” and higher production ramp-up costs. New aircraft tend to be sold at heavier discounts to spur further orders. The Airbus Helicopters unit slipped into loss as the world’s largest commercial helicopter maker continues to suffer from the grounding of aircraft in UK and Norway, following a crash that killed North Sea oil workers. For 2017, Airbus expects to deliver over 720 aircraft and to report mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income. Airbus’ results came a day after Boeing reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit, with its US rival also lifting its full-year forecast. Net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose to $1.5 billion. Boeing said declining costs boosted earnings for the latest quarter. But revenues fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company underperformed in terms of revenues. The firm has been trimming jobs in its civil aviation division due to slowing sales. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged to have a “sharp focus on performance and productivity” to reach its financial targets. Boeing plans to cut hundreds of engineering jobs on June 23 and expects additional cuts by the end of the year. Since the start of 2017, it has eliminated 3,500 positions, or about 2.3 percent of its staff at the end of 2016. “We are having to deal with a lot of competitive realities in the marketplace,” Muilenburg said. While Boeing has experienced net job loss, it has been adding some technology-oriented positions out of recognition that “we need to fuel the research and development for the future,” Muilenburg said. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, down seven from the same period of 2016. Commercial deliveries are closely scrutinized by Wall Street because of their connection to revenues. Boeing modestly increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $10.35 to $10.55, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate. Muilenburg said he was encouraged that President Donald Trump had nominated two board members for the Export-Import Bank, which has been hamstrung due to a lack of a quorum following an effort by some in Congress to eliminate the bank. Muilenburg called the nominations “a very big step” and said he was hopeful “that soon we’ll see a fully operational board.” The Ex-Im Bank has sometimes been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” because of its role in providing key financing to Boeing customers over the years to purchase aircraft.

But revenues fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company underperformed in terms of revenues. The firm has been trimming jobs in its civil aviation division due to slowing sales. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged to have a “sharp focus on performance and productivity” to reach its financial targets. Boeing plans to cut hundreds of engineering jobs on June 23 and expects additional cuts by the end of the year. Since the start of 2017, it has eliminated 3,500 positions, or about 2.3 percent of its staff at the end of 2016. “We are having to deal with a lot of competitive realities in the marketplace,” Muilenburg said. While Boeing has experienced net job loss, it has been adding some technology-oriented positions out of recognition that “we need to fuel the research and development for the future,” Muilenburg said. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, down seven from the same period of 2016. Commercial deliveries are closely scrutinized by Wall Street because of their connection to revenues. Boeing modestly increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $10.35 to $10.55, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate. Muilenburg said he was encouraged that President Donald Trump had nominated two board members for the Export-Import Bank, which has been hamstrung due to a lack of a quorum following an effort by some in Congress to eliminate the bank. Muilenburg called the nominations “a very big step” and said he was hopeful “that soon we’ll see a fully operational board.” The Ex-Im Bank has sometimes been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” because of its role in providing key financing to Boeing customers over the years to purchase aircraft.

Just a day before Trump announced he would revive the Export-Import Bank he met with former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, who supported the bank. After meeting with pharmaceutical executives Trump dropped his support for a plan backed by Democrats that would let Medicare negotiate bulk discounts for prescription drugs. The president "risks getting a one-sided view of policy" without more input from groups representing consumers or workers, says Brookings' Darrell West. Jacob Pramuk | @jacobpramuk 13 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters In Trump's White House, some say face time with a CEO can help to sway the stance of the president    15 Hours Ago | 01:41 When President Donald Trump said he would revive the embattled Export-Import Bank this month, it marked an about-face on an institution that Trump once slammed as "featherbedding" for big corporations. The decision was a win for American industrial titans General Electric and Boeing, which have foreign customers that use the bank's loans to buy products. Just a day before Trump first announced he would fill vacancies on the Ex-Im Bank's board, the president met with former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, who previously supported the bank in the face of conservative opposition on Capitol Hill. It is not clear whether the pair discussed the Ex-Im Bank at that meeting or how much McNerney or GE CEO Jeff Immelt — a member of a White House economic advisory group — affected Trump's stance on the issue. But the episode underscores a pattern whereby Trump, whose policy views are notoriously flexible, often modifies his political positions after face time with high-level executives. The businessman Trump has positioned his White House as uniquely business-friendly during his first 100 days in office, frequently showcasing meetings with executives as he aims to chop corporate tax rates and slash regulations. Trump's proximity to executives and his wish for splashy policy announcements have given major corporate CEOs a front seat to some policy decisions, experts said. "Smart CEOs will find a personal connection with him and have a lot of influence through direct lobbying, because he does not come to the Oval Office with a lot of specific policy preferences," said Michael Cohen, interim director of the political management program at George Washington University. "It is in some ways dangerous politically for him because he finds himself changing his mind based on who he is talking with rather than a deep independent analysis of the positives and negatives of policy options." Kevin Lamarque | Reuters resident Donald Trump speaks before signing an executive order directing federal agencies to recommend changes to a temporary visa program used to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill high-skilled jobs during a visit to the world headquarters of Snap-On Inc, a tool manufacturer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, U.S., April 18, 2017. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story. It's normal for presidents to take input from key American executives. But Trump has gone "further than most in formalizing the role and setting up an advisory committee of billionaires and top CEOs," said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. One of the president's economic advisory councils, chaired by billionaire Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, features the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, General Motors, Walt Disney and Wal-Mart, as well as McNerney. In recent months, Trump has held listening sessions with executives from the technology, health care and manufacturing industries, among others. The Ex-Im Bank is just one case in which Trump appeared to take feedback from CEOs into his policy decisions. West notes that Trump ordered a review of the H-1B visa program used widely at Silicon Valley technology companies, rather than taking more drastic steps that may endanger the program, after he met and discussed immigration with executives from companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet. Trump opposed the program on the campaign trail, saying it hurt American workers in favor of cheaper foreign workers. After meeting with pharmaceutical executives Trump dropped his support for a plan backed by Democrats that would let Medicare negotiate bulk discounts for prescription drugs. Trump's administration is in the process of making other major policy choices with corporate executives lobbying one way or another. Trump has yet to announce whether the United States will pull out of the landmark Paris climate agreement, which Trump pledged to "cancel" as a candidate. GE's Immelt and oil behemoth Exxon Mobil have spoken out in favor of upholding the deal. GE did not comment specifically on what Immelt has discussed with Trump in person. It pointed CNBC to a CNN interview in which Immelt said CEOs should largely "kind of keep their head down" but stand up to the president when they feel it is warranted. "So, I don't think it's something we should do every day, but I do think we're also stewards of our companies, we're representatives of the people that work with us, and I think we're cowards if we don't take a position occasionally on those things that are really consistent with what our mission is and where our people stand," Immelt said. Dow Chemical has also urged the Trump administration to "set aside" the findings of a scientific study that said a family of pesticides is harmful to roughly 1,800 threatened or endangered species. Dow CEO Andrew Liveris heads a Trump manufacturing working group, but it is unclear if he brought that issue up with the president personally. Dow did not respond to a request for comment on Liveris' conversations with Trump. He told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" Thursday that he is "pleased to see" the policy changes Trump has pushed in the White House. "I am very much involved, of course, for the company in what's going on in the White House," he said. "And I'm very pleased to see the [regulatory] reform agenda; I'm pleased to see what's going on in workforce training and activities there. Both of those I'm heavily involved in with the manufacturing initiative, as are 30 other CEOs." Brookings' West said meeting with CEOs, who often consider their own companies before consumers, can create problems in economic policy. Trump has included some labor leaders, for example, in his policy meetings, but executives heavily outnumber them.

The decision by American to push back some of its Boeing Co and Airbus orders comes two weeks after Delta Air Lines Inc said it was reviewing wide-body jet orders to address excess capacity, noting that reductions were likely over the next several years. While demand for smaller and more standardised narrowbody aircraft has proved resilient to economic weakness as leasing companies move them to where they are most needed, the market for the more customised widebody jets is more easily saturated as manufacturers bring out competing models simultaneously. American said alongside its earnings on Thursday that it was delaying first delivery of its Airbus A350 jets from 2018 to 2020 and deferring delivery of two Boeing 787-9s to the first quarter of 2019 from second-quarter 2018 to "provide widebody capacity flexibility" in its fleet. "We have some flexibility in how long we retain some of our other widebodies, so by pushing back the A350 we can keep those other planes longer, or not, in line with demand," American spokesman Joshua Freed said. American Airlines has 22 A350-900 passenger jets on order, according to the latest data from Airbus, which was hit by Delta´s decision to discuss delays in wide-body jet deliveries. Delta has no wide-body Boeing jets on order, but has unfilled orders for more than 50 Airbus wide-body jets including 25 A350-900s, the same number of future A330-900 aircraft and one current A330-300 model. Airbus Finance Director Harald Wilhelm said earlier he was not worried about signs of weakness because of a cushion of 6,700 unfilled orders. "What matters is whether the backlog is robust, whether there are any significant movements in there and I can clearly confirm that this is not the case," he told reporters after posting weaker first-quarter profits. Boeing said on Wednesday it was seeing "varying levels of near-term demand" for wide-body jets, but predicted a wave of replacement demand at the start of next decade.

Rodriguez announced that Venezuela will initiate a withdrawal process from the OAS. The procedure will last 24 months. On the night of March 25, the Foreign Minister warned that, in the event of a meeting of Foreign Ministers, Maduro’s dictatorship would formally begin Venezuela’s withdrawal from the Organization of American States.

Well, they kept their word. “Today, the people of Venezuela are waging a battle for their sovereignty, and we know that our diplomacy has nothing to do with the shameful history of the OAS,” Rodríguez added. The process, she explained, “would take 24 months” and would cost at least US $8.7 million, which is a considerable amount for a country so heavily in debt. Article 143 of the OAS Charter states that the country that leaves the organization must endure a two-year process and pay the outstanding debt of its installment as a member of the OAS. As of December 2016, the debt stood at $8,764,449. Despite the Rodriguez’s threats, opposition Congressmen Delsa Solorzano stated: “The only way we can no longer be part of these multilateral organizations would be through a constitutional reform,” which is why “… Venezuela’s eventual withdrawal from the OAS does not seem valid.” Source: Efecto Cocuyo CNN Español Orlando Avendaño Orlando Avendaño is a PanAm Post intern who resides in Caracas, Venezuela, where he studies social communication at Andrés Bello Catholic University.

As bad as this flip-flop is, his excuses for doing so are downright pitiful. As a candidate in August 2015, Trump categorized the bank as “feather bedding,” adding, “I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage. I think it’s unnecessary. And when you think about free enterprise, it’s really not free enterprise.” He was right, of course, but that was then. On Friday, the president announced his intention to nominate former New Jersey Rep. Scott Garrett as bank president and former Rep. Spencer T. Bachus III to the Ex-Im board. If the two are confirmed, the bank will return to full operation after 21 months without a board quorum—which prohibited deals exceeding $10 million. Read More: Chavista Paramilitary Violence Leaves Three Dead in Venezuela Read More: FARC Guerrilla Throws Full Support behind Venezuela Dictatorship And that means billions of taxpayer dollars to foreign firms and foreign governments with which to purchase exports from favored multinational companies such as Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar. The best course of action would be to eliminate the bank altogether. There is no shortage of private export financing, and the subsidies distort credit and labor markets. Perhaps worst of all, unsubsidized American companies are placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to the foreign firms collecting Ex-Im subsidies. (Delta, for example, loses out when Air India gets a sweetheart deal from Boeing by way of Ex-Im.) A Meritless Flip-Flop The White House is making much of the fact that Garrett has been a critic of Ex-Im, twice voting against renewal of the bank charter. That supposedly portends reform, although Congress has previously tried to do so without appreciable effect. No amount of bureaucratic tinkering can shield taxpayers from bailouts in the event that bank reserves run dry—as occurred in the 1980s—nor protect American businesses from the disadvantages of the U.S. government subsidizing their foreign competitors. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1459522593195-0'); }); In an April 12 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump acknowledged that he had been “very much opposed” to the bank but changed his mind because “lots of small companies will really be helped. “But also maybe more importantly,” he said, “other countries give it, and … we lose a tremendous amount of business.” He also added, “So instinctively you would say it’s a ridiculous thing but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money.” All of which is nonsense. Bank proponents focus on small firms to deflect attention from the fact that the vast majority of Ex-Im beneficiaries are titans of industry that are well-positioned to prosper without Ex-Im subsidies. They do not lack access to private capital, and most have billions of dollars of backorders with which to keep production going. In recent years, the bank supported less than half of 1 percent of small businesses—which in many cases aren’t so small. (The bank’s definition of “small business” includes manufacturers with as many as 1,500 employees and service firms and retailers with as much as $20.5 million in annual revenues.) On their own, businesses with fewer than 500 employees account for 98 percent of all firms exporting goods, and exports have reached high levels in recent years. In fiscal year 2016, for example, U.S. exports totaled $2.2 trillion, with Ex-Im supporting just 0.22 percent ($5 billion). That makes one thing very clear: Export financing obviously is not a problem for small firms in the aggregate. This is further validated by the fact that small businesses ranked “Exporting My Products/Services” as the least problematic of 75 business problems assessed in the 2016 annual survey by the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation. (The cost of health care ranked as the most severe problem. The president would do well to focus on that rather than resuscitate Ex-Im.) In the event that a small business cannot access private capital, it can seek to export through wholesalers or associate its business operations with larger firms or with global supply chains. The real beneficiaries are the big boys like Boeing (market cap $110 billion), and the extent to which the bank caters to the company is staggering. Read More: Donald Trump and the GOP Are Missing their Chance at “Draining the Swamp” As of March 2014, at least 28 percent ($32 billion) of Ex-Im’s total portfolio was devoted to financing wide-body jets. In 2013, the bank authorized financing for the purchase of Boeing aircraft in 25 countries, including China, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. Subsidies for air transport, in general, comprised more than 45 percent of all export subsidies that year. General Electric (market cap $256 billion) is another top Ex-Im beneficiary. The company began 2017 with a record backlog of $321 billion. Likewise, Caterpillar (market cap $54 billion) posted a backlog of $12 billion at the end of 2016. Ex-Im Doesn’t ‘Level the Playing Field’ The claim that U.S. companies will lose sales to foreign competitors without Ex-Im financing is also drivel. Economist Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center has documented that only about a third of Ex-Im financing—which benefits just 2 percent of all U.S. exports—is designated in bank records as necessary to counter subsidized foreign competition. A whopping 66 percent of the financing classified as necessary to counteract foreign competition went to Boeing. In other words, Ex-Im Bank financing counteracts foreign subsidies for less than 1 percent of U.S. exports—with more than half the benefit accruing to Boeing. Finance costs are only one among a variety of factors that affect a purchaser’s choice of supplier. Availability, reliability, and stability all play significant parts in purchase decisions. There should be no question that U.S. firms are capable of competing successfully without corporate welfare. The claim of “competitive disadvantage” is further belied by the agreement among 31 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to abide by a set of financing rules covering loan term limits, minimum fees, and other practices. There is rarely such a thing as a “level playing field” in trade. Every country has advantages that others lack. The ingenuity and drive of American companies can, in many instances, trump the export subsidies doled out by foreign governments—assuming, of course, that tax and regulatory barriers do not further restrict free enterprise. It is silly for Ex-Im advocates to cite China’s massive subsidies as proof that Ex-Im is necessary. Do they really want America to emulate a country in which all the largest enterprises are owned by the state? As reported in The Wall Street Journal, almost 14 percent of China’s listed, nonfinancial companies’ profits are attributable to government support, according to an analysis by Wind Info. And let’s not forget that Trump campaigned on challenging China’s trade practices. He cannot now claim with any credibility that we must match its subsidies to stay competitive. An Anti-Market Institution Perhaps most disappointing, though, is the president’s defense of Ex-Im based on its potential to “make money.” That statement, out of all his others, insults the very concept of free enterprise and limited government. By that rationale, Washington should assume control of all profitable companies to feed its insatiable appetite for spending. In any event, the claim that Ex-Im is profitable is illusory: The bank uses “accrual” accounting, which does not factor in the risk of defaults related to bank financing. For example, under current accounting methods, bank officials claim that Ex-Im will return a $14 billion surplus to taxpayers in the next decade. But the Congressional Budget Office reported in 2014 that Ex–Im programs, if subjected to the fair value accounting methods required of private banks, actually operate at a deficit that will cost taxpayers some $2 billion over 10 years (in addition to the bank’s operating costs). Ex-Im advocates offer myriad excuses for maintaining government interference in export financing, including job creation, gaps in private investment, and government subsidies lavished on foreign firms. Such justifications do not stand up to the facts, and the purported benefits—if any—are not commensurate with the risk to taxpayers. The president has made a huge mistake on Ex-Im, but it isn’t too late for him to change direction—back to where he was in the first place.

(Daily Signal) By Diane Katz President Donald Trump has apparently changed his mind about eliminating the crony Export-Import Bank, opting to “reform” the swamp rather than drain it. As bad as this flip-flop is, his excuses for doing so are downright pitiful. As a candidate in August 2015, Trump categorized the bank as “feather bedding,” adding, “I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage. I think it’s unnecessary. And when you think about free enterprise, it’s really not free enterprise.” He was right, of course, but that was then. On Friday, the president announced his intention to nominate former New Jersey Rep. Scott Garrett as bank president and former Rep. Spencer T. Bachus III to the Ex-Im board. If the two are confirmed, the bank will return to full operation after 21 months without a board quorum—which prohibited deals exceeding $10 million. Read More: Chavista Paramilitary Violence Leaves Three Dead in Venezuela Read More: FARC Guerrilla Throws Full Support behind Venezuela Dictatorship And that means billions of taxpayer dollars to foreign firms and foreign governments with which to purchase exports from favored multinational companies such as Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar. The best course of action would be to eliminate the bank altogether. There is no shortage of private export financing, and the subsidies distort credit and labor markets. Perhaps worst of all, unsubsidized American companies are placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to the foreign firms collecting Ex-Im subsidies. (Delta, for example, loses out when Air India gets a sweetheart deal from Boeing by way of Ex-Im.) A Meritless Flip-Flop The White House is making much of the fact that Garrett has been a critic of Ex-Im, twice voting against renewal of the bank charter. That supposedly portends reform, although Congress has previously tried to do so without appreciable effect. No amount of bureaucratic tinkering can shield taxpayers from bailouts in the event that bank reserves run dry—as occurred in the 1980s—nor protect American businesses from the disadvantages of the U.S. government subsidizing their foreign competitors. In an April 12 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump acknowledged that he had been “very much opposed” to the bank but changed his mind because “lots of small companies will really be helped. “But also maybe more importantly,” he said, “other countries give it, and … we lose a tremendous amount of business.” He also added, “So instinctively you would say it’s a ridiculous thing but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money.” All of which is nonsense. Bank proponents focus on small firms to deflect attention from the fact that the vast majority of Ex-Im beneficiaries are titans of industry that are well-positioned to prosper without Ex-Im subsidies. They do not lack access to private capital, and most have billions of dollars of backorders with which to keep production going. In recent years, the bank supported less than half of 1 percent of small businesses—which in many cases aren’t so small. (The bank’s definition of “small business” includes manufacturers with as many as 1,500 employees and service firms and retailers with as much as $20.5 million in annual revenues.) On their own, businesses with fewer than 500 employees account for 98 percent of all firms exporting goods, and exports have reached high levels in recent years. In fiscal year 2016, for example, U.S. exports totaled $2.2 trillion, with Ex-Im supporting just 0.22 percent ($5 billion). That makes one thing very clear: Export financing obviously is not a problem for small firms in the aggregate. This is further validated by the fact that small businesses ranked “Exporting My Products/Services” as the least problematic of 75 business problems assessed in the 2016 annual survey by the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation. (The cost of health care ranked as the most severe problem. The president would do well to focus on that rather than resuscitate Ex-Im.) In the event that a small business cannot access private capital, it can seek to export through wholesalers or associate its business operations with larger firms or with global supply chains. The real beneficiaries are the big boys like Boeing (market cap $110 billion), and the extent to which the bank caters to the company is staggering. Read More: Donald Trump and the GOP Are Missing their Chance at “Draining the Swamp” As of March 2014, at least 28 percent ($32 billion) of Ex-Im’s total portfolio was devoted to financing wide-body jets. In 2013, the bank authorized financing for the purchase of Boeing aircraft in 25 countries, including China, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. Subsidies for air transport, in general, comprised more than 45 percent of all export subsidies that year. General Electric (market cap $256 billion) is another top Ex-Im beneficiary. The company began 2017 with a record backlog of $321 billion. Likewise, Caterpillar (market cap $54 billion) posted a backlog of $12 billion at the end of 2016. Ex-Im Doesn’t ‘Level the Playing Field’ The claim that U.S. companies will lose sales to foreign competitors without Ex-Im financing is also drivel. Economist Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center has documented that only about a third of Ex-Im financing—which benefits just 2 percent of all U.S. exports—is designated in bank records as necessary to counter subsidized foreign competition. A whopping 66 percent of the financing classified as necessary to counteract foreign competition went to Boeing. In other words, Ex-Im Bank financing counteracts foreign subsidies for less than 1 percent of U.S. exports—with more than half the benefit accruing to Boeing. Finance costs are only one among a variety of factors that affect a purchaser’s choice of supplier. Availability, reliability, and stability all play significant parts in purchase decisions. There should be no question that U.S. firms are capable of competing successfully without corporate welfare. The claim of “competitive disadvantage” is further belied by the agreement among 31 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to abide by a set of financing rules covering loan term limits, minimum fees, and other practices. There is rarely such a thing as a “level playing field” in trade. Every country has advantages that others lack.

As millions of citizens take to the streets of Caracas and other Venezuelan cities to demand the end of socialist Nicolás Maduro's dictatorship, as they have been doing since last week, the international press has almost unanimously called for a return to liberal democracy and an end to the government's despicable repression against peaceful protesters. Even the formerly pro-Chávez New York Times, which publicly thanked the Comandante for his policies in a 2007 editorial, has changed its tune. The NYT is now denouncing the Chavista "government’s epic economic mismanagement and cronyism" while encouraging pressure for "Venezuela's leader to back down". And Maduro is facing pressure not only to end his deadly, Cuban-inspired tactics of repression, but also to relinquish his hold on power altogether. As Venezuelan journalist Pedro García Otero wrote in these pages on April 22: Reliable sources told the PanAm Post that Maduro’s decision to assign lawyer Hermann Escarrá and José Vicente Rangel, Chávez’s vice-president from 2002 to 2007, with the task of unblocking the political game and establishing a timetable for general elections... involves his ordered exit from power. The only condition would be a guarantee of some type of transitional justice for Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and possibly some members of his inner circle, all of whom would face serious criminal charges under ordinary circumstances... But while some evidence does hint at the possibility of Maduro stepping down and being replaced by a transitional government— in return, of course, for immunity for his crimes— other signs point to Maduro's utter contempt for public opinion, at home as well as abroad, and to his unabashed desire to hold on to the presidency regardless of the cost, which at this point is measured in terms of the corpses of innocent Venezuelans who needlessly perish beneath the Chavista regime's lethal yoke. Read More: Chavista Paramilitary Violence Leaves Three Dead in Venezuela Read More: FARC Guerrilla Throws Full Support behind Venezuela Dictatorship The latest piece of evidence in this regard is the arrival in Moscow of Vladimir Padrino, Maduro's Defense Minister, who announced in a video that he would meet his Russian counterpart, Sergey Kuzhugetovich Shoygu, at a conference of international defense. "I have come (to Moscow) upon the orders of President Nicolás Maduro," Padrino said in the video. He added: "I bring a very interesting, a very important point (to the conference), which is NATO's projection in Latin America, its consequences and risks." https://twitter.com/villegaspoljak/status/857278403606695936 Beyond the excuse of the conference, why is Maduro's Defense Minister, the man who "pulls the strings of power behind the scenes" in Venezuela according to García Otero, visiting Moscow precisely when massive citizen protests are posing an existential threat to the Chavista regime? The answer may have to do with what is perhaps the least analyzed aspect of the Venezuelan crisis: the geostrategic implications of a failed state in Venezuela from the point of view of the world's great powers. There certainly has been a shift in Washington's attitude toward the Venezuelan regime since Donald Trump arrived at the White House. As the PanAm Post explained in 2016, the Obama administration carried out a three-pronged strategy in Latin America, its aims being: Achieving the dangerous pact between Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the communist FARC guerrillas. Renewing diplomatic and commercial relations with the Castros' Cuba after more than five decades since the Cuban embargo was put in place. Appeasing the Maduro regime in Venezuela in order to guarantee the success of the Santos-FARC pact while preventing the implosion of the Cuban economy, which depends on Venezuelan oil for its survival (Obama wanted to avoid a Mariel Boatlift-type humanitarian crisis on the coasts of Florida). President Trump, however, has thrown this Obama-ite strategy out of his blacked-out Mar-a-Lago window. As President Elect, Trump encouraged the opposition to the Cuban dictatorship by denouncing Fidel Castro as a “brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades." Castro's legacy, Trump stated, "is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights." In a single paragraph, Trump utterly discarded all of Obama's wishy-washiness toward the Cuban regime, which even included an official visit to the island. Read More: Why Maduro May Be about To Leave Power in Venezuela Read More: Fearless Venezuelans: Protester Undresses, Climbs Tank, and Requests Ceasefire In January, Rex Tillerson, Trump's Secretary of State, announced that the US would revise its support for the Santos-FARC pact in Colombia. In other words, Santos could no longer count with the blank check he had enjoyed under Obama, who had pledged USD $450 million for the agreement's "implementation." In April, the Colombian mainstream media was scandalized when it learned that Trump had met Colombian ex-presidents Andrés Pastrana and Álvaro Uribe, the most visible opponents of the Santos-FARC deal, in his Florida resort more than a month before he was scheduled to receive Santos at the White House. While Colombian journalists mocked the two former presidents since unnamed sources cited only a brief encounter between Pastrana and Trump, only few noted that nobody runs into the president of the United States, the most carefully guarded man in the world, by accident, and that the Trump-Pastrana-Uribe meeting was arranged by Senator Marco Rubio. The Cuban-American senator helped deliver Florida for Trump in the election and he speaks to the president's ear about Latin America due to his knowledge of regional politics. Moreover, Trump is not exactly obsessed with following diplomatic protocol. In geostrategic terms, his meeting with Uribe and Pastrana was far more important than outraged Colombian journalists could realize. https://twitter.com/AndresPastrana_/status/853056886098231296 It was through Senator Rubio, in fact, that Lilian Tintori, wife of Leopoldo López, Venezuela's most prominent political prisoner, managed to meet Trump at the White House in February. The fact that the new US president welcomed Tintori and demanded López's freedom (via Twitter, natch) signalled that the days of Obama's appeasement of the Maduro regime were confined to history. In fact, Trump could deliver the much sought for coup-de-grâce to Maduro if he managed to halt or significantly reduce US imports of Venezuelan oil, a measure which would devastate the Chavista government. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832016501657968640 This brings us back to Russia. Another shift in US foreign policy since Trump came to power has been his return to traditional deterrence after Obama's "lead from behind" strategy allowed Vladimir Putin to truly flex Russia's muscles in the Middle East for the first time since the end of the Cold War. By propping up the murderous Assad regime in Syria amid the outcries of an impotent international community (i.e. the European Union and the Obama administration), Putin could show the world that Russia was reassuming its role as a world power after a brief, Gorbachev-and-Yeltsin-induced hiatus. While Obama famously allowed his threats of retaliation in Syria if Assad crossed the "red line" by using chemical weapons against civilians to go unheeded, Trump decided to take action after Assad's forces allegedly gassed innocent people in the northwestern province of Idlib. By launching 59 Tomahawk missiles against a Syrian airbase, Trump announced to the world- and to Putin- that a new sheriff was in town. As Victor Davis Hanson wrote: The Tomahawk volley attack, for all its ostentatious symbolism, served larger strategic purposes. It reminded a world without morality that there is still a shred of a rule or two... Trump's missiles changed the nature of the world's geopolitical game. As Owen Matthews argues in The Spectator, with Trump’s bombing of a regime airbase... Syria suddenly went from being an asset to Russia to being a dangerous liability. Instead of being a diplomatic multipurpose tool, the fallout from Trump’s Syria raid now threatens a series of Russian vital interests... The problem for Moscow is that it’s harder to get out of a war than into one. Moscow’s relationship with Trump and the future of sanctions are far more important priorities to Putin than the future of the Assad regime. Nonetheless, Pottery Barn rules apply — you broke it, you own it. Syria may no longer bring political dividends — but there’s no easy way for Putin to extract himself without losing face. By offering a tottering Maduro support in Venezuela just as he once saved Assad from his imminent overthrow, however, Putin could be opening a new front in his new cold war with America, this time in Washington's own backyard. This could explain Padrino's visit to Moscow at this critical moment as well as his insistence on the danger of NATO's "projection" in Latin America. As the Venezuelan crisis descends into a civil war, the country's internal conflict may be about to go global.     Weekly E-Newsletter Get the latest from PanAm Post direct to your inbox!

Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion in the first quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had estimated. Weak sales overshadowed a surprise gain in free cash flow as the manufacturer kept costs in check and started to reap a long-awaited payoff from the 787 Dreamliner. The report spotlighted Boeing's need to tamp down costs and make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn't raise its cash outlook -- a crucial number for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. "'The stock has been a highflier for a while," George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. "People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report." The shares dipped $1.80, or 1 percent, to close Wednesday at $181.71. Boeing rose 18 percent this year through Tuesday, the third-largest gain among the 30 members of the Dow Jones industrial average. The manufacturer plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain, and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing's factories. It represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane's manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a moneymaker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the plane-maker would consume $137 million during what's typically the company's slowest period. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body aircraft next month. First-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $1.45 billion, or $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared with the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate.

Rocket and Space Corporation Energia (RSC Energia) and Boeing have finally managed to reach a settlement over a sizeable $330 million debt incurred by the Russian company over the Sea Launch project. Russia's RSC Energia and US' Boeing have finally managed to hammer out a settlement following a lengthy litigation which began almost four years ago. "The settlement came into effect on February 22, and a joint claim was made by Boeing and RSC Energia on March 16. The California court made a final decision to end this litigation. The issue is now closed forever," Solntsev told RIA Novosti. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by Boeing. The goal of the project was to employ a mobile maritime launch platform to conduct commercial space launches from the equator which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. In 2009 Sea Launch Co LLC, the provider of the Sea Launch service, filed for bankruptcy, and in 2013 Boeing filed a lawsuit claiming that RSC Energia, PO Yuzhnoye and KB Yuzhnoye failed to reimburse Boeing for over $350 million paid to third-party creditors. On May 12, the US District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of Boeing, stating that Energia owed Boeing more than $320 million plus legal fees. According to Solntsev, both parties had to overcome numerous hurdles during the settlement negotiations but finally managed to reach a mutual compromise, and that the deal between Energia and Boeing will now allow the companies to engage in a number of joint ventures. "The details of these negotiations remain a commercial secret; what matters is that the partners were able to break the deadlock. We're now discussing ongoing and ambitious future joint projects, from trips to ISS to deep space flights, which would've been impossible without a settlement," he added. Solntsev also pointed out that the S7 Group which purchased the Sea Launch project, did not take part in the negotiations with Boeing and will not be making any payments to the US company.

Total revenue came in at $20.98 billion, a 7 percent drop from 1Q16. In the commercial aircraft division, revenue edged down 1 percent to $14.3 billion as fewer 737s were delivered. Boeing is transitioning to 737 MAX production, with entry into service of the new aircraft expected in May. The first quarter operating margin increased to 8.5 percent, from 7.2 percent, reflecting improved performance on production and services, the Chicago-based company said. Boeing took $27 billion of net orders in the quarter as the value of its backlog rose to $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the start of the period. The commercial aircraft division booked 198 net orders during the quarter, with the backlog now standing at more than 5,700 planes valued at $417 billion. Boeing’s chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said that milestones achieved during the quarter included certification of the 737 MAX 8 and first flight of the 787-10 Dreamliner. “We remain on track to achieve our full-year revenue, earnings and cash flow targets,” he said in a company statement. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft during the quarter, a drop of seven from last year. The 737 saw the biggest fall in deliveries as Boeing ramps up production of the 737 MAX. Wide-body deliveries were broadly similar to the first quarter 2016. Boeing maintained its 2017 delivery forecast of 760-765 commercial aircraft, and left its revenue guidance for that sector unchanged at $62.5 billion to $63.5 billion. Total revenue guidance is also unchanged at $90.5 billion to USD$92.5 billion.

[Photo by Yin Liqin/For China Daily] Domestic aircraft manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China said on Thursday that it has started work to develop a wide-body commercial jet with Russia, and the passenger plane is expected to be delivered within 10 years. The 280-seat wide-body jet would have a range of 12,000 kilometers. The project signals the two countries' ambitions to compete in the wide-body market, which is currently dominated by US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and European manufacturer Airbus Group SE. "Research and development of wide-body aircraft was launched recently," said He Dongfeng, vice-chairman and president of COMAC. The research and development for the jet will be conducted in Moscow, and the assembly work will be conducted in Shanghai, COMAC announced at November's Zhuhai Airshow. Li Xiaojin, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said: "It is hoped that the development of wide-body aircraft will drive the growth of many related aircraft manufacturing sectors in China. And China will be able to learn and apply the experiences from Russia, and enhance the manufacturing level of the nation's aviation industry. "Wide-body aircraft requires high standards in terms of aircraft engine technology and aircraft materials. China and Russia still face some difficulties in making competitive wide-body jets, given their current manufacturing levels," Li said. Meanwhile, the C919, China's first self-made passenger jet airliner, is technically ready for its maiden flight and will take to the skies soon, said the president of the Shanghai-based aircraft maker. COMAC said a variety of factors will be taken into consideration for C919's first flight, including the condition of the aircraft, the status of the crew and weather conditions. With the help of global cooperation, COMAC has managed to learn existing mature modes, adopt scientific methods, and utilize resources of the industry, technology and talent all over the world to create its own passenger jets. "COMAC's 256 leading suppliers come from 14 countries and regions, and our partners include leading aviation institutes and enterprises such as GE Co and Fokker Technologies Holding BV, and its OEMs including Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier Inc," said He from COMAC. Safety is the cornerstone of civil aviation, and it is all industry players' responsibility to keep flights safe, He said.

Boeing, which owns 80 percent of the 2,850-acre field lab in the southern hills of Simi Valley, secured the easement Tuesday from North American Land Trust, a national organization that holds more than 480 conservation easements in 18 states. The trust will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the easement. “Our vision is that Santa Susana will continue to be a place where mountain lions roam free, cultural artifacts remain undisturbed and oak woodlands have the opportunity to thrive,” said Steve Shestag, Boeing’s director of environment, in a statement provided to the Acorn this week. “We remain committed to completing a cleanup that fully protects everyone who will enjoy this vast open space habitat as well as our neighbors in the community.” Cleanup efforts by Boeing, NASA, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and U.S. Department of Energy have been underway at SSFL for nearly a decade. In 2007, Boeing committed to preserving its portion of the field lab as open space upon completion of the cleanup. Stephen Johnson, North American Land Trust president, said SSFL is a “critical link in a regional wildlife corridor” connecting the Santa Monica Mountains to Los Padres National Forest that is “essential for the survival of mountain lions” and other animals. Large, undisturbed portions of the site are also home to redtailed hawks, bobcats, mule deer and more. “We are thrilled to be able to collaborate with Boeing on the conservation of this incredible property,” Johnson said in a statement. “We will ensure that the property is protected forever, and that its natural and cultural resources are enhanced for the benefit of generations to come.” —Melissa Simon Return to top Copyright © 2004-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

The federal government says it will give Bombardier $372.5 million in repayable loans over four years to support the Global 7000 and CSeries aircraft projects. (THE CANADIAN PRESS / Paul Chiasson) Ross Marowitts, The Canadian Press Published Thursday, April 27, 2017 8:25PM EDT Last Updated Thursday, April 27, 2017 8:27PM EDT MONTREAL -- Bombardier and the federal government have rejected Boeing's claim in a complaint filed with the U.S. government that its Canadian rival has dumped its new CSeries commercial jet into the United States at below cost. "Bombardier structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing," the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer said in an emailed statement. The world's third-largest airplane maker said it spends about US$3 billion annually with U.S. suppliers and employs about 7,000 people in dozens of facilities in both rail and aerospace across 17 states. The Seattle-based competitor said Thursday that it petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is also seeking an order to be issued against the sale of the plane in the important American market. Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains said the government objects to the allegations and vowed to mount "a vigorous defence." "We are confident that our programs are consistent with Canada's international obligations," he said in a statement. Boeing said it asking the Trump administration to act "to end Bombardier's illegal and unfair business practices before it is too late to prevent significant harm to America's aerospace industry and thousands of good-paying aerospace jobs." The aerospace giant said the threat against its suppliers will only grow as Bombardier increases the annual production rate of the CSeries to between 90 and 120 airplanes by 2020. It said more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in "predatory pricing" for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Boeing claimed Bombardier has sold CSeries planes that cost US$33 million to produce for less than US$20 million each and at prices below what it charged in Canada. "It's selling the aircraft in the U.S. at prices that are millions lower than those that they're charging in Canada, which is the very definition of dumping," Boeing spokesman Daniel Curran said in an interview. Boeing joins Brazil, which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer. Delta Air Lines will become the first U.S. CSeries carrier after placing a firm order a year ago for 75 CS100 aircraft valued at US$5.6 billion. It also has options for 50 more planes and can covert some of the aircraft to larger CS300s. Air Canada followed by ordering 45 CS300s for US$3.8 billion at list prices, plus options for 30 more planes. Airlines typically pay much less than list prices and early buyers of new planes usually get low prices. The latest challenge against Bombardier's largest aircraft came just days after the U.S. imposed preliminary duties of up to 24 per cent on softwood lumber imported from Canada.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:50 AM, April 28, 2017 Updated: 8:35 AM, April 28, 2017 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK - Boeing Co on Thursday asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing for Canadian planemaker Bombardier's new CSeries airplane, adding to growing trade tensions between the United States and Canada. The petition against Canada's new competitor to the Boeing 737 aircraft came just days after the Commerce Department imposed duties averaging 20 percent on Canadian softwood lumber, saying that its origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he intended to begin renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, after White House officials said Trump had been considering an order to withdraw from the pact. Boeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta Air Lines Inc after losing a competition at United Airlines, had offered its planes to the airline at an "absurdly low" $19.6 million each, well below what it described as the aircraft’s production cost of $33.2 million. "Propelled by massive, supply creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States," Boeing said in its petition. Boeing's similarly sized 737-700 model has a list price of $83.4 million, with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at $92.2 million. Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 percent to 50 percent in the industry. In April 2016, Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated $5.6 billion based on the list price of about $71.8 million. In its complaint against Bombardier, Boeing argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, nor a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec in 2015. Boeing also took a shot at European rival Airbus, which it accuses of benefiting from similar "unfair" government subsidies in a long-running dispute before the World Trade Organization. Bombardier is “taking a page out of the Airbus strategy book” by trying to muscle into the U.S. market with cut-rate pricing, Boeing charged. A Commerce Department spokesman said the petition would be given "a thorough review" and further comment was premature. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has taken swift action in recent weeks to protect the U.S. steel and aluminum industries from foreign competition, launching national security investigations that could lead to import restrictions. An investigation could lead to duties on the aircraft to offset any below-cost pricing or any subsidies deemed unfair. In a statement, Canada's government objected to Boeing's allegations and noted that the CSeries has many U.S. suppliers, including for engines, and supports thousands of U.S. jobs. "The Government of Canada will mount a vigorous defense against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border," it said in the statement. Bombardier’s chief executive conceded the company had been “aggressive” on pricing in order to win, and sources familiar with the deal pegged the discount closer to two-thirds off the nominal list price. Bombardier said in a statement that it was reviewing the petition and structures its dealings to ensure compliance with all relevant laws. The request for anti-dumping measures was also addressed to the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent U.S. trade body that will review any decisions by the Commerce Department.

Friday, April 28, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Malaysia Airlines offers to lease A330s from Alitalia April 28, 2017, Friday MALAYSIA Airlines has offered to lease Airbus A330 jets from Alitalia if the struggling Italian airline is wound up, the Asian carrier’s chief executive said. Alitalia is preparing for special administration proceedings after workers rejected its latest rescue plan, making it impossible for the loss-making airline to secure funds to keep its aircraft flying. Workers are hoping the Italian government will step in with an alternative rescue deal. Malaysia Airlines could take between six and eight Airbus A330s from Alitalia, CEO Peter Bellew told Reuters in Dubai. “I hope Alitalia stays in business but it doesn’t look good to me today. I think it’s hard to see how they are going come back from the pressure they are sitting on at the moment,” he said. An Alitalia spokesman declined to comment. Malaysia Airlines is emerging from a turnaround after suffering two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared in what remains a mystery, and then flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Its load factors – or how full its planes are – averaged around 80 percent in the three months to March 31, Bellew said. Malaysia Airlines wants to lease between six and eight A330s or Boeing 777s for use from 2018 and a further seven to nine from 2019, he said, expecting to finalise most of those deals in the next four to six weeks. This is an increase on the six for 2018 and six for 2019 he told Reuters last month he was interested in. “The world really is awash right now” Bellew said with regard to spare widebody aircraft, adding that he also saw opportunities to take aircraft from Middle East carriers. “There are really good deals out there at the moment. It’s a buyer’s market right now.” Bellew also said he planned to make a decision on an order for 30-35 new Airbus A330neo or Boeing 787-9 widebody planes in the next four to six months to replace existing aircraft in its fleet from the end of 2019. “If the prices are good … we will do an order,” he said. “But they need to sharpen their pencils because they are still unrealistic with the pricing in the current market.” Malaysia Airlines would look for more leases if it doesn’t get the pricing it wants, he said. It could also convert or add to an existing order for 25 of Boeing’s new generation 737 MAX 8 narrowbody aircraft or the proposed bigger MAX 10 version currently being offered informally to the market by the U.S. planemaker. Bellew did not say how many could be ordered or when a decision might be made. Industry sources said on Tuesday that Boeing was nearing a decision to launch the MAX 10 plane at the Paris Airshow in June. Malaysia Airlines plans to trim its narrowbody fleet to between 35 and 40 aircraft from 54 currently and increase its number of widebodies from 15 to 35. The airline is aiming for a return to profitability by 2018 and stock market listing in March the following year. Bellew said he believed a majority of the airline would be listed. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

What those corporations actually fork over every year, however, is much smaller. On the state level, 240 Fortune 500 firms avoided paying $126 billion in income taxes between 2008 and 2015, a study released Thursday by the non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found. Of those 240 companies, 92 avoided state income taxes for at least one year during that period, and 49 paid no state income taxes for multiple years. (The institute examined 258 firms, and 240 made their state and local tax data available.) Some companies, such as Facebook, DuPont, Boeing, Merck and Eli Lilly, paid negative effective state tax rates for several of those eight years through rebates, credits or deductions, ITEP found. While state corporate tax rates, on paper, average at about 6.25 percent, according to the report, those firms—all of which were profitable during the period they were studied—paid an average rate of 2.9 percent. The study followed a similar report released by ITEP in March that pegged the average effective federal corporate tax rate, which Mnuchin and Cohn said would be slashed Wednesday, among 258 Fortune 500 companies at just 21.2 percent. A March report from the Congressional Budget Office using 2012 data more or less confirmed these disparities, while comparing statutory tax burdens shouldered by American companies to those of other countries in the Group of Twenty, or G-20, a consortium of developed nations. Although in theory the U.S. stood at the top of the list in terms of average combined state and federal corporate taxes, at 39.1 percent, it came in fourth when taking loopholes and subsidies into account, with an 18.6 percent rate. Corporate profits, meanwhile, have generally been on the rise. Just over three years ago, they hit their highest level in more than eight decades. After dipping slightly in 2015, they grew 22 percent between the final quarters of 2015 and 2016. Trump's plan is widely expected to accelerate the trend. In addition to winding down the statutory rate, the proposal called for a tax on the profits American corporations hold offshore, but would incentivize the return of those sheltered profits overseas with the promise of, as Mnuchin described it in the Wednesday press conference, “a very competitive rate that will bring back trillions of dollars.” The Treasury secretary, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, assailed the corporate rate in its current form, citing it as a reason companies hold many of their profits outside the U.S. “It is perhaps the most complicated and uncompetitive business rate in the world,” he said. “Not a surprise that companies leave trillions of dollars offshore.”National More Political Capital Are Shareholders About To Be Silenced?

Carney | Apr 12, 2017, 4:02 PM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn We knew that Trump is thoroughly impressionable, meaning that when the lobbyists, the bankers, and the special interests got his ear —" and this being the swamp, that was inevitable —" they could probably win him over. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) We knew Donald Trump wasn't a conservative. We knew he believed in government picking winners and losers. We knew he had an inordinate infatuation with with exports. We also knew that Trump is thoroughly impressionable, meaning that when the lobbyists, the bankers, and the special interests got his ear — and this being the swamp, that was inevitable — they could probably win him over. So when Trump said early in the campaign that he didn't think the Export-Import Bank (at that point it was in liquidation) should exist because the private sector can and does finance exports, I didn't get too excited. He was correct on the specific matter, but his personality suggested that this wouldn't last. His budget chief Mick Mulvaney said on CNBC (transcript via Reason) Wednesday that Trump was now pro-Ex-Im, and the president himself professed his love for Boeing's bank to the Wall Street Journal: The president said he planned to fill two vacancies on the bank's board, which has been effectively paralyzed with three open seats on its five-member board. "It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies," Mr. Trump said. "But also, maybe more important, other countries give [assistance]. When other countries give it we lose a tremendous amount of business." ... "Instinctively, you would say, 'Isn't that a ridiculous thing,'" Mr. Trump said of the Ex-Im Bank. "But actually, it's a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money." His argumentation here couldn't be less sound. He makes three points. All faulty to the extreme. 1) Starting at the end: "it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money." Ex-Im, if proper accounting methods are used, loses a tiny bit of money, according to the Government Accountability Office. But Trump seems to be seeing this government agency as a money-maker for the government. Is this what he meant by running the government like a business? That he was going to displace private sector players (and Ex-Im does displace private-sector financiers) in profitable business in order to profit? Why stop at export finance? Why not open a federal casino? Golf course? Or national health insurer? Also, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made money until they didn't, and then they crashed and were bailed out by the taxpayer. Corporate welfare's costs aren't mostly budgetary, but distortionary. I make these arguments at more length here. 2) "other countries give [assistance]. When other countries give it we lose a tremendous amount of business. ..." Most Ex-Im financing is not issued to counter foreign government financing, according to Ex-Im's own documents. Also, foreign governments harm themselves when they subsidize their own exports. Two economists estimate that China harms its economy by 3 percent when it subsidizes its exports. Does Trump know that Ex-Im mostly subsidizes the Chinese government? 3) "lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies. ..." In a typical year, less than 20 percent of Ex-Im's money subsidizes small exporters. In a typical year, about 40 percent of Ex-Im's money subsidizes Boeing exports. This isn't a small-business agency. Even the agency's "small-business" program subsidizes big business. And about 99 percent of small U.S. businesses never get support from Ex-Im. Ex-Im doesn't help the economy. It doesn't drain the swamp. It does boost the president's power to pick winners and losers, and maybe that's why Trump likes it. Timothy P.

The decision by American to push back some of its Boeing Co and Airbus orders comes two weeks after Delta Air Lines Inc said it was reviewing wide-body jet orders to address excess capacity, noting that reductions were likely over the next several years. While demand for smaller and more standardised narrowbody aircraft has proved resilient to economic weakness as leasing companies move them to where they are most needed, the market for the more customised widebody jets is more easily saturated as manufacturers bring out competing models simultaneously. American said alongside its earnings on Thursday that it was delaying first delivery of its Airbus A350 jets from 2018 to 2020 and deferring delivery of two Boeing 787-9s to the first quarter of 2019 from second-quarter 2018 to "provide widebody capacity flexibility" in its fleet. "We have some flexibility in how long we retain some of our other widebodies, so by pushing back the A350 we can keep those other planes longer, or not, in line with demand," American spokesman Joshua Freed said. American Airlines has 22 A350-900 passenger jets on order, according to the latest data from Airbus, which was hit by Delta’s decision to discuss delays in wide-body jet deliveries. Delta has no wide-body Boeing jets on order, but has unfilled orders for more than 50 Airbus wide-body jets including 25 A350-900s, the same number of future A330-900 aircraft and one current A330-300 model. Airbus Finance Director Harald Wilhelm said earlier he was not worried about signs of weakness because of a cushion of 6,700 unfilled orders. "What matters is whether the backlog is robust, whether there are any significant movements in there and I can clearly confirm that this is not the case," he told reporters after posting weaker first-quarter profits. Boeing said on Wednesday it was seeing "varying levels of near-term demand" for wide-body jets, but predicted a wave of replacement demand at the start of next decade.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Iridium Remains Confident in Its Long-Term Prospects The satellite communications company reported solid operational results as the deployment of the Iridium NEXT project continues. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Apr 27, 2017 at 9:45AM Upgrading a satellite communications system is a massive endeavor, and investors in satellite specialist Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) have seen how the process can take years to play out. With challenges ranging from preparing satellites for deployment to getting them safely into orbit, the importance of the entire Iridium NEXT project has had investors on the edge of their seats for quite a while. Coming into Thursday's first-quarter financial report, Iridium investors expected operating results to be mixed, with sluggish sales growth and a slight drop in earnings per share. The company's actual numbers were better than that, but the fact that Iridium kept its long-term future outlook unchanged was even more encouraging for those who believe in the potential that NEXT has. Let's look more closely at Iridium Communications and what its latest results mean for investors going forward. Image source: Iridium Communications. Iridium keeps gaining altitude Iridium Communications' first-quarter results continued to show the water-treading that the company has had to do as it awaits full implementation of Iridium NEXT. Total revenue rose just 0.2% to $104.4 million, which was slower than the roughly 1% growth rate that most investors were looking for from the satellite company. GAAP net income was up by a third to $37.9 million, producing earnings of $0.30 per share, easily topping the $0.20 consensus forecast. Looking more closely at Iridium's numbers, however, shows one key aspect of the quarter's success. The company recognized a $14.2 million boost to operating income from a one-time gain on a transaction with Boeing (NYSE:BA), in which Iridium brought on more than 180 Boeing employees to give the satellite company more direct management over its network. Without that gain, Iridium would have seen operating income decline from year-ago levels. Still, Iridium reported relatively solid performance in its core business. Total billable subscribers were up 10% from a year ago to 869,000, with the company citing growth in its machine-to-machine data services business and its offerings to government customers. On the commercial side of the business, service revenue rose 3% on a 1% rise in voice and data subscriber counts. Commercial average revenue per user fell slightly, but data subscriptions continued to gain momentum with outpaced growth compared to traditional voice services. Meanwhile, government service revenue was flat from year-ago levels, but subscriber counts were up sharply on a 21% rise in machine-to-machine data subscriptions. CEO Matt Desch expressed satisfaction with the company's performance. "Strong subscriber additions in commercial M2M helped to fuel Iridium's service revenue growth during the first quarter," Desch said, and the CEO believes that the satellite provider is in a good position to sustain growth going forward. What's ahead for Iridium? Most importantly, Iridium NEXT appears to be going well. In Desch's words, "Our first batch of Iridium NEXT satellites is now operational and working well for Iridium's global base of subscribers." The company expects its second SpaceX launch to happen in late June and remains hopeful about the timeline for full implementation. As things continue to go well, Iridium kept its guidance roughly unchanged. Service revenue should rise by roughly 3% to 5% this year, and Iridium still expects operational pre-tax operating earnings of $255 million to $265 million. Long-range outlooks include calls for between $440 million and $465 million in service revenue in 2019, with acceptable levels of leverage between now and then. Iridium investors didn't have a major reaction to the news immediately after the announcement, but that's not surprising because of the long-range nature of Iridium's current business prospects. Once Iridium NEXT has fully taken shape, investors will be in a better position to assess whether the efforts to which the satellite specialist has gone to upgrade its network will pay off with long-term growth in sales and profits.

After United overbooking controversy, Kelly also declared that Southwest will "cease to overbook going forward." 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters LUV CEO: Optimistic about growth, despite earnings miss    17 Hours Ago | 05:35 Southwest Airlines reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hit by higher operating expenses and a decline in average fares. Despite Southwest posting a miss on the top and bottom line, CEO Gary Kelly is still "optimistic about the future." "We're very optimistic about the future; the economy looks good, and fuel prices look moderate," Kelly told CNBC on Thursday. "This is one quarter where the consensus was too high, but we were right in line with guidance on revenues and cost guidance. So this too shall pass." In the midst of a United overbooking controversy that led to a passenger being dragged down the aisle, Kelly also declared that the company will "cease to overbook going forward." The airline's shares were down 4.5 percent at $54.40 in premarket trading on Thursday. The No. 4 U.S. airline by passenger traffic said its unit revenue, a metric that compares ticket sales with flight capacity, fell 2.8 percent in the quarter ended March 31. However, the Dallas-based carrier said it expects unit revenue in the current quarter to rise 1 to 2 percent. Earlier this month, bigger rival Delta Air Lines forecast its passenger unit revenue to rise 1 to 3 percent in the second quarter, citing improving demand and average fares. U.S. carriers have struggled to mark positive increases in unit revenue as cheaper fares and tougher competition have pummeled the industry. The budget airline's operating expenses increased 8.8 percent to $4.23 billion and its average passenger fare declined 2.6 percent in the first quarter. The company said its net income fell to $351 million, or 57 cents per share, in the quarter, from $513 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 61 cents per share, compared with estimates of 63 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating revenue rose 1.2 percent to $4.88 billion.

Sean Rayford/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump addresses a crowd at Boeing's facilities in North Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 17. Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump has said over and over that creating jobs is at the top of his agenda. It may seem unfair to judge his progress on this goal in his first 100 days, but Trump has opened the door to scrutiny by making his own assertions on job creation. During a White House meeting with CEOs on April 11, Trump claimed his administration had already created over 600,000 jobs. "You see what's going on. You see the numbers," he said. "We've created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it's going to really start catching on now because some of the things that we've done are big league and they are catching on." Politics Trump Can't Bring Back All Those Jobs From China. Here's What He Can Do Since the beginning of the year, the Labor Department says, the U.S. has created 533,000 jobs. Of course, Trump only took office on Jan. 20, and the January numbers are generally attributed to the outgoing president, because the new president hasn't had a chance to put his policies in place. So, at most Trump could take credit for 219,000 jobs in February and 98,000 in March. That's a total of about 317,000 — about half his original claim. (The White House website now touts "over 500,000 new jobs.") And there's a good argument to be made that presidents shouldn't take credit for a role in job creation until well into their first term, after they've had a chance to influence the course of events with policies or leadership. Trump has announced a number of executive actions that he says will help create U.S. jobs, but so far the effect of those actions has been minimal. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and top economic adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, points out that Trump inherited an economy near full employment. "That's a very different world than his predecessor Barack Obama entered," says Holtz-Eakin. Obama faced "hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every month," and so "a lot of job creation needed to be done." Obama managed to get a big stimulus package through Congress, along with taking additional action to rescue automakers during his first 100 days. Politics What Trump Misses About Energy Jobs In America But, Holtz-Eakin says, "the task is different now." Trump's job is not faster job creation, but switching the focus to boosting the productivity of workers, which could support higher wages and make incomes grow more rapidly, Holtz-Eakin says. That will require passing complex plans like business tax reform and health care legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Holtz-Eakin says it remains to be seen whether Trump and the Congress can achieve those goals. What about Trump's flurry of activity during the presidential transition — after he was elected but before he took office? Trump has made a big deal of twisting corporate arms to save U.S. jobs at automakers and companies like Carrier. The Two-Way Shaming Firms That Export Jobs Has Worked For Trump So Far Business Carrier Got Cut A Deal, But Can Other Companies Expect The Same? In the case of Carrier, about 800 jobs were preserved in one factory. Trump was especially vocal, taking credit for car company announcements that they were expanding factories and adding thousands of workers. However, most of the companies said the expansions were in the works before Trump was elected. Holtz-Eakin says the "direct impacts [of Trump's arm-twisting] were modest." But Holtz-Eakin does believe Trump's election may have boosted confidence enough at some businesses that they added jobs anticipating a stronger economy and stronger demand for their goods and services. He says the quick rollback of a number of Obama-era regulations also likely boosted the spirits in the business community and led to more hiring. But, Holtz-Eakin says, there's still no hard evidence to back that up. And, he says, a 100-day report card on job creation really tells us very little about what long-term impact a president will have.

Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump has said over and over that creating jobs is at the top of his agenda. It may seem unfair to judge his progress on this goal in his first 100 days, but Trump has opened the door to scrutiny by making his own assertions on job creation. During a White House meeting with CEOs on April 11, Trump claimed his administration had already created over 600,000 jobs. "You see what's going on. You see the numbers," he said. "We've created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it's going to really start catching on now because some of the things that we've done are big league and they are catching on." Politics Trump Can't Bring Back All Those Jobs From China. Here's What He Can Do Since the beginning of the year, the Labor Department says, the U.S. has created 533,000 jobs. Of course, Trump only took office on Jan. 20, and the January numbers are generally attributed to the outgoing president, because the new president hasn't had a chance to put his policies in place. So, at most Trump could take credit for 219,000 jobs in February and 98,000 in March. That's a total of about 317,000 — about half his original claim. (The White House website now touts "over 500,000 new jobs.") And there's a good argument to be made that presidents shouldn't take credit for a role in job creation until well into their first term, after they've had a chance to influence the course of events with policies or leadership. Trump has announced a number of executive actions that he says will help create U.S. jobs, but so far the effect of those actions has been minimal. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and top economic adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, points out that Trump inherited an economy near full employment. "That's a very different world than his predecessor Barack Obama entered," says Holtz-Eakin. Obama faced "hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every month," and so "a lot of job creation needed to be done." Obama managed to get a big stimulus package through Congress, along with taking additional action to rescue automakers during his first 100 days. Politics What Trump Misses About Energy Jobs In America But, Holtz-Eakin says, "the task is different now." Trump's job is not faster job creation, but switching the focus to boosting the productivity of workers, which could support higher wages and make incomes grow more rapidly, Holtz-Eakin says. That will require passing complex plans like business tax reform and health care legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Holtz-Eakin says it remains to be seen whether Trump and the Congress can achieve those goals. What about Trump's flurry of activity during the presidential transition — after he was elected but before he took office? Trump has made a big deal of twisting corporate arms to save U.S. jobs at automakers and companies like Carrier. The Two-Way Shaming Firms That Export Jobs Has Worked For Trump So Far Business Carrier Got Cut A Deal, But Can Other Companies Expect The Same? In the case of Carrier, about 800 jobs were preserved in one factory. Trump was especially vocal, taking credit for car company announcements that they were expanding factories and adding thousands of workers. However, most of the companies said the expansions were in the works before Trump was elected. Holtz-Eakin says the "direct impacts [of Trump's arm-twisting] were modest." But Holtz-Eakin does believe Trump's election may have boosted confidence enough at some businesses that they added jobs anticipating a stronger economy and stronger demand for their goods and services. He says the quick rollback of a number of Obama-era regulations also likely boosted the spirits in the business community and led to more hiring. But, Holtz-Eakin says, there's still no hard evidence to back that up. And, he says, a 100-day report card on job creation really tells us very little about what long-term impact a president will have.

(Photo: Jeff Baenen / AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Last year was considered by some to be less-than-stellar for commercial aerospace and defense, but both sectors are projecting healthier growth this year. In fact, total world spending in the commercial aerospace and defense industries will continue to rise in the foreseeable future, thanks in large part to an increased demand for passenger air travel and cargo delivery and escalating tensions in some of the world’s toughest neighborhoods. The upsurge in defense spending will be a boon to the more than 3,300 local companies that support the industry, which currently employs 94,000 workers with an average annual income of more than $91,000, according to the Detroit Regional Chamber. In the aerospace industry, Moody’s Investor Service projects a 7 percent gain in commercial aviation sales in 2017. Along with easy credit terms and growing air traffic, the drop in fuel costs will continue to stimulate airline profits while boosting orders for additional planes. According to the Economist, however, this could be a mixed blessing for aircraft manufacturers since it also reduces the need for fuel-efficient models that manufacturers have so heavily invested in during recent years. Much of the shift in product demand can be attributed to new Asian airline upstarts that favor narrow-bodied jets rather than the wider ones — good news for Airbus A320 “neos” but not so great for Boeing’s 737 MAX’s. Despite this, it is hardly a zero-sum proposition for these two competitors given the industry’s overall growth projections. Case in point: IHS Aerospace, Defense & Security points to a strong backlog of new orders for passenger and cargo jets that will exceed $317 billion in sales by 2018, almost double that of 2013. To be sure, Boeing’s current orders of 5,800 planes along with Airbus’ pipeline of 6,400 jets ensures that their respective supply chains will remain occupied for the next decade or so. As for defense, worldwide military spending in 2017 should increase from last year’s $1.57 trillion by 3.2 percent, to $1.89 trillion. Predictably leading the pack is the U.S., with budget outlays slightly north of $635 billion, assuming the Trump Administration’s request to eliminate the sequestration and increase appropriations for more jet fighters, navy ships and enhanced battlefield readiness is approved by a recalcitrant Congress. In addition to the U.S., the other top-five spending nations are a distant China ($211 billion), India ($57 billion), U.K. ($54 billion) and Saudi Arabia ($47 billion). Noticeably absent from the list this year — and, for that matter, last year — is Russia. Kremlin planners have been stung by Western economic sanctions imposed in response to their foray into neighboring Ukraine. Moreover, world oil and gas prices, which constitute Moscow’s number one export and foreign currency earner, have spiraled precipitously downward in the last five years. Broadly speaking, most of the defense spending outside the U.S. will be concentrated in the usual trouble spots in the Middle East (e.g., Oman, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.) in response to threats posed by Iran, ISIS, and the simmering civil war in Syria; Southeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, Philippines, and Vietnam) to restrain Beijing’s adventurism in the East and South China Seas; and India, which is long overdue for a next-gen modernization of its dated weapon systems. But make no mistake: the Pentagon still outspends the next nine top-spending nations combined, constituting almost 40 percent of total global defense spending. Growth in the aerospace and defense sectors is also significant because these industries are at the forefront of innovation and technological development, which cross-pollinate into other previously disparate sectors of our economy. Indeed, our nation’s future success depends on this spillover effect and wide-scale adoption of high-tech manufacturing processes practiced by aviation and defense to ensure our nation’s global competitiveness in 2017 and beyond.

While the "Mad Money" host is skeptical about the plan passing Congress, he looked at how a corporate tax cut from 36 percent down to 15 percent could change the stock market layout. "There are a lot of investors on the sidelines waiting for this market to come down to a more reasonable price," Cramer said. "What happens if so many companies are suddenly making more money because they have a lower tax rate? I bet it that would force billions and billions of dollars into the stock market in a virtuous circle of wealth creation." Still, for the moment, Cramer still recommends staying the course. And while investors should keep tax cuts in mind as a potential blessing on their portfolios, don't count on them too heavily. "Should you buy stocks in anticipation of this huge tax cut? The answer is point blank: no. The truth is we have no idea what will pass, and I seriously doubt this current plan can make it through Congress," the "Mad Money" host said. Susana Gonzalez | Bloomberg | Getty Images When PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments all reported great earnings numbers but saw their stocks go down, Cramer decided to investigate. "The answer is that nothing's really wrong with any of these companies except their stocks simply got ahead of themselves. Investors got so excited that they bid them up to unsustainable levels," the "Mad Money" host said. In reality, the market's reaction was not an accurate reflection of the companies' successes, but a product of lofty expectations that came from each stock's massive run. "We can't ask, 'What's wrong?' We have to say, 'This is our chance.' And that's exactly what I think PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments are worth buying right here," Cramer said. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Then, Cramer spoke with Jim Fish, the president and CEO of Waste Management, a waste and recycling giant that saw its stock slide on earnings despite meeting expectations. Some of the market's nerves were wrought when the company reported timid guidance, which Fish attributed to a large drop in Waste Management's recycling business tied to Chinese buyers halting their purchases of recyclable newspaper material. "We're still feeling pretty optimistic about recycling right now, very optimistic," Fish told Cramer on Wednesday. "We just didn't want to raise guidance with something that doesn't have great visibility to it." And with corporate tax cuts now more concretely on the federal government's slate, Fish said he is looking forward to their benefits, saying the company would look into acquisitions as a first step. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pipelines run toward oil storage tanks at the Enbridge Cushing storage terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Finally, with investors on the lookout for high-quality stocks that could be lifted by the president's policies, Cramer turned to one unusual energy play that could be one of the biggest winners. By acquiring Spectra Energy, Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge became the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. That positioned it to gain from U.S. projects, being that it operates the longest crude oil and gas liquids transportation system in the world. "Yep, the president may have run on an America First platform, and he's suddenly started to get very tough on trade with Canada, but that doesn't change the fact that right now, one of my favorite Trump stocks is a Canadian company," the "Mad Money" host said. In Cramer's lightning round, Cramer flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks: Sanofi: "I like that stock. I've got to tell you, [it's] got a good yield. Mostly what I really like is they've got that big position in Regeneron. They should merge and really kill it." Micron Technology: "This is very tough, because what happened is the price has spiked so much that people believe that they may have actually ruined the demand curve. And Seagate reported a number today that people didn't regard as being as strong as they'd like, so it's pulled down everybody. I think Micron is fine. It's just not in the explosive phase anymore because people keep thinking there's going to be one day [where] there's too many DRAMs, and then boom. But I don't think that day is here yet. I think we're OK. I'm no longer as confident as I've been saying because we've liked that from the teens." Questions for Cramer?

This resource illustrates the mathematical modeling functionality of COMSOL Multiphysics® software and how it can be used by simulation experts to overcome design challenges that, among other issues, are not always possible to resolve experimentally. Read to learn how engineers across a wide range of industries used multiphysics simulation to improve critical aspects of product design. One story highlights how Boeing used multiphysics simulation to model thermal expansion in protective coatings for aircraft composites, which allowed engineers to use a lighter material, and still maintain sufficient lightning protection. An electrically conductive expanded metal foil (EMF) inner layer was added to the composite structure such that excess current and heat would dissipate rapidly in the event of lightning. However, thermal cycling induces stress that can result in cracks in the coating, which is not ideal for the EMF. Engineers at Boeing used COMSOL Multiphysics® software to optimize EMF layer design, balancing current-carrying capacity, displacement due to thermally induced movement of protective layers, and weight, to create an optimized design that is both lightweight and protective against lightning. Another article describes how the car manufacturer, Toyota, optimized topology for improved cooling in their hybrid vehicles. Toyota’s hybrid vehicles contain complex electrical systems that contain power semiconductor devices such as diodes and insulated gate bipolar transistors that are used for power conversion. To keep the systems within thermal operating conditions, the devices are mounted on aluminum heat sinks, around which a water/glycol coolant mixture is pumped. Engineers at the Toyota Research Institute of North America (TRI-NA) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, used simulation to redesign the topology of the aluminum heat sink to reduce the size by half while dissipating the same amount of heat. Miele, the German manufacturer of induction stoves, is also highlighted in the Manager’s Guide. Engineers at MieleTec FH Bielefeld (a joint research laboratory between Miele & Cie. KG and the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld, Germany) used COMSOL Multiphysics® to solve important design challenges in the development of their induction stoves. Simulating the induction heating process involved solving heat transfer concurrently with electromagnetics to determine the best operating conditions, materials, and geometry. Making use of simulation, the engineers were able to reduce the number of experiments needed to finalize their designs by 80%. Continue reading here to see how companies in industries ranging from auto manufacturing to graphene and plasmonics incorporated multiphysics simulation into their work flow to optimize production design.

Thales said it will pay as much as $215 million for San Mateo, Calif.-based Guavus, a 250-person business with more than $30 million in expected 2017 sales. Boeing Co., the world's largest plane maker by deliveries, last year agreed with Microsoft Corp. to jointly work on data analysis tools for commercial aviation. British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC signed a similar agreement with Microsoft. Thales, which makes items such as satellites, missiles, submarines and rail signaling equipment, has undertaken a string of technology deals. It acquired LiveTV in 2014 from JetBlue Airways Corp. to boost its in-flight entertainment portfolio and last year bought an optics business from Switzerland's Ruag Holding AG to augment its satellite activities. Guavus has some of the biggest U.S. telecommunications companies as its customers, Thales said, and handles about 5,000 terabytes of data a day, roughly the data of 3 million feature films. Philippe Keryer, Thales executive vice president for strategy, research and technology, said in an interview that the company plans to use Guavus's know-how in analyzing data in real-time across its products. The ability to rapidly sift through huge volumes of data could help intelligence analysts find key information in spy-satellite photos. The system should also make it easier to spot cybercrime by examining computer logs in real-time, Mr. Keryer said. Thales set out last year to expand its data analysis capability and evaluated several businesses for potential acquisition or partnerships. It opted for Guavus after running trials in real-world scenarios, Mr. Keryer said. The acquisition, which is scheduled to close in the third quarter pending regulatory approvals, would also help broaden the French company's overseas footprint. Guavus also has operations in Canada and India.

The U.S. Department of Energy, which is responsible for cleaning up the area, announced in January that remediation will not begin until this year or next, despite a 2010 agreement in which the agency committed to having the soil decontaminated by 2017. ACORN FILE PHOTO The state agency responsible for overseeing the removal of contamination at the Santa Susana Field Lab says the U.S. Department of Energy’s plans to remediate a highly controversial portion of the site does not comply with a 2010 cleanup agreement. The DOE released a draft environmental impact statement Jan. 6 outlining how it would like to clean up part of Area IV of the field lab, which was the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1959. Boeing Co. owns 80 percent of the 2,850-acre field lab, and the site is part of Boeing’s portion. The statement included goals to demolish and remove 18 structures in Area IV, remediate chemically contaminated soil and groundwater in the area and a buffer zone to the north, and restore the environment. But on April 14, Mohsen Nazemi, a spokesperson for the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, sent a letter to the DOE listing concerns with the federal agency’s statement. According to the letter, DOE’s statement lacks sufficient data to determine whether the proposed cleanup options would be feasible. Furthermore, the statement lacks solutions to overcome challenges in implementing cleanup requirements, Nazemi wrote. He also wrote in the letter that the DOE appears to be violating a legally binding agreement signed in 2010 by DTSC, DOE, NASA and Boeing, the agencies responsible for cleaning up the field lab in the southern hills of Simi Valley. Under the 2010 agreement, all detectable soil contamination was supposed to be cleaned up by this year and plans to remediate the groundwater were to be in place. Instead, DTSC officials said in January that cleanup will not begin until this year or next. “This (environmental statement) is inconsistent with the Department of Energy’s earlier statement describing the cleanup’s purpose and need,” Nazemi said in the letter. “Given this, we must reiterate that the (DTSC) will hold the (DOE) accountable for complying with the (2010 agreement).” A DTSC representative could not be reached for further comment as of press time Thursday. John Jones, a DOE spokesperson, declined to comment on Nazemi’s letter, saying only that the agency is “appreciative of comments” received during the feedback period, which ended March 14. “Going forward, DOE will evaluate and consider the comments as it prepares the final environmental impact statement,” Jones said in an email to the Simi Valley Acorn last week. “The comments DOE received during the comment period and responses to those comments will be available in the comment response document, a part of the final environmental impact statement regarding the future cleanup of the site.” Dan Hirsch, president of environmental group Committee to Bridge the Gap and one of many advocates in favor of a full SSFL cleanup to background standards (meaning all material unnatural to the site is removed), said the DTSC has “called out DOE for breaking its commitment to clean up all the radioactive and chemical contamination on its part of the property,” per the 2010 agreement. Hirsch asserts that DOE “now proposes to leave in place—not clean up—between 34 percent and 99 percent of the contaminated soil.” “The (2010) agreement is legally binding, and DTSC is DOE’s regulator,” he said. “DOE can’t unilaterally break the agreement.” Earlier this year, Jones told the Acorn that the DOE’s proposed remediation options do line up with the 2010 cleanup agreement. But in his letter, Nazemi said the data provided does not “sufficiently support” the agreement. “(DTSC) is committed to require that the Department of Energy comply . . . and the (DOE) must pursue solutions to achieve that compliance,” Nazemi said. “We look forward to working with the (DOE) in achieving the cleanup in a manner consistent and in compliance with the (agreement).” Hirsch said the matter of whether cleanup will occur now depends on DTSC enforcing prior agreements, which he alleges the DOE is trying to break. “The protection of the health of the people in the area around Santa Susana depends upon DTSC being forceful and successful in enforcing cleanup commitments,” he said.

IN A NUTSHELL The California Department of Toxic Substances Control will hold a meeting at 6:30 p.m. Tues., May 2 at the Rancho Santa Susana Community Center, 5005 E. Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley, to highlight Santa Susana Field Lab activities from the past six months and talk about what to expect over the next six months.

(Ryan Remiorz / THE CANADIAN PRESS) The Canadian Press Published Thursday, April 27, 2017 7:59PM EDT Bombardier is rejecting Boeing's claim in a complaint filed with the U.S. government that it has dumped its new CSeries commercial jet into the United States at below cost. In a statement, the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer says it structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates. The Seattle-based rival petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is calling for the Trump administration to issue an order against the sale of the plane in the important American market. The move comes days after the U.S. imposed preliminary duties of up to 24 per cent on softwood lumber imported from Canada. Boeing joins Brazil which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer.

Its corporate beneficiaries are fighting tooth and nail to protect their subsidies. Do not be fooled by their rhetoric. Insider lobbying groups like the Chamber of Commerce claim the Ex-Im Bank is about small business and jobs. Without the bank, they threaten, catastrophe will strike average Americans. This is just fear-mongering. The bank only subsidizes less than 2 percent of exports and jobs and less than 1 percent of small businesses in the U.S. each year. Most of this support directly benefits a handful of well-connected domestic and foreign firms, like Boeing and General Electric. Unfortunately, Ex-Im supporters know that “promoting small business” is a good way to conceal toxic Ex-Im corporatism. Take this piece in The Hill by Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La. He argues that the bank primarily helps small businesses to gain customers, create thousands of jobs, and grow exports. These claims are misleading. First, the Ex-Im Bank's definition of a “small business” isn't exactly “small.” Most government bodies set the threshold at firms with fewer than 500 employees. Ex-Im “small businesses” can be three times that large and earn up to $21 million in annual revenues. This isn't “small” for most Americans. Even with this expansive definition, it is misleading to imply, as Boustany does, that Ex-Im supports most small business firms and jobs in America. In fact, Ex-Im's effect on U.S. small businesses and jobs is so tiny that you can hardly see it on the chart above. Data from Census Bureau's Statistics of U.S. Businesses dataset and this Export-Import Bank dataset show that only 0.3 percent of all small business jobs in 2007 (the most recent year for the Census dataset) were supported by the Ex-Im Bank. Assuming that each Ex-Im small business transaction went to a unique small business, only 0.04 percent of all small businesses were supported by Ex-Im that year. The pattern is similar on the state level. Consider Boustany's home state of Louisiana. Census data show that Louisiana exported $355 billion in goods and services from 2007 to 2014. Ex-Im reports that it supported $1.6 million of Louisiana's exports in that same time, $786 million of which went to small businesses. This means that only 0.44 percent of Louisiana’s exports were actually supported by the bank — which is lower than the national average of 1.6 percent. Additionally, Ex-Im only supported 0.22 percent in exports for small businesses in Louisiana. Boustany either doesn’t know the facts or he doesn’t care. Either way: Ex-Im is hardly critical for more than 99 percent of small businesses in the U.S. and his own state. That doesn’t stop Boustany from trying to scare Americans from ending the Export-Import Bank with visions of exports collapsing and economic catastrophe. The sad part is that the Export-Import Bank actually harms many U.S. small businesses and workers by subsidizing their competitors. Boustany doesn’t explain that when Ex-Im subsidizes one Louisiana firm, it penalizes all other unsubsidized firms and workers. Subsidized firms undoubtedly enjoy that these taxpayer-backed subsidies lower their costs and raise their profits, but they come at the cost of slower wage growth, less hiring, and more layoffs among the other 98 percent of unsubsidized exports. These unsubsidized Americans shouldn’t matter less than the few privileged firms who receive government subsidies. Boustany is right when he says that “American people are tired of Washington politicians playing political games when American jobs are at stake.” He should look in the mirror. More than 98 percent of jobs and exports in the U.S. bear the unjust costs of Ex-Im privileges for politically connected few. Members of Congress should represent all of us, not just those of us fortunate to have friends down at the Export-Import Bank.

Program beneficiaries have strong incentives to coordinate and protect their privileges. Average Americans, on the other hand, simply do not have the time or information to organize enough opposition to defeat these programs. They might bear the costs of government expansion, but individual programs only cost each American a few tax dollars here and there. Fighting for reform is simply not worth it. Bad programs proliferate, then, because cronyism pays more than stewardship. The Export-Import Bank is a prime example of this dynamic. There is no policy justification for this corporatist program. Economists have long known that these kinds of export credit subsidies will never raise the overall level of trade; rather, they redistribute wealth away from unsubsidized American firms, employees, and consumers and direct it toward a tiny number of subsidy beneficiaries. The bank is allowed to prosper and grow because its costs are spread over millions while its benefits are jealously protected by its few clients. A recent chart series that I produced for the Mercatus Center clearly illustrates this effect. The map above uses data from the Export-Import Bank to display Ex-Im disbursements in each state as a percentage of total disbursements. Washington is the clear winner in terms of total Ex-Im disbursements, receiving a massive 43.6 percent of all Ex-Im Bank disbursements from 2007 to 2014. Why? The state houses Boeing, one of Ex-Im Bank’s biggest beneficiaries, but the sheer size is nonetheless startling. Larger states like Texas and California only respectively pulled in 10.5 percent and 8.8 percent of total Ex-Im Bank disbursements during the same time. While businesses in most states barely benefit from the Ex-Im Bank at all, their taxpayers are just as exposed to Ex-Im Bank liabilities as taxpayers in handful of states that receive the most Ex-Im Bank backing. The same is true when look at the portion of total state exports backed by the Ex-Im Bank, as a second chart in the Mercatus series demonstrates. Washington is again the big winner, with an incredible 22.67 percent of state exports backed by the Ex-Im Bank since 2007. The state percentages drop off quickly from there. While almost four percent of Wisconsin’s exports and about 3.5 percent of Massachusetts’s exports were backed by the Ex-Im Bank, the Ex-Im Bank supported less than two percent of the exports of 41 states for the same time period. The truth of the matter is that the Ex-Im Bank yields negligible benefits for the vast majority of state exports, aside from one big outlier. These charts make it clear that the Ex-Im Bank primarily exists to benefit Boeing at the expense of everyone else in the country. You might wonder why lawmakers would refuse to acknowledge this reality. For one, politicians are pressured by an army of lobbyists representing powerful companies who are committed to protect their perks even if it hurts everyone else. But politicians are not exactly shrinking violets, here. They like being able to point to the small businesses and American jobs that they “support” through the Ex-Im Bank. What is much harder is to point to the millions of victims of the Ex-Im Bank. Taxpayers, for instance, bear a massive $140 billion exposure so that giant corporations like Boeing and General Electric can make a little more profit each year. Should the bank’s portfolio go south, normal people like you and I will be on the hook. Then there’s the economic distortions. Consumers face higher prices for airline travel, for instance, because the bank heavily subsidizes the foreign purchase of aircraft. Unsubsidized companies are subjected to an unleveled playing field. Because Ex-Im artificially lowers subsidized competitors’ financing costs, unsubsidized firms get crowded out of capital markets and find it hard to expand and maintain employment. If they fail, they won’t have the convenient assurance of a de facto taxpayer bailout like Boeing does. Since more than 98 percent of all U.S. exports receive no assistance from Ex-Im, this means the vast majority of Americans are victims who bear the costs of political privileges for a tiny number of politically-connected firms. Lawmakers should stand up for these unseen victims of the Ex-Im Bank. But they should also ask themselves why they are protecting a program that mostly benefits Washington.

(AFP) NEW YORK: US businesses would reap a windfall if President Donald Trump’s plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas becomes law, but it was unclear whether they would stimulate a surge in investment and job creation in return. Under Trump’s proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the US in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration’s tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp. Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned “the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation.” Big US companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc. has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. “What we would do with it, let’s wait and see exactly what it is, but as I’ve said before we are always looking at acquisitions,” Cook told investors on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in January in response to an analyst’s question about the company’s thinking on acquisitions. Cook’s comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co. , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A mixed bag The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co. on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. “At the highest level we’re a big supporter of tax reform,” Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. “It’s going to drive jobs, it’s going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it’s going to allow us to compete.” Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office,” said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

(NYSE: BA) dipped 1.9%, before recovering by the end of the day to regain about half of the dip. The aircraft maker’s deliveries dropped by 4% year over year for the quarter, and revenues were down by about $370 million. Profits beat estimates by six cents per share. Margins improved, however, and new orders rose to 198, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.05 to 1.00. These positive signs were encouraging enough to induce some analysts to raise their price target on the stock. Boeing also reiterated its cash flow estimate of around $10.75 billion for the full year and maintained its estimate of commercial jet deliveries of 760 to 765. We want to look at both sides of the story, balancing the positive views with one negative view. First, the good news for Boeing and its investors. Cowen raised its price target from $195 to $215, and RBC lifted its price target from $138 to $146 per share. JPMorgan raised its price target from $185 to $205 and rates the stock Neutral. Merrill Lynch sees Boeing differently. The analysts maintained their Underperform rating and kept their $150 price objective on the stock. The firm said it continues to believe that the aerospace industry may be in the early stages of a down cycle. Here’s what it said in its investment rationale: BA is changing the face of commercial aerospace with the 787. We firmly believe that the use of composites as the primary structure on the 787 marks a fundamental shift in the industry. We expect the stock to be pressured in the medium term as Boeing grapples with industry concerns regarding overproduction as well as development and production risks on programs like the 787, 777X, and 737 MAX. Boeing also has plans to grow its support and services business to around $50 billion in 10 years. The company does not break out how much of its revenue in the commercial jet division comes from service and support, but one analyst estimates that the company’s current revenue stream, including military service and support, is around $17 million. Essentially tripling that total in 10 years is an ambitious goal, and it may be critical to Boeing’s future growth if demand for commercial jets should hit the doldrums. Boeing’s stock traded up about 0.9% in the noon hour Wednesday, at $183.46 in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. The 12-month consensus price target is $181.90 and may not include these latest changes.

But Reuters analyzed more than 900 White House press pool reports to give the first big picture view, albeit an incomplete one, of who has had the most and least success at bending the president's ear.Such access can be crucial for companies, with Trump regularly passing judgment and making proposals on business issues such as trade, taxes, immigration and regulation.The review showed Trump listening closely to some segments of Corporate America, though perhaps neglecting the dynamic technology and entertainment sectors, both powerful U.S. export industries.Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc, and other tech leaders met with Trump before his inauguration.Access sometimes means influence, but it was likely too soon to tell, after less than 100 days, whether Trump's actions have disproportionately favored big manufacturers and Wall Street. Industrial power-houses have led the way on access, including companies with the clout to make significant hiring decisions: Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields has met with Trump at least four times; General Motors CEO Mary Barra, at least four times; and Boeing representatives, at least three times.The Reuters review helps fill a blank in the Trump record that opened in mid-April when he put the White House visitor logs off-limits to the public. They had been mostly public under Obama. Transparency advocates have warned that Trump's decision will make it harder to hold him accountable."A public record of who has the president's ear is more important than it has ever been," said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit good-government advocacy group. The review showed about half of the companies that have made it into the Trump inner circle through April 21, day 92 of his presidency, were manufacturers or financial firms - asset managers, insurers and banks ranging from Wall Street giants such as Citigroup to small community banks.Financier Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs a presidential advisory forum of business leaders, is CEO of the Blackstone Group, the largest manager of private equity and real estate assets. He was spotted by the press pool aboard Air Force 1 on Feb. 3 when the president was traveling to Mar-a-Lago. Schwarzman also attended at least three meetings with Trump and other executives.Almost all of Trump's meetings were group encounters with 10 or more executives sitting down with the president and White House officials in events billed as listening sessions, roundtable discussions or town halls. A few were more intimate encounters, such as on March 18, when Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Corp. subsidiary, met with the president in Mar-a-Lago before having dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.Perlmutter, however, was one of few executives from media companies seen by pool reporters in meetings with Trump.Information technology firms, which enjoyed significant access to former President Barack Obama, have had less access to Trump than legacy manufacturers such as auto and steel makers. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty attended three meetings with Trump, but was one of only a few CEOs from big tech firms seen at the White House.Manufacturers and financiers also enjoyed access to the White House under Obama, according to a Reuters review in December 2015 of White House visitor logs. The recent Reuters review is not comprehensive since the press pool, though dogged and alert, may have missed some of Trump's meetings with business leaders. The pool is a rotation of journalists from several outlets, including Reuters, who follow Trump and get briefings from White House officials on some, but not all of his meetings.

He also cautioned that a class of the high-quality silver metal is used in several defense jets including Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) F-35, and Boeing’s F-18 and C-17 (BA). It is also used in armor plating of military vehicles and combat vessels. The investigation is ongoing and has not reached a conclusion, he said.  Ross noted that there is just one U.S. smelter plant that can produce high-quality aluminum for the defense industry. “It is very, very dangerous to have one [high-quality] supplier of critical material” he noted.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Along with national security concerns, Ross said imports have, in part, crippled the U.S. aluminum industry which has seen at least eight smelter plants either close or dial back production since 2015. The secretary also called out China’s rising dominance of global aluminum market share. Canada, Russia and the United Arab Emirates are also big suppliers to the U.S. Mining giant Rio Tinto, which is one of several companies that imports aluminum to the U.S., is open to a review of practices and contends the U.S. and Canada have a solid working relationship. “We are confident that the national security review of aluminum imports will recognize the exceptional role that cost-competitive, high quality and readily available aluminum from Canada plays as a key input for U.S. manufacturers – including in the defense sector,” a spokesperson tells FOX Business. Earlier this week Ross lowered the boom on Canada in an attempt to level the playing field on lumber and dairy trade. “The way it works in Canada is that the provinces own the standing timber and they charge very, very low, way below market fees for what’s called stumpage, mainly the right to cut the trees down," Ross told the FOX Business Network's Lou Dobbs on Tuesday.  "That in turn lets the Canadians ship lumber into the U.S. at a subsidized price.” Now, the U.S. wants payback. “The preliminary finding was a fine of $1 billion per year, and since we are imposing it retroactively for 90 days, when we put them on notice that will be an extra one-time $250 million and they began paying those fines today,” said Ross. Ross is also investigating all foreign steel imports, a promise he made after being confirmed, as reported by FOX Business. The Commerce Department is conducting these steel and aluminum probes – also known as 232 investigations - by dusting off a rarely used portion of an old trade law.   When asked about the connection to these recent trade crackdowns and the future of NAFTA he said, “This is about aluminum, not NAFTA.” Suzanne O’Halloran is Managing Editor of FOXBusiness.com and a graduate of Boston College.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Jason Lange | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON Manufacturers and Wall Street have led the quest for business access to President Donald Trump in his first 100 days in office, with media companies and Silicon Valley seldom entering the presidential bubble, a Reuters review found. Since inauguration day on Jan. 20, top executives from at least 186 companies have visited with Trump or senior advisers at the White House or on presidential trips, including those to Mar-a-Lago, the private, seaside Florida club where he spends many weekends. Some of the meetings have been reported in the press. But Reuters analyzed more than 900 White House press pool reports to give the first big picture view, albeit an incomplete one, of who has had the most and least success at bending the president's ear. Such access can be crucial for companies, with Trump regularly passing judgment and making proposals on business issues such as trade, taxes, immigration and regulation. The review showed Trump listening closely to some segments of Corporate America, though perhaps neglecting the dynamic technology and entertainment sectors, both powerful U.S. export industries. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc, and other tech leaders met with Trump before his inauguration. Access sometimes means influence, but it was likely too soon to tell, after less than 100 days, whether Trump's actions have disproportionately favored big manufacturers and Wall Street. Industrial power-houses have led the way on access, including companies with the clout to make significant hiring decisions: Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields has met with Trump at least four times; General Motors CEO Mary Barra, at least four times; and Boeing representatives, at least three times. The Reuters review helps fill a blank in the Trump record that opened in mid-April when he put the White House visitor logs off-limits to the public. They had been mostly public under Obama. Transparency advocates have warned that Trump's decision will make it harder to hold him accountable. "A public record of who has the president's ear is more important than it has ever been," said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit good-government advocacy group. The review showed about half of the companies that have made it into the Trump inner circle through April 21, day 92 of his presidency, were manufacturers or financial firms - asset managers, insurers and banks ranging from Wall Street giants such as Citigroup to small community banks. Financier Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs a presidential advisory forum of business leaders, is CEO of the Blackstone Group, the largest manager of private equity and real estate assets. He was spotted by the press pool aboard Air Force 1 on Feb. 3 when the president was traveling to Mar-a-Lago. Schwarzman also attended at least three meetings with Trump and other executives. Almost all of Trump's meetings were group encounters with 10 or more executives sitting down with the president and White House officials in events billed as listening sessions, roundtable discussions or town halls. A few were more intimate encounters, such as on March 18, when Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Corp. subsidiary, met with the president in Mar-a-Lago before having dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Perlmutter, however, was one of few executives from media companies seen by pool reporters in meetings with Trump. Information technology firms, which enjoyed significant access to former President Barack Obama, have had less access to Trump than legacy manufacturers such as auto and steel makers. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty attended three meetings with Trump, but was one of only a few CEOs from big tech firms seen at the White House. Manufacturers and financiers also enjoyed access to the White House under Obama, according to a Reuters review in December 2015 of White House visitor logs. The recent Reuters review is not comprehensive since the press pool, though dogged and alert, may have missed some of Trump's meetings with business leaders. The pool is a rotation of journalists from several outlets, including Reuters, who follow Trump and get briefings from White House officials on some, but not all of his meetings.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Advertisement Big U.S. companies have nearly US$1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than US$200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January in response to an analyst's question about the company's thinking on acquisitions. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

The available positions will accommodate 88″ x 125″ or 88″ x 108″ pallets, with the seventh and eighth positions accommodating smaller pallets.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Reuters The Nasdaq Composite ended at a record high on Thursday, boosted by results-related gains in Comcast, PayPal and Intuit. Amazon and Alphabet jumped more than 4% each after the bell, following stellar earnings. The S&P 500 and the Dow were little changed. Comcast rose 2.1% to $39.59 after touching a record high of $40.62 as strong subscriber growth brought a forecast-beating profit. The Nasdaq climbed 23.71 points to 6,048.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.24 points to 20,981.33, while the wider S&P 500 index edged up 1.32 points to 2,388.77. Much of the stock movement came in response to the quarterly earnings that a slew of companies are sharing with investors this week. American Airlines shares plummeted 5.2% after its release on Thursday, which included a 2% revenue increase - and the news it would provide raises to pilots and flight attendants. Rival carriers also came under pressure, with Delta down 1.4% and United Continental down about 1%. United is trying to move past bad publicity over its removal of a passenger from a flight, a case the company said it settled on Thursday. Under Armour shares soared 9.3%, despite the sportswear maker reporting its first quarterly net loss since the company listed on the market in 2005. It reported a net loss of $2.3m for the three months to March after a sharp fall in profit at its North American operations. However, the shares jumped as the loss was not as bad as feared.

Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, is also Africa's leading grower of natural rubber.

The markets may benefit from a positive reaction to the latest batch of earnings news, as a number of well-known companies have reported better than expected quarterly results. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading modestly lower after seeing strength for much of the trading session. The major averages pulled back going into the close, ending the session just below the unchanged line. The Dow dipped 21.03 points or 0.1 percent to 20,975.09, the Nasdaq edged down 0.27 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 6,025.23 and the S&P 500 slipped 1.16 points or 0.1 percent to 2,387.45. The lower close on Wall Street came after officials from President Donald Trump's administration unveiled the president's highly anticipated tax reform plan. White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outlined Trump's plan in a briefing to reporters at the White House. Trump's tax reform plan would reduce the number of income tax brackets from seven to three, with a top rate of 35 percent and lower rates of 25 percent and 10 percent. The president's proposal would also lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. Trump's plan would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax as well as the estate tax, which is also known as the "death tax." Among individual stocks, shares of Twitter (TWTR) moved sharply higher after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also saw notable strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) came under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are sliding $0.82 to $48.80 a barrel after inching up $0.06 to $49.62 a barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,264.50, up $0.30 from the previous session's close of $1,264.20. On Wednesday, gold fell $3. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 111.40 yen compared to the 111.06 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0918 compared to yesterday's $1.0904. Asia Asian stocks fluctuated before closing mostly higher on Thursday after top White House officials finally unveiled the president's highly anticipated tax reform plan that includes significant reductions in both individual and corporate income tax rates. The proposal would lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent and also eliminate the so-called "Death Tax" on estates. Analysts initially greeted President Donald Trump's tax plan as a starting point to simplify the U.S. tax code but warned that there were obstacles ahead. Chinese shares reversed initial losses to close modestly higher after official data showed profits earned by Chinese industrial firms climbed markedly in March, though at a slower pace than in the first two months of the year. Industrial profits surged an annual 23.8 percent, well below the 31.5 percent spike in the January to February period. However, it was much faster than the 8.5 percent growth in the year 2016. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 11.34 points or 0.36 percent to 3,152.19, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 120.05 points or 0.49 percent to 24,698.48. Australian shares moved in a narrow range before finishing higher, led by financial and gold mining stocks. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index inched up 9.50 points or 0.16 percent to 5,921.50, while the broader All Ordinaries Index closed 7.60 points or 0.13 percent higher at 5,944.40. The big four banks rose between 0.6 percent and 1 percent ahead of earnings due next week. Gold miners Evolution and Northern Star climbed 3-5 percent as gold prices rebounded in Asian trading on skepticism over Trump's proposed tax reform. Energy major Santos fell as much 5.5 percent after the conservative government proposed a radical plan to restrict exports of liquefied natural gas when required. Lower copper prices weighed on mining stocks, with BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group losing 1-3 percent. Ten Network slumped 19 percent after the company reported a massive half-year loss and warned of "material uncertainty" that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. Wesfarmers dropped 1.5 percent on reporting muted growth in supermarket sales for the third quarter. Meanwhile, Japanese shares snapped a four-day rally as the Bank of Japan kept its policy steady while sounding more upbeat on the economy, citing a pick-up in overseas demand. The Nikkei 225 Index shed 37.56 points or 0.19 percent to finish at 19,251.87, and the broader Topix index closed 0.05 percent lower at 1,536.67. Takata shares plummeted 19.5 percent after reports that the airbag maker was considering filing for bankruptcy protection and then selling its core operations. Canon jumped 3.7 percent after lifting its full-year outlook. Europe The major European markets have moved to the downside on the day following the European Central Bank's monetary policy announcement. While the German DAX Index is down by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.5 percent. The ECB left its key interest rates and the volume of asset purchases unchanged on Thursday and signaled that it was ready to boost stimulus if the economic outlook turned less favorable. Sweden's central bank left its key rate unchanged but extended the purchases of government bonds and delayed its expected timing for an interest rate hike until mid-2018. Deutsche Bank has moved lower after German lender more than doubled its first-quarter profit, but its revenue dropped due to the negative impact of credit spreads. Airline Lufthansa have tumbled after its first quarter net loss widened from last year. AstraZeneca has come under pressure after the drug giant reported weak profit and revenues in its first quarter amid declining sales of cholesterol treatment Crestor, which lost patent protection last year. On the other hand, Nokia shares have soared after the telecoms giant narrowed its first-quarter loss and said it was cautiously optimistic for the full year. Mediclinic shares have also spiked higher after the Abu Dhabi government canceled a requirement for citizens to make co-payments for private medical treatment. Lloyds Banking Group has rallied after the British bank more than doubled its first-quarter profit despite challenging trading conditions and the HBOS scandal. In economic news, German consumer confidence is set to improve markedly in May after two consecutive declines, survey data from market research group GfK showed. Separately, a monthly survey from the European Union showed that its economic sentiment indicator across the 19-country euro zone rose by 1.6 points in April to 109.6, the highest level in nearly a decade. U.S. Economic Reports The Labor Department released a report showing an unexpected increase in initial jobless claims in the week ended April 22nd. The report said initial jobless claims climbed to 257,000, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week's revised level of 243,000. The increase surprised economists, who had expected jobless claims to edge down to 241,000 from the 244,000 originally reported for the previous week. A separate report released by the Commerce Department showed that new orders for manufactured durable goods climbed by less than expected in the month of March. The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose by 0.7 percent in March after jumping by a revised 2.3 percent in February. Economists had expected orders to surge up by 1.2 percent compared to the 1.8 percent increase that had been reported for the previous month. Excluding a jump in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders edged down by 0.2 percent in March after climbing by 0.7 percent in February. At 10 am ET, the National Association of Realtors is due to release its report on pending home sales in the month of March. Economists expect pending home sales to drop by 1.0 percent in March after spiking by 5.5 percent in February. A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale. The Treasury Department is scheduled to announce the results of its auction of $28 billion worth of seven-year notes at 1 pm ET. Stocks in Focus Shares of Comcast (CMCSA) are moving higher in pre-market trading after the telecom giant reported first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates. Auto giant Ford (F) may also see early strength after reporting better than expected first quarter results on both the top and bottom lines. Shares of Bristol-Myers (BMY) are also moving to the upside in pre-market trading after the drug giant reported first quarter results that topped expectations. On the other hand, Southwest Airlines (LUV) may come under pressure after reporting first quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. Biotechnology company Amgen (AMGN) reported first quarter earnings that exceeded expectations but on weaker than expected revenues. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Google Parent Alphabet Q1 Profit Rises - Update Delta Boots Passenger For Using Bathroom During Long Delay On Tarmac McDonald's Getting Rid Of Hi-C Orange American Airlines Q1 Profit Drops; But Results Beat Estimates Ford Motor Q1 Results Top Estimates; Backs FY17 Profit View Nokia Stock Up On Narrower Q1 Net Loss, Sales Down; Backs Costs Savings View Airbus Q1 Profit Climbs, Adj.

The European firm said it was confident of plans to increase jet output despite wobbling demand, but voiced caution about the speed at which it can lower costs on its new A350 and warned of "significant" exposure on its troubled A400M army plane. Airbus' results came a day after rival Boeing reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit, with the world's largest planemaker also lifting its full-year forecast. Airbus Finance Director Harald Wilhelm took aim at U.S. supplier Pratt & Whitney over engine delays that forced it to deliver fewer A320neos than planned last quarter, despite fresh assurances from the engine maker that it will meet targets. "The demonstrated performance so far is not satisfactory, but let's see whether their fixes are coming through (and) are finally confirmed. ... We still need to see the proof coming through," he told reporters. "We don't miss any opportunity to remind Pratt of the commitments they made for 2017 and 2018," he added. He also said Airbus was trying to secure a return this year to European government export funding, which was suspended last year amid a probe into suspected corruption in jetliner sales. Wrangling over past business dealings deepened on Wednesday when Austria disclosed a separate fraud probe into Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders over a 2003 fighter deal. Airbus called the accusations "completely unsubstantiated". Airbus shares fell as much as two percent, before steadying down 0.8 percent. Its quarterly adjusted operating profit fell 52 percent to 240 million euros ($261.7 million) as revenues rose 7 percent to 12.988 billion. Analysts were on average expecting core profit of 344 million euros, down 31 percent. A350 CHALLENGE The Airbus planemaking business saw 31 percent lower profit despite a 13 percent rise in revenues. It blamed a less favourable mix of deliveries in the quarter, which included more of the new but still sharply discounted A350s and higher production ramp-up costs. Getting costs on the A350 to fall in line with targets as volume increases is a "top challenge" for 2017, Wilhelm said. However it had reduced the amount of unscheduled factory work. Airbus is in the midst of two major product changes designed to revitalise its portfolio through the 2020s, but which also spell the end of its two existing cash lifelines. They include the A320 medium-haul jet, upgraded with new engines to become the A320neo, and the long-haul A330, giving way to the all-new A350 and to an upgrade of the A330 itself. The switchover between models is a tricky time for planemakers as they discount the old while mastering the new. Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said the results were hit by "severe pricing weakness" as Airbus preserves customers for the current version of its A330 wide-body jet. Wilhelm and some analysts said the trends were as expected. Airbus Helicopters slipped narrowly into loss as the world's largest commercial helicopter maker continues to suffer from damage to its image from the grounding of aircraft in UK and Norway, following a crash that killed North Sea oil workers. A report on last year's crash is due on Friday. For 2017, Airbus officially expects to deliver over 700 jets and to report mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income. Wilhelm said the actual delivery target is around 720.

By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer PARIS (Reuters) - Core profit at Airbus more than halved in the first quarter as it cut prices of old models and delays at an engine maker hampered deliveries of its profitable new A320neo jet.

The world’s second-largest plane maker after Boeing said adjusted operating profit fell to 240 million euros ($261.7 million) as revenues rose 7 per cent to 12.988 billion. Analysts were on average expecting adjusted operating income of 344 million euros, down 31 per cent, and 5.5 per cent higher revenues of 12.857 billion, according to a Reuters poll. Airbus said it was still worried about problems with temperamental engines for its new A320neo passenger plane from Pratt & Whitney, and commercial exposure on the troubled A400M military aircraft programme. It expects deliveries of the A320neo once again to fall predominantly in the latter part of the year, but has said it hopes to avoid the last-minute rush seen in December last year. The engine issues “need to be resolved,” Airbus said in a statement. The Airbus planemaking business saw 31 per cent lower profit despite a 13 per cent rise in revenues. The Toulouse-based firm said this reflected a different mix of aircraft, with more of the new A350s delivered in the first quarter, “transition pricing” and higher production ramp-up costs. New aircraft tend to be sold at heavier discounts to spur further orders. The Airbus Helicopters unit slipped into loss as the world’s largest commercial helicopter maker continues to suffer from the grounding of aircraft in UK and Norway, following a crash that killed North Sea oil workers. For 2017, Airbus expects to deliver over 720 aircraft and to report mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income. Airbus’ results came a day after Boeing reported a 19 per cent rise in first-quarter profit, with its U.S rival also lifting its full-year forecast.

Daily flights on Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner aircraft will take off on the new route from 25 March 2018, with return fares starting at £1,095 or A$1,893. The airline said it was the next stage in the evolution of the so-called “kangaroo route”, facilitated by the more fuel-efficient Dreamliner. United Airlines to offer $10,000 for passengers to give up seats Read more The direct Perth flight will take 17 hours to carry passengers 9,000 miles, a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the route to London in 1947. “We’ve said the Qantas Dreamliner is a game changer, and that’s becoming real today,” said Alan Joyce, the chief executive of the Australian airline. “The kangaroo route has kept changing with new technology. It used to take four days and seven stops but now we’re able to link Australia and UK in a single hop. It’s a level of convenience Australians have never had before.” Passengers travelling from Melbourne to London will now be able to transfer in Perth, rather than Dubai, reducing their total travel time by more than an hour, the airline said. Qantas added that fares may fall to as low as £900 return during deal periods. The flight between Perth and London will be the longest flight on the Qantas network and the longest Dreamliner flight in the world. Joyce said Qantas had focused on greater comfort in its Dreamliner cabins and would offer a lower seat count that most of its competitors. “We’re conscious that this is a long flight, but not much longer than our Sydney to Dallas service,” he said. “It’s the kind of route that the Dreamliner was created for, because of its built-in features to reduce jet lag and improve the overall travel experience.” He said the route, first announced in December, would appeal to both tourists and business travellers. “This route makes Western Australia a new tourism gateway for Australia. We know from our research that there’s a lot of appetite to explore the west, not just from British and European visitors but also from Aussies on their way to London. A lot of business travellers, particularly in the resources sector, will stop off in Perth on their way to the UK,” he added.

The fighters and approximately 300 personnel from the Louisiana and Florida Air National Guards have been located to Graf Ignatievo Air Base, near Plovdiv, as the 122nd Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (EFS). No duration was given for the deployment, but the DoD noted that the aircraft will afterwards move onto other locations throughout NATO. The USAF has stepped up its deployments to eastern Europe in particular following the breakdown of political relations between the West and Russia over the actions of President Putin in Ukraine.

Steven Heapy spoke to this newspaper as the airline confirmed it was adding eight routes to Belfast International Airport, including six that are new to Northern Ireland. The airline will now fly to Antalya in Turkey, Costa De Almeria in Spain, the Greek island of Crete, Madeira, Malta, Naples in Italy, Paphos in Cyprus and Rhodes. Jet2 already operates a number of flights to Spain, the Canaries and eastern Europe from Belfast. The move is expected to create around 50 new jobs. "We've been looking at Belfast International Airport for some time with a view to expansion," Mr Heapy said. "Our brand and products are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the local travel agents, and we've had a lot of support from them. "We've decided to put a fourth aircraft into Belfast. It's different from the existing three, because it's a (Boeing) 737-800, which is bigger and has a longer range, and that has allowed us to reach some of the new destinations." The flights start in April and May next year, and seven will fly once a week, while the Costa De Almeria link is twice a week. But Mr Heapy said that if demand was strong, the airline could look at increasing the frequency of the services. He said he believed competition was "a healthy thing", with Jet2 now going head-to-head with Ryanair. Speaking about concerns over what will happen if the open skies agreement, which allows carriers to fly anywhere within the EU, is scrapped after Brexit, he said: "There are a lot of concerns around Brexit. There's freedom of movement, of capital, of labour and open skies. "Probably the biggest of that is the open skies. It's our job as the airline and tour operator community to communicate with the Government to put forward the case for aviation and travel. They really need to make sure they deliver open skies, because if we didn't have that, or have anything less than what we have now, it would be terrible for the industry and terrible for people who want to travel." He said without the agreement it would be very hard to "operate or launch" routes. Speaking about the new routes, Graham Keddie, managing director of Belfast International Airport, said: "Of course, with the welcome expansion will come new employment opportunities. "Up to 50 jobs spread throughout the airport will have to be filled, including ground crew, pilots and cabin crew, which will mean £1.5m in wages injected into the local economy."

Airbus expects to build a record 720 planes this year including 200 of its new A320neo single-aisle jet. But it only delivered 26 of those A320neo airliners in the first three months, fewer than expected, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm told reporters Thursday. A rush to the finish line is nothing new for Airbus, the world's No. 2 plane maker behind Boeing. The Toulouse, France-based plane maker was forced to crank out a record number of planes in December to meet its full-year target after it fell behind earlier. Airbus was hoping this year would be less of a wild ride, even if it projected in January most plane deliveries would fall in the second half. Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., has had to replace faulty engines, called the geared turbofan, on some A320neo planes already delivered to airline customers, which has reduced the number of turbines available for new airliners. United Technologies Wednesday said 26 of 70 geared turbofans delivered last quarter were used as spares. Mr. Wilhelm called it a "tough quarter" for the Pratt engine and that the demonstrated performance was "not satisfactory." Airbus is sticking to its A320neo plane delivery target for now, he said, but still is awaiting proof from Pratt that the engine issue will be fixed as promised. United Technologies Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said fixes to the engine were either approved or in development and that additional tests were being performed to identify any other potential faults early. He acknowledged the reliability issue was painful for customers. The company stuck to its target of building 350 to 400 geared turbofan engines this year, also for other plane makers. Airbus also gets A320neo engines from a joint venture of General Electric Co. and France's Safran SA. Each engine supplier is expected to power about half the planes due for delivery this year. Airbus reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profit, hobbled by delivery of less profitable planes and higher costs on new models even as its net result benefited from the sale of some defense activities. The company's closely watched earnings before interest and taxes stripping out some one-time items fell 52% to EUR240 million ($261.7 million). Airbus delivered 136 planes in the first three months of 2017, 11 more than a year earlier, but those included more newer-model airliners that tend to be less profitable than versions that have been in production for longer. Sales rose 7% to EUR12.99 billion on a rise in plane deliveries. Net profit rose 52%, boosted by a EUR560 million gain from the divestment of Airbus's defense electronics unit. The sale will lower full-year adjusted earnings per share by around EUR0.14, it said. Airbus CEO Tom Enders said the company was on track to meet full-year targets.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Sequencing the Station: Investigation Aims to Identify Unknown Microbes in Space     HOUSTON, TX, April 27, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ — Building on the ability to sequence DNA in space and previous investigations, Genes in Space-3 is a collaboration to prepare, sequence and identify unknown organisms, entirely from space. When NASA astronaut Kate Rubins sequenced DNA aboard the International Space Station in 2016, it was a game changer. That first-ever sequencing of DNA in space was part of the Biomolecule Sequencer investigation. Although it’s not as exciting as a science fiction movie may depict, the walls and surfaces of the space station do experience microbial growth from time to time. Currently, the only way to identify contaminants is to take a sample and send it back to Earth. „We have had contamination in parts of the station where fungi was seen growing or biomaterial has been pulled out of a clogged waterline, but we have no idea what it is until the sample gets back down to the lab,” said Sarah Wallace, NASA microbiologist and the project’s principal investigator at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. „On the ISS, we can regularly resupply disinfectants, but as we move beyond low-Earth orbit where the ability for resupply is less frequent, knowing what to disinfect or not becomes very important,” said Wallace. Developed in partnership by NASA’s Johnson Space Center and Boeing, this ISS National Lab sponsored investigation will marry two pieces of existing spaceflight technology, miniPCR and the MinION, to change that process, allowing for the first unknown biological samples to be prepared, sequenced and then identified in space. The miniPCR (polymerase chain reaction) device was first used aboard the station during the Genes in Space-1, and, soon to be Genes in Space-2 investigations, student-designed experiments in the Genes in Space program. Genes in Space-1 successfully demonstrated the device could be used in microgravity to amplify DNA, a process used to create thousands of copies of specific sections of DNA. The second investigation arrived at the space station on April 22, and will be tested this summer. Next came the Biomolecule Sequencer investigation, which successfully tested the MinION’s ability to sequence strands of Earth-prepared DNA in an orbiting laboratory. „What the coupling of these different devices is doing is allowing us to take the lab to the samples, instead of us having to bring the samples to the lab,” said Aaron Burton, NASA biochemist and Genes in Space-3 co-investigator. Crew members will collect a sample from within the space station to be cultured aboard the orbiting laboratory. The sample will then be prepared for sequencing, in a process similar to the one used during the Genes in Space-1 investigation, using the miniPCR and finally, sequenced and identified using the MinION device. „The ISS is very clean,” said Sarah Stahl, microbiologist and project scientist. „We find a lot of human-associated microorganisms – a lot of common bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus and different types of familiar fungi like Aspergillus and Penicillium.” In addition to identifying microbes in space, this technology could be used to diagnose crew member wounds or illnesses in real time, help identify DNA-based life on other planets and help with other investigations aboard the station. „The Genes in Space-3 process will increase the scientific capacity of the ISS by facilitating state-of-the-art molecular biology research for both current and next generation ISS researchers,” said Kristen John, NASA aerospace engineer and Genes in Space-3 project engineer. „The team has put a strong focus on generating a spaceflight-certified catalog of general laboratory items and reagents, and developing common methods and easily customizable reaction conditions for miniPCR and the MinION to enable other ISS researchers to use this technology.” This process will give scientists on the ground real-time access to the experiments going on in space, allowing for more accuracy and a more efficient use of the time on the space station. „If you could get a snapshot of the molecular signatures of your research as it was occurring on the ISS, how would you change your experiment?” said Wallace. „Would you change your time points? Provide a different nutrient? Alter growth conditions? You can imagine how, if you had that data, you could adjust your experiment to enhance the insight being gained.” Closer to home, this process can be used to provide real-time diagnosis of viruses in areas of the world where access to a laboratory may not be possible. The ISS National Laboratory is managed by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS). For more information about research happening aboard the space station, follow @ISS_Research.

Next came the Biomolecule Sequencer investigation, which successfully tested the MinION's ability to sequence strands of Earth-prepared DNA in an orbiting laboratory. "What the coupling of these different devices is doing is allowing us to take the lab to the samples, instead of us having to bring the samples to the lab," said Aaron Burton, NASA biochemist and Genes in Space-3 co-investigator. Crew members will collect a sample from within the space station to be cultured aboard the orbiting laboratory. The sample will then be prepared for sequencing, in a process similar to the one used during the Genes in Space-1 investigation, using the miniPCR and finally, sequenced and identified using the MinION device. "The ISS is very clean," said Sarah Stahl, microbiologist and project scientist. "We find a lot of human-associated microorganisms - a lot of common bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus and different types of familiar fungi like Aspergillus and Penicillium." In addition to identifying microbes in space, this technology could be used to diagnose crew member wounds or illnesses in real time, help identify DNA-based life on other planets and help with other investigations aboard the station. "The Genes in Space-3 process will increase the scientific capacity of the ISS by facilitating state-of-the-art molecular biology research for both current and next generation ISS researchers," said Kristen John, NASA aerospace engineer and Genes in Space-3 project engineer. "The team has put a strong focus on generating a spaceflight-certified catalog of general laboratory items and reagents, and developing common methods and easily customizable reaction conditions for miniPCR and the MinION to enable other ISS researchers to use this technology." This process will give scientists on the ground real-time access to the experiments going on in space, allowing for more accuracy and a more efficient use of the time on the space station. "If you could get a snapshot of the molecular signatures of your research as it was occurring on the ISS, how would you change your experiment?" said Wallace. "Would you change your time points? Provide a different nutrient? Alter growth conditions? You can imagine how, if you had that data, you could adjust your experiment to enhance the insight being gained." Closer to home, this process can be used to provide real-time diagnosis of viruses in areas of the world where access to a laboratory may not be possible. The ISS National Laboratory is managed by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS).

(File Photo | AP) PARIS: Europe's Airbus on Thursday posted a steeper than expected 52 percent drop in first-quarter profit, weighed by weaker prices as it changes to new models and higher production costs, but reaffirmed targets for higher profits for the year. The world's second-largest planemaker after Boeing said adjusted operating profit fell to 240 million euros ($261.7 million) as revenues rose 7 percent to 12.988 billion. Analysts were on average expecting adjusted operating income of 344 million euros, down 31 percent, and 5.5 percent higher revenues of 12.857 billion, according to a Reuters poll. Airbus said it was still worried about problems with temperamental engines for its new A320neo passenger plane from Pratt & Whitney, and commercial exposure on the troubled A400M military aircraft programme. It expects deliveries of the A320neo once again to fall predominantly in the latter part of the year, but has said it hopes to avoid the last-minute rush seen in December last year. The engine issues "need to be resolved," Airbus said in a statement. The Airbus planemaking business saw 31 percent lower profit despite a 13 percent rise in revenues. The Toulouse-based firm said this reflected a different mix of aircraft, with more of the new A350s delivered in the first quarter, "transition pricing" and higher production ramp-up costs. New aircraft tend to be sold at heavier discounts to spur further orders. The Airbus Helicopters unit slipped into loss as the world's largest commercial helicopter maker continues to suffer from the grounding of aircraft in UK and Norway, following a crash that killed North Sea oil workers. For 2017, Airbus expects to deliver over 720 aircraft and to report mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income. Airbus' results came a day after Boeing reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit, with its U.S rival also lifting its full-year forecast.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:20 PM, April 27, 2017 Updated: 3:15 PM, April 27, 2017 SHANGHAI - Chinese and European aviation regulators said on Thursday they will forge closer ties over aircraft manufacturing and certification as the global industry turns its eyes to China ahead of the maiden flight of the Chinese-built C919 jet. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are holding a landmark meeting on aviation in Shanghai as China's government pushes for a bigger role in the global aviation market. The first flight in May of the C919 jet, built by Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), will mark a major step for Beijing. The government hopes the jet will compete with Boeing Co and Airbus SE for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. A big hurdle, though, is that Europe and the United States have yet to certify a domestically built Chinese passenger plane and do not currently recognize Chinese certification procedures, limiting the countries to which China can sell its planes. "The ever closer ties between the Chinese and European aviation industries have created good conditions and a solid foundation to deepen cooperation on aircraft manufacturing and certification," CAAC administrator Feng Zhenglin said. Another CAAC official said closer ties would "increase the global influence and competitiveness of Chinese aviation". The meeting between CAAC and EASA is the first since the two signed an agreement in 2015 to cooperate more closely on aviation issues in a five-year project. The ties have already yielded some results. EASA said on Wednesday it had started the process of certification for the C919, though no decision had yet been made. China's first domestically made plane, the regional ARJ21 jet, has yet to receive U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or EASA certification, which had raised questions over whether the larger C919 jet would be approved in the West. The Shanghai meeting will see a raft of global aviation firms including COMAC, Airbus, Safran SA, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC and British Airways, part of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.

The European firm said it was confident of plans to increase jet output despite wobbling demand, but voiced caution about the speed at which it can lower costs on its new A350 and warned of "significant" exposure on its troubled A400M army plane. Airbus' results came a day after rival Boeing reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit, with the world's largest planemaker also lifting its full-year forecast. Airbus Finance Director Harald Wilhelm took aim at U.S. supplier Pratt & Whitney over engine delays that forced it to deliver fewer A320neos than planned last quarter, despite fresh assurances from the engine maker that it will meet targets. "The demonstrated performance so far is not satisfactory, but let's see whether their fixes are coming through (and) are finally confirmed. ... We still need to see the proof coming through," he told reporters. "We don't miss any opportunity to remind Pratt of the commitments they made for 2017 and 2018," he added. He also said Airbus was trying to secure a return this year to European government export funding, which was suspended last year amid a probe into suspected corruption in jetliner sales. Wrangling over past business dealings deepened on Wednesday when Austria disclosed a separate fraud probe into Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders over a 2003 fighter deal. Airbus called the accusations "completely unsubstantiated". Airbus shares fell as much as two percent, before steadying down 0.8 percent. Its quarterly adjusted operating profit fell 52 percent to 240 million euros ($261.7 million) as revenues rose 7 percent to 12.988 billion. Analysts were on average expecting core profit of 344 million euros, down 31 percent. A350 CHALLENGE The Airbus planemaking business saw 31 percent lower profit despite a 13 percent rise in revenues. It blamed a less favourable mix of deliveries in the quarter, which included more of the new but still sharply discounted A350s and higher production ramp-up costs. Getting costs on the A350 to fall in line with targets as volume increases is a "top challenge" for 2017, Wilhelm said. However it had reduced the amount of unscheduled factory work. Airbus is in the midst of two major product changes designed to revitalise its portfolio through the 2020s, but which also spell the end of its two existing cash lifelines. They include the A320 medium-haul jet, upgraded with new engines to become the A320neo, and the long-haul A330, giving way to the all-new A350 and to an upgrade of the A330 itself. The switchover between models is a tricky time for planemakers as they discount the old while mastering the new. Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said the results were hit by "severe pricing weakness" as Airbus preserves customers for the current version of its A330 wide-body jet. Wilhelm and some analysts said the trends were as expected. Airbus Helicopters slipped narrowly into loss as the world's largest commercial helicopter maker continues to suffer from damage to its image from the grounding of aircraft in UK and Norway, following a crash that killed North Sea oil workers. A report on last year's crash is due on Friday. For 2017, Airbus officially expects to deliver over 700 jets and to report mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income. Wilhelm said the actual delivery target is around 720.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: Who benefits? It’s hard to say precisely because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready to say at what levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting many of the richest taxpayers. Why cut corporate taxes? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. The Obama administration proposed cutting it to 28 percent. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. “Simplifying the tax code as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale is certainly something that we support,” an executive at Boeing said on a conference call earlier Wednesday. Who’d benefit from the corporate rate cut? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they are structured as pass-throughs, an ungainly moniker that derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers would receive an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas’ men’s basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax, despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as “business income” and have it taxed at the 15 percent rate, tax experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses more than doubled the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” How else would big businesses benefit? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. That’s led many businesses to keep hundreds of billions of dollars outside the U.S. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the U.S. and invest it in plants and equipment. Yet some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. What about the deficit and growth? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster economic growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well. But the Trump team offered no details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would lower government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 of a percentage point annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 (G-20) countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday (April 26) cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 per cent from 35 per cent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 per cent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation."   asiastocks.jpg Related Story Asian shares retreat from highs on doubts over Trump tax plan   fed.jpg Related Story Fed, wary of inflation, could lean against Trump tax cut Big US companies have nearly US$1.8 trillion (S$2.5 trillion) in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service.

Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 per cent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 per cent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 per cent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform,"Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call on Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. "A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump's first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Companies cheer Trump tax cuts, but jobs are less certain to follow By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz (Reuters) - U.S. businesses would reap a windfall if President Donald Trump's plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas becomes law, but it was unclear whether they would stimulate a surge in investment and job creation in return. Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended.

(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory President Donald Trump told Reuters on Thursday that he was “psyched” to terminate the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico, but changed his mind after their leaders asked for it to be renegotiated instead. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he will not hesitate to change course again and pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement if the negotiations become “unserious.” His comments came at the end of a long 24 hours during which Ottawa and Mexico City were whipsawed over the Trump administration’s intentions over the 23-year-old trade pact. “You know I was really ready and psyched to terminate NAFTA,” Trump said. He decided that it would be better to terminate the trade deal after hearing about Wisconsin farmers’ struggles with new Canadian dairy rules that were shutting out their milk protein exports. “You saw that, you wrote about it,” Trump said. “And I said I’ve had it. I’ve had it.” But after administration officials said a withdrawal order was being prepared, Trump said he received phone calls from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking to renegotiate the pact. “I’m not looking to hurt Canada and I’m not looking to hurt Mexico. They’re two countries I really like,” Trump said. “So they asked to renegotiate, and I said yes.” News of the possible U.S. pullout from NAFTA rattled financial markets on Wednesday. Relative calm returned on Thursday after Trump’s comments, and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.86 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar was flat versus the greenback. Mexico, Canada and the United States form one of the world’s biggest trading blocs, and trade disruptions among them could adversely affect farm, automotive, energy and other sectors in all three countries. NAFTA removed most trade and tariff barriers between the neighbors, but Trump and other critics have blamed it for deep U.S. job cuts. Trump campaigned for president last year on a pledge to pull out of NAFTA if he could not renegotiate better terms. The United States went from running a small goods trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63-billion deficit in 2016. Asked by Reuters what would make NAFTA a fair deal, Trump said: “Open markets. Open borders for trade” and “Fairness, no government subsidies so that it makes it impossible for our people to compete.” He added that if the NAFTA negotiations “become unserious, I will terminate.” As Trump spoke, a new trade irritant between the United States and Canada emerged, as Boeing Co asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged price dumping and unfair Canadian government subsidies for Bombardier Inc’s new Canadian-made CSeries jetliners. ‘GET TO WORK’ Trudeau told a news conference in Saskatchewan he had urged Trump not to withdraw from the trade pact and warned that doing so “would cause a lot of short- and medium-term pain.” “That’s not something that either one of us would want, so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA,” Trudeau said. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. On Tuesday, Trump said he did not fear a trade war with Canada, a day after his administration moved to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber. In Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Pena Nieto had called Trump on Wednesday and spoken with him for about 20 minutes in a conversation focused exclusively on the looming talks over NAFTA’s “renegotiation and modernization.” Trump has accused Mexico of luring away American factories and jobs with cheap labor and other advantages enabled by NAFTA. During the presidential campaign he accused Mexico of sending rapists and criminals into the United States, and as president plans a U.S.-Mexico border wall. One of Trump’s first major acts after becoming president in January was to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Several agriculture lobby groups in Washington were told U.S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, met with Trump on Wednesday evening to dissuade him from withdrawing from NAFTA. American Soybean Association President Ron Moore said, “When you’re talking about $3 billion in soybean exports a year, any threats to withdraw from agreements and walk away from markets makes farmers extremely nervous.” Formal NAFTA talks likely will not get started until August. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office must first send Congress a notice that starts a 90-day consultation period preceding any negotiations. A USTR spokeswoman said the notice would not be sent until the Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee for trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. (Additional reporting by Stephen J.

Why, you announce a tax cut! And in your self-absorbed way, you announce a tax cut that will hugely benefit yourself. Imagine those millions saved! You feel better already! I’m deeply skeptical that President Donald Trump will manage to get a tax reform package passed into law, and that’s just as well. Trump’s new tax “plan” (more like an extremely vague plan for a plan) is an irresponsible, shameless, budget-busting gift to zillionaires like himself. This isn’t about “jobs,” as the White House claims. If it were, it might cut employment taxes, which genuinely do discourage hiring. Rather, it’s about huge payouts to the wealthiest Americans — and deficits be damned! If Republicans embrace this “plan” after all their hand-wringing about deficits and debt, we should build a Grand Monument to Hypocrisy in their honor. Trump’s tax “plan” is a betrayal of his voters. He talks of helping ordinary Americans even as he enriches tycoons like himself. For example, it’s great that the tax plan promises help with child care costs, a huge burden for low-income families, especially single moms. But Trump doesn’t explain what form his help will take. Maybe he will eventually provide details, but in his campaign tax plan (which overall seems similar to the latest), fewer than 10 percent of low-income households with children would get anything at all, according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in February. It added that under the campaign plan, families earning between $10,000 and $30,000 a year would receive an average child care benefit of just $10. In fairness, Trump’s proposal does include some sensible elements. Raising the standard deduction is smart and would simplify everything, reducing cheating and the need for record-keeping because millions of filers would no longer itemize deductions. But the heart of Trump’s “plan” is to lower taxes for corporations and the affluent. It would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, without which Trump would have paid less than 4 percent in taxes for 2005; with it, he paid 25 percent. Conservatives emphasize that the official top corporate tax rate in the U.S. is too high, and they have a point. The top rate for American corporations — almost 39 percent, including a 35 percent federal rate and a bit more for the average state rate — is among the highest in the world, according to the Tax Foundation. Yet that’s deeply misleading, because most companies don’t pay that rate. The Government Accountability Office found that two-thirds of active corporations paid no federal tax. Even large, profitable corporations paid an average federal rate of only 14 percent — and Boeing, Verizon, General Electric and Priceline paid no federal income tax over a five-year period, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. There’ve been many studies showing that the U.S. effective marginal rate for corporations is in the same ballpark as in other industrialized countries (some say it’s a bit lower, others a bit higher). So, sure, let’s lower the official corporate tax rate while reducing loopholes, but don’t pretend this will create a ton of new jobs. Where the tax plan would have a big impact is in empowering some very wealthy people, because of another bit of chicanery in the proposal: Trump apparently would allow some business owners to dodge personal income tax by paying at the much lower corporate rate. In other words, tycoons would try to structure their incomes to pay not at a 39.6 percent top personal rate but at a 15 percent corporate rate. This isn’t tax policy; it’s a heist. Then there’s the elimination of the estate tax. The White House talks solemnly about protecting family farms and other businesses, but give us a break! The estate tax now affects only couples worth more than $11 million. About one-fifth of 1 percent of Americans are affected — but the estate tax does limit the rise of inequality and assures a hint of fairness, since much of the wealth in rich estates has never been taxed at all. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Trump’s tax “plan” would be paid for partly “with growth” — which means that he has no idea how to pay for it. The Tax Policy Center examined Trump’s campaign tax plan and found it would cause the federal debt to rise by at least $7 trillion in the first decade, and more than $20 trillion by 2036 — slowing growth, not raising it. To put the latter number in perspective, that’s additional borrowing of about $160,000 per American household. Effectively, we’d borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions. And this is populism? Nicholas Kristof is a columnist for The New York Times.

Read why Brigham & Women’s Hospital is offering buyouts to 1,600 workers, and why it and parent Partners HealthCare paid $10 million to settle allegations a researcher fraudlently obtained a federal grant. A report shows which Mass. companies have managed to pay no state taxes. And there’s more news about United Airlines. But first, here’s Jon Chesto. Chesto Means Business Wynn's big bet:  Building in the Boston area sure can get expensive. Just ask Steve Wynn. The Wynn Resorts CEO used to complain aboutgovernment bureaucracy in Massachusetts during earnings calls with analysts. But this week, he kvetchedabout the cost of hiring subcontractors here instead. Wynn is building a massive hotel and casino on the Mystic River in Everett, with an opening expected in two years. The projected cost for Wynn Boston Harbor was $1.6 billion back in 2014, when he won the casino license for the region. Today? It’s $2.4 billion. The company, among its standard legal disclosures in its recent annual report , warned that development expenses may still go higher than expected. The skyrocketing costs didn’t go unnoticed. One analyst essentially asked Wynn: Are we done, now? Wynn said yes, “that’s the end of it.” His company has established a “Guaranteed Maximum Price” of $1.3 billion for hard construction costs at the Suffolk-built project. The rest consists of non-construction expenses such as furnishings, equipment, designs, permits, licensing and community payments. It also includes the millions that Wynn is spending to buy nearby properties to spruce up the place. Wynn blamed the overruns on surprisingly expensive bids from subcontractors, which he in turn attributed to demand for services in a boomtown. “The building trades are busy in Boston,” Wynn said, “and the cost of living is high in Boston.” Meanwhile, Wynn Resorts shares jumped 6 percent on Wednesday after corporate earnings beat expectations. For now, investors seem willing to wait to see whether Wynn’s big bet on Boston pays off. Jon Chesto is a Globe reporter. Reach him at jon.chesto@globe.com and follow him on Twitter @jonchesto. Executive Summary Tax free Massachusetts:  As we're hearing about President Trump looking to cut federal business taxes, there's a new report on how little large US companies pay in state taxes. Seven profitable Massachusetts Fortune 500 companies paid little or no state tax in 2015, according to the report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Those companies include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., which paid no taxes but reported $852 million in profits. The Massachusetts corporate tax rate is 8 percent. Be sure to check out the Globe report here for the full scoop. Economy remains strong: The labor market is still tightening -- a sign of a strong economy -- as the four-month average for new jobless claims continues to fall. The four-week moving average of claims dropped 500 to 242,250 for the week ending April 22, the lowest level since February. The government reported more Americans filing for jobless benefits (257,000) than expected (245,000) for last week. The uptick may sound like bad news, but the four-week average is considered more reliable because it smooths out rough spots in the data. Elsewhere, durable goods purchases increased 0.7 percent in March to $238.71 billion. Who has access to Trump?: The answer is manufacturing and finance executives, according to a study by Reuters. Since Jan. 20, high executives from nearly 190 companies have visited the president or his advisers at the White House or Mar-a-Lago. Of those, traditional industrial firms were tops. They included multiple visits from Ford, GM and Boeing execs. Some of these meetings have been in the news. Others are the result of Reuters analyzing more than 900 White House press pool reports. The picture is incomplete, since Trump won't release White House visitor logs. Access can mean influence, and that makes it important the public know who visits the White House. Partners, Brigham settle: Partners Health Care System and its Brigham & Women’s Hospital will pay $10 million to settle allegations it fraudulently obtained federal grant funding. The federal authorities contended a stem cell lab run by Dr. Piero Anversa submitted false scientific information to the National Institutes of Health to get the grant funding. Anversa and two other doctors allegedly involved are no longer affiliated with Partners and the Brigham. After learning of the allegations, Partners and Brigham investigated and forwarded their findings to federal authorities. Brigham offers buyouts: The Brigham is offering voluntary buyouts to 1,600 workers. The hospital, one of Boston's largest employers, said it's profitable, but buffeted by flat payments for services from insurers and government while its expenses rise. Brigham also is taking on $845 million of debt from a pair of projects, including a new software system that launched in 2015. Brigham earned $93 million last year. Its parent Partners lost $108 million largely due to its insurance business. Brigham has 18,000 workers. Workers age 60 and over are eligible for the buyout, which includes one year of base pay. The buyouts come as Care New England, which is about to merge with Partners, announced layoffs across its company.  From Staples to books:  Longtime Staples executive Demos Parneros is now the top man at bookseller Barnes & Noble, a mere five months after his arrival. Parneros was named chief executive today. He replaced Ronald Boire, who was ousted in August after less than a year. Barnes & Noble, which is squaring off against online retailers, reported an 8 percent first quarter decline in sales. As president of Staples North American stores, Parneros is familiar with that pressure. Back in March, the Globe's Jon Chesto all but predicted Parneros' rise. He reported interim CEO Len Riggio all but giving Parneros the job.

Those new rules would roll back Obama-era regs known as “net neutrality.” Net neutrality requires all cable and wireless companies to treat all Internet traffic equally. So, for instance, YouTube videos are as clear as those on Comcast’s NBC network.   FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai could have struck down the Obama rules. Instead, he’s calling for an entire do-over. If the FCC comes down with a heavy hand, that could dampen entrepreneurship. The commission votesMay 8. When that time comes, Bray hopes the FCC recalls the battle cry of the old online activists: “Hands off my Internet!” Talking Points newsletter is compiled by Edward Mason. Follow him on Twitter at  @EBMason. If you liked what you've read, please tell your friends to sign up.

By Kali Holloway / AlterNet April 27, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Shutterstock.com One of the many impossible promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail was that he, and he alone, would be able to stem the tide of American jobs moving overseas. Though it was, on its face, a lie as unbelievable and untenable as all the others, it only further solidified Trump’s “America First” bonafides with his base. Fast forward to nearly 100 days into Trump's presidency, and his casting of himself as a hybrid strongman-miracle worker seems only slightly less absurd than his supporters' continued belief in this invention. Not only has Trump not been the great job savior he proclaimed himself, but thousands of jobs continue to flow to places like Mexico and China. One day after he vowed to exit NAFTA, a ThinkProgress analysis found that “since Trump was sworn in on January 20, at least 11,934 American jobs have either been moved abroad or are in the process of leaving the country.” The figure is based on data from the Department of Labor Trade Adjustment Assistance program, but since there’s no agency or organization that keeps exact tabs on the number of jobs leaving America for cheaper environs abroad, “the actual number is almost certainly much higher." ThinkProgress' investigation is aligned with recent reports of individual companies shipping thousands of jobs beyond America’s borders. A Bloomberg report from March found that: Illinois Tool Works Inc. will close an auto-parts plant in Mazon, Illinois, this month and head to Ciudad Juarez. Triumph Group Inc. is reducing the Spokane, Washington, workforce that makes fiber-composite parts for Boeing Co. aircraft and moving production to Zacatecas and Baja California. TE Connectivity Ltd. is shuttering a pressure-sensor plant in Pennsauken, New Jersey, in favor of a facility in Hermosillo. Trump’s method for attempting to keep jobs in the country was simply to yell at manufacturers, often via social media where he assumed public pressure and bad press would outweigh the lure of enhanced profits and even less regulation. He was, predictably, wrong. Though Trump has repeatedly tried to take credit for saving thousands of jobs across the country, he’s failed to move company heads to stay put. And in cases where businesses have pulled back on plans to send jobs to other countries, Trump has had nothing to do with the decision-making process. Indianapolis-based firm Rexnord is moving 300 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico, despite a December tweet by Trump meant to shame the company into staying. That company is located just up the road from Carrier, the air conditioning manufacturer Trump falsely claimed to have bribed into keeping 1,100 jobs in its home state. Like nearly every victory claimed by the president, it too was a lie. As CNN Money notes, only 800 factory jobs were saved while 500 are still being shifted south. Trump’s falsehood moved a local union leader to declare POTUS had “lied his ass off.” “Trump and Pence, they pulled a dog and pony show on the numbers,” Chuck Jones, president of the local steelworkers union, told the Washington Post. “I almost threw up in my mouth.” The ThinkProgress investigation found that jobs are being lost nationwide, “from Maine to Florida, from Arizona to Wisconsin,” in fields beyond the factory, such as “medicine, technology, even finance.” As Trump continues to drive money out of the economy and drive sales figures down for various industries—his nationalism will likely cost the U.S. billions in lost tourism, for example—the job exodus will likely continue.       Kali Holloway is a senior writer and the associate editor of media and culture at AlterNet.         Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Sign Up!

People know this and they're sick of it. They've even taken to the streets. It's a non-partisan outrage, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street. People are sick of the cronyism, and the Export-Import Bank is the epitome of that cronyism. Come September, lawmakers have a chance to put an end to this boondoggle. It should be a no-brainer for anyone who believes in markets and who see the immorality of giving subsidies to companies, whether they are big or small and domestic-based or foreign-based. It should also be easy since most of the bank's activities support large and successful companies which didn't wait for the handout to make some cash. In fact, some great research by Heritage Foundation's Diane Katz proves that the bank's stories about being the secret ingredient in the success and profits sauce of specific small businesses--including the bank's poster child Mrs. Jenny's Pickles--are quite misleading. But what about the claim that export subsidies are necessary to counteract the competitive disadvantages posed by the export credit agencies of foreign nations? Since foreign firms enjoy the benefits of their own national export subsidy organizations, the thinking goes, U.S. firms would struggle to compete internationally if our federal government did not provide similar aid. Obviously, U.S. exporters prefer that their companies only had to compete on price and quality against unsubsidized foreign companies. Bad economic policy is hardly limited to the U.S., and many countries have indeed established their own export-financing agencies just like the Export-Import Bank. This does not justify the bank’s existence, however. Congress recently obliged the bank to provide more explanations for certain portfolio transactions as a condition of its most recent reauthorization in 2012. While the bank does not provide justifications for all transactions in its portfolio, the bank’s current charter now compels Ex-Im to at least provide categorical explanations for all loans and long-term loan guarantees in its annual report. According to the Export-Import Bank's fiscal year 2013 annual report, roughly $7.9 billion in estimated export-valued loans and $10.7 billion in estimated export-valued long-term loan guarantees, or a combined estimated export value of $18.7 billion, must be categorized as Congress legislated. Here is how Ex-Im justifies its activities: $4.1 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “political risks,” another $2.1 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “private sector limitations,” and finally $12.2 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “foreign competition.” That leaves $18.8 billion in estimated export value, or 50.2 percent, of the rest of the bank’s portfolio unjustified. Since the estimated export value of the bank’s entire portfolio for fiscal year 2013 was roughly $37.4 billion, this means that less than one third of the estimated export value of the bank’s portfolio is intended to actually counteract competitive disadvantages wrought by foreign export credit agencies. What's more, much of this financing goes to large corporations that are unlikely to be incontrovertibly harmed by foreign export credit agencies. For instance, roughly 66 percent of the value designated to “meet competition from a foreign, officially-sponsored export-credit agency” went to the Boeing Corporation, whose own financial director publicly admitted could “find alternative funding sources” without the Export-Import Bank. The bottom line is that defending the Export-Import Bank on the grounds that it effectively counters foreign competition simply does not hold water. The Export-Import Bank backs less than 2 percent of the value of total U.S. exports. It means that more than 98 percent of U.S. exports take place without any support from the Ex-Im Bank. In addition, the Bank’s data show that it justifies less than 33 percent of this tiny portion on the grounds of countering foreign competition. In other words, the Bank claims to counteract 0.0066 percent of the value of U.S. exports that are exposed to foreign-subsidized competition. The Bank's effect in countering foreign subsidies is negligible, but its activities come at the great costs of corporate cronyism, economic distortions and irresponsible taxpayer exposure. It's time to retire the Export-Import Bank. CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the percentage of the value of U.S. exports that are exposed to foreign-subsidized competition the Export-Import Bank claims to counteract.

Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Thursday was Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) which traded up 1.23% at $33.81. The stock’s 52-week range is $25.81 to $34.53. Volume was about equal to the daily average of around 19.4 million shares.

Volume was about a 30% below the daily average of around 3.2 million. Several analysts raised price targets on the aircraft maker. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) traded up 0.76% at $37.21. The stock’s 52-week range is $29.50 to $38.45. Volume was about 20% above the daily average of around 23.6 million shares. The chipmaker announces first-quarter results after markets close Thursday.

(Reuters) SYDNEY: Australian national carrier Qantas Airways Ltd. on Thursday said it would ax its Melbourne-Dubai-London flights operated in partnership with Emirates and switch the capacity to Asia when it launches non-stop Perth-London flights next year. The move is part of a strategy of cutting the journey time to London to gain an edge and pricing premium over the two dozen rivals offering one-stop flights on the so-called Kangaroo route. Qantas will charge a premium of as much as 48 percent in economy class and 62 percent in business class relative to one-stop rivals like Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines on the Perth-London route in return for saving three hours of travel time, according to online price comparisons. Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce has said his airline could be operating non-stop flights from Sydney and Melbourne to London within five years as Airbus SE and Boeing Co. introduce longer-range aircraft. The 17-hour Perth-London flight on a Boeing 787-9 will originate and end in Melbourne and will not be subject to heightened security checks for Middle Eastern flights as a result. It will cut more than an hour off the flying time from Melbourne to London relative to the current route through Dubai, Qantas said in a statement. Sydney-Dubai-London will be the Australian airline’s only flight operating through the Emirates hub once the change takes place in March. Qantas’s capacity to London will fall as a result of the switch to a 787 from a larger A380. Two A380s that had been serving the Melbourne-Dubai-London route would be redeployed to meet periods of high demand from Melbourne and Sydney to destinations in Asia, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, a Qantas spokeswoman said.

Wall Street analysts expect repatriation to increase share buybacks. The PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW) has underperformed the S&P 500 so far this year. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross talks trade, Trump and taxes    19 Hours Ago | 08:14 Tax reform appears just around the corner, potentially breathing new life into share buybacks and the companies that do them. Wall Street generally remains confident that a plan that passes Congress will include a cut in the tax rate for repatriation of profits — overseas earnings brought back to the U.S. — despite no mention of a specific rate in the Wednesday announcement of the Trump administration's plan. The handout from the administration just read, "one-time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas." "When it comes, I do believe it will impact buybacks more than dividends," said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. "Buybacks are a win-win short-term situation for companies. The minute you do it, you support your stock." Buying back shares reduces the share count for a stock, increasing the earnings per share. Shareholders theoretically benefit, although critics say companies' cash would be better used in longer-term investments for the good of the business such as capital expenditures. "I think there is a good chance the 10 percent tax repatriation rate will be implemented," Thomas Digenan, head of U.S. intrinsic value equity at UBS Asset Management, said in an email. "To the extent the Republicans are willing to use the budget reconciliation process [that expedites policy consideration], they will only need a simple majority to pass a tax bill." show chapters Less taxes, more problems?    Wednesday, 26 Apr 2017 | 5:03 PM ET | 05:56 In November, after Trump's election win, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, forecast that S&P 500 buybacks would surge by 30 percent this year if there is repatriation, but by just 5 percent without tax reform. Kostin estimated that lower tax rates on repatriated profits should add $150 billion to a total expected $780 billion in buybacks, only the second time in 20 years in which buybacks will account for the largest share of total cash use by S&P 500 companies. The buyback trade One way to trade a potential resurgence in share buybacks is through the PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW), which tracks U.S. stocks with a net reduction in shares outstanding of at least 5 percent in the last 12 months. Except for 2015, over the last eight years PKW has generally outperformed the S&P 500 with solid double-digit annual gains. The fund rose as much as 44.56 percent in 2013. But so far this year, PKW is up only about 4 percent, versus the S&P 500's nearly 7 percent rise. Five-year month-to-date performance of PKW vs. S&P 500 (indexed to Dec. 30, 2016) Source: FactSet PKW tracks the Nasdaq U.S. BuyBack Achievers Index and the holdings of both are adjusted after the end of every quarter to account for changes in company share count. As of Tuesday, the top five holdings in PKW were: McDonald's Boeing General Electric United Technologies Goldman Sachs To be sure, Trump's tax proposal also faces the very big hurdle of congressional approval. It is possible the final repatriation rate is higher than 10 percent, cutting into the amount of cash returned and limiting the buyback trade. When looking at companies with the most cash held overseas, technology names dominate. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle are the five companies with the largest overseas cash holdings, according to an April 17 note from S&P Global Ratings' Andrew Chang. Among those, Apple has also topped the list of S&P 500 companies with the largest quarterly buybacks and share count reduction in history, S&P's Silverblatt said. That said, technology stocks have already been the biggest winners of the last few months — the Nasdaq composite hit a record high Thursday.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons. The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) chapter of a notorious anti-Israel group is being slammed by Jewish students for launching a boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which was observed on Monday. “The Jewish community here at UCSB is shaken by the insensitivity of this resolution being brought up on Yom HaShoah [by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)],” Gauchos United for Israel told The Algemeiner on Tuesday. “Of course, we are not taking this sitting down and have mobilized members of our community to come together and carefully organize how we are going to most effectively explain why anti-Zionism is antisemitism as well as where legitimate criticism of the Israeli government ends and antisemitism begins,” said the Hillel-affiliated student group. Related coverage April 27, 2017 5:18 pm 0 Jews Murdered in Holocaust Called ‘Cowards’ at London Protest Outside Israeli Ambassador’s SOAS Lecture Some 400 demonstrators came out to protest Israeli Ambassador to the UK Mark Regev's appearance at a prominent London university on... In 2015, SJP introduced a similar resolution that was voted on — and defeated by a slim margin — at the Associated Students Senate on Holocaust Remembrance Day, as college paper The Daily Nexus reported. A member of SJP told the paper at the time that she had been in favor of postponing the vote, in recognition of Yom HaShoah as “a time when a lot of people are sensitive.” Another student responded that she found it “just a little bit ridiculous” that SJP could say it “stand[s] in solidarity with Jewish students when Jewish students feel attacked by a resolution that [SJP is] bringing.” UCSB SJP published a statement on Monday on a Facebook page called UCSB Divest, saying, “We resoundingly reject the notion that [the announcement of a new BDS push coinciding with Yom HaShoah] is in any way anti-semitic.” It said the “scheduling decision was made purely for pragmatic reasons.” UCSB SJP went on to call the Holocaust “a catastrophe of unmitigated proportions that lives in the memory of Jewish people throughout the world as a site of collective trauma and grief.” “We believe in the importance of upholding and honoring that trauma,” it added. Nate Erez, president of the Students Supporting Israel chapter, said, “The problem with SJP’s timing is not if they did it deliberately or not; the problem is they don’t care enough about Yom HaShoah to even think that maybe they shouldn’t bring a resolution that targets the one Jewish state on the one day a year when we commemorate the horrible atrocities of the Holocaust. Instead they do it, and then make excuses about how there was not a single other day in the entire school year that fit their schedule.” The resolution, titled “Divest From Companies that Profit From Human Rights Violations in Palestine/Israel,” calls for the student government, the university, the UCSB Foundation and the UC Regents to divest from companies that “a) provide military support for, or weaponry to support, the occupation of the Palestinian Territories, or b) facilitate the building or maintenance of the Apartheid Wall or the demolition of Palestinian homes, or c) facilitate in the building, maintenance, or economic development of Israeli settlements on annexed Palestinian territories.” Corporations supposedly guilty of these acts include “but [are] not limited to: Motorola, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.” The resolution cited the support of organizations like Jewish Voice for Peace — which honored Palestinian terrorist Rasmea Odeh at its national conference earlier this month — as proof “that the Jewish people are not a monolithic group that unconditionally supports policies of the Israeli government, and that critiques of the nation-state and its policies are political criticism, not anti-Semitic or an attack on the Jewish people.” Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel — which serves the UCSB campus — told The Algemeiner that his center “stands firmly behind our students in rejecting BDS and in standing up for what is right.” He also noted that UCSB student leaders have succeeded in defeating BDS — which he called “odious” and “evil” — “every single time it’s come up.” Campus activists have called the timing of anti-Israel activities for Jewish holidays an “underhanded” and “undemocratic” tactic. As The Algemeiner reported, student governments at Tufts University and Claremont Colleges both passed unexpected BDS motions on or immediately before the start of Passover this year.

Why, you announce a tax cut! READ MORE: Why tax cut may not deliver the boost White House promises Trump surprises with tax reform announcement Tax plan is far too vague And in your self-absorbed way, you announce a tax cut that will hugely benefit yourself. Imagine those millions saved! You feel better already! I’m deeply sceptical that United States President Donald Trump will manage to get a tax reform package passed into law, and that’s just as well. Trump’s new tax “plan” (more like an extremely vague plan for a plan) is an irresponsible, shameless, budget-busting gift to zillionaires like himself. This isn’t about “jobs”, as the White House claims. If it were, it might cut employment taxes, which genuinely do discourage hiring. Rather, it’s about huge payouts to the wealthiest Americans — and deficits be damned! Betrayal of his voters? If Republicans embrace this “plan” after all their hand-wringing about deficits and debt, we should build a Grand Monument to Hypocrisy in their honour. “Effectively, America would borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions.”” -Nicholas KristofShare on facebookTweet this Trump’s tax “plan” is a betrayal of his voters. He talks of helping ordinary Americans even as he enriches tycoons like himself. For example, it’s great that the tax plan promises help with child-care costs, a huge burden for low-income families, especially single mums. But Trump doesn’t explain what form his help will take. Maybe he will eventually provide details, but in his campaign tax plan (which overall seems similar to the latest), fewer than 10 per cent of low-income households with children would get anything at all, according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in February. It added that under the campaign plan, families earning between $10,000 (Dh36,780) and $30,000 a year would receive an average child care benefit of just $10. In fairness, Trump’s proposal does include some sensible elements. Raising the standard deduction is smart and would simplify everything, reducing cheating and the need for record-keeping because millions of filers would no longer itemize deductions. But the heart of Trump’s “plan” is to lower taxes for corporations and the affluent. It would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, without which Trump would have paid less than 4 per cent in taxes for 2005; with it, he paid 25 per cent. Conservatives emphasise that the official top corporate tax rate in the US is too high, and they have a point. The top rate for American corporations — almost 39 per cent, including a 35 per cent federal rate and a bit more for the average state rate — is among the highest in the world, according to the Tax Foundation. Yet, that’s deeply misleading, because most companies don’t pay that rate. The Government Accountability Office found that two-thirds of active corporations paid no federal tax. Large corporations paid 14% tax Even large, profitable corporations paid an average federal rate of only 14 per cent — and Boeing, Verizon, General Electric and Priceline paid no federal income tax over a five-year period, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. There’ve been many studies showing that the US effective marginal rate for corporations is in the same ballpark as in other industrialised countries (some say it’s a bit lower, others a bit higher). So, sure, let’s lower the official corporate tax rate while reducing loopholes, but don’t pretend this will create a ton of new jobs. Where the tax plan would have a big impact is in empowering some very wealthy people, because of another bit of chicanery in the proposal: Trump apparently would allow some business owners to dodge personal income tax by paying at the much lower corporate rate. In other words, tycoons would try to structure their incomes to pay not at a 39.6 per cent top personal rate, but at a 15 per cent corporate rate. This isn’t tax policy; it’s a heist. Then there’s the elimination of the estate tax. The White House talks solemnly about protecting family farms and other businesses, but give us a break! The estate tax now affects only couples worth more than $11 million. About one-fifth of 1 per cent of Americans are affected — but the estate tax does limit the rise of inequality and assures a hint of fairness, since much of the wealth in rich estates has never been taxed at all. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Trump’s tax “plan” would be paid for partly “with growth” — which means that he has no idea how to pay for it. The Tax Policy Center examined Trump’s campaign tax plan and found it would cause the federal debt to rise by at least $7 trillion in the first decade, and more than $20 trillion by 2036 — slowing growth, not raising it. To put the latter number in perspective, that’s additional borrowing of about $160,000 per American household. Effectively, America would borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions.

Under Trump’s proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce have cheered the administration’s tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned “the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation.” Big US companies have nearly US$1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than US$200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. “What we would do with it, let’s wait and see exactly what it is, but as I’ve said before we are always looking at acquisitions,” Cook told investors on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in January in response to an analyst’s question about the company’s thinking on acquisitions. Cook’s comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co, for example, has told investors that it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard & Poor’s said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first-quarter profits, partly because of a 4-percentage-point drop in its tax rate. “At the highest level we’re a big supporter of tax reform,” Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call. “It’s going to drive jobs, it’s going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it’s going to allow us to compete.” Boeing has been cutting jobs in the US, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. His administration has also been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while a bid to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Aviation Cyber Security Market Trends and Forecast By 2024 The aviation sector is expanding as more and more people are using airline services to travel across the globe. These have caused an increase in air traffic in recent years. To solve this problem, the aviation sector has adopted information technology in its system. The sector has upgraded itself from using Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) technologies to processor-based hardware platforms. However, use of information technology in aviation industry has given rise to the threat of cyber attack. Cyber attack is nothing but an internet based attempt to damage information technology system of an airline company and hack critical information using malware or spyware. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/aviation-cyber-securit… To tackle this issue, a cyber security solution is necessary in aviation industry. Cyber security is the use of technology and processes to protect data, computers and networks from attack of hackers through internet. Aviation cyber security solution mainly deals with management and protection of critical IT infrastructure in Aviation sector. Aviation industry basically uses and stores a high amount of processed data. This data is mainly used in airports, airlines and air traffic management (ATM) services. The manipulation of such data by hackers can create huge damage for aviation industry. The other threat is the increased use of mobile phones, laptop and tablets among airline passengers that has increased possible complexity regarding cyber attack threats. Due to the frequency and complexity of such cyber attacks, it has become necessary for aviation sector to improve the quality of protection. Thus, airline companies are now outsourcing their cyber security responsibilities to skilled security service providers, in order to gain better protection. High initial purchase and maintenance cost is a major challenge for the adoption of aviation cyber security solution in market. Most of airports and airline companies are unable to afford aviation cyber security due to this reason. Another challenge for aviation cyber security solution is the absence of standard cyber security framework. The aviation industry consists of many stakeholders such as airports, airlines and air traffic management service provider which are mostly controlled by private players. The coordination between the stakeholders is low which results in less standardization of aviation cyber security. A collective responsibility of governments, airlines, airports and Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in aviation industry is necessary to adopt such framework. The introduction of cloud based cyber security solution will help aviation industry to upgrade service in less time and low cost. The aviation cyber security solution find its application mainly in areas of airport management, air traffic management (ATM), airline management and air cargo management. Fill the form to gain deeper insights on this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The application of aviation cyber security solution is going to increase in air cargo management service in coming years as popularity of air cargo services have increased. Due to increasing cyber terrorism threat, the demand for aviation cyber security market is going to increase in developed economies such as North America and Europe. Some of the key companies providing aviation cyber security solution are Amadeus IT Group, Airbus SAS, Arinic, Boeing, IBM Corporation, Intel Corporation, Sabre Airline Solution, SITA, Symantec Corporation, Unisys Corperation, BAE Systems, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc, General Dynamics Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation and Raytheon Company.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 27 April 2017 | MYT 11:57 PM Tech earnings power Nasdaq to record high; S&P, Dow flat At 11:05am (Thursday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.18 points and the S&P 500 was down 1.32 points, but the Nasdaq Composite was up 15.61 points. The AFP photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: The Nasdaq hit a record intraday high on Thursday, powered by a string of strong earnings from technology companies, while the S&P 500 and the Dow were little changed. Investors shifted their focus back to earnings, a day after the Trump administration unveiled a tax reform plan that proposed deep tax cuts for businesses, but offered little detail about its implementation. “The market is focused more on growth and earnings now than what is coming out of the administration,” said Ryan Caldwell, chief investment officer at Chiron Investment Management. “It is good to see they are looking at taxes, and it’s good to know they are aggressive, but the implementation looks more like an end-of-the-year event.” The S&P 500 technology index rose 0.5%, led by PayPal, which hit an all-time high after raising its full-year earnings forecast. Technology stocks will remain in focus ahead of results from sector heavyweights Microsoft and Alphabet, which are scheduled to report results after the bell on Thursday. At 11:05am (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.18 points, or 0.07%, at 20,959.91, the S&P 500 was down 1.32 points, or 0.05%, at 2,386.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 15.61 points, or 0.26%, at 6,040.83. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. Energy tumbled 1.5% on the back of a more than 2% decline in oil prices. Financials, which had risen for the past three days, were down 0.7%. “I think in financials, it’s some profit-taking off a very good run week-to-date after the French elections,” Caldwell said. Comcast was the top stock on the S&P, with a 3% increase after the company’s profit beat analysts’ estimates on strong subscriber growth. American Airlines dropped 7% after the company said it had deferred the delivery of several Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. The news dragged down shares of other US carriers, including Delta and United Continental. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,507 to 1,240. On the Nasdaq, 1,372 issues fell and 1,262 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 62 52-week highs and one low, while the Nasdaq recorded 137 highs and 23 lows. - Reuters   Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Related Stories Wall St flat as Trump’s tax plan eyed Nasdaq, Russel hit record, Dow and S&P 500 brush against recent peaks(Update 2) Nasdaq breaches 6,000 mark for first time ever Wall St slips as investors brace for French election Wall St climbs as earnings gather pace; AmEx boosts Dow You May Be Interested Bring down tariff to zero, Najib tells Asean Trading ideas: Tenaga, T7Global, Datasonic, Westports Global stocks slip after Trump tax plan; euro softens after ECB CIMB says outlook is actually ‘better than it has been’ Digi posts RM373mil Q1 net profit, declares 4.7 sen dividend Why are M'sians investing hard-earned money in Ponzi schemes?

American and Airbus have reached an agreement under which the delivery of the Dallas/Fort Worth-based carrier’s first A350-900 will be pushed back to late 2020 from 2018, and all 22 A350-900s American has on order will be delivered on a deferred schedule. The 22 A350s will now be delivered from late 2020 to 2024 “with an average deferral of two years” per aircraft, American said. This is the second time in less than a year that American has deferred the delivery of the 22 A350-900s, which were originally ordered by US Airways in 2007. American and US Airways merged in December 2013. In July 2016, American reached an agreement with Airbus to defer its first A350-900 delivery from the spring of 2017 to late 2018. At that time, it pushed back the rest of the deliveries by 26 months on average, meaning that the new deferral pushes back those deliveries by 50 months on average from the original schedule. American has additionally reached an agreement with Boeing to defer the delivery of two 787-9s from the 2018 second quarter to the 2019 first quarter. American said the deferrals give it “widebody capacity flexibility.” The delivery schedule changes will reduce the airline’s planned capital expenditures by $500 million in 2018 and by $300 million in both 2019 and 2020.

Investors shifted their focus back to earnings, a day after the Trump administration unveiled a tax reform plan that proposed deep tax cuts for businesses, but offered little detail about its implementation. "The market is focused more on growth and earnings now than what is coming out of the administration," said Ryan Caldwell, chief investment officer at Chiron Investment Management. "It is good to see they are looking at taxes, and it's good to know they are aggressive, but the implementation looks more like an end-of-the-year event." The S&amp;P 500 technology index rose 0.5 percent, led by PayPal, which hit an all-time high after raising its full-year earnings forecast. Technology stocks will remain in focus ahead of results from sector heavyweights Microsoft and Alphabet, which are scheduled to report results after the bell on Thursday. At 11:05 a.m. ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.18 points, or 0.07 percent, at 20,959.91, the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.32 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,386.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 15.61 points, or 0.26 percent, at 6,040.83. Seven of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher. Energy tumbled 1.5 percent on the back of a more than 2 percent decline in oil prices. Financials, which had risen for the past three days, were down 0.7 percent. "I think in financials, it's some profit-taking off a very good run week-to-date after the French elections," Caldwell said. Comcast was the top stock on the S&amp;P, with a 3 percent increase after the company's profit beat analysts' estimates on strong subscriber growth. American Airlines dropped 7 percent after the company said it had deferred the delivery of several Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. The news dragged down shares of other U.S. carriers, including Delta and United Continental. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,507 to 1,240. On the Nasdaq, 1,372 issues fell and 1,262 advanced. The S&amp;P 500 index showed 62 52-week highs and one low, while the Nasdaq recorded 137 highs and 23 lows.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Vinod Khanna Udan Vijay Mallya Donald Trump IPL 2017 News Academy US STOCKS-Tech earnings power Nasdaq to record high; S&P, Dow flat Shares1 Thu, 27 Apr 2017-09:13pm , Reuters The Nasdaq hit a record intraday high on Thursday, powered by a string of strong earnings from technology companies, while the S&P 500 and the Dow were little changed. Investors shifted their focus back to earnings, a day after the Trump administration unveiled a tax reform plan that proposed deep tax cuts for businesses, but offered little detail about its implementation. "The market is focused more on growth and earnings now than what is coming out of the administration," said Ryan Caldwell, chief investment officer at Chiron Investment Management. "It is good to see they are looking at taxes, and it's good to know they are aggressive, but the implementation looks more like an end-of-the-year event." The S&P 500 technology index rose 0.5 percent, led by PayPal, which hit an all-time high after raising its full-year earnings forecast. Technology stocks will remain in focus ahead of results from sector heavyweights Microsoft and Alphabet, which are scheduled to report results after the bell on Thursday. At 11:05 a.m. ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.18 points, or 0.07 percent, at 20,959.91, the S&P 500 was down 1.32 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,386.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 15.61 points, or 0.26 percent, at 6,040.83. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. Energy tumbled 1.5 percent on the back of a more than 2 percent decline in oil prices. Financials, which had risen for the past three days, were down 0.7 percent. "I think in financials, it's some profit-taking off a very good run week-to-date after the French elections," Caldwell said. Comcast was the top stock on the S&P, with a 3 percent increase after the company's profit beat analysts' estimates on strong subscriber growth. American Airlines dropped 7 percent after the company said it had deferred the delivery of several Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. The news dragged down shares of other U.S. carriers, including Delta and United Continental. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,507 to 1,240. On the Nasdaq, 1,372 issues fell and 1,262 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 62 52-week highs and one low, while the Nasdaq recorded 137 highs and 23 lows.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo By Alana Wise | NEW YORK NEW YORK Shares of American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) dropped more than 8 percent on Thursday after the company said it had offered a mid-contract pay increase for pilots and flight attendants. American said that the move, which overshadowed the carrier's solid quarterly earnings, will increase its salary and benefits expense by approximately $230 million for 2017 and $350 million for 2018 and 2019. Flight attendants and pilots at American ratified new five-year agreements in late 2014 and early 2015. Under the new proposal, announced on Wednesday, they will now receive on average 5 percent to 8 percent increases in hourly pay, respectively, in an adjustment to match rival carriers. In the years since American contract negotiations, labor groups at rival airlines United (UAL.N) and Delta (DAL.N) have negotiated compensation agreements, placing American at the low end of the pay spectrum. "As our industry has rapidly evolved and pay increases at other airlines have accelerated, some of our colleagues have fallen behind their peers at other airlines in base pay rates. And, unless their current contracts are modified, they’ll remain far behind for more than two years," Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker said in a statement on Wednesday. Analysts worried about the possible effects of the pay increase on American and the implications it could have for the broader industry. "We are troubled by AAL’s wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups. In addition to raising fixed costs, American’s agreement with its labor stakeholders establishes a worrying precedent, in our view, both for American and the industry," JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. American posted earnings of 61 cents per share for the quarter ended March 31 on Thursday, versus analysts' consensus forecast of 57 cents per share, excluding special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline reported first-quarter revenue of $9.6 billion, matching analyst predictions, and a net profit of $308 million. Passenger unit revenue, which measures sales relative to flight capacity, rose 2.4 percent year over year. The company also said on Thursday it had deferred the delivery of several wide-body Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. That decision came two weeks after Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said it was reviewing pending wide-body jet orders to address excess capacity, noting that reductions were likely over the next several years. American said in its earnings filing that it was pushing back the first delivery of its Airbus (AIR.PA) A350 XWBs from 2018 to 2020 and deferring the delivery of two Boeing (BA.N) 787-9 aircraft to the first quarter of 2019 from the second quarter of 2018 to "provide widebody capacity flexibility" in its fleet.

NASA Running Out of Space Suits for ISS Missions © NASA. US 18:07 27.04.2017Get short URL 264545 NASA seems to be running out of usable suits for use at the International Space Station (ISS), according to the recent revelations of NASA Inspector General Paul Martin. © NASA. NASA Designs Flexible Spacesuits for Mission to MarsOn Wednesday, NASA Office of Inspector General released its report on the audit of NASA’s management and development of spacesuits. In the audit, Inspector General Paul Martin and his team examined "NASA’s efforts to maintain its existing spacesuits and its plans for and progress in developing its next-generation spacesuits." The team has interviewed Agency and other relevant officials; analyzed cost, schedule, and performance data; and reviewed relevant reports, documents, and presentations. The revelations however seem to be quite alarming. "Beginning with the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965, NASA astronauts have ventured outside their spacecraft hundreds of times wearing specialized suits that protect them from the harsh environments of space and provide the oxygen and temperature control necessary to preserve life. The spacesuits NASA astronauts currently use on the International Space Station (ISS or Station) – known as Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) – were developed more than 40 years ago and have far outlasted their original 15-year design life," the report states. "NASA continues to manage an array of design and health risks associated with the EMUs used by ISS crew. In addition, only 11 of the 18 original EMU Primary Life Support System units – a backpack-like structure that performs a variety of functions required to keep an astronaut alive during a spacewalk – are still in use, raising concerns that the inventory may not be adequate to last through the planned retirement of the ISS," says What We Found section of the manual. Russian Federal Space Agency Russia to Deliver Three Advanced Spacesuits to ISS in 2016 - OfficialGiven these issues, it further states, NASA will be challenged to continue to support ISS needs with the current fleet of EMUs through 2024, a challenge that will escalate significantly if station operations are extended to 2028. Despite spending nearly $200 million on NASA’s next-generation spacesuit technologies, the manual says, the Agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit capable of replacing the EMU or suitable for use on future exploration missions. "As different missions require different designs, the lack of a formal plan and specific destinations for future missions has complicated spacesuit development. Moreover, the Agency has reduced the funding dedicated to spacesuit development in favor of other priorities such as an in-space habitat," it states. A decade ago, NASA began developing a rocket and spacecraft to return humans to the Moon as part of the Constellation Program. Back in 2009, NASA awarded a $148 million contract to Oceaneering International, Inc. to develop and produce a spacesuit for astronauts for operations in deep space and on the lunar surface. However, President Obama canceled the Constellation program just a year later, in early 2010. Later that year, senior officials at the Johnson Space Center recommended canceling the Constellation spacesuit contract because the agency had its own engineers working on a new spacesuit and because NASA apparently no longer had a clear need for deep-space spacesuits. However, the Houston officials were overruled by agency leaders at NASA's headquarters in Washington, DC. The recently released report provides its comments on the issue. "After examining these spacesuit development efforts, we question NASA’s decision to continue funding a contract associated with the Constellation Program after cancellation of that Program and a recommendation made by Johnson Space Center officials in 2011 to cancel the contract." It says. Rather than terminate the contract, it says, NASA paid the contractor $80.8 million between 2011 and 2016 for spacesuit technology development, despite parallel development activities being conducted within NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems Division. © NASA. Boeing Unveils Designer Spacesuits for Shuttle to International Space Station"Moreover, given the current development WHY WE PERFORMED THIS AUDIT WHAT WE FOUND schedule, a significant risk exists that a next-generation spacesuit prototype will not be sufficiently mature in time to test it on the ISS prior to 2024," it suggests. Finally, it states, little schedule margin exists between anticipated delivery of the Orion Crew Survival System spacesuit in March 2021 and NASA’s current internal launch date of August 2021 for its first crewed mission. The report therefore recommended the Associate Administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate to urgently develop and implement a formal plan for design, production, and testing of the next-generation spacesuits; compare the cost of maintaining the current EMU spacesuit and developing and testing a next-generation spacesuit and apply lessons learned from operations of existing EVA to the design of future spacesuit systems. At a pinch, NASA could do worse than turning to AliExpress, where a brand new space suit can be had for as little as $188, and even better, shipping is free! ...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman NASA Invites Media to Visit Two Midwest Companies Helping Build Agency’s Deep Space Spacecraft, Rocket HOUSTON, April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Media are invited to hear about progress on crewed flight hardware for NASA's Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) at two contractor facilities May 1 and 2 in Rockford, Illinois. Media will also be able to interview NASA, Lockheed Martin, Ingersoll Machine Tools and UTC Aerospace Systems program officials. Participants will include: William Hill, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Exploration Systems Development in Washington Rex Walheim, astronaut, NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston Mark Kirasich, Orion program manager, NASA Johnson Larry Price, deputy Orion program manager, Lockheed Martin Tino Oldani, president, Ingersoll Machine Tools David Imbrogno, general manager, UTC Aerospace Systems U.S. media interested in participating must contact Laura Rochon at laura.a.rochon@nasa.gov or 281-483-0229 by 12 noon EDT on Friday, April 28. International media accreditation for this event is closed. Orion and SLS are two of the foundational elements of NASA's new exploration systems that will send humans on a series of missions beyond the moon. NASA's deep-space exploration programs are supported by thousands of large and small businesses in 48 states and Puerto Rico, including more than 200 companies across the Great Lakes region. The first integrated flight test of Orion and SLS will launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a three-week uncrewed mission beyond the moon and back. A second mission will follow with the system's first crewed mission, which will take humans farther in space than we have ever traveled before. Ingersoll Machine Tools, a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin, is currently manufacturing four of the seven major parts of the Orion spacecraft structure for the first flight with crew. Several components of the spacecraft will ship from Illinois to NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans this summer for welding and assembly. UTC Aerospace Systems is a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin and supplies several power management, environmental controls and life support systems for the Orion spacecraft. For the SLS Program, the company builds auxiliary power units and hydraulic systems for Boeing and Orbital ATK, and supports SLS work for Aerojet Rocketdyne in Rosemount, Illinois.

American said that the move, which overshadowed the carrier's solid quarterly earnings, will increase its salary and benefits expense by approximately $230 million for 2017 and $350 million for 2018 and 2019. Flight attendants and pilots at American ratified new five-year agreements in late 2014 and early 2015. Under the new proposal, announced on Wednesday, they will now receive on average 5 percent to 8 percent increases in hourly pay, respectively, in an adjustment to match rival carriers. In the years since American contract negotiations, labor groups at rival airlines United and Delta have negotiated compensation agreements, placing American at the low end of the pay spectrum. "As our industry has rapidly evolved and pay increases at other airlines have accelerated, some of our colleagues have fallen behind their peers at other airlines in base pay rates. And, unless their current contracts are modified, they´ll remain far behind for more than two years," Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker said in a statement on Wednesday. Analysts worried about the possible effects of the pay increase on American and the implications it could have for the broader industry. "We are troubled by AAL´s wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups. In addition to raising fixed costs, American´s agreement with its labor stakeholders establishes a worrying precedent, in our view, both for American and the industry," JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. American posted earnings of 61 cents per share for the quarter ended March 31 on Thursday, versus analysts' consensus forecast of 57 cents per share, excluding special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline reported first-quarter revenue of $9.6 billion, matching analyst predictions, and a net profit of $308 million. Passenger unit revenue, which measures sales relative to flight capacity, rose 2.4 percent year over year. The company also said on Thursday it had deferred the delivery of several wide-body Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. That decision came two weeks after Delta Air Lines Inc said it was reviewing pending wide-body jet orders to address excess capacity, noting that reductions were likely over the next several years. American said in its earnings filing that it was pushing back the first delivery of its Airbus A350 XWBs from 2018 to 2020 and deferring the delivery of two Boeing 787-9 aircraft to the first quarter of 2019 from the second quarter of 2018 to "provide widebody capacity flexibility" in its fleet.

The tech-heavy index is likely to extend its record-breaking string of gains as heavyweights Amazon and Alphabet jumped more than 4 percent each after the bell, following stellar earnings. Earnings were back in the spotlight, a day after the Trump administration unveiled its tax reform priorities without details on how the reform would be paid for, raising questions on whether deficit hawks in Congress would support it. Comcast (CMCSA.O) rose 2.1 percent to $39.59 after touching a record high of $40.62 as strong subscriber growth brought a forecast-beating profit. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "Most folks were expecting a build in earnings acceleration and that’s what we’ve got. Despite all the economic and geopolitical noise, ultimately the market has been responding to improving earnings," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. He said a premium has been built into stock prices on bets of tax reform and other policies expected from the Trump administration, so "when that is in question you see a sideways action." U.S. businesses would mostly benefit if President Donald Trump's plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas becomes law. But the economic benefits and the timing of a possible bill remain in question. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 6.24 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,981.33, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.32 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,388.77 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 23.71 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,048.94. In after-hours trading, Amazon (AMZN.O) added 4.1 percent to $955.92 while Google's parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) jumped 4.5 percent to $931.91 as both continue to race to $1,000. Alphabet jumped as Google's ad revenue rose 18.8 percent to $21.41 billion in the first quarter, while Amazon reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates. In regular market hours, Intuit (INTU.O) rose 8.5 percent to $125.61 after it reported consumer tax-season results and reiterated its quarter and full-year forecast. PayPal (PYPL.O) shares hit a record high a day after it raised its earnings outlook and reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Sportswear maker Under Armour (UAA.N) shares jumped 9.9 percent to $21.67 after it posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Energy .SPNY was the biggest decliner among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, falling 1.1 percent on the back of a 0.8 percent decline in U.S. crude futures CLc1. American Airlines (AAL.O) dropped 5.2 percent to $43.98. The company said it had offered a mid-contract pay increase for pilots and flight attendants that JPMorgan analysts called "a wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labour groups." Indexes ticked up but declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1.03-to-1 while on Nasdaq a 1.15-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 76 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 180 new highs and 45 new lows. About 7.18 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The one-page plan, unveiled on Wednesday, proposed deep tax cuts for many businesses, but offered no detail on how it would be paid for without increasing the deficit. U.S. stocks snapped a two-day rally to end lower on Wednesday after the plan was unveiled. The prospects of hefty tax cuts have been a major driver of the post-election rally since November. "Yesterday, you saw some selling but it didn't develop into an outright heavy pressure day," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.43 points, or 0.05 percent, at 20,986.52, the S&P 500 was up 0.14 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,387.59 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.55 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,031.78. Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, lead by a 0.35 percent gain in the technology index. PayPal jumped to an all-time high of $47.50 after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast. However, a more than 2 percent drop in oil prices weighed on the energy sector, which fell 0.8 percent. Investors are keeping a close watch on the first-quarter earnings season to gauge fundamental performance in the face of lofty valuations. Of the 181 S&P 500 companies that have released results so far, nearly 77 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations. In a typical quarter, about 64 percent of the companies top earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comcast was the top stock on the S&P, with a 3 percent increase after the company's profit beat analysts' estimates on strong subscriber growth. Under Armour jumped 7.7 percent after the sportswear maker posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Bristol-Myers was up 2.4 percent after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and a jump in revenue. American Airlines tumbled 8.1 percent after the company said it had deferred the delivery of several Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. The news dragged down shares of other U.S. carriers, including Delta and United Continental. Microsoft, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet are scheduled to report results after the bell. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,274 to 1,236. On the Nasdaq, 1,207 issues rose and 1,009 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 39 52-week highs and no lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 72 highs and 11 lows.

Sonia Legg reports ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Many airlines were keen to buy the A320neo - it's lower fuel costs and quieter engines a big attraction. But production of Airbus's new jet has been on a go slow - and it seems it's not entirely the European plane maker's fault. Finance Director Harald Wilhelm blamed delays at engine maker Pratt and Whitney for hampering deliveries. That led to weaker than expected first-quarter results. Core profit at Airbus more than halved to 240 million euros. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CRAIG ERLAM, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYST, OANDA, SAYING: "A drop in the profits in the first quarter is a bit of a shock, people were expecting a sizeable drop but not quite to the extent that we saw, especially given the fact that the revenue numbers actually beat expectations." Price cutting of older models didn't help. And Wilhelm also warned about "significant" exposure on its A400m army plane. But Airbus remains confident it can increase jet output despite wobbling demand. and news of a 19 percent rise in first quarter profit at rival Boeing. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CRAIG ERLAM, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYST, OANDA, SAYING: "I think it is important to note that they expect full-year profits to remain in line with their initial guidance so while we have seen this early setback they are still optimistic that the performance in the following three quarters is going to offset the disappointment in the first." But Airbus's boss has a lot on his plate. Austria has launched a fraud investigation into Tom Enders over a 2003 fighter jet deal. Airbus calls the accusations "completely unsubstantiated". But it's another distraction. Last year European government export funding was suspended amid a probe into suspected corruption in jetliner sales.

Sonia Legg reports Video Transcript Many airlines were keen to buy the A320neo - it's lower fuel costs and quieter engines a big attraction. But production of Airbus's new jet has been on a go slow - and it seems it's not entirely the European plane maker's fault. Finance Director Harald Wilhelm blamed delays at engine maker Pratt and Whitney for hampering deliveries. That led to weaker than expected first-quarter results. Core profit at Airbus more than halved to 240 million euros. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CRAIG ERLAM, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYST, OANDA, SAYING: "A drop in the profits in the first quarter is a bit of a shock, people were expecting a sizeable drop but not quite to the extent that we saw, especially given the fact that the revenue numbers actually beat expectations." Price cutting of older models didn't help. And Wilhelm also warned about "significant" exposure on its A400m army plane. But Airbus remains confident it can increase jet output despite wobbling demand. and news of a 19 percent rise in first quarter profit at rival Boeing. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CRAIG ERLAM, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYST, OANDA, SAYING: "I think it is important to note that they expect full-year profits to remain in line with their initial guidance so while we have seen this early setback they are still optimistic that the performance in the following three quarters is going to offset the disappointment in the first." But Airbus's boss has a lot on his plate. Austria has launched a fraud investigation into Tom Enders over a 2003 fighter jet deal. Airbus calls the accusations "completely unsubstantiated". But it's another distraction. Last year European government export funding was suspended amid a probe into suspected corruption in jetliner sales. more from global   Multimedia gallery Fields Covered With Snow gallery Girls' Day career event at the Chancellery gallery USS Carl Vinson on patrol gallery Palestinian hunger strike protest grows VIDEO Airbus plane maker profit dips on engine delays, price squeeze AUDIO Bahrain plans to give stiff competition to Dubai tourism Advertisement Most Popular Videos Airbus plane maker profit dips on engine delays 19 hours ago - Reuters Videos Field of fake Trumps battle it out in LA 1 day ago - Reuters Videos Baby born with four legs returns home after surgery 1 day ago - Reuters Videos Advertisement About zawya Contact us Copyright © 2017 Zawya.

The answer is the same today as it was when I launched my first company five decades ago: to make a positive difference in people’s lives. I believe that companies should have a similar desire at their core, no matter what industry they’re in. Our team at Virgin has always kept this in mind whenever we’ve entered a new sector. Take the airline industry. We built three beloved airlines—Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Australia and Virgin America—based on the belief that passengers deserved better. We feel that when people choose an airline, they deserve courtesy and care. They also deserve respect and an amazing experience. They certainly do not deserve to be treated like numbers on a balance sheet, or like cattle in a cabin. Sadly, not every business shares this viewpoint. (I’m sure you can think of one or two you’ve recently read about without me having to name them). Companies like these tend to put profit before people and they will ultimately be found out. Every company and business leader makes mistakes. I’ve made more than my fair share, and I know I’ll make more. The good news is that if you face them head on, move fast and have a strong company culture in place, you can recover from any setback. Maintaining a strong company culture begins with putting people first, and that requires heartfelt service. Allowing your team the freedom to be themselves is key to achieving that. When things go wrong, having too many processes and procedures in place can hinder staff when they need to make judgment calls based on their own experience, their humanity and the company culture. On our team, we strive to give employees enough latitude to make decisions that are based on common sense, not outdated rulebooks. We believe in giving our staff the right tools to do their job, then trusting them to do the right thing. Whether it’s dealing with an overbooked flight, a missed train or an issue with a phone bill, empower your front-line team to deal in the moment. Acting fast can cost you some money, but a delay or a rigid response will probably cost you a great deal more in lost good will. And in this age of social media, a customer issue can spread like wildfire across the internet, and cause lasting damage. Giving your team flexibility and responsibility is part of the solution, but it’s also important to ensure that workers feel like they’re part of a bigger mission than just making money: They will treat customers better, and those customers will prove to be more loyal and come back over and over again. In the end, this will reflect positively on your profits, too. I recently spent some time taking a whirlwind trip to visit Virgin businesses around the world, which gave me plenty of time on planes to reflect on these thoughts. It was particularly poignant to close a globetrotting week in Seattle, as that’s the home of Boeing, the company that gave me a break 33 years ago by renting a second-hand 747 airliner to a young upstart record producer so that we could launch Virgin Atlantic. Most people wrote us off at the time and insisted we had no chance of surviving. However, building our airline around customer experiences and having an empowered team meant that we focused on the right things from the beginning. It helped us create a service culture that attracted loyal passengers and allowed us to adapt. We brought in more comfortable seats, stand-up bars, seat-back entertainment systems, but none of these features would have had an impact if we had not given our staff the freedom to be themselves. More than 33 years later, Virgin Atlantic still exudes the same confidence and sense of fun that started it all. It’s a testimony to the leadership and company culture, which was embedded from the start. If your business is not built on people and purpose, you will only ever be papering over the cracks. But if your business believes in supporting and growing your people, they will thrive; and customers will come back over and over again.   (Richard Branson is the founder of the Virgin Group and companies such as Virgin Atlantic, Virgin America, Virgin Mobile and Virgin Active.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — New orders for U.S. durable goods rose 0.7% in March to mark the third straight gain, though demand was inflated by new bookings for fighter planes and passenger aircraft. The increase in new orders, a weathervane of sorts for the U.S. economy, was below Wall Street’s forecast. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a 1.4% advance. Yet the government also raised the increase in orders in February’s report to 2.3% from 1.8%, a revision that makes the gain in March look better. More importantly, a key measure of business investment advanced for the sixth month in a row. So-called core orders rose 0.2% in March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, and they are up 3% in the past year. Businesses have been slowly increasing investment since last fall after a two-year slump, a good sign for the U.S. economy. Also reported: U.S. trade deficit widens in March And: Jobless claims jump to one-month high of 257,000 Stronger profits and rising customer demand have helped, but companies are also optimistic that a pro-business Trump administration will make the climate for investment even more attractive. The White House on Wednesday, for example, rolled out a plan to slash corporate taxes to their lowest rate in decades. Although the plan faces high hurdles in its current configuration, analysts think some kind of tax cut will pass. In March, orders for commercial aircraft increased 0.7%, while booking for military planes jumped 26%. Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing have been growing rapidly for years. Automakers on the other hand appear to have stalled after an explosion in sales that had so far lasted through most of the eight-year-old economic recovery. Orders fell for the second month in a row, reflecting a slower pace of sales at dealerships. If the large transportation industry is set aside, orders for durable goods fell 0.2% in March. That’s the first decline in five months. Bookings for machinery, computers and telecommunications-networking equipment all declined. Orders for primary metals and electrical equipment rose. Shipments of core capital goods, meanwhile, climbed 0.4% in March following a strong 1.1% gain in February. Shipments are fed into the government’s formula for calculating gross domestic product, the official scorecard of the economy. Business spending is likely to add to GDP in the first quarter. The government will issue its first take on first-quarter GDP on Friday. All numbers are seasonally adjusted. More from MarketWatch Randomly selected?

Story Continued Below “House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry said a partial supplemental could force lawmakers to ‘make up some of the lost ground’ in the forthcoming fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act and defense appropriations bill. "’My understanding is negotiations are still going on, so there is no final number or final answer until everything is locked down,’ the Texas Republican told reporters Wednesday. ‘My guess is that the supplemental will end up being less than the president asked for.’" — AND WHITE HOUSE DROPS OBAMACARE SHUTDOWN THREAT, POLITICO’s Burgess Everett, Heather Caygle and Josh Dawsey report: “The White House is telling lawmakers that it will continue paying Affordable Care Act cost-sharing subsidies, potentially defusing a bruising conflict between Democrats and Trump administration officials that had sparked a new round of shutdown fears in Washington Wednesday. “House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) confirmed the news Wednesday afternoon after word started spreading around the Capitol. It was not immediately clear how long the White House planned to keep the money flowing… Still, appropriators plan another a one-week stopgap spending bill to give Congress until May 5 to reach a final deal, POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris reports. SENATORS ALARMED BY WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ON NORTH KOREA, write POLITICO’s Burgess and Matthew Nussbaum: “Senators were alarmed by a Trump administration presentation Wednesday at the White House complex about the dangers of North Korea, though lawmakers in both parties said it was unclear what the president’s next action against the combative nation will be. “Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who led the session, did not divulge whether the United States is considering military options against North Korea after recent weapons tests and military activities were conducted by the regime of Kim Jong Un. And senators said officials did not discuss putting North Korea back on the list of nations that sponsor terrorism, as some lawmakers want.” And China welcomes an apparently softer U.S. tone on the North Korean crisis, but stresses its opposition to a U.S. missile defense system being deployed in South Korea, Reuters adds. PACOM CHIEF: VINSON CARRIER GROUP READY TO DEFEND AGAINST NORTH KOREA, via our colleague Connor O’Brien: “The USS Carl Vinson Aircraft Carrier Strike Group can defend itself against an attack from North Korea, U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris told Congress today. “The North Korean regime has threatened to sink the Vinson, which is conducting training exercises with Japanese forces in the Pacific. But testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Harris downplayed North Korean's capabilities, assuring the committee the strike group can ably defend itself…” "’The weapons that North Korea would put against the Carl Vinson Strike Group are easily defended by the capabilities resident in that strike group,’ Harris explained. ‘If it flies, it will die, if it's flying against the Carl Vinson strike group.’" Harris also took “the hit” for the mix-up over the whereabouts of the Vinson amid the escalating tensions with North Korea, Connor reports. — BUT THE ASIA-PACIFIC NEEDS MORE SUBS, the admiral adds via Connor: “Harris told Congress today the Navy can only supply him with half the submarines he needs in the region. “The shortage, he told the House Armed Services Committee, will become more apparent if the attack submarine fleet shrinks over the next decade as the Navy's most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan forecasts — a move he described as ‘completely in the wrong direction.’ "’From a joint combatant commander perspective, I need more submarines,’ Harris said.” And the Navy Reserve can’t meet more than two-thirds of its global support requests due to insufficient funding, your Morning D correspondent writes.

Catch the livestream here. ARMY PICK MARK GREEN TORCHES ‘LIBERAL LEFT,’ writes POLITICO’s Nolan D. McCaskill: “President Donald Trump’s Army secretary nominee is accusing the ‘liberal left’ of mischaracterizing and ‘blatantly falsifying’ his comments on terrorism, the Islamic State and the LGBT community. “‘The liberal left has cut and spliced my words about terrorism and ISIS blatantly falsifying what I've said,’ Dr. Mark Green, a Tennessee state senator, wrote in a Facebook post early Tuesday. “The post included a link to a Christian Fighter Pilot report. The site brands itself as a venue for Christians in the military, and the article accuses LGBT advocates of targeting Green over his religion.” HOPES DIM FOR A TRUMP MILITARY BUILDUP, writes our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: “Defense hawks are starting to lose hope in President Donald Trump’s promises of a ‘historic’ military buildup. “Trump vowed during the campaign to make the military so big and powerful that “nobody — absolutely nobody — is going to mess with us,” and since his inauguration he has rattled sabers at North Korea, launched an airstrike on Syria and dropped an enormous bomb on Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan. “But nearly 100 days into his presidency, Republican legislative stumbles have fueled doubts that Congress will approve the $84 billion defense boost he has proposed for this fiscal year and next — a jump that many advocates have already slammed as too small.” ** A message from Huntington Ingalls Industries: As the largest military shipbuilder in America, Huntington Ingalls Industries provides our nation with six classes of military ships.

Learn more at HuntingtonIngalls.com ** WAR REPORT — TRUMP GIVES THE PENTAGON POWER TO SET TROOP LIMITS, reports Reuters: “President Donald Trump has given the military the authority to reset a confusing system of troop limits in Iraq and Syria that critics said allowed the White House to micro-manage battlefield decisions and ultimately obscured the real number of U.S. forces. “The Pentagon, which confirmed the move on Wednesday, said no change has yet been made to U.S. troop limits. It also stressed the U.S. strategy in Iraq and Syria still was focused on backing local forces to fight Islamic State - a tactic that has averted the need for a major U.S. ground force. “But the shift on troop limits was another sign of the greater authority Trump appears comfortable giving his military commanders to make battlefield decisions and could allow for more rapid increases in troop levels in the future.” — U.S. SAYS TURKISH STRIKES PUT AMERICANS AT RISK, via The Associated Press: “The U.S. military says Turkey gave coalition forces less than an hour's notice before striking Kurdish troops in Syria this week. “The United States says Turkey's attacks potentially put Americans at risk. “Air Force Col. John Dorrian says Turkey's warning to the coalition's air operations center described a large area and wasn't specific enough about timing and location to ensure the safety of American forces.” And Turkey launches more strikes against Kurdish militants in Iraq, Reuters reports. — FRANCE TRACES SARIN-ATTACK SAMPLES TO ASSAD, reports The Washington Post: “Samples from a deadly sarin attack in Syria bear “the signature” of President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons program and point to its use in other massacres, French officials said Wednesday. “The announcement marks the strongest evidence yet that Assad’s government was responsible for the daybreak attack on the northwestern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun earlier this month. At least 86 people were killed, many of them as they slept.” — HOGS OF WAR THWART ISIS AMBUSH IN IRAQ, writes the Military Times: “A herd of wild boar mauled three Islamic State militants to death and injured five others in Iraq while the extremists were setting up an ambush, locals claimed. “The men were said to have taken cover in a bed of reeds near fields in the Hamrin mountains, about 55 miles southwest of Kirkuk. They were planning an attack on tribesmen who had formed anti-Isis brigades and had fled to the mountains when the jihadists seized the nearby town of Hawija in mid-2014.” NAVY FIRES A WARNING AT IRAN IN THE GULF, via the AP: “A U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer fired a warning flare toward an Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessel coming near it in the Persian Gulf, an American official said on Wednesday, the latest tense naval encounter between the two countries. “The incident happened Monday as the vessel attempted to draw closer to the USS Mahan despite the destroyer trying to turn away from it, said Lt. Ian McConnaughey, a spokesman for the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet.” ARMY TO MOVE A ARTILLERY BRIGADE TO POLAND, reports Stars and Stripes: “The U.S. Army in Europe is moving ahead with a plan to place another brigade’s worth of combat-ready armor and artillery inside Poland in an effort to push firepower closer to potential hot spots along NATO’s eastern flank… “Details of the plan were revealed after a large delegation of USAREUR and allied leaders began a four-day tour Tuesday of strategic sites in Europe. They are looking for ways to ensure that forces can more quickly assemble in the event of a conflict or crisis with Russia.” INDUSTRY INTEL — GENERAL DYNAMICS EARNINGS RISE 17 PERCENT, reports Jacqueline: “General Dynamics saw a nearly-17 percent increase in earnings from continuing operations over the first quarter of the year, the company reported today. “Earnings from continuing operations rose to $763 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $654 million over the same time period last year, up 16.7 percent. First-quarter revenue, though, dipped slightly, from $7.48 billion to $7.44 billion.” — NORTHROP REPORTS A ‘STRONG’ FIRST QUARTER, Jacqueline writes: “Northrop Grumman’s net sales and earnings increased in the first quarter of the year, the company reported today. “Net sales increased 5 percent, from $6 billion in the first quarter of 2016 to $6.3 billion in the same period this year. Net earnings increased 15 percent, from $556 million to $640 million.” — BUT BOEING SEES A DROP IN ITS DEFENSE PORTFOLIO, Jacqueline adds: “Boeing today reported double-digit earnings growth in the first quarter of the year, but saw a decrease in its defense portfolio, especially military aircraft. “Overall, the company increased earnings from operations 13 percent, from $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2016 to $2 billion in the same period this year. Boeing saw a 7 percent decrease in revenue, which it attributed to the “timing” of commercial and defense aircraft deliveries.” — ‘BUY AMERICAN’ COULD HURT DoD, Jacqueline writes: “Former Pentagon officials told Congress today that a strict provision to buy American-made goods could negatively impact the DoD’s acquisition process…” “Peter Levine, the former deputy chief management officer at the DoD, said that the acquisition community ‘always has a bias’ to get the best technology into warfighters' hands at the lowest possible cost, even if that means buying from a foreign manufacturer.” MAKING MOVES — FANNING JOINS MCKINSEY: Former Army Secretary Eric Fanning has joined the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company as a senior adviser.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — New orders for U.S. durable goods rose 0.7% in March to mark the third straight gain, though demand was inflated by new bookings for fighter planes and passenger aircraft. The increase in new orders, a weathervane of sorts for the U.S. economy, was below Wall Street’s forecast. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a 1.4% advance. Yet the government also raised the increase in orders in February’s report to 2.3% from 1.8%, a revision that makes the gain in March look better. More importantly, a key measure of business investment advanced for the sixth month in a row. So-called core orders rose 0.2% in March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, and they are up 3% in the past year. Businesses have been slowly increasing investment since last fall after a two-year slump, a good sign for the U.S. economy. Also reported: U.S. trade deficit widens in March And: Jobless claims jump to one-month high of 257,000 Stronger profits and rising customer demand have helped, but companies are also optimistic that a pro-business Trump administration will make the climate for investment even more attractive. The White House on Wednesday, for example, rolled out a plan to slash corporate taxes to their lowest rate in decades. Although the plan faces high hurdles in its current configuration, analysts think some kind of tax cut will pass. In March, orders for commercial aircraft increased 0.7%, while booking for military planes jumped 26%. Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing have been growing rapidly for years. Automakers on the other hand appear to have stalled after an explosion in sales that had so far lasted through most of the eight-year-old economic recovery. Orders fell for the second month in a row, reflecting a slower pace of sales at dealerships. If the large transportation industry is set aside, orders for durable goods fell 0.2% in March. That’s the first decline in five months. Bookings for machinery, computers and telecommunications-networking equipment all declined. Orders for primary metals and electrical equipment rose. Shipments of core capital goods, meanwhile, climbed 0.4% in March following a strong 1.1% gain in February. Shipments are fed into the government’s formula for calculating gross domestic product, the official scorecard of the economy. Business spending is likely to add to GDP in the first quarter. The government will issue its first take on first-quarter GDP on Friday. All numbers are seasonally adjusted. More from MarketWatch Randomly selected?

Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile The US Air Force (USAF) has successfully test-fired an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) equipped with a single test re-entry vehicle. The launch was conducted from the Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB), California, by a combined team of Air Force Global Strike Command airmen. The team comprised 90th Missile Wing (MW) at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, 341st MW at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, and 625th Strategic Operations Squadron at Offutt AFB, Nebraska. 341st MW task force commander lieutenant colonel Tony Rhoades said: “This mission requires a tremendous amount of discipline, training, and attention to detail. Our airmen demonstrated this with true professionalism and proved that the Minuteman III remains the nation's premier deterrence and assurance capability.” The testing was conducted to validate the accuracy and reliability of the Minuteman III ICBM weapon system. "Our airmen demonstrated this with true professionalism and proved that the Minuteman III remains the nation's premier deterrence and assurance capability." Consisting of a telemetry package used for operational testing, the re-entry vehicle travelled approximately 4,200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The Boeing-built Minuteman III is a ground-based strategic deterrent designed to replace the USAF's LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBM weapon system. Expected to enter service in 2027, the missile will remain in service until 2075. The Minuteman III forms a part of the nuclear triad, which also includes strategic bombers such as the B-52 Stratofortress and B-2 Spirit, as well as submarine-launched ballistic missions provided by Navy submarines. Prior to the latest test, the USAF conducted the test launch of the missile in February. The data collected from test launches will be used by the ICBM community, including the US Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and US Strategic Command, for continuing force development evaluation.

Shares fell 4.3% to $54.50 premarket as the nation's largest discount air carrier missed analysts' expectations for profit and sales. Operating expenses increased 8.8% during the first quarter while revenue edged up 1.2%. The Dallas-based company expects costs to rise about 6% in the current quarter. Chief Executive Gary Kelly said cost inflation should ease significantly in the back half of the year. Labor costs at the airline are rising after Southwest signed new contracts with its pilots and flight attendants last year. Additionally, the company is contending with accelerated depreciation on a flock of older Boeing Co. 737s it intends to retire this fall. Higher fuel prices and strong demand for lower fares have pressured airlines industrywide. Southwest also recorded a quarterly fuel-hedge loss of $106 million. In all for the first quarter, Southwest reported a profit of $351 million, or 57 cents per share, down from $513 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, the airline earned 61 cents per share, down from 88 cents per share last year. Revenue rose 1.2% to $4.88 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings of 63 cents per share on $4.92 billion in revenue.

Stories are considered to have a stronger impact on the end-users rather than companies. However, aren't those also people representing different brands that you target? At the end of the day, whether you run a B2B or B2C campaign, you are selling to people, and people like stories. Business owners need to see data that would provide them with a clear statement of the reasons of why they should deal with a particular company. They want to see posts with useful information. However, they are also people who don't always need a narrative to understand that a specific piece of content is valuable. This is when stories come into play. A good story can capture a user's attention, hold him on the page, and evoke a desire to learn where the story goes. That is why, different brands from all over the world have started using video content-storytelling in both B2C and B2B marketing campaigns to humanize their projects, make their data relate to the readers, and reveal in what ways their offerings can transform other businesses. So, is video content-storytelling THAT useful for your business? Let's try to find an answer to this question while considering several cases for using storytelling in B2B marketing. Learn from the Trendsetters To check how stories work in online marketing, customer service software company Groove once ran a case study on how the same text delivered to their clients through a narrative and a story influenced the way people reacted to it. What they did first was a publication of an article "How We Got 1,000+ Subscribers from a Single Blog Post in 24 Hours". Next, they emailed two versions of this text to their subscribers. In the first version, the text was wrapped up into a story, where users were taken to the primary objective. As per the second version, the text was written straight to the point. As a result, the first version showed a greater public engagement into the post. 300% more readers moved from the beginning up till the end of the text, spending an average of 5 minutes longer to read the copy, compared to the straightforward version. The web saw many companies communicating their services to the audience through stories. Here are a few of the most remarkable ones. Norton, the world leader in digital security, released a 20-minute documentary video about a small and picturesque Romanian town Râmnicu Vâlcea, which better known as the hacker capital of the world. The video features stories of scammers who hacked Google, Facebook, accounts of the members of the president family, the U.S. Army, NASA, etc. While telling stories of real people who were imprisoned for hacking companies and organizations of all sizes, Norton transports the audience into the world of cyber crimes, communicating how fragile is the web space and how important it is to take care of your virtual security. Salesforce is another world-known company making use of videos to deliver stories to their consumers. Instead of adding a regular section with user testimonials to the homepage of their site, they devote a separate page for every client who shares feedback about their services. Most importantly, people tell their success stories via videos, which are known as better attention-grabbers and stronger influencers. Just take a look at Aston Martin story of using Salesforce to add a personal touch to their business. Boeing replaced press releases with news stories on their Features pages. With the help of stories, the company tells the history of their establishment, the way they operate right now, as well as their plans for future. For example, in the Space Features block, there is a story under the title "The Flight Before the Launch." The written story about the preparation before the launch of WGS-9 and its shipment from the LA to FL is accompanied by a brief explanatory video, which makes it easier for non-tech-savvy users to understand what the whole story is about, and where it goes. Why is video content-storytelling so effective? As noted earlier, people love being entertained by visual content. That's why more and more often marketers use video ads to promote their offerings and get the audience more engaged. In their press kit, the giant video streaming platform - YouTube - states they receive over a billion of users watching video content of various kinds on a daily basis. What's more, YouTube videos are being reached by the 18-49 target age range, which most of the online marketers hunt for. Taking into account the extraordinary popularity of YouTube videos among millions of users, both world-known brands and mom-and-pop companies have started investing into YouTube advertisements, as well as launch their channels featuring tutorials bringing value to the customers, reviews, entertaining stuff, and merely highlights the memorable company events. TemplateMonster also doesn't lag behind the trends and updates the YouTube channel with valuable pieces of video content every now and again. Simply put, the reasons why videos are indispensable for the success of your online marketing campaign are the following: people enjoy video content more than print; videos visualize the marketing intent; a video leaves no room for misinterpretation; a video shows a product in action, revealing in what ways it can benefit their lives; videos let customers feel like they are participating in the active relationship with the brands they enjoy; a video breaks down corporate walls, referring to consumers like friends. Final thoughts Even if you run a small company and you do not have the budget for an Oscar-winning movie, record short video clips revealing your company story, introduce people to your employees and loyal fans. Get inspired by the way trendsetters use visual stories in their B2B marketing campaigns and consider in what ways you can do the same.

The new accords targeted by China will be more reciprocal than existing ones and see the two foreign authorities granting greater recognition to Chinese certifications, Wang Jingling, deputy director general of plane airworthiness at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said at a conference in Shanghai Thursday. “Once included, aircraft already certified by the CAAC will face less scrutiny from authorities in the U.S. and EU in getting their certification,” Wang said. “That will make it easier for China’s homegrown planes to sell in these developed markets.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up State-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. is set in May to conduct the maiden flight of the nation’s first domestically produced large jet, C919, Wang said. The aircraft, whose first flight has been delayed more than a year, is a result of China’s ambitious goal to become an advanced manufacturing powerhouse and break into the passenger-jet market dominated by Airbus SE and Boeing Co. -- estimated to surpass $1 trillion in the nation within two decades. The nation is seeking to gain the European Aviation Safety Agency’s approval for the C919 as part of negotiations under a China-E.U. air-safety agreement. EASA has been in the process of certifying the C919 since December, and officials have met twice with the CAAC and Comac, Wang said. Regional Aircraft The single-aisle C919 isn’t China’s first passenger jet. Comac previously developed a smaller regional jet, ARJ21, which competes with aircraft from Bombardier Inc. and Embraer SA. Wang said the CAAC is also in talks with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to approve the ARJ121, and FAA officials have shadowed the Chinese regulator’s processes to certify the aircraft. The ARJ21 was about a decade behind schedule, and took six years to go from first flight to commercial operation. “The ARJ21 has provided a lesson for the C919,” Comac President He Dongfeng told Bloomberg News at the conference. The C919 will “definitely” go to the market faster, he said. — With assistance by Dong Lyu Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15% from 35%, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T (t) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15% is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple (aapl) did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January in response to an analyst's question about the company's thinking on acquisitions. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors (gm), for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20% returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A Mixed Bag The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35% tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06% for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing (ba) on Wednesday reported a 19% increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

China Southern Airlines has announced it is ordering 20 Airbus A350-900 aircraft. Rolls-Royce, which has its civil aerospace division in Sinfin, is the exclusive engine supplier for that particular aircraft, which means the airline will be placing an order with the firm. The A350 is powered by the Trent XWB - an engine that has been designed and developed in Derby. The engine is also manufactured in the city. It has been billed as the world's most efficient large aero engine by Rolls-Royce. IN OTHER NEWS: New shops and eateries set for popular A50 services near Toyota More than 40 customers have ordered over 1,600 engines - making it the fastest-selling wide body jet engine ever. Dominic Horwood, Rolls-Royce's director of customers and services for the firm's civil aerospace division, said: "We're delighted to be building on a long and successful relationship with China Southern. "Our Trent XWB engine delivers excellent efficiency and lower emissions which will complement their expanding fleet." This is China Southern Airlines' first selection of the Airbus A350-900. Its Rolls-Royce powered fleet includes Airbus A330s, Airbus A380s and Boeing 757s. In November, the airline announced an order for 10 Airbus A330 aircraft, which are to be powered by Trent 700 engines in a deal worth £570 million. The order also included a TotalCare long-term engine service support package. It is turning out to be a good week for Rolls-Royce after it announced another engine deal on Tuesday. That £234 million contract will see it supply Trent 700 engines to power three new Airbus A330 aircraft ordered by Lion Group. Lion Group is an Indonesian company, which is made up of airlines Lion Air, Wings, Batik Air, Malindo Air, Thai Lion Air and Lion Bizjet. LOOKING FOR A JOB?

Leadership Search Search PoliticsAlex Acosta Confirmed by U.S. Senate as Trump’s New Labor Secretary aviationBoeing Is Asking the Commerce Department to Investigate Bombardier for Dumping Jets TradeTrump Says South Korea Should Pay for $1 Billion Anti-Missile System FoxconnFoxconn’s Chairman Was Just at the White House, But He Won’t Say If He Met with Trump Bound aluminum ingots sit in a warehouse ahead of shipping in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, on March 2, 2017. Andrey Rudakov—Bloomberg/Getty Images National Security Trump Just Launched a Probe Into Whether Aluminum Imports Threatened National Security Reuters Apr 27, 2017 The U.S. Commerce Department launched an investigation on Wednesday to determine whether a flood of aluminum imports from China and elsewhere was compromising U.S. national security, a step that could lead to broad import restrictions on the metal. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the investigation was similar to one announced last week for steel imports into the United States, invoking Section 232 of a national security law passed in 1962 at the height of the Cold War. Ross told reporters the probe was prompted by the extreme competitive pressures that unfairly traded imports were putting on the U.S. aluminum industry, causing several domestic smelters to close or halt production in recent years. China, the world's top producer and consumer of the metal, is seriously concerned by the probe and hopes to resolve the dispute through negotiations, a Commerce Ministry spokesman said at a regular briefing on Thursday. The U.S. move is the latest of several potential U.S. actions aimed at stemming a rising tide of aluminum imports. The Commerce Department is investigating allegations that Chinese companies are dumping aluminum foil into the U.S. market below cost and benefiting from unfair subsidies. Fore more about President Trump, watch Fortune's video: Ross said part of the justification for the investigation was that U.S. combat aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin (lmt) F-35 joint strike fighter and the Boeing (ba) F/A-18 Super Hornet require high-purity aluminum that is now produced by only one smelter, Century Aluminum (cenx). He said that company could probably meet U.S. peacetime needs, but not if the United States needed to ramp up defense production for a conflict. The same high-purity aluminum goes into armor plating for military vehicles and naval vessels, he said. "At the very same time that our military is needing more and more of the very high-quality aluminum, we're producing less and less of everything, and only have the one producer of aerospace- quality aluminum," Ross told a White House briefing. The investigation will determine if there is sufficient domestic aluminum capacity to meet U.S. defense needs and will also assess the effects of lost jobs, skills and investments on national security, Ross said. Although he said China was a major contributor to the global excess capacity in aluminum production, he said imports from other countries, including Russia, were also causing problems. "This is not a China-phobic program, this has to do with a global problem," Ross said. Last November, a dozen U.S. senators requested that a U.S. national security review panel reject the $2.3 billion acquisition of Cleveland-based aluminum products maker Aleris by China's Zhongwang International Group. Aleris spokesman Jason Saragian said the aluminum probe announced by the Commerce Department was unrelated to the ongoing review of the merger by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). "The pending acquisition is not affected by this broad inquiry, because the transaction does not involve any imports from China," Saragian said in an emailed statement.

Yet the proposal was short of vital details, including how it would be paid for - it was less than 200 words long and contained just seven numbers. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income-tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 per cent to 35 per cent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 per cent all the way to 15 per cent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 per cent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Trump plans to cut US corporate taxes to 15 per cent Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 per cent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. “This is about economic growth, job creation, America first, and that’s what [Trump] cares about,” White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said. “Our tax plan is a big leg of that stool. It’s a big leg. And in many respects, he thinks it’s the most important leg.” The plan now must navigate a legislative and political gantlet on Capitol Hill that has killed numerous other efforts to rework the tax code. “It’s a great plan,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. “It’s going to put people back to work.” The proposal also eliminates the estate tax - referred to by some opponents as the “death tax” - a levy on property including cash and real estate transferred from deceased individuals to their heirs. But with the tax plan limiting most deductions, it could expose more of an average American household’s income to taxes. It’s hard to say precisely who would benefit most because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 per cent, 25 per cent and 35 per cent. But Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” Yet Trump’s campaign proposals were skewed to the wealthiest Americans, and it’s likely that his new proposal, once fleshed out, could be as well. The theory is clear - by making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment, from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 per cent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 per cent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The obvious risk of the plan is that the government’s budget deficit could explode, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among the advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. “Simplifying the tax code as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale is certainly something that we support,” an executive at Boeing said on a conference call about the company’s earnings earlier Wednesday. Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit from the corporate rate cut because they are structured as pass-throughs, an ungainly moniker that derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 per cent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 per cent, those taxpayers would receive an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 per cent of pass-through income flows to the 10 per cent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities. The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the US and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. That’s led many businesses to keep hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the US and invest it in plants and equipment. Yet some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to simply pay dividends to shareholders. The obvious risk of the plan is that the government’s budget deficit could explode, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at US$5.5 trillion. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster economic growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered no details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would lower government revenue by US$2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 per cent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 of a percentage point annually.

Sergey Dubinsky, 54, a retired Russian colonel, confessed through a friend that he was responsible for moving a Buk surface-to-air missile system into place before it was used to shoot down the Malaysia Airlines plane in 2014. But Serhiy Tiunov, a pro-Ukrainian who took Dubinsky’s confession, says the colonel denies being personally responsible – instead blaming the ‘b******* from Moscow.’ Serhiy Tiunov (right) says his friend Sergey Dubinsky (left), a retired Russian colonel, has admitted to moving a missile launcher into position before it shot down MH17 But Tiunov (pictured) said Dubinsky denied pulling the trigger himself and instead blamed ‘the b******* in Moscow’ for the attack which killed 298 innocent people  Tiunov, a pro-Ukrainian military leader who fought with Dubinsky in Afghanistan, told Novaya Gazeta that he now fears his friend will be killed to keep the identities of those who launched the missile a secret. Everyone on board the plane, 298 passengers and crew, were killed after it was shot out of the sky. It is thought Russian-backed rebels fired at it after mistaking it for a Ukrainian military plane.r Ukrainian secret services confirmed shortly after the incident that they had intercepted audio from Russian military channels of a known Red Army commander ordering a missile system into position before the strike. Dubinsky aka Khmury (Grumpy) had already been unmasked as the man behind that voice, but Wednesday’s comments mark his first significant account of the incident. Tiunov (rear) says he believes Dubinsky (left) knows the identities of those who gave the order, and fears for his friend’s life At the time, he was head of military intelligence for the self-proclaimed and pro-Putin Donestsk People’s Republic. During the conflict in Ukraine, Dubinsky and Tiunov had met several times, and the colonel had freed a number of Ukrainian soldiers captured by the rebels. Tiunov said: ‘I could not stay calm (and I told him) it is you who hit the Boeing passenger plane like gangsters! ‘I saw the expression on his face and felt that he was hurt, and took it very personally. ‘He said: “You think I did it myself?” ‘Then he pointed his finger at the heavens and said: “It was done by b******* from Moscow!’ ‘It was hard for him to talk about it, he had to make excuses. He is a military man after all, not a gangster. ‘It was clear for me, he understood that he was linked to it and that he was partly guilty in the death of civilians. ‘So he quickly ended our conversation.’ The revelation – if true – destroys the Kremlin’s version that the plane was shot down by Ukrainian forces, and suggests a Moscow cover-up to hide the truth. This Russian claim had already been rejected by an international probe into the disaster, but would mark the first denial from a source close to the Kremlin. Tiunov said Dubinsky’s confession came when he confronted his friend over the missile launch, accusing him of being a ‘gangster’ If Tiunov’s comments are accurate, it marks the first time Dubinsky has admitted his role in the MH17 disaster, and the first time a source close to Moscow has admitted Kremlin involvement Pauline Hanson shrugs off criticism of Vladimir Putin over MH17 Tiunov said of Dubinsky: ‘He was neither a b******, nor a rat. I know this. ‘Such people just don’t survive in intelligence. He was fighting in Donbass (eastern Ukraine) as a soldier. ‘Yes, probably, he received a criminal command from his commander. ‘But I am 100 per cent sure – if he had known that it was a passenger plane, and if he had controlled the launch of the missile, he would have never chosen to kill civilians. ‘What’s more, this is what I heard from him in person: “It was done by b******* from Moscow!’ ‘And now he is pictured as the most guilty man. I don’t accept this.’ He stated: ‘He is a key witness, but he is not a murderer. ‘And he is my friend. I want him to stay alive. I believe he did not press the button of that Buk, he only coordinated its movements.’ In total 298 people died in the air disaster in 2014. It is thought Russian-backed militants fired at the aircraft, thinking it was a Ukrainian military plane The secret radio chatter that implicated Dubinsky Independent analysis by Swedish experts confirmed that the high probability that it is Dubinsky’s voice (D) that can be heard in conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian SBU secret service. One conversation with a man nicknamed Buryat (B), went as follows. On 17 July 2014 they discussed where to position the Buk complex that would later be used to shot down MH17. B ~ where shall we load this beauty? D ~ which one? This one? B ~ the one I have brought. I am already in Donetsk (in eastern Ukraine) D ~ this ~ is what I am thinking about, right? The one called M? B ~ yes-yes-yes, Buk, Buk. D ~ and she is up there, on a tractor truck? B ~ yes~ we must unload it somewhere, in order to hide. D ~ is it with a crew? B ~ yes, with a crew. D ~ don’t hide it anywhere. It will soon go there – I will say now where it has to move. It will go together with Vostok tanks. Russians believe leaked recording proves CIA took down MH17 Source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447044/Fears-MH17-witness-blames-Russia-attack.html Advertisements Share this: Pinterest Tumblr LinkedIn Google Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Print Like this: Like Loading...

The move is part of a strategy of cutting the journey time to London to gain an edge and pricing premium over the two dozen rivals offering one-stop flights on the so-called Kangaroo route. Qantas will charge a premium of as much as 48 per cent in economy class and 62 percent in business class relative to one-stop rivals like Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines on the Perth-London route in return for saving three hours of travel time, according to online price comparisons. Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce has said his airline could be operating non-stop flights from Sydney and Melbourne to London within five years as Airbus SE and Boeing Co introduce longer-range aircraft. The 17-hour Perth-London flight on a Boeing 787-9 will originate and end in Melbourne and will not be subject to heightened security checks for Middle Eastern flights as a result. It will cut more than an hour off the flying time from Melbourne to London relative to the current route through Dubai, Qantas said in a statement. Sydney-Dubai-London will be the Australian airline’s only flight operating through the Emirates hub once the change takes place in March. Qantas’s capacity to London will fall as a result of the switch to a 787 from a larger A380. Two A380s that had been serving the Melbourne-Dubai-London route would be redeployed to meet periods of high demand from Melbourne and Sydney to destinations in Asia, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, a Qantas spokeswoman said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week AirAsia X to fly to Europe soon These are the most adventurous travellers in the world AirAsia strengthens connectivity with introduction of three new routes Southwest Airlines says to stop overbooking flights Paddle-boarders and paddle crabs at Wellington’s Queens Wharf Paddle-boarders and paddle crabs at Wellington’s Queens Wharf Budget airline Norwegian launches direct flights from Singapore to London for S$199 AirAsia X to fly to Europe soon A look at the world’s most punctual airlines, airports These are the best US cities for starting over, according to DK Eyewitness Travel Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake See this new ‘Wonder Woman’ TV spot Reuters Video: United Airlines settles with Dr David Dao, says CNBC Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles How airline workers learn to deal with you A look at the world’s most punctual airlines, airports Lufthansa expands Asia network with Cathay Pacific tie-up Laptop ban hits Gulf airlines in battle for business travellers Airlines aim to trick your taste buds at 30,000 feet Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The robotics team will be making their second appearance at the FIRST Robotics World Championship in St. Louis, Mo. (Submitted photo) Two area robotics teams begin competition Thursday at the world championship in St. Louis, Mo. The Duluth East Daredevils will be making their fifth appearance and Esko's SubZero Robotics will be making their second appearance at the FIRST Robotics World Championship, where they'll compete until Saturday against more than 400 teams from countries that include Israel, Turkey, Russia, Australia and Mexico. With four previous trips to the world championship — coming in second place in 2015 — the Daredevils' goal is to win the world championship this year, coach Tim Velner said, adding that it's a "cool thing" that this year's team has the specific mission of taking home a first-place win. "They've had this self-consciousness that we're just some little team from Duluth ... then two years ago, we won second place at the world championships. So this team is believing that it belongs on this stage and that's so cool. It's one thing to want to get to the world championships, it's another thing to have a team that believes that they can win it," he said. SubZero Robotics' goal this year is to have fun throughout the tournament, coach Justin Scheider said. "That's been our team goal is to just go out there and have fun, whatever happens happens and we're going to do our best," he said. The team's division will be competitive but the kids are excited and they feel good about their robot. He said "it's an incredible accomplishment" that the team is going to the championship for the second time since it started three years ago. The team has two large groups of ninth graders and 11th graders, Scheider said. "The juniors have been here once, most of them, so they got the experience and it really inspired them last year. And our freshmen coming in will get a lot of cool things to see and do and they're excited to have the opportunity to learn from and see some of the best teams in the world." Teams spent Wednesday speaking with representatives at the competition's College Row. In the past, Velner has had Daredevils figure out which colleges they want to visit based on those they spoke to at College Row. He added, "Even if they don't go to any of those schools, they engage in that conversation with some really high-powered schools." Students could also spend Wednesday at the Innovation Fair, where national companies such as Boeing, Lego and Nokia demonstrate their industries and technology. "I have seen kids literally develop dreams of what they want to do because of that, because they're talking to somebody and they go, man, I didn't even know that existed. All of a sudden, they have an idea of where they want to go. This isn't just about the world competition, this is also about them finding what their next steps are, what their dreams for the future may be because it's all here," Velner said. "We're here because people develop their pathways here. It's so cool to watch that happen and it's a big part of being here."

While the airports met the tight deadline, the leaders of the two largest regional carriers are certainly not curling up into ball and hiding in a corner. A month into the process, the President of Emirates airline and Chief Executive of Qatar Airways sat down for one-on-one interviews with CNNMoney in Dubai and Doha to share their thoughts on that decision and much more. It was, however, the blunt language aimed at the chief executive of United Airlines that captured most of the headlines after the forceful removal of a passenger on an overbooked flight. “Let me say it was a disgrace. It shamed the airline industry as a whole,” Tim Clark told me at Emirates’ headquarters. “We don’t go about our business in that way. It’s symptomatic of a corporate culture within that company from the board and chief executive downwards.” United’s CEO Oscar Munoz apologised on numerous occasions and took full responsibility for actions that quickly evolved into a public-relations nightmare and eroded $250 million from the company’s market capitalisation. Munoz remains chief executive, but the board decided not to grant him the dual role as chairman. Clark said he would have fallen on his sword if he was in charge at United. “Had it been me in that position I would’ve have had blue flashing lights on cars going right through the company to find out how this could’ve been allowed to happen in the first place. That was probably the last thing I do before I resigned.” The Gulf carriers have been at odds with major American airlines for years and this spilt out into the open again when Emirates decided to trim services to US cities because of all the policy changes from the Trump administration since the start of the year. This would include the attempted travel bans that targeted this region, new visa requirements, a review of the so-called H1-B visa for specialised overseas workers and, of course, the laptop ban. “It is what I call unintended consequences,” said Clark, “From the Emirates point of view, the policy of the federal government is outweighing anything else at the moment.” Clark was referring to the impact of a high-profile global advertising campaign to attract visitors to the US and even local efforts from destinations like the City of Los Angeles. For the CEO of Qatar Airways, the electronics ban took centre stage. He said it was poorly conceived and rushed into action, regardless of the security intelligence that was being gathered by the US agencies. “In today’s day and age we have so much advancement in detection systems that we should utilise them and not just shoot from the hip,” Akbar Al Baker told me during a global gathering of airport chief executives in the Qatari capital. The outspoken CEO was an early backer of Donald Trump so he was careful with his criticism of the President’s first 100 days in office. “I am always a supporter of Donald Trump but a president you know will act upon the advice of people that are around him. And I think on this matter he was ill advised,” To drive home his point he injected a bit of humour into our interview, “If [Trump] continues this way, at the end of the day you will have people sitting in the aeroplane with underwear and nothing [else] on them.” But the battle over access to the US market is no laughing matter. Both sides have been trading verbal barbs for the last three years and have put forward thousands of pages of evidence to defend their positions. Many airline strategists believe it will be difficult to curtail the expansion of the Gulf carriers due to the size of their fleets and orders of Boeing jets and component parts made by giants such as GE and Pratt & Whitney. “We are today living in a globalised world and you really cannot close your doors,” said Al Baker. “Trump is not a nationalist, Trump is a pragmatist. He is looking after America first and we are supporting him in America first.” But this has not stopped the lobbying group for the American carriers called “Open & Fair Skies” to seize upon the opportunity of Emirates’ decision to trim flights to the US saying that “market demand has never played a role when the Gulf carriers decide where to fly.” Clark was not surprised by that language and struck a similar tone in his reply. “I am sure they are delighted, but be careful because we will be back. And we will continue to grow our product and presence in the US throughout the cities we are already serving and others to come.” The writer is Editor of CNNMoney.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Canada’s main stock index fell nearly 1 per cent on Thursday, dragged down by heavyweight banking stocks after an alternative lender’s funding troubles raised concerns about the health of the housing market. Home Capital Group Inc, which has been hit by a series of adverse news last month, said it had hired bankers to help it secure additional funding and size up its strategic options, as the subprime lender reported a further sharp decline in its assets amid a security regulator’s probe into its disclosures. “It’s a crisis affecting a company which happens to be operating in the mortgage market,” said Fred Demers, chief macro strategist at TD Securities, who did not think there was a risk of contagion like the one experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. Home Capital shares popped 25.0 per cent to $7.49, offsetting some of Wednesday’s 60 per cent plunge, but the broader financial group – which accounts for a third of the index’s weight – fell 1.7 per cent and touched four-month lows. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest bank, fell 2.0 per cent to $93.60, while Toronto-Dominion Bank lost 2.4 per cent to $64.20 and Bank of Nova Scotia shed 2.7 per cent to $75.35. Home Capital’s funding woes come at a time when federal and provincial governments are trying to cool Toronto’s red-hot property market through a series of measures. The runaway prices have attracted comments from banks CEOs that the market could correct, which in-turn could hurt lender’s earnings growth. Canada’s federal housing agency said on Wednesday that Toronto still faces price acceleration, overvaluation and overheating. At 3:35 p.m. ET (1935 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index fell 132.74 points, or 0.85 percent, to 15,516.80. The energy group – which account for another 20 percent of the index’s weight – retreated 1.6 percent as oil prices fell on news that two key oilfields in Libya had restarted, pumping crude for export into an already bloated market. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd fell 3.7 per cent to $43.41 and Encana Corp also shed 1.8 per cent to $14.47. Canada’s largest oil and gas company, Suncor Energy Inc advanced 0.3 per cent to $41.75 after reporting better-than-expected profit. Fertilizer company Potash Corp of Saskatchewan gained 2.4 per cent to $23.21 after beating profit expectations and upping its outlook. The Nasdaq Composite ended at a record high on Thursday, boosted by results-related gains in Comcast, PayPal and Intuit, while the S&P 500 and the Dow were little changed. Earnings were back in the spotlight, a day after the Trump administration unveiled its tax reform priorities without details on how the reform would be paid for, raising questions on whether deficit hawks in Congress would support it. Comcast rose 2.1 percent to $39.59 after touching a record high of $40.62 as strong subscriber growth brought a forecast-beating profit. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Most folks were expecting a build in earnings acceleration and that’s what we’ve got. Despite all the economic and geopolitical noise, ultimately the market has been responding to improving earnings,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. He said a premium has been built into stock prices on bets of tax reform and other policies expected from the Trump administration, so “when that is in question you see a sideways action.” U.S. businesses would mostly benefit if President Donald Trump’s plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas becomes law. But the economic benefits and the timing of a possible bill remain in question. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.24 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,981.33, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,388.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.71 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,048.94. Technology stocks will be the focus after the bell with heavyweights Microsoft and Alphabet reporting results. Intuit rose 8.5 percent to $125.63 after it reported consumer tax-season results and reiterated its quarter and full-year forecast. PayPal shares hit a record high a day after it raised its earnings outlook and reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Sportswear maker Under Armour shares jumped 9.9 percent to $21.67 after it posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Energy was the biggest decliner among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, falling 1.1 percent on the back of a 0.9 percent decline in U.S. crude futures. American Airlines dropped 5.2 percent to $43.98. The company said it had offered a mid-contract pay increase for pilots and flight attendants that JPMorgan analysts called “a wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups.” Indexes ticked up but declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1.03-to-1 while on Nasdaq a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 76 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 180 new highs and 45 new lows. About 7.11 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.   Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

(AAL) reported a profit for the first-quarter 2017 that declined 66.6 percent from last year, reflecting a 37.8 percent increase in consolidated fuel expense. But quarterly total operating revenues increased 2.0 percent. Both adjusted earnings per share and revenue for the quarter beat analysts' expectations. In the Thursday's pre-market trade, AAL is trading at $44.97 down $1.43 or 3.08 percent. Net income for the first-quarter dropped 66.6 percent to $234 million from the prior year's $700 million, with earnings per share declining to $0.46 from $1.14 in the previous year. Total first-quarter operating expenses were $9.0 billion, up 11.4 percent year-over-year due primarily to a 37.8 percent increase in consolidated fuel expense. Total first-quarter cost per available seat mile excluding fuel and special items was 11.16 cents, up 7.6 percent year-over-year, due primarily to a 6.5 percent increase in salaries and benefits expense and other investments to improve the operation. Net income, excluding net special item, for the quarter was $308 million or $0.61 per share, compared to $765 million or $1.25 per share last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $0.56 per share for the first-quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Total operating revenues grew 2.0 percent to $9.62 billion from $9.44 billion in the previous year. Analysts expected revenue of $9.61 billion for the quarter. Other revenue was up 9.3 percent primarily due to the new co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016. Total revenue per available seat mile increased by 3.1 percent, on a 1.1 percent decline in total available seat miles. The company expects second-quarter TRASM to rise approximately 3.0 to 5.0 percent, which reflects improving customer demand in both corporate and leisure travel. It also expects second-quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 11.0 and 13.0 percent. In addition, the company on Wednesday disclosed on form 8-K with the Securities Exchange Commission that it has offered a mid-contract hourly base pay rate adjustment for its flight attendants and pilots of an average of approximately five percent and an average of eight percent, respectively. American plans to invest $4.1 billion in new aircraft this year, as it continues to renew its fleet. During the quarter, the company invested $1.2 billion as it took delivery of 17 mainline aircraft and five regional aircraft. These new deliveries will replace aircraft that are expected to leave the fleet. In addition, the company expects to invest $1.6 billion in non-aircraft capital expenditures in 2017 focused on integrating the airline, product enhancements, and operational improvements. To provide widebody capacity flexibility, the company reached an agreement with Airbus to defer delivery of the A350 XWB. Under the new delivery schedule, American expects to receive its first A350 aircraft in late 2020 instead of 2018 as previously planned. American now expects to receive 22 A350s from 2020 through 2024, with an average deferral of two years. In addition, the company reached an agreement with Boeing to defer the delivery of two 787-9 aircraft from the second quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. The company noted that the changes as well as the impact of changes to net pre-delivery payments reduce the company's planned capital expenditures by $500 million in 2018 and $300 million in 2019 and in 2020. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Lower After Trump Comments Company Spotlight: LeMaitre Asian Markets Mixed Amid Cautious Trades Microsoft Q3 Profit Rises - Update Google Parent Alphabet Q1 Profit Rises - Update Stocks Manage To Close Mostly Higher, Nasdaq Sets Record High - U.S. Commentary There Are Still Blockbuster Stores In Alaska Amazon Echo: Product To Judge Your Wardrobe Ryan: We Have Not Made Any Decisions On Vote On Healthcare Bill Vinci Q1 Revenues Up 5% Google Enters Cuba Most Americans Say Trump Performing As Expected Stocks Turning In Mixed Performance In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary The Silence Of The Lambs' Director Jonathan Demme Dies Trump Agrees Not To Terminate NAFTA, To Renegotiate With Canada, Mexico <<Previous        91 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS American Airlines Group Inc Reveals 60% Drop In Q1 Profit American Airlines Group Q1 17 Earnings Conference Call At 8:30 AM ET American Airlines Removes Employee After Clash Over Baby's Stroller American Airlines March Traffic, Capacity Down; Lifts Q1 TRASM, Margin View American Airlines Apologizes For Magazine Photo Of Pilots Drinking Trade AAL now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Google Parent Alphabet Q1 Profit Rises - Update Delta Boots Passenger For Using Bathroom During Long Delay On Tarmac McDonald's Getting Rid Of Hi-C Orange American Airlines Q1 Profit Drops; But Results Beat Estimates Ford Motor Q1 Results Top Estimates; Backs FY17 Profit View Nokia Stock Up On Narrower Q1 Net Loss, Sales Down; Backs Costs Savings View Airbus Q1 Profit Climbs, Adj.

The proposal from the Trump administration slashes tax rates for businesses and on overseas corporate profits returned to the country. It offered no specifics on how it would be paid for without increasing the deficit. “A lot to digest on the tax side and to be honest we don’t have a lot of details at this point aside from just a few bullet points from the press conference,” said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York. “This is going to be a bit of an uphill fight to get this plan enacted into law.” The expectation of a corporate tax cut was partly behind the rally in U.S. stocks since the November election of Donald Trump. The market stalled over the last several weeks as the administration has failed to score a major legislative victory, Republican majorities in the House and Senate notwithstanding. The S&P 500 traded above its record closing high throughout the day, however. Some analysts say even though tax reform would be a major boost to stocks, economic and earnings growth are enough to support current market levels. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 11.8 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,975.09, the S&P 500 lost 1.16 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,387.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.27 point to 6,025.23. Despite the tick lower, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The tax proposal includes a cut on so-called pass-through business taxes that would deliver a windfall to investors in MLPs, master limited partnerships. Among stocks, United Technologies rose 1.1 percent to $118.20 and provided the biggest boost to the Dow industrials after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations helped by higher sales in all four of its business units. “Earnings are very strong, you could see a 15 percent year-on-year growth on the S&P,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York. “We’re seeing a global, synchronized up swing.” On the flip side, Boeing shares fell about 1 percent to $181.71 after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 210 new highs and 28 new lows. About 7.33 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.44 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Maine man sentenced to 9 years in jail following 9th OUI conviction Maine monument’s future in doubt after Trump orders review From tasty water to the ‘lowest depths of misery,’ celebrities have mixed feelings on Maine FairPoint to phase out regulated landlines in 5 more Maine communities Falmouth doctor sentenced for illegal drug distribution It’s time for physicians to ask patients about their drinking Trump’s budget guts this program critical to the success of Maine’s coastal communities Formatting error shouldn’t jeopardize college education for low-income students Here’s the economic case for supporting addiction treatment Are Trump supporters getting their money’s worth?

Stocks in the United States eased back from their opening gains overnight, with muted market reaction to President Donald Trump's tax agenda. Markets at 8:00am (AEDT): ASX SPI 200 futures -0.1pc to 5,897 AUD: 74.69 US cents, 58.17 British pence, 82.98 Japanese yen, 68.46 euro cents, $NZ1.08 US: S&P 500 -0.04pc to 2,387, Dow Jones -0.1pc to 20,975, Nasdaq 6,025 Europe: Euro Stoxx +0.08pc to 383.26, FTSE +0.18pc to 7,288 Commodities: Gold +0.42pc to $US1,268.65/ounce Mr Trump has proposed slashing the income tax rate paid by public corporations from 35 per cent to 15 per cent and is hoping to reduce tax on overseas profits that are returned to the country. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin outlined the tax plan overnight, stating that the administration's objective was "to make US businesses the most competitive in the world". But stocks in multinational companies like Apple, with large stockpiles of offshore profits, fell after the announcement failed to reveal a specific rate for repatriating overseas profits. Analysts said markets appeared unimpressed with the outlines of the US tax plan and warned that there were obstacles ahead, which would likely delay the agenda. NAB currency strategist Rodrigo Catril said that question marks remained on whether the tax plan would attract enough support in Congress to pass in its current form. "There is also uncertainty on whether these changes are going to be permanent or temporary, given that as it stands, it is unclear if the tax cuts will pay for themselves or result in a larger budget deficit by the end of 10 years," he wrote in an analyst note. "Notably as well, the tax reform announcement did not include any details on infrastructure spending — something that was initially seen as a potential way to garner Democrats support." Overall, Mr Catril said the eagerly anticipated tax plan was viewed as short on new details. "While in theory Trump's tax plan should be risk and growth positive, the muted market reaction is probably a reflection of the lack of new detail in the today's announcement as much of the key proposals were already known," Mr Catril wrote. "Some of the key changes include a reduction of corporate tax from 35 to 15 per cent, impose a one-off tax on overseas profits and then move the US into a territorial tax system — based on taxing businesses on revenues and costs incurred in the US, no border tax adjustment, reduce individual tax brackets from 7 to 3 (10 per cent, 25 per cent and 35 per cent respectively), eliminate estate tax — death tax — and reduce most deductions for individuals, leaving mortgage interest and charitable deductions." Company earnings results were also mixed overnight. United Technologies stocks rose after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, but that was partially offset by falls in Boeing shares, after the company reported a decline in revenue. European shares rose slightly, supported by gains in luxury stocks and financials, after a wave of earnings results that largely outperformed market expectations. Locally, it is set to be a fairly flat open and at 8:00am (AEST) the Australian dollar was falling to 74.69 US cents. At the same time, West Texas Crude oil was worth $US49.19 a barrel, a barrel of Tapis was higher at $US51.13 and spot gold had increased to $US1,268 an ounce.
