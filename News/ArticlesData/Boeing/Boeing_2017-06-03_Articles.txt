A current dispute between the Canadian government and the Montreal-based aircraft maker Bombardier on the one side, and Boeing on the other, appears to be proving one thing: Protectionism begets protectionism. The quarrel heated up a few weeks ago, when Boeing launched an anti-dumping petition against Bombardier, asking the U.S. Department of Commerce to find that the latter was guilty of dumping its C Series plane on the U.S. market at below market costs with the help of the Canadian and Quebec governments. Demonstrating an all-too-predictable tit-for-tat approach, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland responded immediately to the move, ordering a review of the government’s previously announced purchase, without an open competition, of 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan made the link between Boeing’s trade action and the Canadian Government’s response even more explicit a few days ago, saying: “It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner and we call on Boeing to withdraw it." A few days later, the Canadian government suspended discussions with Boeing to iron out the details of the purchase. It is reminiscent of a Mafia Don: Nice aircraft contract ya got there. Would be a shame if anything were to happen to it. Let’s be clear about something right off the bat: The Canadian Government turned to the Super Hornet not as a favor to Boeing, but because it needed the fighter jets to fill a projected 20-year capability gap. The plane offers maneuverability, with the capacity to serve as a multi-role fighter capable of carrying a wide array of weapons, while providing compatibility with Canada’s existing fleet of CF-18s. If the government didn’t believe that Boeing’s fighter jet met those needs, the company wouldn’t have been awarded the contract, certainly not without competition. What the Canadian government is doing by holding up the contract is threatening to cut off its nose to spite Boeing’s face. Of course, Boeing is hardly in a position to complain about any country engaging in dirigiste economic policies. It has been a steady recipient of funds from Washington, channeled through the Export-Import Bank. In fact, Ex-Im is sometimes referred to as ‘Boeing’s Bank.’ And nobody comes to this fight with clean hands. Bombardier has consistently sought and obtained protectionist rents from Canadian governments. The billions in government largesse – including recent loans of $1 billion and $372 million from the Quebec and Canadian governments respectively – has allowed Bombardier to cut prices and win a contract from Delta Air Lines for its C Series airplane, prompting Boeing’s attempt to get the Commerce Department’s help. When one considers the way both Boeing and Bombardier have been getting fat off the largesse of their respective governments, in any competition between the two aircraft makers one thinks immediately of what Henry Kissinger was reputed to have said about the Iran-Iraq War: “It’s a pity both sides can’t lose.” But while both Boeing and Bombardier may benefit from their golden keys to their governments vaults, taxpayers, workers and other businesses on both sides of the border are the real losers. The money that Washington and Ottawa (and Quebec City) unload on the two aircraft companies only serves to distort the marketplace, restrain competition, divert capital and talent from other firms, and drain government revenue that could be used to cut taxes, reduce deficits, or improve infrastructure, education, training or other objectives. The dispute demonstrates, once again, that protectionism and mercantilism inevitably lead to a vicious cycle of favoritism, subsidies and low-interest forgivable loans, with all countries engaging in a true race to the bottom. For businesses like Boeing and Bombardier, it’s a hell of a ride – while citizens and taxpayers pay for it.

Matein Khalid Market View/Dubai Filed on June 4, 2017 | Last updated on June 4, 2017 at 08.18 pm Share More > Vote Boeing forecasts that the global passenger jet fleet will more than double to 45,250 by 2035. (AP) I was stunned to read a Boeing report that forecasts that the global passenger jet fleet will more than double to 45,250 by 2035. Given that almost 20,000 of the world's in service aircraft will be retired or converted to freighters in the next decade, Boeing forecasts at least $3 trillion in financing for 40,000 odd new aircraft deliveries in the next eighteen years. This makes aircraft leasing one of the few growth niches in global finance. While Tony Ryan and Guinness Peat Aviation pioneered the industry's growth in the late 1970's, putting Dublin on the world map as the epicentre of global aviation finance, I see no reason why Dubai and Abu Dhabi not take advantage of the sheer scale of the secular growth in the industry to nurture an ecosystem in aviation leasing and finance a new Dublin is in the desert. After all, even new, 8,000 of the 20,000 odd passenger jets in service even now are leased, not owned, by airlines. The global aircraft leasing markets enables Emirates and Etihad airlines to finance new aircraft orders, manage their balance sheets and manage their global route networks more efficiently. Chinese banks have emerged as major players in global aircraft leasing, as symbolised by the IPO of Bank of China (BOC) Aviation and CDB Financial Leasing's initial public assets in Hong Kong while investors as varied as Tony Fernandez's Air Asia and Li Ka Shing have actively acquired aircraft leasing assets. The world's top two aircraft lessors now are General Electric's Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) and Dublin's Aer Cap, with over 1,000 aircraft each leased to the world's leading airlines. Chinese megabanks ICBC are Bank of China and CDB own three of the world's largest operating lessors. Since Chinese demand for new passenger jets will shape the future of aviation in the next decade, it does not surprise me that Chinese banks, conglomerates and even Hong Kong taipans have scrambled to invest in aircraft leasing assets. There is surely a lesson here for the GCC's sovereign wealth funds, merchant banks, Islamic banks, insurance companies and family offices. As an investor, I find this sector interesting because it is possible to earn 6-8 per cent on senior debt and as much as 15 per cent in a diverse portfolio of aircraft leased to the leading airlines in the US, Europe and Asia. The Middle East and Africa are 10 per cent of the global leased aircraft market even now. Emirates airlines has a lessee fleet of 122 aircraft, though global airlines like American, Air France KLM, IAG (British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia) boast three times as many leased aircraft. It is no coincidence that 60 per cent of passenger jets owned by lessors are narrow body aircraft that are more cost efficient to operators and can be rerouted easily compared to wide-body aircraft while also in great demand by Asia, Europe, GCC and Latin America's low-cost carriers. Budget airlines use fleet expansion to launch short- to mid-haul routes. This makes the narrow-bodied jet leasing segment a highly liquid, particular to the white hot regional budget airline operating in the Pacific Basin and even India. It is no coincidence that both General Electric GECAS and Air Capso dominate the global narrow body passenger jet leased fleet market. The age of a leased aircraft is critical as older aircraft have significant residual value and maintenance cost risks which can gut their credit rating in an economic slump even as borrowing costs in the capital markets spike higher, as the airline bankruptcies in the 2008 and 2009 global recession demonstrate. This is the reason Chinese bank lessors tend to prefer aircraft fleets whose age ranges between 3 and 5 years. I believe investing in aircraft lessors not airlines, is the optimal play on the secular growth in global air travel. It is imperative that aircraft lessors must own young narrow body fleets, have stable cash flows, and the lowest cost bank funding possible scale is mission critical because there are 160 aircraft lessors operating worldwide and only the biggest firms can diversify jet type, fleet age, lease duration and client concentration risk. Of course, EPS growth, rising operating margins, free cash flow, cheap valuations and high ROE are the holy grail for investors in the global aircraft leasing market.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 2017 Investor's Guide to the Top 10 Fighter Jets in the World Only a handful of companies make fighter jets -- and fewer still are worth investing in. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Jun 4, 2017 at 10:13AM In the 21st century, there are fighter jets, and then there are fighter jets. Which kind you get depends on how much you want to pay. Image source: U.S. Air Force. Got hundreds of millions of dollars to toss around? Then like the U.S. government, you can hire Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to design and build you an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter -- widely considered the most capable air-superiority combat jet in the world. (Of course, if you cut your production run short before efficiencies of scale kick in, the planes end up costing $412 million apiece.) The same $412 million could buy you a handful of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) perfectly serviceable fourth-generation F/A-18 or F-15 fighter jets, retailing for about $100 million a pop. Or alternatively, if you're buying on a budget, you might enjoy a nice Soviet-era Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback ($18 million). Prefer to "buy American"? Have you given Textron's (NYSE:TXT) new Scorpion a try? It's a steal at $17 million per plane. Depending on what each nation needs, various buyers pick various warplanes and various price points. But which are the most popular combinations today? Let's find out. 10. Northrop Grumman F-5 Tiger, $20 million to $25 million (estimated) Image source: U.S. Navy. Northrop Grumman's F-5 Tiger is no longer in production (hence the really old photo), and its numbers are fading fast. As recently as last year, FlightGlobal's World Air Forces 2017 report put the number of F-5s in service globally at 482. Today, that number has fallen to just 416, which is still enough to make up 3% of all fighters in operation around the world. 9. Chengdu J-7 Fishbed (only sold in China and no longer in production) Two Bangladeshi F-7BG Defenders, an export version of China's J-7 fighter, accompanying a U.S. Air Force C-130H Hercules. Image source: U.S. Air Force. Tied with the F-5 at 3% global market share is No. 9, the Chinese J-7 fighter jet. It's actually China's version of the old Soviet MiG-21, and is no longer produced. Still, all 418 "Fishbeds" cited in last year's survey remain in service today. 8. Chengdu F-7 Airguard, $2 million in 1984 (~$4.7 million in 2017 dollars) The same two F-7s, preparing for takeoff. Image source: U.S. Air Force. The export version of China's J-7 is dubbed F-7, and it's likewise a twin to Russia's MiG-21. The global population of F-7s declined by nine planes over the past 12 months, and now stands at 450 aircraft, giving the F-7 a 3% market share as well. 7. Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot, $11 million Image source: Sukhoi. Rounding out the list of fighter jets with roughly 3% global market shares is Sukhoi's Su-25 Frogfoot, Russia's answer to the tank-busting American A-10 Thunderbolt II "Warthog." With 511 units in service, however, there are nearly twice as many Frogfoots (Frogfeet?) flying around the globe as there are A-10s. 6. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Fishbed, $25,000 (used) Two Croatian MiG-21s (left) fly formation with a Navy F-14 Tomcat. Image source: U.S. Navy. The global population of operational MiG-21s continues to dwindle, falling 31% from 793 in 2013 to just 547 today. Pretty soon, these MiGs will be collector's items -- in fact, they may already be. It seems you can sometimes buy a used MiG-21 on eBay for about 25 grand. The MiG-21 still commands 4% market share globally, and if you include its "twins" -- the Chinese J-7s and F-7s -- there are 1,415 MiG-21 lookalikes in service today. Counted that way, this would be enough to make the MiG-21 the world's No. 2 most popular fighter jet. 5. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum, $16 million Royal Malaysian Air Force MiG-29N (middle). Image source: U.S. Navy. Awhile back, we mentioned that a new variant of the MiG-29, dubbed the MiG-35D, was slated to enter service in 2016, giving a new lease on life -- and increased market share -- to the Moscow warbird. That's now happened, and the world's most advanced MiG has enjoyed a market share boost to 6% (829 planes) as a result. 4. Boeing F-15 Eagle, $100 million Image source: U.S. Air Force. Losing more and more international fighter jet competitions through a combination of high cost and low stealth, Boeing's F-15 is down, but not out. With 874 planes in service, the F-15 still retains a 6% market share. What's more, that share is expected to grow. Late last year, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified Congress of a pending sale of 72 F-15QA fighter jets to Qatar -- the first such foreign sale noted in several years, and for a whopping $21.1 billion purchase price. (That works out to $292 million per plane, a far steeper price than other countries have been asked to pay.) 3. Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker, $62 million Image source: Sukhoi. Russia's Su-27 Flanker (and the more advanced Su-30 "Flanker-C" upgrade) remains Russia's most popular fighter jet -- and the third most popular fighter in the world. Globally, the Flanker and Flanker-C command 6% global market share, with 940 aircraft in service. 2. Boeing F-18 Hornet, $92 million Image source: U.S. Navy. Last-minute deals negotiated under the Obama Administration to sell advanced fighter jets to Persian Gulf allies have salvaged Boeing's fighter-jet business. Not only will Boeing get to keep building F-15s, but its powerful F/A-18 Super Hornet franchise also appears to have been revived. Simultaneously with the announcement of the F-15 sale to Qatar, DSCA announced a sale of 32 F/A-18E fighter jets and eight more advanced F/A-18F fighters to Kuwait for a total cost of $10.1 billion. With 1,071 F/A-18 fighters of various configurations in service, and a 7% worldwide market share already, Boeing's F/A-18 looks set to make up a larger proportion of world air forces in years to come. 1. Lockheed Martin F-16 Falcon, $34 million Image source: U.S. Air Force. And last (first?), but not least, for the fourth year running, Lockheed Martin's modestly priced F-16 Falcon tops the rankings in this year's edition of FlightGlobal's report. With 2,312 planes in active service, the F-16 remains the most popular fighter jet on the planet, making up 16% of the world's air forces. Theoretically, that could change as F-16s age out of service, and are gradually replaced by Lockheed Martin's newer (but more expensive) F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jet. Then again, India is said to be in negotiations with Lockheed about a deal to produce hundreds of F-16s locally -- which could keep Lockheed Martin at the top of the rankings of the most popular fighter jets for years to come. Why investors care about fighter jets So why is this important to investors in the defense industry? It works like this: the more planes a company sells, the broader the base over which it can spread research and development costs, and the less it must charge per plane. The lower the cost, the cheaper the plane. And the cheaper the plane, the easier it is to sell more planes, growing market share further. Thus the effect snowballs. Now, Lockheed Martin has sold more than 4,500 F-16s around the world. That's not surprising, because it's one of the most cost-effective warplanes in our inventory, costing just $21,450 per flight hour. Half of these F-16s are still flying, and generating services, maintenance, and upgrades revenue for Lockheed -- and according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, earning Lockheed's shareholders better than 10.5% operating profit margins. Additional F-16 sales to India would help keep that plane at the top of the rankings -- and generating profits -- until the F-35 is ready to take its place. In that regard, Lockheed appears to be making progress with the F-35. Recently, the U.S. Air Force inked a deal with Lockheed pricing new F-35A fighters at less than $95 million each. If it can keep driving prices down while ramping sales up, then one day soon, we should see the F-35 make its debut on this list -- perhaps not next year, but soon.

Boeing expects to get about a half of the pie, with their gain being estimated about $50 billion. It is known that this figure includes both military and commercial sales, but the company did not disclose what exactly it is going to sell, RIA Novosti reported. Boeing will also establish a joint venture with Saudi Arabia to provide "sustainment services for a wide range of military platforms," the company said in a statement, according to the Business Insider. It added that a separate joint venture would "provide support for both military and commercial helicopters." The other weapon maker, Lockheed Martin, expects to make about $28 billion, with a massive batch of 150 Black Hawk helicopters. The company also sells the Saudis its Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), the ones that have a long and sad development history, as a replacement option instead of multimission warships the Saudis were looking for. Lockheed is also preparing to sell the THAAD missile defense system to Saudi Arabia, in a deal mediated by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who reportedly helped the deal by calling Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson and asking her to lower the price for the Saudis. The other beneficiaries are believed to be Raytheon, which seeks to sell $1 billion worth of Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs, and General Dynamics, which is about to finalize its order of 115 M1A2 tanks. According to the Business Insider, "Saudi Arabia is seeking closer defense and commercial ties with the US under Trump, as it seeks to develop its economy beyond oil, and leads a coalition that is fighting a war in Yemen.

Digital Trends Home > Cars > Inside the Lamborghini lab that’s… Inside the Lamborghini lab that’s reinventing carbon fiber By Ronan Glon — Updated June 2, 2017 3:52 pm Subscribe Share It’s easy to draw parallels between a Lamborghini and an airplane. Both boast a wind-cheating design, both are incredibly quick, and both are coveted by the rich and the famous. The fighter jet-style start switch on the center console of the brand’s most recent models adds substance to the comparison, as do the toggle switches on the dashboard. But, the similarities are more than skin-deep. Like airplane and helicopter manufacturers, Lamborghini relies heavily on advanced composite materials such as carbon fiber to make its cars as light as possible. Some of the technology – and the way it’s applied during the development process – comes straight from the world of aerospace. Lamborghini handles every step of the production process in-house; its engineers call this a building block approach. To find out how it’s done, we flew to the company’s headquarters in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy, put on a uniform, and spent a day shadowing workers. The Seattle connection Lamborghini began dabbling in carbon fiber in 1982. At the time, its cars were largely built using various types of sheet metal, and the composites department was just a tiny fragment of the brand’s research and development effort. Lamborghini’s composites department built an experimental Countach prototype with a full carbon fiber monocoque a year after it was founded. By chance, some of the engineers who founded the department were Italians that had previously worked for Boeing in Seattle, Washington. They diligently applied the lessons learned while developing the 767 airliner to the world of high-end, high-performance cars. The team was made up of just five people, yet it managed to build an experimental, fully-functional Countach prototype with a full carbon fiber monocoque only a year after the department was founded. The composites department grew in size during the 1980s and the 1990s after executives accurately predicted carbon fiber was the future of supercars. By 1998, all of the Diablo GT’s exterior body panels were made from the lightweight material. In 2011, the Aventador debuted an ultra-light carbon fiber body. Going straight to the source As we step inside the carbon fiber development center, we’re greeted not by a technician with oil-stained hands but by a researcher in a black lab coat. The first step of the process is to test samples (called coupons) to learn how various types of carbon fiber withstand pressure. The small, rectangular coupons are bent until they snap, crushed by hundreds of pounds, and subjected to extreme temperatures on both ends of the thermometer. They’re examined under a powerful microscope to identify even the tiniest imperfections that can later cause much bigger issues. Nothing is left to chance in the research lab. The valuable data gathered during these tests is used to manufacture elements, assemblies, components, and, ultimately, a full car. Attilio Masini, Lamborghini’s head of materials technology and manufacturing engineering, tells us this bottom-up approach came directly from Boeing. He explains it’s extremely important for Lamborghini to have full control over the entire production process. No step is outsourced, but engineers and researchers frequently exchange ideas with Boeing and the University of Washington.  The collaboration gives Lamborghini access to advanced software that allows it to calculate how a specific carbon fiber component will fare in an accident without needing to stuff an expensive prototype into a wall. Rolls of carbon fiber are stored in a massive walk-in freezer reminiscent of the cold room you’d find in a butcher’s shop. Members of the R&D department can tell ahead of time which parts of, say, an Aventador body will absorb impact. This greatly reduces the time it takes to get a car certified for road use. From the freezer to the oven Production of carbon fiber components takes place deep inside the growing Lamborghini complex. It’s not what you imagine when you think of a car factory. It’s well lit, the floors are clean enough to eat off of, and the entire process is done by hand so the facility is almost as quiet as a library. To experience the process first hand, we’re instructed to make a small part with ridges and grooves that R&D cuts up and uses for various tests. Having never played with carbon fiber before, we were surprised by how much time it takes to churn out a relatively simple part. Rolls of carbon fiber are stored in a massive walk-in freezer reminiscent of the cold room you’d find in a butcher’s shop. Once they’ve thawed, they’re cut to shape with a knife, because using a laser would create too much heat. With four small sheets of the material in hand, we set out to make our first part. The sheets must be carefully placed in a mold one layer at a time, and pressed down using a plastic tool to ensure a tight fit. The mold is placed in a vacuum bag to remove the air that gets trapped in between the layers. It sounds relatively simple when you read about it, but making the wave-shaped part took us about 45 minutes. It’s then baked in a large oven for about six hours. Carbon fiber parts need to look good, and they also need to be durable; craftsmanship is the name of the game in Sant’Agata. Consequently, the process of manufacturing even a basic component like a piece of trim is highly meticulous. Lamborghini explains it takes roughly a year before new workers are allowed to make carbon fiber parts on their own. While our part hardens, we head over to a different part of the factory to learn about what insiders proudly refer to as carbon fiber 2.0. The carbon fiber of the future Not one to rest on its laurels, Lamborghini has developed a brand-new type of carbon fiber named Forged Composites. The name might not sound familiar, but you’ve seen it before if you’ve been keeping up with Lamborghini news. It’s that cool, high tech-looking material prominently featured on the Sesto Elemento and, more recently, on the Huracán Performante. It was designed in-house, and the company’s brightest minds agree it’s the carbon fiber of the future. Designers love working with Forged Composites because it gives parts a unique look, and it can be shaped in ways that regular carbon fiber can’t. On paper, Forged Composites is similar to the carbon fiber we’ve gotten used to seeing in cars. Rolls of it are stored in a freezer until they need to be turned into parts. They’re also cut with a knife, and carefully placed in a mold layer by layer. However, the other tasks are entirely automated. Again, we’re instructed to make a small, wavy part used by members of the R&D staff for testing. This time, there is no need to poke, nudge, or force the material into a mold; a vertical press handles that part of the process with a single powerful strike. And, instead of sitting in an oven for hours, for fifteen minutes the part is placed in a purpose-built machine that heats it up to 275 degrees Fahrenheit while applying over 1,100 PSI of pressure. Right now, Forged Composites is used to make components like spoilers, bumpers, interior trim parts, and shift paddles. It will gradually replace carbon fiber on the assembly line, meaning it’s not too far-fetched to imagine one day Lamborghini will make a full monocoque out of Forged Composites. When it reaches that point, the brand will be able to increase production of its super sports cars as it sees fit. Ronan Glon/Digital Trends “Forged Composites provides the right balance between weight reduction, performance, and safety in our super sports cars,” Masini told us. Lamborghini designers love working with Forged Composites because it gives parts a unique look, and it can be shaped in ways that regular carbon fiber can’t. Engineers praise the material because it’s highly resistant to damage, and it’s easy to drill or trim. That’s why everyone at the factory refers to it as carbon fiber 2.0, and we’re going to be seeing much more of it in the coming years.

June 2017 New postponement to delivery of Norwegian Airline’s new planes Flight manufacturer Boeing has postponed delivery of the 737 Max aircraft to Norwegian once again. Advertisement Completion was expected by late May, but, ‘Boeing has informed us that delivery of our first 737 Max is postponed until the end of June,’ said a spokesperson for Norwegian on the Flight Global website. In mid-May, Boeing announced that they had ordered test flights of all 737 Max aircraft due to a possible error in a vital enginepart. Boeing, and engine manufacturer, CFM, told Reuters news agency they didn’t know how long the problem would persist. Four routes affected Norwegian had planned to launch four foreign routes with the 737 Max by mid-June. The company say they will switch to the 737 Max when they receive them, but according to the website, can’t specify exactly when that will be. Norwegian made purchase options on a total of 100 of the aircraft type, referred to as the next generation of short and medium-distance planes. The airline plans to fly 737 Max aircraft, with lower fuel consumption than its predecessor, on routes between Europe and smaller cities in the United States.   © NTB Scanpix / Norway Today Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Related SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Next post Related Articles Finance Boeing supports Norwegian in license case Travel Trouble for Dubrovnik passengers Finance Norwegian will be first on the wing with new 737 Max aircraft Finance, News Teething problems for Norwegian’s Boeing 737 Max Be the first to comment on "Delivery of Norwegian Airline planes delayed again" Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

McIntyre 24/7 Wall St. June 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share United Airlines will start the longest flight between a U.S. location and any airport in the world. The service, which will cover 8,700 miles, will run between Los Angeles and Singapore. United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) will use a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner plane for the flight. The aircraft builder launched the plane in 2009 and delivered the first one to Nippon Airlines in 2011. It can hold over 300 passengers. It is good for long-range flights because Boeing Co. (BA) has taken as much weight off its frame as possible, mostly through the use of composite material. Boeing says it has made 541 of the planes. Boeing's price for the plane is $270 million, although carriers rarely pay the list price. ALSO READ: Warren Buffett’s Top Stock Holdings Keep Changing Lighter planes have become the key to longer flights. On top of that, international travel has surged. According to a leading industry group: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced full-year global passenger traffic results for 2016 showing demand (revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 6.3% compared to 2015 (or 6.0% if adjusted for the leap year). This strong performance was well ahead of the ten-year average annual growth rate of 5.5%. Capacity rose 6.2% (unadjusted) compared to 2015, pushing the load factor up 0.1 percentage points to a record full-year average high of 80.5%. The rise in load and drop in fuel prices make these long routes more profitable than they would have been several years ago.

The company expects that it will see robust demand for its military aviation products including the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the EA-18G Growler and the F-15 Eagle. “We see our defense business strengthening. We still see it as a modest growth business going forward,” Boeing chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg said at Sanford C. Bernstein’s Strategic Decision Brokers Conference on June 1. “We see some fundamentals strengthening in the U.S. defense budget as you well know, there is still uncertainty on exactly where the fiscal year 2018 budget will come out what the five-year plan looks like.” Compared to just a few years ago, when Boeing faced the prospect of shuttering both its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet product lines, things are looking up for the company’s tactical fighter business. “We see some new energy in our fighter line for example,” Muilenburg said. “Demand for the F-18 is returning and you see the five-year plans that have just been launched and the fiscal 2018 budget requests. Those all include Super Hornets, when in the past they did not. So that creates some opportunity for the future.” Meanwhile, the Navy is looking at mid-life upgrades for the Super Hornet, which could prove to be lucrative for the company. In addition to more F/A-18s and upgrades for the existing Super Hornet fleet, Muilenburg noted that the Navy has expressed interest in more EA-18G electronic attack aircraft. “We see continuing interest in the Growler electronic attack variant domestically,” Muilenburg said. “All of that tells us that line should very well be strong and healthy through the next decade. Not just through this decade, but well into the next decade.” Things are also looking up for both the Super Hornet and F-15 overseas in the export market. “We are continuing to see international interest. Kuwait’s interest in F-18s, as you recently saw the signing of the agreements—our approval of the agreements in Qatar for three F-15s with an option from another 36—Canadian interest in the Super Hornets,” Muilenburg said. Embed from Getty Images “We have continuing international interest in several places. So we can see both the F-18 line and the F-15 line being extended in a strong way well into the next decade.” If Muilenburg proves to be correct and the F/A-18 and F-15 lines are extended into the 2020s, Boeing’s fighter production lines will survive long enough to compete for the U.S. Navy’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) or F/A-XX program to replace the Super Hornet. The company could also be a competitor for the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA)—which is also sometimes called F-X or Next Generation Air Dominance [sharing the same program name as the Navy’s separate effort]—program to replace the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and the F-15C Eagle air superiority fighters. However, the Pentagon needs to start working on those next-generation projects sooner rather than later for the sake of the industrial base.

The Tod and Maxine McClaskey Foundation has awarded $2 million to Washington State University Vancouver for the creation of an endowed chair in hospitality business management. Tod McClaskey was a co-founder of the Red Lion Inn Hotel chain, and the foundation in his name donated money to help launch WSUV’s hospitality program in 2013. Last year, the foundation gave $4 million to Clark College to bolster the school’s culinary program, and over the years it has contributed to numerous other educational programs throughout the county. Vancouver in recent years has benefited from the generosity of a remarkable generation of philanthropists, people who have used their wealth to provide for the future of the community. In the process, they have bolstered the region’s high quality of life. Jeers: To job losses at Boeing. The aerospace giant, Washington’s largest private employer, saw its workforce in the state decline by 1,582 in April. According to The (Everett) Herald, that was the company’s sharpest monthly decline since 2003. Boeing officials said the cuts are necessary for the company to remain viable in a competitive global market. And, it should be noted, Boeing still employs some 80,000 people in Washington and remains essential to the state’s economy. But at the same time, the company reports that it saved $242 million on its state tax bill thanks to breaks approved by the Legislature in 2013. Those breaks were provided in exchange for a promise to build the 777X in Washington. Boeing has lived up to the letter of that agreement, but often has violated the spirit of it by moving other jobs out of the state. Cheers: To pneumonia. Well, we’re not big fans of the illness, but cheers go to the fact that “pneumonia,” according to Google, is the most often looked-up word in Washington. Hey, it’s a tough word to spell, so there is no shame in having to double-check it. Oregonians, on the other hand, were most likely to look up “sense,” which common, um, sense tells us isn’t very difficult to spell. And while our neighbors to the south might be scratching their heads over that one, it is the people of Wisconsin who should be truly embarrassed by the Google analysis. The most searched-for word in The Badger State is “Wisconsin.” Jeers: To tension at The Evergreen State College in Olympia. After a couple weeks of racial unrest, the campus was abruptly closed Thursday following a phoned-in threat of violence. Evergreen has seen recent protests stemming from the tradition of Day of Absence, in which minorities traditionally attend programs off campus. The situation has devolved from there, with a professor being urged by some to resign and with national news outlets paying attention. We’ll make it simple: Campuses should be bastions of free speech. Meanwhile, whomever escalated the tension by threatening violence should be investigated and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Cheers: To the Portland Rose Festival. Portland’s annual civic celebration is getting underway, providing opportunities for fun and frivolity in an extravaganza the attracts people from well beyond the city boundaries. CityFair, which lures revelers to the Willamette River waterfront with rides, carnival games, food, and entertainment, is open this weekend and next. The Starlight Parade will wind its way through downtown Portland tonight, and the Grand Floral Parade is next Saturday. The Rose Festival dates to 1907, and it long has heralded the start of summer while celebrating the natural beauty of this region.

It's offering a dozen people a once-in-a-lifetime ride on the airline's newest plane. But just four days after opening an auction for seats on the delivery flight scheduled for June 13, Norwegian says it won't be taking off that day. "Boeing has informed us that the delivery of our first 737 MAX is postponed until the end of June," the company said in a brief statement. Why the delay? Boeing spokesman Doug Alder tells CNBC: "On occasion delivery processes run into minor issues — whether for maintenance or other reasons. In this case, we and our customer decided to re-schedule this delivery in order to resolve a minor technical issue." Alder declined to give further details about issues causing the delay. Boeing expects Norwegian Air to get the plane by the end of June. Pushing back scheduled deliveries of new planes is not unusual, but Boeing has a lot riding on its new 737. The transition from the current 737 NG to the 737 MAX is being watched closely. Boeing is currently building 42 737s each month, with monthly production scheduled to jump to 47 later this year, 52 in 2018 and 59 in 2019. As that production climbs, so will deliveries of the 737 MAX. There's no indication that delaying some initial 737 Max deliveries will jeopardize Boeing's production plans, but pushing back Norwegian's delivery comes less than a month after Boeing suspended 737 MAX test flights to inspect some of the engines for a potential manufacturing flaw. After inspecting the LEAP 1B engines and working with the engine manufacturer CFM International, (Singapore Exchange: CFMH-SG) Boeing resumed test flights, and the first 737 MAX 8 was delivered in mid-May to the Asian carrier Malindo Air. Malindo is now operating two 737 MAX planes. As for Norwegian, the delivery delay will not change the airline's plan to expand service to the U.S. this summer. "This will not affect our operation or our passengers, as the upcoming launch of transatlantic routes between the U.S. East Coast and Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Norway will be operated by another aircraft type," the airline said. Boeing shares closed Friday up more than 1.6 percent at about $190.23.

Boeing & Aerospace Business International Trade Boeing delays Norwegian Air’s first 737 MAX plane a second time Originally published June 2, 2017 at 6:03 pm Boeing is looking to step up shipments of the 737 MAX after briefly suspending flights last month because of a potential manufacturing fault in the plane’s engines. Boeing said the latest delay was due to a “a minor technical issue.” (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) Boeing attributed the latest delay decision to a “a minor technical issue” without providing details. Share story By Julie Johnsson and Justin Bachman Bloomberg News Boeing is delaying the delivery of Norwegian Air Shuttle’s first 737 MAX jet — again. The upgraded single-aisle plane will now arrive at the end of June, the discount carrier said in an emailed statement Friday. The delay is the second in about a month for Norwegian, which initially planned to receive its first 737 MAX at the end of May before being forced to reschedule for June 13. Boeing is looking to step up shipments of the fastest-selling plane in company history after briefly suspending flights last month because of a potential manufacturing fault in the plane’s engines. Norwegian has been discussing “appropriate” compensation with Boeing over the delay, Thomas Ramdahl, the airline’s chief commercial officer, said this week. The carrier referred questions about the delay to Boeing. In an emailed statement, the planemaker attributed the decision to a “a minor technical issue” without providing details. The engines are made by CFM International, a venture of General Electric and Safran.

Norwegian has already planned to begin new trans-Atlantic service from Edinburgh to the U.S. with a 737-800 limited to 150 passengers. The delay likely means Norwegian will fly the older 737 on the route longer. Norwegian is the European launch customer for the 737 MAX, with 108 orders. Boeing delivered the first of the upgraded 737 to Lion Mentari Airlines’s Malaysian unit, Malindo Airways, on May 17, followed by a second shortly after. Lion is the largest 737 MAX customer, with 201 orders, one more than Southwest Airlines, which plans to begin flying the plane in October.

The aircraft would include four F-35C Joint Strike Fighters made by Lockheed Martin, four CMV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft made by Bell and Boeing, six P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and 10 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet strike fighters, both made by Boeing. Lawmakers received the 48-item list, which contains equipment, weapons, development and operations equipment and maintenance assets totalling $4.8 billion, on May 30. The list items were not included in last month’s $171.5 billion fiscal budget for 2018. © AFP 2017/ MLADEN ANTONOV Trump Nominates Richard Spencer to Be US Navy Chief The fact that no ships are included on the list comes as surprise, as US President Donald Trump made a larger Navy one of his top defense planks on the campaign trail and the Navy called to expand the fleet from 270 ships to 355. If the expansion is enacted, the Navy would see the largest shipbuilding boom since the end of the Cold War, ideally creating tens of thousands of jobs for sailors. Navy Times quoted then-Senator Jeff Sessions at the time saying, "Trump's plans are actually to build more ships and maintain a higher number of troops and aircraft. It will go a lot further than words to convince the world that we remain strong. It will help us to maintain the peace." Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America, said in early January. "Russia and China are going to continue to build up their navies … The complexities aren’t going to get any easier. The Navy, more than any of the services, is our forward presence. We’re going to need this Navy."  © AP Photo/ Northrop Grumman US Navy Orders Another $244Mln Worth of ‘Vehicle Spares’ for $1Trln F-35 Last month, acting Navy Acquisition Chief Allison Stiller said the White House supports buying two additional Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), as the Navy’s 2018 request only called for one. She said at the time, "The administration recognizes the criticality of our industrial base and supports funding a second LCS in FY-18," though she did not clarify how the new vessels would be paid for. Although there are no ships on the unfunded list there is a request for $312 million for five ship-to-shore connectors made by Textron and $84 million for upgrades to the LCS survivability and lethality capabilities. The Navy also asked for $110 million for a new LCS training facility in Florida at Naval Station Mayport and $31 million for the development of the ships’ over-the-horizon capabilities. ...

(Northrop Grumman) SEATTLE (The Seattle Times/TNS) - For a vital aircraft that will fly above distant battlefields, the Air Force will choose between Goliath and two Davids. One is a jet originally designed to carry around 135 passengers, the two others built to carry fewer than 20 people. With a $6.9 billion deal on the line, a militarized version of Boeing’s 737 jet is going up against the Gulfstream G550 and the Bombardier Global 6000 high-end business jets for a special-mission contract to be awarded as early as this fall. The 17 JSTARS jets at issue will be stuffed with high-tech military radar and computer-analysis equipment. The planes are heavily used in combat zones for surveillance of ground forces and to target enemy positions. The current JSTARS fleet is now active in strikes on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Chicago-based Boeing, which has a big presence in the Seattle region, hopes a JSTARS win could incline the Air Force to choose the 737 to replace more than 100 different types of special-mission aircraft in its inventory, contracts that are lucrative far beyond the mere number of 737s involved. But the competition from Savannah, Ga.-based Gulfstream and Canada’s Bombardier is formidable. For special missions, air forces around the world are increasingly selecting business jets that fly higher, faster and further than airliners. The U.S. Air Force initially chose the Gulfstream for a separate electronic-jamming plane code-named Compass Call, although Boeing in May formally challenged that process. Fred Smith, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing Military Aircraft, dismisses the business jets as “a great solution for countries with smaller air forces and navies.” As for the U.S., he said, “for a bigger mission, you need a bigger airplane.” In a conference room inside Boeing’s former Space Center in Kent, Wash., now a hive of different defense programs, a reporter donned a virtual-reality visor to take a look at a mock-up of the jet maker’s 737 JSTARS contender. JSTARS stands for Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. It’s a joint Air Force and Army system, revolving around a massive, long-range radar that monitors what’s happening on the ground in a battle zone. The virtual mock-up shows the radar hidden in a canoe-shaped bump about 20 feet long under the jet’s fuselage. Inside the virtual airplane, operators seated at 10 stations toward the rear of the aircraft monitored large computer screens, analyzing the radar data and communicating with U.S. forces. Aft of the stations, large metal cabinets housed the computer servers and other equipment. Forward of them was a robust printer and a “mission table,” with a tabletop computer display screen of the battle zone. At the front of the cabin, immediately behind the flight deck, was a crew rest area for long-endurance missions and extra seats. Then Smith showed off a Boeing marketing trick, designed to impress upon the Air Force why size matters. With a click of a button, an arc of light sliced through the virtual cabin, superimposing upon Boeing’s mock-up another cabin wall that cut off half the computer stations. “That’s the G550 fuselage,” Smith said. The Air Force plans to weigh the cost, risk and performance of the three proposals on offer and choose the JSTARS replacement by year end. If Boeing were to win, the necessary military modifications to the airframe would likely be done during final assembly on the Renton, Wash., production line — perhaps even on the same dedicated military line now churning out the P-8s. Where Boeing would then install the mission equipment, the radar and all the computers, is unclear. Still, for Renton, a Boeing JSTARS win would be significant and worth more than just 17 airplanes. It would indicate a high likelihood of further special-mission aircraft contracts later. First though, Goliath has to beat the Davids.

With the defence budget under huge pressure, losing these expensive skills when people leave the military is not only costly, it means hard-won experience that could be handed down to newer pilots also goes. Inzpire, a company founded just over a decade ago by three ex-servicemen, has found a business opportunity in this problem. It takes older, veteran pilots who are leaving the forces and re-employs them as instructors on the Apache. Inzpire’s civilian pilots, focused at Middle Wallop airfield in Hampshire, home to the Army Air Corps, work with serving instructors to make students competent at operating the hugely complex Apache in all weathers, day or night. One of the more famous pilots to go through Middle Wallop is Prince Harry. Chris Raynes, helicopter services project lead at Inzpire, has logged 4,500 flight hours and completed tours in Libya and Afghanistan in the Apache while on active service. Prince Harry, known as Captain Wales in the British Army, flew Apaches during his deployment in Afghanistan But a young family meant he felt it was time for a change, and he left the forces almost five years ago. “We’re here to provide the real experience of flying the aircraft type,” he says. “Most people coming here are where we were 10 or 15 years ago. Our aim is to try to capture the experience that would otherwise be lost.” Jonny Priest, Inzpire’s head of helicopter services, adds: “Students want to be inspired by a guy who has flown thousands of hours and knows what it’s like. They want to hear what doing a dust landing in Afghanistan is like and how to handle it.” The arrangement require trust on both sides. The Army is effectively handing over to a civilian the responsibility of flying a multi-million pound helicopter to teach a student army pilot. At the same time, Inzpire has to know it has the full support of the forces to make the project attractive: the company’s instructors could earn more flying civilian helicopters if they chose to. Inzpire is keen to point out that it is working in partnership with the military and is not about to take over completely all flight training. “We could not and would not want to,” says Priest, a former RAF Chinook pilot who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his involvement in the successful mission to rescue British soldiers kidnapped by rebels in Sierra Leone in 2000. The Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter 01:35 Inzpire took over the contract to help teach Apache pilots in 2012. Over the five years the current deal is due to run, it expects to see about 90 students go through the system. The civilianisation of jobs and work that would have been carried out by serving personnel is not new. UK law means civilians cannot fight. But big defence contractors such as BAE, Babcock, Boeing and Lockheed Martin have been involved in training service staff and maintaining military equipment for decades. The concept received a push after the cost-cutting defence review of 2010 called “Whole Force”, which called for industry and reservists to fill the gaps caused by a shrinking defence budget. One of the consequences was more smaller companies pushing into the sector. Hugh Griffiths, chief executive of Inzpire and a former Tornado jets weapons instructor, welcomes the Government’s target of putting a third of its multi-billion spending on procurement through SMEs, up from the current level of 19pc. “The forces are thoroughly disenchanted with dealing with the big prime contractors, who aren’t delivering,” he says. “If our guys have to go live in a hole in the ground on Salisbury Plain with students on training operations, we’ll do that. We are offering flexibility, and making sure valuable experience isn’t lost.” Inzpire also provides software systems to the Ministry of Defence, but training is the bulk of its business. This does not only involve teaching students how to fly: the company provides pilots who control “virtual” aircraft in exercises, such as events where ground and air forces learn how to work together in complex and often confusing digital battlefields, and it also teaches mission planning. A Chinook Mk IV followed by an Apache flying over London as part of a fly past to commemorate the end of Britain's involvement in Afghanistan Budget cuts have forced the MoD to adapt to defence spending that is now just 2pc of GDP. “When I joined my first squadron in 1990, defence spending was close to 5pc of GDP,” Griffiths says. “There was lots of capacity and the military did everything.” Today, he says, “operational demand is up but capacity is down. Someone has to do it for them, and we were ‘them’ for 20 years, until we left.” While Inzpire is a very niche player compared to the defence giants (it has just over 100 staff, the bulk of them ex-forces, and generates annual revenues of about £10m) it does have hopes to expand. Griffiths says he cannot imagine the company growing beyond 300 staff, but it is positioning itself with much larger partners for a UK contract that could see privately owned fighter aircraft training against the RAF’s jets. There is great scope and reason for industry to take on more work from the military, according to Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, which represents Britain’s aerospace, defence and security sector. “Whole Force is about flexibility, allowing frontline staff to do frontline activity, with industry supporting them,” he says, though adding that there have been “good and bad examples of it”. Worries about liabilities mean smaller companies are put off from bidding for work in the first place, Everitt says, while others are deterred after developing a new technology or system for the military, only to see the contract re-awarded, taking their intellectual property with it. The military sees both benefits and problems from Whole Force. In a paper on the concept, the chief of the general staff, General Sir Nick Carter, said it can provide “access to a wider pool of personnel with specialist skills” and is “a viable method of acquiring specialists or surge capacity that we do not wish to maintain continuously”. However, he cautioned, industry does not maintain “spare capacity” that can be thrown at sudden requirements, adding: “despite the hype, non-regular solutions seldom represent better value for money”. One contract where the system is working well is maintaining the RAF’s fleet of Typhoon jets. BAE Systems and Leonardo (formerly Finmeccanica) are a year into a decade-long, £2.1bn deal where they provide heavy maintenance to the fighters. An RAF Typhoon FG R4 taking off from Akrotiri en route to Iraq or Syria “Instead of servicing them every 400 or 500 hours, we have been able to push it out to 600 in some cases and may be able to go to 750. It means less time in the hangar,” says Richard Hamilton, BAE’s director of the contract. Perhaps the biggest worry over the civilianisation of military work is that the forces will lose the ability to support themselves. But Hamilton says: “The RAF controls all forward activity. Any skills they require in theatre are there, they still have the trained people who can do the job.” Inzpire’s Raynes adds: “It’s a fine balance. If we were too forward-leaning we might as well be back in the military. We try to be the same but we are not a manpower substitution. “People can’t quite comprehend what we do, civilians flying Apaches, but we are passing on experience to the next generation.” Share this article Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn Related Topics Defence industry Boeing Prince Harry British Army Royal Air Force BAE Systems Afghanistan Ministry of Defence Iraq Syria Show more Galleries Gallery 02 Jun 2017, 4:30pm Gallery: Nine things you could buy with this week's £131m EuroMillions jackpot Gallery 30 May 2017, 6:46pm Gallery: Ten things you didn't know you could do on Amazon Gallery 26 May 2017, 4:15pm Gallery: Apple Park: Apple's new 'spaceship' campus - in pictures Business latest 05 Jun 2017, 12:01am Another slice of Domino's Pizza set for London listing 05 Jun 2017, 12:01am Manufacturers shrug off economic fears as export orders continue to flow 04 Jun 2017, 10:27pm The week ahead in business and finance 04 Jun 2017, 10:19pm SEGRO to embark on major development programme 04 Jun 2017, 10:13pm Big business eyes collaboration to combat dearth of innovation 04 Jun 2017, 10:01pm BMI Regional ‘actively considering’ replacing quarter of fleet with larger craft 04 Jun 2017, 9:55pm Comment: Trump is correct: German surplus is bad news for everybody else Roger Bootle Premium 04 Jun 2017, 9:01pm Global recovery drives World Bank triple growth upgrade for UK economy 04 Jun 2017, 7:22pm AO World set to reveal consumer confidence at annual results 04 Jun 2017, 7:06pm Italy faces borrowing shock when ECB removes support, warns Pimco 04 Jun 2017, 7:00pm Car industry hopes for recovery after sales plunge on new tax on emissions  04 Jun 2017, 6:58pm Mars bars, Ford GT40s and David Brent: The Slough Trading Estate as it nears 100   04 Jun 2017, 6:29pm Biometric data and fingerprint scans could help India get its records straight 04 Jun 2017, 2:20pm Ocado finally strikes first overseas deal 03 Jun 2017, 7:45pm Theresa May wins over economists as Corbyn risks taking UK 'back to the 1970s' 02:28 03 Jun 2017, 7:44pm General election 2017: City braced for market jitters 03 Jun 2017, 7:44pm British Airways owner IAG urged to add IT experts to board 03 Jun 2017, 7:44pm Brexit boosts BT pension fund assets by £7bn 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Investor warns Tesco its backers disapprove of Booker takeover 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Price comparison site Kelkoo takes Google to High Court over abuse of search dominance 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Wood Group wins support for Amec bid despite fraud concerns Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We've noticed you're adblocking.

This school was located in Seattle’s de facto segregated Japantown. The majority of the student body were ethnic Japanese. We never thought this was unusual. In fact, we thought all Seattle schools were like ours, including our area of immigrant Asians, Italians, and Jews. Of course, growing up with immigrant parents, our first language was Japanese. Since Kaz and I were most deficient in English, we were enrolled in a remedial class. This was the forerunner of today’s ubiquitous “English-as-a-second language” classes. When Kaz married Setsu, it was evident to me that she was speaking more like an average White. Not like Kaz and me speaking with a distinct ethnic accent, growing up within Japantown. This was due, I believe, to the fact that Setsu losther mother during her adolescence and was raised in a foster home of a Swedish/English family in Portland, OR. They, of course, spoke the distinct West Coast English, avoiding the dialect of the South, New England, or the Midwest. Recently, I was searching through some old family albums. To my surprise I found a Christmas card from Kaz before World War II. Nothing special about this, except having had it for so long. Kaz must have been about 10 or 11 at that time. Now, of course I’ve misplaced it and can’t find it. In 1942, Kaz and I were incarcerated at Minidoka concentration camp with other Seattle Japanese Americans. We enrolled for high school. The school wasn’t like Seattle’s brick-and-mortar buildings. It used the same block of shiplap barracks that were built to confine us. Picnic-style tables with fixed seating boards on either side were our desks. When we filled out the enrollment sheet for freshman class, it asked for our choice of vocation. Kaz knew exactly what he was shooting for – engineer. I had no idea of ever going to work or what I wanted to become, so I copied Kaz, and wrote – engineer. (Today, by the 1st grade, millennials knew exactly what they wanted to be – computer programmers) Kaz and I were both enrolled in the same math class. The problem was that he and I were the only two boys in that class. The rest were girls. I had to bust my butt to keep from looking stupid next to Kaz, who was a wiz in math. But, I think when we first went down to Reno, I figured the odds in playing blackjack better than he did. All of Kaz’s siblings were Nisei (U.S. born), except him. His pregnant mother had to make an urgent trip to Japan at the time, giving birth to Kaz over there. When they returned to America, Kaz of course became an alien ineligible for naturalization. This restriction applied to all non-White Asian immigrants until 1952. This didn’t stop Kaz from being drafted. After he was discharged from U.S. military service, I thought he was automatically a U.S. citizen, as it is today. No, he told me he became naturalized only after passing the standard Americanization test. Later, Kaz became an engineer at Boeing, and I was there as a graphic designer. I remember an assignment from Boeing Public Relations. It was to provide graphic support to Rainier Beach High School. It involved designing graphic patterns to fill up the blank walls of their hallways. Two of our artists laid out floor plans of all the walls, the mural designs based on the school icon “Vikings,” and the school colors. They provided full-size traceable layouts. After the mural design was approved by the school PTSA, members of their student body executed the project. They enthusiastically stenciled and painted the mural layouts on the wall, allowing them full involvement and proud ownership of the project. How was this project initiated? Setsu, as Rainier Beach High PTSA president, wrote the letter that persuaded Boeing to support this project — no easy task, when most requests that they receive had to be declined by Boeing as a practical matter. After all, Boeing’s mission is to build airplanes. Setsu, showing great initiative, is most deserving of this credit. But, how did she pull it off? Most Japanese Americans incarcerated for three years in an American concentration camp had become extremely introverted like Kaz and I. Growing up as racialminorities we began life being quiet, reserved and reticent. Whereas Setsu, raised in a White family, I believe reinforced her to think “White” and absorb the gumption to step forward to take leadership, in spite of also having been incarcerated. Very well done, Setsu. And, congratulations Kaz for marrying Setsu. This is written in memory of Setsu Tanemura who passed away on March 26, 2017, and Kaz Tanemura who passed away on April 15, 2017. [Editor’s Note] Yukio Tazuma was born in Seattle and lived in the Puget Sound region almost all of his life, except for the three years he was confined in the Minidoka concentration camp in Idaho with other Japanese Americans during World War II. Before his retirement, he worked as a graphic artist at The Boeing Co. He can be reached at ydentsuma@gmail.com 0 Share Share Tweet Previous Post Flavor of Spring : Sansai Okowa made EASY!

And private initiatives, rather than governments, are at the forefront against climate change Media outlets around the world have come down harshly on President Trump’s decision to pull the United States from the Paris climate agreement. Critics are somehow implying that Trump is taking the US back to the age of belching smokestacks, unclean air and dirty water — a criticism which is inherently dishonest and not rooted in reality. The truth is that Trump’s decision is not quite so apocalyptic, and may even have a more positive overall impact to climate change than if the US stayed in the Paris agreement. Hazy accord First, Trump is not against the environment. A lifelong businessman who has built the world’s most luxurious resorts, golf courses and clubs knows better than most people that clean surroundings are essential to attracting a steady clientele — and that this can only happen if the environment is regulated. Let us not forget that all the expansive environmental laws in the US are still very much in place. The main problem with the Paris accord is it has several flaws. Two years ago, delegates could not agree on how soon each nation should cut greenhouse gas emissions, so they decided to cut them “as soon as possible”, with no fixed date set. Further, commitments made by each country in the 195-member agreement are voluntary and non-binding. But pledges without enforcement are meaningless. If a country fails to meet its goal, it is not punished but is simply allowed to restate its new goal the next time the elite club meets in some other world city five years hence. And even then, the new goals are voluntary. This is an accord? The Paris deal was a mirror reflection of the hubris of its leaders. If it was that critical to humanity, why did Obama not deem the accord as a treaty and submit it for formal ratification by the US Senate which would have then bound the US and Trump to the agreement? The simple reason was that Obama knew he could never obtain the 67 votes to get the accord ratified, with many senators in his own party opposed to the deal. The accord’s language is so unserious, so non-binding and so kid-gloved that it could never pass muster as a crucial international treaty, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Even under President Clinton, an avowed environmentalist (Al Gore was his Vice-President), the US Senate never ratified the Kyoto protocol. Finally, the agreement required rich countries like the US to subsidise other countries with technology and financing to limit GHGs with direct cash contributions. Trump won in coal country, and promised that he would help revitalise this region by opening up export markets and creating jobs. Why would he help shut the US coal industry down by authorising American tax dollars to be given to China so that it would burn less coal, when the US is $20 trillion in debt already? Google’s Pichai, Facebook’s Zuckerberg and Microsoft’s Stone all issued statements criticising Trump, and asserting that their companies would do what it takes to combat climate change. Private initiatives This is the key part of the story that is not being reported. The private economy, driven by free-market spirit, will do excellently well where governments cannot. Consider the Boeing 787 aircraft, the world’s most advanced, environmentally friendly, lightweight, fuel-efficient plane ever built. With over 1,200 orders to date, the model has outsold every other wide body model in aviation history. Boeing’s success preceded Paris and was not because of the accords. Market forces nudged Boeing to offer such a product because the world’s airlines demanded it, and not doing so would mean ceding its leadership to Airbus. Already, US emissions from both static and mobile sources have been going down significantly because of innovation. Facebook and Google operate zero energy data centres. Hybrid cars and improved engine designs have greatly helped improve fuel economy rates of the US’ automobile fleet. Technological advances in alternate forms of energy such as wind, solar and wave have made them cost competitive with traditional fossil fuels, certainly coal. The US’ abundant natural gas supplies — unlocked due to fracking technologies, another American innovation — are creating so much pressure on the price of coal that there is no meaningful future for the US coal industry, anyway. Climate change is of course real. But countries and their private economies can fight this largely on their own because the benefits are immediate, significant and local. We do not need a colourful global agreement, with clinking champagne glasses, to guide our way forward.

Photo: PTI. India is all set to launch communication satellite GSAT-19 into space today using a monster rocket. The satellite launch vehicle--the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (GSLV Mk-III)--is the heaviest rocket till date. Its weight is equal to that of five fully-loaded Boeing Jumbo Jets or as much as 200 fully grown elephants. "All activities for our GSLV-Mark III launch tomorrow are going on in Sriharikota, expecting launch at 5:28 pm," said AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Sunday. The ISRO chairman called the launch an important event as it will help India put communication satellites into space from its own soil. The GSAT-19's successful launch will pave the way for the launch of GSAT-11--a heavier communication satellite--into the space in the near future. HERE IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE GSAT-19 AND GLSV-MARK III LAUNCH: The GSLV-Mark III in its first developmental flight will carry communication satellite GSAT-19 weighing 3,136 kg from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. The GSLV-MK III-D1 is a three-stage vehicle with two solid motor strap-ons, a liquid propellant core stage and a cryogenic stage (C25). If successful, the single GSAT-19 satellite will be equivalent to having a constellation of 6-7 of the older variety of communication satellites in space. Currently, of the 41 in-orbit Indian satellites, 13 are communication satellites. While the size of the rocket/launch vehicle is being talked about, it is the satellite--GSAT-19--that is billed as the real game-changer. According to experts, the satellite can be the first to provide "Internet services using a space-based platform". Internet services may not be unleashed immediately but what the country is putting together is a capability in place which is important especially to connect places that are literally off the fibre optic Internet backbone. Weighing more than three tonnes, the GSAT-19 satellite is the heaviest satellite made and launched from India, and is the test bed for several new technologies. The GSAT-19 will be powered for the first time with indigenously-made Lithium-ion batteries. Similar batteries can be later used to power electric vehicles like cars and buses. According to ISRO, the GSAT-19 "carries a Geostationary Radiation Spectrometer (GRASP) payload to monitor and study the nature of charged particles and the influence of space radiation on satellites and their electronic components". The GSAT-19 also features a miniaturised heat pipe, fibre optic gyro, Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometer. These new features are being tested with GSAT-19 and can go on to become an intrinsic part of the systems on future missions. The GSAT-19 will not have transponders, and instead it will beam data using multiple frequency beams. According to experts, this feature will also let the satellite beam more data to the ISRO.

This month alone he has spent $3.5m chartering a flight for trips to Singapore and Cancun in Mexico. Source: Jet-setting Mugabe spends $3.5m to charter plane to Singapore, Mexico | News24 Harare – This is why he’s known as Zimbabwe’s ‘visiting president’: so far this year Robert Mugabe has spent more days outside the country he’s ruled for 37 years than he’s spent at home, it’s been reported. Until May 27, when Mugabe got back from a week-long jaunt to Mexico, the president had spent 77 days outside the country, reports the Standard. Only 69 days had been spent at home. Luxury Boeing Mugabe, 93, recently had to charter a luxury Boeing as the Air Zimbabwe plane he usually uses is grounded for servicing. The paper said Mugabe began his 2017 travels on January 17, while still on official leave in Dubai, with a trip to China. 9 countries, 3 continents Since then, the paper estimates he’s covered 145 000km, and clocked a staggering 250 hours in the air. Countries he has so far visited on three continents include China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Mauritius, Singapore (twice), South Africa, Swaziland and Mexico. The Zimbabwe Independent, a respected business weekly, estimates that this month alone the president spent $3.5 million chartering a plane for trips to Singapore and Cancun in Mexico. $1 million for 4 days The paper identified the plane as a Comlux Aviation Boeing 767. “It costs one million US dollars to hire the plane for four days so Mugabe paid that when he went to Singapore,” an unnamed aviation source told the paper. “The plane also attracted close to half a million dollars in charges when it was parked for six days, from May 13 to May 18 while the cabin crew was at a local hotel. Mugabe paid close to 2 million US dollars for the nine days the plane took him to Mexico.” President pays  But transport minister Joram Gumbo, while declining to disclose the amount spent on the Mexico trip, suggested that chartering a plane is no more expensive than flying Air Zimbabwe. “Air Zimbabwe is used at cost and the rates are the same. Every last penny is paid for by the president’s office,” he told the paper. Large entourage Mugabe invariably travels with a large entourage, including state media journalists who get paid daily expenses in scarce foreign currency. Critics say the country gains nothing from these expensive trips. Share this: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email More Google Reddit No related posts.

But Joram Gumbo the Honourable Transport Minister must be the most silly of that lot. If you don’t believe me look what he says here… “But transport minister Joram Gumbo, while declining to disclose the amount spent on the Mexico trip, suggested that chartering a plane is no more expensive than flying Air Zimbabwe. “Air Zimbabwe is used at cost and the rates are the same. Every last penny is paid for by the president’s office,” he told the paper.” Where does he think that the “Presidents Office” get its money from. From the sky? From the West? From the East? From Mugabe? No you silly man, from the people of Zimbabwe, while they go hungry, homeless and cold while Mugabe and all his many high spending jet setter cohorts are gallivanting (and often staggering) all over the World doing bogger all… Waken up Joram and admit to what is happening. Just dream of your many deep potholes that US$ 3.5 million could have mended! Reply ↓ Farai May 31, 2017 The minister has now just proven that this is tax payers money by saying ” Every last penny is paid for by the president’s office” – the presidents office is solely funded by taxpayers and therefore when our country is burning Mugabe sees it fit to spend millions of tax payers dollars just so he can play around overseas. Reply ↓ Fallenz June 4, 2017 Agreed. But, someone backed the communist insurgency. Someone chose to pick up weapons and join the fight. Someone killed and maimed innocents with market bombs. Someone put Mugabe in charge. Someone has used violence to keep him in power. Now, I ask… who are those “somebodies”..? Let them step forward and explain how stupid they were. Let them tell us they did not understand that this is how communist-inspired governments work. Let them explain how a communist economy works that provides jobs and opportunities for income, food, and fees for school. Let them explain how one man can steal and squander so much from people who have nothing left. Let those valiant somebodies speak… or let them hide in shame.

President Moon looks set to push ahead with his ideas to reform the military and eradicate corruption -- in particular the dubious connections between the military procurement agency and arms vendors.   “We have to use (the ongoing THAAD scandal) as an opportunity to root out irregularities in military acquisition deals that have brought enormous disappointment to the people,” said Rep. Kim Young-ho of Moon’s governing Democratic Party who is a member of the parliamentary defense committee.  Former security chief Kim Kwan-jin(left) and President Moon Jae-in. Yonhap Topping the list of “irregularities” would be the previous Park Geun-hye administration’s controversial decision to purchase 40 F-35 stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, as part of the country’s next-generation fighters procurement project. Despite the fact that Boeing’s F-15 Silent Eagle had been initially selected as a sole candidate for the project, then Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin, who held the final say over the procedure as a chairman of defense acquisition council, ordered a review of the biding process and selected F-35 in the end. Since April, the nation’s Board of Audit and Inspection has been looking into allegations that Lockheed Martin failed to fulfill its agreement, part of the 7.3 trillion won F-35 deal, to transfer technology to South Korea so that it can build its indigenous aircrafts. Another issue could be the collusion scandal surrounding Korea Aerospace Industries, South Korea’s sole aircraft manufacturer, which produces indigenous air fighters, including supersonic aircraft T-50. In 2015, KAI was accused for creating a slush fund worth of 5.2 billion won ($460 million) and bribing military and political figures with gift vouchers. About one-third of the fund was allegedly used for lobbying efforts. KAI has denied the allegation. Since taking office, President Moon has made eradicating corruption in military on his top priority, describing it as a “deep-rooted evil” that has plagued the country’s national security and readiness posture.  “We will never tolerate irregularities over defense acquisitions,” Lee Soo-hun, a member of Moon’s de facto transition team, said on May 25 after receiving a report from the Defense Acquisition and Procurement Agency. “The issue is so import that we decided to have a (separate) briefing session…Over the past years, the military has found itself in the hot seat from a series of procurement scandals. Now is the time to find ways to fix past wrongdoings and ensure military discipline.” Defense Minister Han Min-koo (left) and Kim Kwang-jin (second from right), former President Park Geun-hye’s chief security adviser, is seen with President Moon Jae-in (right). Yonhap The Moon administration is not the first government that sought to overhaul the scandal-ridden military procurement process, mostly dominated by a revolving door of the defense ministry, acquisition agency and military contractors. In 2014, former President Park ordered a massive probe into dubious military contracts following public outrage over Navy salvage ship ”Tongyeong,“ which failed to participate in the rescue mission of the sunken Sewol ferry due to a malfunction. But the malfunction turned out to be a result of the collusion between the Defense Acquisition and Procurement Agency and former Navy captain, who received 400 million won in kickbacks to introduce a local supplier to DAPA official in charge of acquiring the ship.  The investigation team revealed that collusive practices were pervasive in various procurement contracts, ranging from the purchase of basic gadgets like body armor and rifles to high-tech ones such as submarines and helicopters.   Most of the corruption in procurement took place when each military branch raised its requirement to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which determine whether to approve the request and have DAPA carry out procurement, said defense officials. ”Every service chief has been so obsessed with their legacy. They tend to think of how many contracts were signed during their tenure as a measure to gauge their performance,“ an Air Force officer who worked for DAPA until last year said under the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. The majority of unlawful deals are made when the military signs a contract with domestic contractors, who supply the military with maintenance and upgrade components, not the foreign contractors such as the US government, who provide the whole weapon system under the restricted rule. According to the Park administration‘s 2014 investigation on the collusion in military procurement, the Navy topped the list for engaging in wrongdoings, with a total amount of illegal projects amounting to 840 billion won ($750 million). The reason is, acquisition officials and experts said, that the Navy’s procurement was mostly about purchasing components from domestic suppliers for maintaining and outfitting the warships, which suffered from frequent malfunctions during the operation. President Moon vowed to impose harsh punishment on those involved with procurement irregularities. On the campaign trail, Moon said that corrupted officials will face punishment equivalent to a treason charge and contractors would be permanently barred from bidding processes if they are found guilty of wrongdoings. Lockheed Martin`s F-35 stealth fighter. Yonhap ”If anyone were found to have engaged in acquisition collusion, they would face severe punishment equivalent to the punishment on treason,“ Moon said in April when he was a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party of Korea, which last year sought to enact a bill including a similar idea to Moon’s.  The president also vowed to enhance civilian oversight over the procurement process by granting more authority to economic branches and outside entities and encouraging more civilian participation in the government-led, procurement decision-making body. DAPA would be transformed into a body with more transparency and expertise. Created in 2006, the agency has been under scrutiny for a lack of military expertise, civilian oversight and collusion from revolving doors between its officials and contractors with a DAPA background. But too much control would lead to excessive regulation on the defense industry, one of the most lucrative export businesses for South Korea, analysts noted, warning against the possibility that the overhaul movement would be reduced to political bickering. For example, former President Park’s extensive investigation was criticized as a stunt to dive the people away from the Sewol tragedy as most of prosecuted high-profile generals were found innocent including former Navy chief Hwang Ki-chul, who is now on the list for the next defense minister or DAPA chief. “Procurement scandal is the result of a break-up in the cartel created decades ago between the government and defense industry,” said Yang Uk, senior research fellow at the Korea Security and Defense Forum. “To some extent, it was somewhat inevitable, taking place because of the change of the economy.” “Therefore, the issue should be seen from a broader perspective. We have to view it as a part of the effort to overhaul the military policy as a whole. Otherwise, investigation into the scandal could be subject to a political witch hunt.” By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@hearldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Seattle’s got the largest stockpile of nukes in the world. It’s sitting on roughly 1,300 nuclear warheads. The city is also home to tech giants, Amazon, Boeing and Microsoft. That makes it a prime target. Now, there’s a law on the books in Washington State that prevents planning for a nuclear attack. It allows for evacuation plans for every disaster scenario...except a nuclear bomb. There’s now a bill in the works to change that The state's top emergency planner says the law’s is not a big deal. Now, military experts say North Korea is about three years away from actually being able to hit the west coast with a nuke.

I ask you on behalf of Russia, and I appeal to the American side,” Putin said, “help the newly elected president, the head of the United States administration.” CNN reported that the audience included senior executives from Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Phillip Morris and Honeywell.

He said that the loss “harms everyone” and that Russia is “ready to support bilateral business projects, that include equal, constructive partnership and cooperation.” Putin insisted that he and Donald Trump “don’t know each other,” but that he views him as “a straight-forward, sincere man,” one that “you can’t really classify… as a traditional politician.” “This is a person with a fresh view of things,” the Russian President said. The comments came just one day after Putin suggested “patriotic hackers” from Russia may have meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and amidst the FBI investigation into the Trump administration’s possible collusion with Russian officials during the campaign.

But inside the ExpoForum convention center, where the event was held, the climate was totally different. For the second time in a row, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum was held outside the city's historic center. As a result, most Forum-related traffic moved further away from Russia's northern capital, making it easy for the participants to reach its historic sites – museums, churches and cathedrals, in their spare time. Some guests of the forum, like the participants of the Monaco-St. Petersburg rare vehicles rally, had a green light on their final stretch of journey to Russia. Members of the European dynasties and aristocracy drove their exotic vintage cars from Monaco all the way to the rally's finishing line at the SPIEF main venue.

Thank you Russia. This eventful visit witnessed several programmes and fruitful meetings. It will further boost India-Russia friendship. pic.twitter.com/XQQPplTyOm — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 2, 2017 © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov MC-21, Russia's Answer to Boeing, Performs Its Maiden Flight (PHOTO, VIDEO)India's pavilion was one of the largest at the SPIEF. The country's government launched a major national program designed to facilitate investment, foster innovation and enhance skill development. Together with Russian partners, the Indians are working on projects in industry, transportation, trade and agriculture, and St. Petersburg Forum is another chance for them to discuss their plans. Indian partners expressed interest in one of Russia's latest projects – the Irkut MC-21 civilian airliner, which made its maiden flight in the end of May. The majority of the plane;s parts were made in Russia. Rostec Corporation produced the avionics and other parts. The prototype was tested using foreign engines, but Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov told Sputnik that they would be replaced by Russian ones, built by a Rostec subsidiary – United Engine Corporation: "We're currently testing our own PD-14 engines. The tests will be finished by the end of this year and next year we're planning to launch mass production." Rostec CEO Chemezov about Russia's MC-21 plane:"We never made anything like this before.

We made avionics and other parts" pic.twitter.com/1RD56y2Lkv — Denis Bolotsky (@BolotskySputnik) June 3, 2017 Besides Indian companies, Russia's partners from Hungary and Bangladesh also expressed interest in purchasing MC-21 planes. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov Russia Reveals What the '21' in Its New MC-21 Airliner Really Stands ForSeveral years ago the US and European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia over the situation in Ukraine. For several years Barack Obama's administration has been warning large US companies not to send their representatives to St. Petersburg Economic Forum. Nevertheless, judging by this year's list of SPIEF participants and official partners, not to mention the number of deals signed during the event, Russia is far from international isolation. Rosneft and BP signed an agreement on cooperation in the gas industry. Gazprom and Royal Dutch Shell agreed on the main terms of their joint Baltic LNG project. Gazprom also struck a deal with Italy's Edison and Greece's DAPA on cooperation in creating a southern route for Russian gas supplies to Europe. Initially, the SPIEF was intended to become the analog of the World Economic Forum. It was first held in 1997 and attended by 1,500 participants. The forum has recently developed from a domestic event into a respected and highly representative international platform for discussing key economic issues in Russia and abroad. ...

An Ariane 5 rocket blasted off successfully from ESAs Spaceport in Kourou on Friday carrying a 10,865-kilo payload composed of two telecommunications satellites. The Arianespace mission with ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B is now underway following Ariane 5s liftoff from the Spaceport in French Guiana, a statement said. The ViaSat-2, weighing 6,418 kilograms (14,149 pounds) was the first to be released into its planned orbit 29 minutes into the flight. The 3,551 kilogram Eutelsat-172B was released 12 minutes later. ViaSat-2, built by Boeing and owned and operated by ViaSat, will provide broadband coverage to North and Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America, and the Atlantic Oceans aeronautical and maritime routes linking North America and Europe. The Via Sat-2 has a design life of over 14 years. Eutelsat-172B is an all-electric, high powered (13 kW,) satellite built by Airbus for the Eutelsat consortium to provide telecoms, broadcast services and in-flight broadband and maritime connectivity to the Asia-Pacific region. The 172B is the first fully electrically-powered satellite which no longer requires tons of fuel on board and thus has reduced its mass up to 40 percent. The satellite has a design life of over 15 years. This Ariane 5 record payload exceeds by 130 kg the previous record achieved in Aug. 2016 according to the ESA note. This mission is the third Ariane 5 launch of 2017 with a further four scheduled launches later in the year and the satellites were the 558th and 559th to be launched by Arianespace, a statement said.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

The 25 Best Time Travel Movies Paul Allen's Enormous Stratolaunch Carrier Aircraft Rolls Out of Hangar for First Time On a football field, the wingtips would extend beyond the goalposts by more than 12 feet on each side. Most Popular Stratolaunch Systems By Jay Bennett May 31, 2017 The gargantuan Stratolaunch carrier aircraft, built by Scaled Composites and nicknamed the "Roc," has the longest wingspan of any aircraft ever built: 385 feet from tip to tip. The six-engine mothership is designed to carry rockets between its two fuselages. Once at altitude, the mega-plane will drop the launch vehicle, which will then fire its boosters and launch to space from the air. .@Stratolaunch came out of the hangar for fuel testing. More pictures soon! pic.twitter.com/RCNgSpgG6W — Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) May 31, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It's a new way of approaching spaceflight, reminiscent of the X-plane testing the Air Force did in the 1950s and 60s, and Paul Allen's company Stratolaunch Systems is leading the way. The long aircraft just rolled out of the Scaled Composites hangar for the first time earlier today, May 31. Fueling tests will begin in the coming days, followed by engine runs, taxi tests, and finally first flight. Related Stories 13 of the Most Incredible Boeing 747s Replacing an 18,000-Pound Jet Engine at 40-Below Most Popular Stratolaunch Systems is still working on the rocket models that will be dropped from the carrier aircraft, but in October 2016 the company said it would use modified Pegasus XL rockets built by Orbital ATK for the first tests. In preparation for today's rollout, Scaled Composites spent the past weeks disassembling a three-story scaffold that surrounded the aircraft during construction. The aircraft's full weight rested on its 28 wheels for the first time, allowing Scaled Composites to weigh the almost entirely composite plane for the first time. It came in at 500,000 lbs. Stratolaunch Systems The big aircraft is designed for a maximum takeoff weight of 1,300,000 lbs., making the plane capable of carrying launch vehicles and their payloads weighing up to about 550,000 lbs., with 250,000 lbs. devoted to fuel. The first full launch test will use only one Pegasus XL rocket, but Stratolaunch has designed the system so up to three launch vehicles can be dropped during a single flight. The company will also look to expand the types of launch vehicles that are compatible with its carrier aircraft. Sign up for the Popular Mechanics Newsletter Please enter a valid email address.

Flightline testing will be conducted at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California over the course of several months, extensively testing all the systems of the new aircraft before flight. Stratolaunch is also preparing for delivery of the first Pegasus XL rocket to their facilities in Mojave. The new spaceflight company is on track to conduct the first launch test by 2019. Stratolaunch is betting on a new way to launch rockets and payloads to space, and it has completed its gigantic aircraft for the job, revealing it to the world for the first time. If the Roc can drive up launch efficiency and drive down price, it might just change the orbital game.

CNBC Here's how much we've spent in Apple's App Store Apple today revealed how much developers have earned through the App Store, and from this figure we can glean just how much users have spent on apps over the years. Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008.

The S&P 500 also managed a new all-time high, ending 0.37 percent higher. The Nasdaq outperformed, rising 0.94 percent to a record high. "This was the closest thing to a nonresponse you're going to see," said Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management. "This isn't a report that warrants a strong response in financial markets and I don't think you're going to get one." The Labor Department said 138,000 jobs were created last month, well below the expected 185,000. Wages also grew less than expected, with average hourly earnings rising at a 2.5 percent annualized rate. The unemployment rate, however, fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent. "There are some sectors in the jobs market that are seeing strong wage growth and others that aren't," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. "I think that's reflective of the tightness seen in some sectors. Chamberlain also noted the U.S. economy has added jobs for 80 straight months now, the longest positive streak dating back to the 1930s. "It's hard to ignore the the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected and, more importantly, the number came in below the 12-month average of 181,000," said Sharon Stark, managing director of fixed income strategies at Incapital. Load Error Investors eagerly awaited the report as it is one of the last major data sets released before the Federal Reserve holds its June monetary policy meeting. Market expectations for a rate hike were near 94 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "The fall in job growth numbers may make some query the likelihood of a rate rise next month, however, one slightly disappointing month does not constitute a wholesale change in fortunes," said Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, in a note. "This is not so much a downward trend away from the strong jobs market but merely a temporary blip on the radar," Samra said. Treasury yields fell on the back of the jobs number, with the benchmark 10-year yield slipping to 2.16 percent; it also hit its lowest level since May 18 earlier in the session. The dollar also dropped against a batch of major currencies, with the dollar index slipping 0.43 percent to 96.78. In turn, the euro rose 0.53 percent to $1.127 against the U.S. currency.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Ready to soar? Aviation Festival hoping to attract much-needed pilots By Sean Moody Published: June 2, 2017 7:15 p.m. Updated: June 2, 2017 7:25 p.m. + Leave a comment 1 of 14 View 14 Items Scott G Winterton, Deseret News Tara Hardinger and her children Kenner, Trinelle and Taggart watch as a plane takes off during the Skypark Aviation Festival and Expo at Skypark Airport in Woods Cross on Friday, June 2, 2017. The expo is Utah's largest annual aviation event. WOODS CROSS — Sunny skies this weekend will be perfect for the Skypark Airport Aviation Festival in Bountiful. Organizers hope it will attract lots of families to see the airplanes, but with demand growing for airline pilots, industry officials aim to use the event to lure future fliers. “There’s a unique opportunity for pilots right now,” said Matthew Schroeder, a captain for SkyWest Airlines who hopes to do some recruiting. That's because demand for pilots has spiked lately. According to a report issued by the Regional Airline Association, the major airlines will need to replace 18,000 pilots within the next few years as they reach the mandatory retirement age of 65. The report also notes a drop in new air transport pilot licenses, the highest certification given by the Federal Aviation Administration, which certifies pilots to fly commercial freight and passenger planes. Over the next 20 years, Boeing estimates North America will need 112,000 new pilots. “That demand is not going to go away. Those pilots are still going to be retiring at their mandatory age of 65, so there's still going to be those opportunities,” Schroeder said. The opportunities start in smaller planes like the ones at the festival. “Aviation is something everybody can do,” said Jason Clark, a flight instructor for Bountiful Flight. “We have $25 introductory flights today.” Bountiful Flight is one of several programs that have teamed up with SkyWest. Southern Utah University, Westminster College, Cornerstone Aviation Flight Schools and ATP Flight School are some of the schools across Utah that are part of the SkyWest Pilot Pathway Program. “You'll be a flight instructor, have a seniority number at SkyWest Airlines and as soon as you have your hours, you're on,” Clark said. They start out in small planes like a Czech Sport. Clark hopes safety features like a full-airplane parachute attract people. “We actually pick it up, bring it back, repack the parachute, and it'll be flying on our flight line again,” Clark said. Comment on this story As the crowds come to Bountiful for the festival Saturday, Schroeder and Clark hope to see them consider a career in the cockpit. “It is simply the best job in the world. There's no doubt about it,” Schroeder said. The festival runs from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Skypark Airport at 1887 S. 1800 West in Woods Cross. There will be aircraft manufacturers, universities, colleges, flight schools, aircraft manufacturers, food trucks, vendors activities and more. There will be skydivers at noon jumping into the airport, and SkyWest will be holding a career fair. Contributing: Viviane Vo-Duc Sean Moody Sean Moody is a reporter for KSL. Add a comment Like that?

Senior executives at the airline said it would use a $450 million bridge loan (`2,900 crore) to part fund the purchase. By: Malyaban Ghosh | New Delhi | Published: June 3, 2017 6:19 AM “The acquisition of these four Dreamliners was a part of the original acquisition plan of 68 aircraft from Boeing. With these, the fleet of 787s will go up to 27,” a senior official of Air India said. (Reuters) With a view to expanding international operations, Air India will add four Dreamliner aircraft to its fleet. Senior executives at the airline said it would use a $450 million bridge loan (Rs 2,900 crore) to part fund the purchase. The mandate for sourcing the loan has been given to Mashreque Bank and NABARD. The expansion of the Dreamliner fleet will help the airline operate on long haul routes. “The acquisition of these four Dreamliners was a part of the original acquisition plan of 68 aircraft from Boeing. With these, the fleet of 787s will go up to 27,” a senior official of Air India said. The first Dreamliner aircraft was inducted into the fleet in 2012 and the last one will come in October this year. The airline could opt for either the sale and lease back model or the direct finance model. Air India chairman, Ashwani Lohani, has observed aircraft should be purchased rather than sold and leased back. “Both direct purchase and sale and lease back model (SLB) have their advantages and disadvantages and we will need to consider these,” the official mentioned above, said. Watch this also: The Dreamliners form the backbone of the Air India’s fleet and will come in handy when the airline flies on the direct routes like Delhi- San Fransisco, Delhi – Madrid or the recently launched Delhi – Copenhagen. Currently, the average daily utilisation of the 787 is between 13 to 14 hours a day. Apart from the Dreamliners, Air India will also add a Boeing 777 wide body aircraft by January 2018. Currently, Air India is the largest operator of non stop flights to United States, United Kingdom and other European destinations. Almost 75% of the capacity of Air India is deployed on the international sector. The airline is in the process of inducting 14 A320 narrow body aircraft from Alafco, a Kuwait -based aircraft leasing company which will mostly replace the old narrow body aircraft deployed in the domestic sector. C CaptainGs Rathee Jun 3, 2017 at 8:06 pm Very very shameful.

Hans Kristensen at the Federal of America Scientists noted there have been several indications in recent years of a coming change. He said the military budget request for FY2018 “only lists the B-2 as carrier of the strategic nuclear gravity bombs.” “U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) apparently has not been assigning nuclear gravity bombs to B-52 bombers since at least 2010. Today, only the 20 B-2 stealth-bombers are tasked with strategic nuclear gravity bombs under the nuclear strike plans,” he explained. “The reason for the change appears to be that the B-52 is no longer considered survivable enough to slip through modern air-defenses and drop nuclear gravity bombs on enemy territory,” said Kristensen. “The B-52 is still equipped to carry the nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile (ALCM or AGM-86B), which can be launched from well outside the reach of air-defenses, and is scheduled to receive the new LRSO (Long Range Standoff Missile) by the late-20s (even though that’s probably unnecessary),” he wrote. According to Boeing, manufacturer of the B-52, the aircraft celebrated 60 years in the air in 2014. “The eight-engine, 390,000-pound (176,901-kilogram) jet was America’s first long-range, swept-wing heavy bomber. It began as an intercontinental, high-altitude nuclear bomber, and its operational capabilities were adapted to meet changing defense needs,” the maker said. “It had a rocky beginning. The original XB-52 design, selected by the Army Air Forces in 1946, was for a straight-wing, six-engine, propeller-powered heavy bomber. On Oct. 21, 1948, Boeing Chief Engineer Ed Wells and his design team were in Dayton, Ohio, when the Air Force’s chief of bomber development told them to scrap the propellers and come up with an all-jet bomber. Over the following weekend, in a Dayton hotel room, the team designed a new eight-engine jet bomber, still called the B-52, made a scale model out of balsa wood and prepared a 33-page report.” The result was the beginning of production and the turbofan-powered version. The most recent version made its first flight in 1961. A total of 744 were built in Seattle and Wichita, Kansas, and about 10 percent still fly. The B-52 cut the round-the-world speed record in half. In January 1962, it flew 12,500 miles nonstop from Japan to Spain without refueling. The jet broke 11 distance and speed records on that flight alone. The B-52 saw active duty in the Vietnam War and was used in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and over Afghanistan in 2001. The technology on the bombers constantly is being upgraded, and Boeing stated, “Modern engineering analyses showed the B-52’s expected lifespan extending beyond 2040.” For the rest of this report, and more, please go to Joseph Farah’s G2 Bulletin.

Regardless, North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun said Thursday that its military was "ready to conduct an ICBM test-fire at any time." During Tuesday's test, the U.S. military intercepted a mock intercontinental ballistic missile target fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California during a test of its Ground-based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, system. Besides California, the U.S. also has the GMD system deployed at Fort Greely in Alaska. The interceptor test took place a day after the North Korean regime fired its ninth ballistic missile test this year. Tuesday was only the 10th successful test out of 17 conducted since 1999. This week's test also was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM target. The test is seen as a sign the U.S. military is making progress to combat the mainland U.S. threat from North Korea. Still, the use of numerous decoy missiles or countermeasures by an enemy could overwhelm or confuse the interceptor system and render it useless. Russia and China already have developed countermeasures to increase the chance of a missile reaching a target. And the North Koreans also are believed to be developing similar capabilities, which creates additional national security concerns given Pyongyang's rapid advances in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. 'Many different ways' North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Friday quoted a military spokesman for the hermit state as saying the U.S. is "sadly mistaken if they think such missile interception system can prevent the shower of [a] nuclear strike." "There are many different ways that a missile can trick an interceptor," said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a think-tank based in Washington founded by former President Richard Nixon. There's an expectation that U.S. adversaries will intensify efforts to counter the GMD and other missile defense technology. Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted as much Thursday "This destroys the strategic balance in the world," Reuters quoted Putin as saying in remarks at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia. Added the Russian leader: "What is happening is a very serious and alarming process. In Alaska, and now in South Korea, elements of the anti-missile defense system are emerging. Should we just stand idly by and watch this? Of course not. We are thinking about how to respond to these challenges. This is a challenge for us." At the same time, China's semiofficial Global Times said this week that the interceptor test is proof the U.S. may be preparing for military action against North Korea and also that the technology "breaks strategic balance among nuke-armed countries." "The enhancement of America's missile defense capability will, in theory, undermine the effectiveness [and] efficacy of nuclear strikes launched by its main strategic rivals, thus consolidating its own domination," according to an op-ed Thursday on the Chinese military's official web portal. China believes the systems "will also stimulate other countries to develop strategic penetration technology at a faster pace or enhance their own strategic defense capability, which will exert a new impact on international security." Russia's and China's first-strike capability and their response capability are "neutered" by the U.S. missile defense, according to Ed Turzanski, an international policy and national security expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think-tank based in Philadelphia. "They believe they were put in a situation where they are going to have to counter that, and that's the age-old story of military capability," he said. Turzanski, who worked in the U.S. intelligence community in postings throughout Asia and Europe during the Reagan administration, noted that during the Cold War there was an agreement with the Soviet Union that limited the number of U.S. interceptor missiles on each side. That agreement ended when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. "We knew the minute you had the ability to knock my missile down, you had survivability and you could launch a first strike with impunity. We wouldn't tolerate it from them, they are not tolerating it from us." Read More Number of GMDs grow The U.S. hopes to have a total of 44 GMD interceptors available by the end of the calendar year, up from 36 today, but even with that amount there may not be enough interceptors to take out more than a dozen incoming ICBMs, according to experts. A group of senators last month introduced a bipartisan bill that seeks to bolster homeland missile defense and sharply increase the number of interceptors. The next test of the GMD interceptor system is scheduled for late 2018, according to the Missile Defense Agency. Boeing (NYSE: BA) is the prime contractor on the GMD program. The U.S. missile agency has received more than $120 billion since 2002 on the GMD missile defense system and it plans to spend an additional $37 billion through 2021 to further develop capabilities, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last month. Meantime, Russia and China also are concerned with the THAAD anti-ballistic missile systems deployed in South Korea. THAAD, a system manufactured by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. The controversial THAAD system is a mobile, ground-based system deployed about 130 miles south of Seoul, South Korea, to defeat North Korean missiles. However, its powerful radar gives the U.S. the ability to peer deep into both China and Russia and monitor military activities. Analysts suggest one way Russia could respond to the U.S. anti-missile technology is by increasing its cyberweapons targeting missile defense systems as well as pushing more space-based anti-missile solutions. Russia also could increase the number of fake missiles it has coming down on targets so more interceptors go to the wrong missile. "There are ways to trick the computer systems to think that there's a lot more missiles coming down on a target," said Kazianis. "The challenge here is that there's so many different ways to literally fake out the interceptor system." At present, the U.S. is considered ahead of Russia and China in developing space-based sensors and interceptor technology. Infrared sensors already are on satellites to detect missiles and the Pentagon is expanding efforts to develop a network of additional sensors in space and to experiment with kill capabilities from space. Laser weapons also show promise as part of a missile defense system. They have already been tested in manned aircraft and now development is underway in drones. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency's "long-term goal is to deploy lasers on high-altitude, long-endurance UAV platforms to destroy ICBMs in the boost phase at long standoff ranges," according to spokesman Chris Johnson. Several challenges remain, though, including overcoming the huge power requirements of laser weapons and the scale necessary to put the weapon technology on unmanned vehicles. General Atomics is working on a high-energy laser system for its UAVs that could be used for a range of uses, including missile defense as well as offensive capabilities. "The challenge there is getting the laser powerful enough while also to be light enough to fit on the back of a UAV," said Thomas Karako, a senior fellow at the International Security Program and director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think-tank. That said, Karako indicated that the laser-based UAV weapon would only be useful for the boost phase of a ballistic missile when it's most vulnerable and rising. The laser probably wouldn't be reliable to kill the missile warhead on its re-entry since at that phase it is designed to withstand intense heat.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoMore By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N), on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N). General Electric Co (GE.N) CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co (BA.N) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. Read More "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N). Blackrock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co (GM.N) said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's (F.N) new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

  News Magazines Events Industry Calendar Products   Home >> News: June 4th, 2017 >> Story Satnews Daily June 4th, 2017 ViaSat Celebrates Successful Launch and Even the First Signals from ViaSat-2  Successful launches are never taken for granted, and rightly so. That is why ViaSat enjoyed a celebration when the launch of ViaSat-2 was transported perfectly and the first signals from the satellite were acquired shortly thereafter.  ViaSat's Statement ViaSat Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT), a global broadband services and technology company, is pleased to announce the successful launch of its ViaSat-2 satellite aboard an Arianespace Ariane 5 ECA launch vehicle. The Ariane 5 ECA carrying ViaSat-2 lifted off yesterday, June 1 at 4:45 pm PDT from the Guiana Space Center, located in Kourou, French Guiana.  Approximately 29 minutes after liftoff, the ViaSat-2 mission was underway with the satellite separating from the launch vehicle. First signals from the satellite were acquired shortly thereafter through a ground station at Hassan, India. In the coming days, ViaSat-2 will start orbit raising with its chemical propulsion system, followed by solar array deployments, and will then switch over to its electric propulsion system to complete orbit raising over the coming months. ViaSat expects it will take several months for ViaSat-2 to reach its final orbital destination, located at 69.9 degrees west longitude. Mark Dankberg, ViaSat's chairman and CEO commented, "Today's successful launch is a momentous event in ViaSat's history. It represents the culmination of hard work, dedication and commitment to technical excellence from across the ViaSat team. We also want to recognize our launch team partners, Boeing and Arianespace, for their support and collaboration in helping us successfully launch ViaSat-2." ViaSat-2 is a geostationary satellite that operates in Ka-band frequencies. It was designed to offer high-capacity connectivity and wide coverage, with the flexibility to move capacity to where demand requires it. ViaSat-2 is expected to significantly improve speeds, reduce costs and expand the footprint of broadband services across North America, Central America, the Caribbean, a portion of northern South America, as well as the primary aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe. Dankberg continued, "The innovations in our ViaSat-2 spacecraft and underlying network will enable us to be one step closer to connecting the world, and delivering new higher speed fixed and mobility services that will continue to compete with traditional broadband services." "Arianespace is excited to have delivered for ViaSat!  We are proud to have launched one of the world's most advanced telecommunications satellites, ViaSat-2, safely to orbit. Great things are in store for our friends at ViaSat," said Stéphane Israël, CEO of Arianespace. "We are honored that ViaSat has put their trust in Boeing to build and deliver their next-generation satellite, ViaSat-2, a high-power 702 satellite with advanced capabilities that will help ViaSat connect millions around the world through high-speed broadband service," said Mark Spiwak, president, Boeing Satellite Systems International.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← Why is ISIS Operating in the Philippines? Police State in London → The Military-Industrial Complex is in Love with Trump Posted on June 4, 2017 by Katie New Eastern Outlook – by Steven MacMillan Trump’s first trip to a foreign country as US President was anything but dull. During his time in Saudi Arabia, there was sword dancing, glowing orb madness and a whole other host of strange behaviour. In between all of this weirdness however, there was one thing that was entirely orthodox for a US President to do when in Arabia: agree to arm the Saudis to the teeth. The US and Saudi Arabia sealed the largest arms deal in US history during Trump’s visit, a deal worth approximately $350 billion over the next decade, although Senator Rand Paul is expected to try and block a portion of the deal. Trump’s slimeball son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was heavily involved in the negotiations, reportedly helping to get the Saudis a better deal.   This agreement once again reveals that Trump will serve the military-industrial complex well during his reign in office, as the share price of the giant war contractors soared after news of the deal broke. In the words of the former US congressman and host of the Liberty Report, Ron Paul, the military-industrial complex was the special interest that gained the most from Trump’s Saudi visit: “This trip I would consider not a diplomatic trip. This was well-staged to serve a few special interests; and I would say the most powerful special interest that the President has kowtowed to would be the military-industrial complex. It’s up to 350 billion dollars over the next 10 years and who knows what, and Trump is just excited about this” (from 3:55 into the show).  The US-Saudi arms deal comes a month and a half after Trump launched 59 Raytheon-made Tomahawk cruise missiles at a military base controlled by the Syrian government, one of the main powers fighting against ISIS and associated ‘moderate rebels.’ The illegal military action led to an immediate surge in the value of Raytheon shares, as well as in the stocks of other war contractors whose technology was also used in the missile launch. Since Trump’s inauguration on the 20th of January, the former real estate mogul has clearly shown a prominent militaristic side, a side which elates the military-industrial complex. In fact, some of the giants of the military-industrial complex contributed to Trump’s record-breaking inaugural fund, with both Boeing and Lockheed Martin donating $1 million each, according to a US filing. Trump’s first prosed budget – for the fiscal year that begins on the 1st of October – is yet more confirmation that we can expect a continuation of the perennial wars under the ‘anti-interventionist’ commander-in-chief. The budget includes a 10% increase for the Pentagon (yes, the same Pentagon that couldn’t account for $6.5 trillion during the 2015 fiscal year), which will put the national security budget at over $600 billion if it is approved. To put that in perspective, Russia’s defence budget has been well under $100 billion for years, with the 2017 budget slashing defence spending to around $50 billion. Trump’s proposed budget also includes 100 Tomahawk cruise missiles from Raytheon, helping to replenish the ones used to strike a sovereign country that is at the forefront of the real war on terrorism. As I warned in an article published all the way back in August 2016, the idea peddled by Trump’s zealot supporters during the election campaign that Trump was somehow an anti-war, anti-interventionist candidate, was, and still is, total nonsense. Trump will continue the long tradition of US Presidents who pursued policies that enriched the military-industrial complex at the expense of an infinite number of human lives. Dwight D. Eisenhower’s warning over half a century ago could not have been more prescient, as the military-industrial complex is one of most powerful special interests that rules the US today. Unfortunately, Americans did not heed Eisenhower’s warning, which he expressed in his 1961 farewell address: “This conjunction, of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry, is new in the American experience. The total influence – economic, political, even spiritual – is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the federal government. We recognise the imperative need for this development, yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications… In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes Steven MacMillan is an independent writer, researcher, geopolitical analyst and editor of  The Analyst Report, especially for the online magazine “New Eastern Outlook”. http://journal-neo.org/2017/06/01/the-military-industrial-complex-is-in-love-with-trump/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the US withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest US retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the US at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost US economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for US goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

PHOTO | JEFF ANGOTE | NATION MEDIA GROUP  In Summary Mbuvi Ngunze joined Kenya Airways in 2011 as the chief operating officer before taking over from Titus Naikuni as the chief executive officer in 2014. As he leaves, the 49-year-old says he will miss the airline's staff and the adrenaline rush that comes with making tough decisions. Advertisement By ELVIS ONDIEKI More by this Author There is a “man in the arena” described by America’s 26th president Theodore Roosevelt whom former Kenya Airways chief executive officer Mbuvi Ngunze thinks is his mirror image. That man, Mr Roosevelt said in a famous speech, deserves all the credit because his work is not to criticise others but to take challenges head-on while in the arena. The man’s face is covered in dust, sweat and blood; he errs again and again knowing he will succeed at the end. “At the worst, if he fails, he at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat,” said President Roosevelt in his 1910 Citizenship in a Republic speech delivered after he left office. That Mr Ngunze used that quote as he closed a presentation during an official Kenya Airways (KQ) event a week before the end of his tenure as chief executive officer shows how much he identifies with the “man in the arena”. On Wednesday, Mr Ngunze left the hot seat of the airline that in recent years has been flying through turbulent times to Sebastian Mikosz, a Polish national, to continue the turnaround plan. In June and July, Mr Ngunze will serve KQ as a restructuring advisor before calling it a day. 'WELL-DESERVED BREAK' “After that I will take a well-deserved break. I’ll take three months off. I just want to take time off and then I can decide what the next step is. I don’t want to pre-empt anything at this moment,” he told the Nation. Mr Ngunze departs at a time when the troubled carrier has reduced its full-year net loss by more than half to Sh10.2 billion for the year to March. The loss reported in the last period was Sh26.2 billion. He joined KQ in 2011 as the chief operating officer before taking over from Mr Titus Naikuni as CEO on December 1, 2014. It has been a turbulent tenure but as he leaves, Mr Ngunze, 49, says he would miss the KQ staff the most, and the adrenaline rush that comes with making tough decisions, something he had to do often at the national carrier. Asked if there is one decision that was hard for him to make, he reckons that there were many, but the laying off of employees was always the toughest. “When you are making decisions around people, it is never easy — because you are actually impacting lives. But you know it’s not personal, it’s really for the betterment of the company. And we were very objective in making sure the people were handled with a lot of respect,” he says. CONTROVERSIAL CUTS The cuts at the airline were often controversial, stirring industrial action and court cases. As CEO, he would report to the office by 6.15am. He loved to start his day with a “passage or something that’s inspiring”. He would spend the rest of the day in meetings, conference calls and all, sometimes up to 8pm. When time allowed during weekends, he could be found playing golf at the Karen Country Club. He says his skills are above average, and to prove it points to his July 2013 win at the Citibank Corporate Golf Day where he beat 160 competitors. “I don’t get as much opportunity to play golf. I hope I’ll be able to enjoy a few more rounds of golf than I’ve had a chance to recently. Golf is therapeutic. Even when I’ve been busy at KQ, I’ve tried to get out and play some golf,” he says. At other times during weekends, you can find him in front of a television set worrying about Liverpool Football Club, a team that plays in the English Premier League. The wins and losses of his favourite football club, have offered lessons that he has applied in is managerial career, he says. 'WILL DELIVER' “You can’t always have your way. But what I tell my teams always is, ‘Hold your head high.’ If you know what your true north is, go in an unrelenting manner, because if you’re clear, you will deliver,” says Mr Ngunze. At times, he says, he was frustrated by the behaviour of some staff as he tried to steer the airline through troubled times. One low moment, he points out, was when the Kenya Airline Pilots Association demanded the sacking of the entire KQ senior management last year. “I don’t understand where they were coming from, particularly because we kept them fully informed of all the plans. And to be quite honest, it surprised me that knowing what we were doing internally, they were going against the grain,” says Mr Ngunze. Looking back, he believes with the benefit of hindsight his critics can now appreciate the efforts to change the fortunes of the airline. “I think they are probably eating humble pie right now because the reality is, the same things we were doing are the ones that are delivering results,” he says. In short, Mr Ngunze believes he leaves the airline on a firm path to recovery with the challenge now in the hands of Mr Mikosz and board Chairman Michael Joseph. The new CEO is known as a ruthless turnaround master. 'MORE AGILE' “KQ will be a more agile airline because the lessons of the last years really have driven much more around agility and the need to be very responsive in the context,” he says. Mr Ngunze, who was in the Alliance High School’s class of 1985 and the University of Nairobi’s class of 1990, started his career at PriceWaterhouseCoopers then went to Bamburi Cement in 1998 as finance manager before he moved to Hima Cement in Uganda, a subsidiary of the French industrial company Lafarge, in March 2002 as a managing director. In May 2006, he moved to the Lafarge headquarters in Paris. Three years later he was appointed general manager for Mbeya Cement, Lafarge’s branch in Tanzania. He left Mbeya Cement for KQ in 2011. A father of one, Mr Ngunze says his shift from Lafarge to KQ provided a whole new set of challenges, the biggest of which is the publicity his post brought. As the KQ chief executive, he was confronted by such issues as exploitative fuel hedging contracts, a weak shilling, poaching of staff by Middle East airlines, flight delays among others. Among the interventions he championed was to hire contractors to clean up the mess. He also pushed for the sale or leasing of some planes. REDUCED COSTS As per the 2016 report, KQ subleased three Boeing 777s and two Boeing 787s and sold two Boeing 777s, bringing fleet costs down by Sh14 billion to Sh15.5 billion. “The decisions about selling aircraft, assets which you’ve bought, were not easy because there is always the point that you don’t buy aircraft to sell them in our industry. But when you see the excess capacity we were carrying, I had to make that bold decision. And today we’re seeing the benefits of some of those decisions,” he says. Overall, he says, he is proud of his achievements, saying the results announced two weeks ago were “a manifestation of the hard work, the heavy lifting that the teams on the ground in KQ have been doing”. Mr Ngunze says even though some people still think the reduced losses announced recently are not good enough, “I always say this is a marathon and not a relay”. And like Mr Roosevelt’s “man of the arena”, he feels the KQ experience has not left any dent on his career as a manager. “Every experience shapes you and grows you. If anything, it makes you stronger,” he says. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” email print In the headlines Jubilee, Nasa clash over free education Raila says he will revamp economy, which Jubilee has run down.

Among the deals Modi and Putin oversaw on the third leg of the Indian leader's four-nation tour of Europe was the inking of an agreement for Moscow to build two more reactors at a nuclear plant in southern India. Modi is the guest of honour at this year's three-day Saint Petersburg Economic Forum -- Russia's answer to Davos -- that Putin wants to use to push the idea that Russia has turned the page on a brutal recession caused by low oil prices and sanctions over Ukraine. Speaking to journalists as the showcase kicked off, the combative Kremlin strongman insisted that measures against Moscow, including economic sanctions, had ended up having "zero effect". Putin said he hoped "Russophobia" in the West would "not last for too long, not forever, if only because the understanding has to come that it is counterproductive and harms everyone." He again struck out at allegations the Russian state was behind hacking attacks targeting elections in the West after accusations he meddled in the last year's US vote but did hold out the possibility that "patriotically minded" hackers might have been involved. "If they are patriotically minded, they start making their own contribution which they deem right in the fight against those who demean Russia," he said. "Theoretically this is possible. But we are not involved at the state level." - India ties - For the Kremlin, India represents the sort of major emerging market it wants to do more business with as it looks to insulate itself against geopolitical shocks with the unpredictable Donald Trump in the White House. "Russian-Indian economic cooperation is once again heading in the direction of growth and it is in our shared interests to strengthen this positive tendency," Putin said at a joint press conference with Modi. Russia and India enjoyed a decades-long alliance forged during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union was New Delhi's largest trading partner, diplomatic ally and main arms supplier, providing everything from tanks to aircraft. But the relationship became unmoored following the collapse of the USSR, as India underwent an economic transformation and increasingly sought to build trade ties with Western nations. - US businesses back?- While India is occupying pole position at the forum, other visiting international leaders include UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern. Bosses from Chevron, Exxon and Boeing are among 144 US firms at the event, the best attendance in years after Washington previously warned business leaders against attending due to political tensions. While Russia is talking up its recovery, the situation remains precarious and attention will also focus on talk of much-needed reforms to modernise its creaking economy. But analysts warned that with Putin likely to bid for another term as president in elections next year there are unlikely to be any radical changes. "Structural changes are necessary but to put them into action is not easy," Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.

The ViaSat-2 satellite system is expected to bring considerable improvements in terms of speed, lower costs and extended broadband coverage within its footprint, which includes North and Central America, plus the Caribbean, northern South America, and the aeronautical and maritime routes in the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe. For its sixth launch of the year, and the third Ariane 5 mission in 2017 from the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, Arianespace will orbit two satellites: ViaSat-2 for ViaSat Inc.; and EUTELSAT 172B for Eutelsat. This mission - the 237th overall by an Ariane launcher - will mark a new all-time Arianespace record for a total payload weight orbited: 10,865 kg., including a net mass at liftoff of 9,969 kg. for the two satellites. ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B are the 558th and 559th satellites to be launched by Arianespace. With this 289th mission by the Arianespace family of launchers (Ariane 5, Soyuz and Vega), Arianespace is serving global connectivity on Earth. The launch will be from Ariane Launch Complex No. 3 (ELA 3) in Kourou, French Guiana. The Launch Readiness Review (LRR) will take place on Tuesday, May 30, 2017 in Kourou, to authorize the start of operations for the final countdown. ViaSat-2 is the second ViaSat, Inc. satellite to be launched by Arianespace. The first was WildBlue-1 in 2006. ViaSat has publicly announced plans to launch a ViaSat-3 class satellite with Arianespace in the future - further extending the partnership between the two companies. ViaSat is changing the perception of satellite internet, globally. As a broadband services company, ViaSat has set out to advance global connectivity beyond what traditional telecom, wireless, cable or fiber could deliver, by solving one of the hardest communications problems: making the internet accessible and affordable to all. The ViaSat-2 satellite system was designed to offer high-capacity connectivity and wide coverage, with dynamic flexibility to move capacity to where demand requires it. The ViaSat-2 satellite system is expected to bring considerable improvements in terms of speed, lower costs and extended broadband coverage within its footprint, which includes North and Central America, plus the Caribbean, northern South America, and the aeronautical and maritime routes in the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe. ViaSat-2 will also provide nearly twice the capacity offered by previous generations of ViaSat satellites, along with seven times as much coverage. Positioned at 70W, ViaSat-2 will provide throughput of approximately 300 Gbps in Ka-band over its coverage zone. ViaSat-2 was built by Boeing in El Segundo, California, using a 702HP platform. EUTELSAT 172B will be the 32nd satellite launched by Arianespace for Eutelsat. Both companies have worked side-by-side since 1983, when Arianespace launched the Eutelsat-1 F1 satellite. Including this upcoming launch, more than half of Eutelsat's satellites will have been orbited by Arianespace. Eutelsat is one of the world's leading and most experienced operators of communications satellites. The company provides capacity on 39 satellites to clients that include broadcasters and broadcasting associations; pay-TV operators; video, data and Internet service providers; enterprises and government agencies. EUTELSAT 172B will deliver increased capacity for fast-growing applications that include in-flight and maritime connectivity, cellular backhaul, corporate networks, video distribution and government services. It will be located at 172E, a key neighborhood providing exceptional Asia-Pacific reach over land and sea, from Alaska to Australia. EUTELSAT 172B is the first all-electric telecommunications satellite built in Europe. This key enabling technology has been implemented by Airbus in Toulouse, using the new all-electric Eurostar E3000 EOR (Electric Orbit Raising) platform.

Moscow is critical of U.S. missile defenses and mulling how to respond. Jeff Daniels | @jeffdanielsca Saturday, 3 Jun 2017 | 1:49 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters US missile defense agency takes out ballistic missile in live-fire test    Wednesday, 31 May 2017 | 2:50 PM ET | 01:20 The Pentagon's successful interceptor missile defense test this week is seen as a step toward reducing the nuclear risk from North Korea, but now China and Russia are seeing the U.S. technology as a threat. Regardless, North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun said Thursday that its military was "ready to conduct an ICBM test-fire at any time." During Tuesday's test, the U.S. military intercepted a mock intercontinental ballistic missile target fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California during a test of its Ground-based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, system. Besides California, the U.S. also has the GMD system deployed at Fort Greely in Alaska. The interceptor test took place a day after the North Korean regime fired its ninth ballistic missile test this year. Tuesday was only the 10th successful test out of 17 conducted since 1999. This week's test also was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM target. The test is seen as a sign the U.S. military is making progress to combat the mainland U.S. threat from North Korea. Still, the use of numerous decoy missiles or countermeasures by an enemy could overwhelm or confuse the interceptor system and render it useless. Russia and China already have developed countermeasures to increase the chance of a missile reaching a target. And the North Koreans also are believed to be developing similar capabilities, which creates additional national security concerns given Pyongyang's rapid advances in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. 'Many different ways' North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Friday quoted a military spokesman for the hermit state as saying the U.S. is "sadly mistaken if they think such missile interception system can prevent the shower of [a] nuclear strike." "There are many different ways that a missile can trick an interceptor," said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a think-tank based in Washington founded by former President Richard Nixon. There's an expectation that U.S. adversaries will intensify efforts to counter the GMD and other missile defense technology. Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted as much Thursday "This destroys the strategic balance in the world," Reuters quoted Putin as saying in remarks at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia. Added the Russian leader: "What is happening is a very serious and alarming process. In Alaska, and now in South Korea, elements of the anti-missile defense system are emerging. Should we just stand idly by and watch this? Of course not. We are thinking about how to respond to these challenges. This is a challenge for us." At the same time, China's semiofficial Global Times said this week that the interceptor test is proof the U.S. may be preparing for military action against North Korea and also that the technology "breaks strategic balance among nuke-armed countries." "They believe they were put in a situation where they are going to have to counter [U.S. weapons], and that's the age-old story of military capability." -Ed Turzanski, national security expert "The enhancement of America's missile defense capability will, in theory, undermine the effectiveness [and] efficacy of nuclear strikes launched by its main strategic rivals, thus consolidating its own domination," according to an op-ed Thursday on the Chinese military's official web portal. China believes the systems "will also stimulate other countries to develop strategic penetration technology at a faster pace or enhance their own strategic defense capability, which will exert a new impact on international security." Russia's and China's first-strike capability and their response capability are "neutered" by the U.S. missile defense, according to Ed Turzanski, an international policy and national security expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think-tank based in Philadelphia. "They believe they were put in a situation where they are going to have to counter that, and that's the age-old story of military capability," he said. Turzanski, who worked in the U.S. intelligence community in postings throughout Asia and Europe during the Reagan administration, noted that during the Cold War there was an agreement with the Soviet Union that limited the number of U.S. interceptor missiles on each side. That agreement ended when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. "We knew the minute you had the ability to knock my missile down, you had survivability and you could launch a first strike with impunity. We wouldn't tolerate it from them, they are not tolerating it from us." Number of GMDs grow Lucy Nicholson | Reuters The Ground-based Midcourse Defense element of the U.S. ballistic missile defense system launches during a flight test from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, U.S., May 30, 2017. The U.S. hopes to have a total of 44 GMD interceptors available by the end of the calendar year, up from 36 today, but even with that amount there may not be enough interceptors to take out more than a dozen incoming ICBMs, according to experts. A group of senators last month introduced a bipartisan bill that seeks to bolster homeland missile defense and sharply increase the number of interceptors. The next test of the GMD interceptor system is scheduled for late 2018, according to the Missile Defense Agency. Boeing is the prime contractor on the GMD program. The U.S. missile agency has received more than $120 billion since 2002 on the GMD missile defense system and it plans to spend an additional $37 billion through 2021 to further develop capabilities, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last month. Meantime, Russia and China also are concerned with the THAAD anti-ballistic missile systems deployed in South Korea. THAAD, a system manufactured by Lockheed Martin, stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. The controversial THAAD system is a mobile, ground-based system deployed about 130 miles south of Seoul, South Korea, to defeat North Korean missiles. However, its powerful radar gives the U.S. the ability to peer deep into both China and Russia and monitor military activities. Analysts suggest one way Russia could respond to the U.S. anti-missile technology is by increasing its cyberweapons targeting missile defense systems as well as pushing more space-based anti-missile solutions. Russia also could increase the number of fake missiles it has coming down on targets so more interceptors go to the wrong missile. "There are ways to trick the computer systems to think that there's a lot more missiles coming down on a target," said Kazianis. "The challenge here is that there's so many different ways to literally fake out the interceptor system." At present, the U.S. is considered ahead of Russia and China in developing space-based sensors and interceptor technology. Infrared sensors already are on satellites to detect missiles and the Pentagon is expanding efforts to develop a network of additional sensors in space and to experiment with kill capabilities from space. Laser weapons also show promise as part of a missile defense system. They have already been tested in manned aircraft and now development is underway in drones. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency's "long-term goal is to deploy lasers on high-altitude, long-endurance UAV platforms to destroy ICBMs in the boost phase at long standoff ranges," according to spokesman Chris Johnson. Several challenges remain, though, including overcoming the huge power requirements of laser weapons and the scale necessary to put the weapon technology on unmanned vehicles. General Atomics is working on a high-energy laser system for its UAVs that could be used for a range of uses, including missile defense as well as offensive capabilities. "The challenge there is getting the laser powerful enough while also to be light enough to fit on the back of a UAV," said Thomas Karako, a senior fellow at the International Security Program and director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think-tank. That said, Karako indicated that the laser-based UAV weapon would only be useful for the boost phase of a ballistic missile when it's most vulnerable and rising. The laser probably wouldn't be reliable to kill the missile warhead on its re-entry since at that phase it is designed to withstand intense heat.

Reuters Several major US companies, including WalMart Stores Inc, JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs’ criticism of the US withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest US retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was “disappointed in today’s news about the Paris Agreement. We think it’s important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. “IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world,” a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump’s decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump’s business group. “I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is “disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table.” Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump’s manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added, “Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal “a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people.” Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration’s efforts to boost US economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for US goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. “If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption.” The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have “a statistically insignificant impact on the environment.” “If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,” she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump’s business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co’s new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump’s immigration policies.

The d3 team, who will be in Booth 4069, will also display their popular pro range. Jun 02, 2017 d3 Technologies will introduce its new gx range to the US market at InfoComm 2017, June 14-16, in the Orange County Convention Center, Orlando. The d3 team, who will be in Booth 4069, will also display their popular pro range. Prototypes of the gx range were previously shown at Prolight + Sound, Frankfurt, 2017. The new media servers are designed to facilitate generative content, which is becoming a progressively important part of live show design. With the gx range, users can render video, audio, MIDI, tracking and automation data, or interactive inputs in real-time for shows that respond to their environments. Whether it's smoke that moves as it's touched or water that ripples as performers pass by, immersive experiences are transforming how live content is being designed. The gx media servers combine output and processing power to produce dynamic content with high resolutions and better frame rates. They build on d3's legacy of pushing the color, clarity and complexity of shows to new limits. There are two models in the gx range: the gx 2 and gx 1. The gx 2 has the fastest professional grade GPU currently available and offers two VFC slots (two 4K outputs, or eight HD outputs) in the same rugged chassis as the tried and tested pro range. It delivers unrivaled performance for the most cutting-edge generative content available. The gx 1 brings the same power density to smaller shows and installations. It packs a powerful single-width workstation GPU and a single VFC slot (one 4K, or four HD outputs) into an all-new compact yet rugged 2U pro chassis. Propelling the wave of generative content forward is Notch, a third-party software partner and a pioneering tool for creativity, which enables creatives to make real-time, live interactive visual content with an unprecedented level of quality and flexibility. The gx range of hardware platforms comes bundled with a full Notch playback license giving users access to the latest software without any barriers. The gx range will begin shipping to the US in June 2017. Rollouts to Europe and the APAC region will follow in September. d3 will also be showcasing the flagship pro range. The pro range was created with one core mission in mind: to play huge video content across massive canvases in the toughest of live environments. d3 pro media servers been used on some of the biggest and most complex projects, including the Hoover Dam, KLM's Boeing MD-11 airliner and the record-breaking 2016 Circle of Light festival in Moscow. The pro range has been engineered with the power to scale any show with the smoothest possible live playback experience, while remaining tough and reliable. The latest member of the pro range, the new 2x4pro, launched earlier in 2017, will be on display at InfoComm. With two VFC slots, this machine brings the power of the pro range to medium-size shows. About d3 d3 is the world's first fully integrated visual production system for video professionals, combining a real-time 3D stage visualizer, timeline, video playback engine and projection mapping tools into one product. d3's unique integrated workflow assists the designer at all stages of the project, from pitch through development to final delivery.

Her husband, Dave, spent 6 months in prison twice for his protest efforts. Sidelined physically with Parkinson's disease, Dave Corcoran remains active behind the scenes -- and in his T-shirt collection. This one says, "I'm not disturbing the peace; I'm disturbing the war." Debi Borden of Westchester, formerly of Arlington Heights, has become more involved in activism since retirement, attending marches and joining the Unitarian Universalist Church in Oak Park to address her feelings of anger at current events in a positive way with other church members.   By Jean Murphy Daily Herald Correspondent Nostalgia reigns supreme this summer as we approach a series of 50th anniversaries of pivotal moments in our history. This summer San Francisco is commemorating the Summer of Love when the hippies arrived in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in 1967. Closer to home the latest version of the Grateful Dead, known as Dead & Company, has concerts scheduled at Wrigley Field on June 30 and July 1, and Navy Pier is hosting "Exhibitionism," an exhibit of Rolling Stones memorabilia, through July 30. Next year and the years that follow will surely generate remembrances of such major events as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Chicago's 1968 Democratic National Convention, Woodstock and the shootings at Kent State, to name a few. So what has happened to all of the people who were activists and hippies in those days? How have they lived their lives since those tumultuous years? Here we take a look at five from the suburbs: • John Brennan of Mount Prospect, who worked to spread racial understanding all of his life and continues today. • Marci Buerger of Forest Lake, who lived for a year in a commune, coming away from that a strong feminist who had learned how to get along with and learn from people from different backgrounds. • Barb and Dave Corcoran of Des Plaines both began adulthood in religious vocations and have spent their lives protesting wars and the instruments of war. • Debi Borden of Westchester and formerly of Arlington Heights, who chanted for peace and joined the protests at the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Today, she is increasing her activism by joining marches and seeking like-minded individuals to join forces with. John Brennan John Brennan continues to combat racial injustice and today practices what he calls "micro-affirmations," by greeting everyone he meets. John Brennan of Mount Prospect has never stopped working for social and racial justice. A native of Boston, Brennan was ordained a Paulist Catholic priest in 1959 and soon thereafter was sent to minister in Utah. That was where he had his first experience of being a member of a minority. Since so many residents of Utah are Mormons, Catholics are definitely in the minority there and that experience has stayed with Brennan ever since. "The systems were just fixed against you if you weren't a Mormon," he recalled. During the years that followed, Brennan took an increasing interest in racism and social justice. In 1963, while serving in Chicago, he took part in his first protest march (to call for the firing of a Chicago Public Schools superintendent) and two years later he attended a talk by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and was very impressed. Soon, after he questioned his pastor telling the congregation that "Jesus said, 'My Country, Right or Wrong,'" he got transferred to Ohio State University's Newman Center, the Catholic organization for college students. His job was to be a sensitivity consultant who would help groups work more effectively together. It was at OSU that a major transformation took place in Brennan's life and thinking. "There were so many rigid Catholics from the parishes around Cleveland and I enjoyed liberating their thinking," Brennan said. During his time at Ohio State, he sponsored an anti-Vietnam War speaker named Fr. Phillip Berrigan. He was the brother of Fr. Daniel Berrigan, one of the nation's leading anti-war activists who spent time in prison for his activities. He also joined an ecumenical group called "Clergy and Laity Against Vietnam" which let him get to know Protestant ministers for the first time. He also agreed to speak against the Vietnam War from Ohio State's Oval "because I felt that it was the right thing to do." Brennan also participated in a sit-in in front of the Ohio State Law School because students there felt the school was making no effort to recruit black students. By this time, Brennan was ready to move on, so he left the priesthood in 1969 and went to New York City to work for Pan Am Airlines. Since he was a racial sensitivity expert, he dealt with issues like complaints from black Pan Am employees that they could not get advanced through the ranks. He eventually established a minority affairs department and got white supervisors and black workers talking. In 1972 he moved to Chicago to take an affirmative action position with G.D. Searle and later with a Searle subsidiary. He married his wife, Charman, in 1974, had two children, a daughter and a son, and eventually established an independent human resources consulting practice. In his spare time, Brennan continued to work toward fair trade with developing nations, such as Brazil, and put together racism workshops in which traditionally black Catholic parishes and traditionally white Catholic parishes were paired for discussion groups to bring about understanding. That movement recently celebrated its 15th anniversary. Fourteen years ago he also initiated a twice-a-year book discussion called Suburban Mosaic, coordinated by area libraries, schools and the Daily Herald. The idea was for citizens from all over the area to read and discuss the same book on a social and racial justice topic and discuss it. Suburban Mosaic eventually expanded to include six books for readers of all ages from preschool to adult. "Suburban Mosaic is a movement, not an organization," Brennan explained. In 2009 he received a Shining Star Award from the Village of Mount Prospect, largely for his work on Suburban Mosaic. Brennan continues to seek social and racial justice at a grass-roots level. He has taken nine mission trips to Nicaragua with his daughter and son; he volunteers in a free clinic in Chicago; and he actively works to combat the micro-aggressions that women and minorities experience every day by actively greeting everyone he encounters, calling what he does "micro-affirmations." Marci Buerger Marci Buerger lived on a small commune in upstate New York in 1970-71. Marci Buerger of Forest Lake in Lake County spent a year on a small commune in Saranac, New York, in 1970-71 and came away a feminist. She remains a committed feminist today. "I grew up in a Detroit suburb and after I graduated from high school, I desperately wanted to leave home, so when my cousin and his wife offered to let me live with them in upstate New York and study at the State University of New York (SUNY) in Plattsburgh, my parents agreed. What they didn't know was that my cousin and his wife had started a small commune and that is where I lived," Buerger recalled. Life on the commune was difficult. Money was tight, the old farmhouse they lived in had no central heat (but it did have electricity and some hot water) and they weren't sure how to keep everyone fed. The growing season so close to the Canadian border was short, so while they grew some of their own food, there wasn't a lot. "It was a very trying environment and the conditions were primitive. I came from a middle class family and had lofty ambitions when I got there, but before long it became clear to me that I couldn't live like that long-term," she explained. "It was an awakening for me, however. I had to learn to share with others who weren't in my nuclear family and make do with what we had. I also learned to share ideas with people from totally different backgrounds," Buerger continued. She went to college during that year, did basic housekeeping, listened to music and involved herself in discussions of social and political issues. "The most positive thing that came out of that year was that I became a feminist by participating in a consciousness-raising group and joined the National Organization for Women (NOW). I learned that the sisterhood of women is powerful and got involved in educating other women about women's issues like equal pay for equal work, gender roles, child care, birth control and the right to choose," Buerger said. "We even participated in demonstrations on women's issues at the SUNY campus." "That was a very formative year for me. I became an adult while I was struggling and making sacrifices on that commune. But I learned that I could do anything. It is a very clear line in my memory," she added. At the end of that school year, Buerger returned home to Michigan and earned an art degree from Wayne State University because she knew that she wanted to be involved in a creative endeavor. She married a goldsmith and they had two sons that they raised to be feminists. Buerger spent 25 years working as a jewelry designer before switching careers 17 years ago and becoming the adult program coordinator at the Mount Prospect Public Library. She continues to support women's issues and was pleased to see Hillary Clinton be able to run as a presidential candidate of a major political party. "Much has changed since I was on that commune, but there is still work to be done," she stated. "I did not participate in the Women's March this year, but I was very gratified to see the outpouring of involvement." Buerger has also expanded her advocacy interests to include environmental issues. She is careful to recycle and curtail waste at home and often books programs at the library which are aimed at educating patrons on climate change, zero waste homes, recycling and so forth. Barb and Dave Corcoran Dave Corcoran carrying a protest sign at the International March Against the Iraq War in front of White House. - Barb and Dave Corcoran of Des Plaines have been taking a stand against war and the instruments of war for decades. Both have been arrested scores of times and Dave has been imprisoned twice -- for six months each time -- for trespassing on federal property during protests. Like John Brennan, the Corcorans began their adulthoods in Catholic religious communities. Dave was a parish priest in Ohio and Barb was a member of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, based in Cincinnati. She was a school principal in Lancaster, Ohio, when the two met. In 1972 they both left their vocations and married. In those days they demonstrated against the arms race and even got hit with tear gas. Dave continued to work in Catholic-related fields, spending four years as an office manager at the National Federation of Priests' Councils before landing a job as a chaplain at Loyola Medical Center in 1976. The couple eventually adopted three children from Korea. As he neared retirement, Dave and Barb both became more and more involved in peace work, protesting (and sometimes being arrested) at the Oak Ridge nuclear facility in Tennessee, at a nuclear facility in Nevada, at Boeing headquarters in Chicago, in front of the Kluczynski federal building in Chicago, in front of the White House and many other places. Beginning in 1998, they made an annual weekend trip to Fort Benning, Georgia, to protest the School of the Americas (SOA) which trained members of the military from South and Central American countries to intimidate and abuse their populations, according to the Corcorans. Dave and others would often dress in black shrouds and white masks, carry mock coffins and lay down on the ground to simulate the deaths they were accusing the U.S. military of causing. In 2000, Dave and nine others were arrested on charges of crossing a line that the several thousand protesters were told not to cross and a judge in the federal court of that part of Georgia sentenced him to six months in the federal prison for men in Oxford, Wisconsin. Three years later, it happened again, this time with 25 others, and he was sentenced to another six months. Dave kept his job at Loyola the first time he was imprisoned, but the second time they encouraged him to retire and he did, then spending his free time visiting troubled parts of the world and protesting perceived wrongs in the United States. "It was worth it. My conscience was telling me that these things were wrong and that I had to do something to stop it. I know I was where God wanted me to be and I would do it again if Barb and I still had our health. But she has a hard time walking and I now have Parkinson's, so we now work behind the scenes on our causes and volunteer every week at Misericordia," Dave explained. "He always saw what needed to be done and he did it. Even when he was still a priest, I remember him stirring up the parishioners about the war in Vietnam. Here was this gentle person telling them that we didn't need to be fighting the war we were fighting," Barb recalled. Debi Borden Debi Borden, pictured at age 20, says she was a casual hippie then, but still managed to attend protests and chant for peace. Debi Borden of Westchester, formerly of Arlington Heights, was a more mainstream, casual hippie. She took a break from activism to raise her daughter and pursue a successful career and now that she has retired, has taken up activism once again. Borden grew up in a Catholic Republican family that lived in both Peoria and Detroit, moving to the Chicago area in time to spend her senior year of high school at Maine South. As a lark, she participated in the protests at the Democratic National Convention in 1968 when she was only 16 and visiting Chicago to see a friend. "We all enjoyed the times. We were chanting for peace and protesting about Watergate while enjoying outdoor rock festivals. We wore bell-bottoms and water buffalo sandals and had long hair," Borden recalled. In 1972, at the age of 20, she quit college and got married. She and her husband of 30 years had one daughter eight years later, but before that "we smoked a lot of dope, visited the national parks and became firmly entrenched in the middle class. We weren't very politically connected during those years." When her daughter was born, Borden was became a stay-at-home mom and, eventually, a Girl Scout leader, not returning to work until her daughter turned 10. She then worked for business organizations throughout her career. Borden retired a year and a half ago and said that now that she has the time and money, she is getting involved in activism once again. She attended the Women's March and plans to attend the Gay Rights March. She is a member of the Sierra Club and contributes to the Wildlife Defense Fund and Best Friends Animal Shelter in Utah. She marched in the Crop Walk for Hunger and spent a day helping to clean up along the Chicago River. "After the Women's March, my partner and I decided to join the Unitarian Church in Oak Park. We decided that we could not be this angry for four years and needed to spend time with like-minded, constructive people who didn't just want to rant and rave," Borden explained. "I look back fondly on the days when protests were more focused on the issues, instead of just calling people names. Back then, people disagreed with one another, but there wasn't the terrible animosity that there is today. We all need to realize that there is plenty to go around in this country and that if we are lucky enough to be privileged, we need to be ethical and care about others," she added. "I guess, as long as the people in D.C. are stupid, I will continue to protest," Borden concluded. Get articles sent to your inbox.

And let’s be honest… have you never yourself experienced moments where either you or your colleagues were watching the minute hand till it reached closing- time? Employee Time Waste in Perspective In 2014 Salary.com, polled 750 employees regarding wasted time at the workplace and found out that 89% of respondents’ waste time at work as follows: 31% waste roughly 30 minutes daily 31% waste roughly 1 hour daily 16% waste roughly 2 hours daily 6% waste roughly 3 hours daily 2% waste roughly 4 hours daily 2% waste 5 or more hours daily That 89% was a significant increase from 69% of respondents wasting time in 2013. In 2014, Careerbuilder (via Harris Poll) also commissioned a study on how people ‘waste’ time at work (the infographic can be found here: http://employer.careerbuilder.com/jobposter/resources/page.aspx?pagever=productivity2014&sc_cmp2=JP_Infographic_productivity2014&template=none ) . What they found was that the polled employees were involved in doing the following: Talking on the cell phone and texting – 50% Gossiping – 42% On the Internet – 39% On Social media – 38% Taking snack breaks or smoke breaks – 27% Distracted by noisy co-workers – 24% In meetings – 23% On email – 23% Distracted by co-worker drop byes – 23% Distracted by co-worker calls on speaker phone – 10% Equally interesting is that now - in 2017, 11% of the employees polled, say that half the working week is spent wasting time, whilst 72% believe that 30% of the working week goes to waste, according to the research conducted by Survey Sampling International There are plenty of similar surveys- Harris Poll is doing such a survey at least once a year for employees in the US, the UK, Australia and other geographies. Sometimes, when I visit a client, I see employees with their blue-tooth on, watching daytime telenovelas or football matched on their phone; once when I had to make a copy at the client’s site, the employee was photocopying an African Dance book…. How-to address Employee Time-Waste Blaming your employees seems to be the easiest way to explain the time wasting. Minimizing Time Wasting starts with Leadership – Your Leadership! If you as a Leader / Manager do not set clear and measurable expectations and goals for the team to achieve, then your team will naturally set their own and usually they will waste as much time as they can. Unfortunately, most people will only do what they are asked to do. So kindly -please- ask yourself, what are you really doing or not doing, that is allowing or encouraging them to waste time? Here are some suggestions: Hire carefully and hire the right people. Why? Because if you do not know the right candidate that you need to hire in terms of skills, abilities and cultural fit, you will get new employees who soon will be frustrated by lack of skills or undervalued if overqualified or bored if their workday is not planned properly and they have nothing to do; all these behaviours lead to time- wasting. Btw, whenever a new employee is hired, make sure that each of your team members knows specifically what they are supposed to do and how and when they are supposed to do it. We assume that you do already have clear company goals and directives in place. Set clear HR / Workplace policies and communicate them to all. A constantly updated Employee Handbook should be readily available at all times with your workplace policies. Address issues like speakerphones, private usage of company property, etc. Introduce fair disciplinary actions for all possible violations. Btw, any red-tape set of bureaucratic policies is by definition a time waster. That includes tedious expense reports of vacation applications, etc. Run Meetings Properly. A badly run meeting, is both demotivational and boring and by default a clear waste of time for all. Plan your meetings properly, have a clear agenda communicated in advance to all participants, and end your meetings at a set time- don’t let them drag unnecessarily because you have no time tracking/ management skills. And…. Employees should have the right to decline meeting-invitations. Proper Training If you assign tasks to an employee that s/he cannot perform, s/he will get eventually frustrated and start procrastinating. So, train them please. On the other hand, don’t force your employees to attend irrelevant or worthless courses. In 2017, it is ok for your employees to sue YouTube or a MOOC to learn new skills. IT, Social Media & Website Blocking. Should you have one? Do your employees need to access gambling sites during work hours? Online shopping ones? Should Facebook be blocked? Is your corporate spam-filter in order or do employees receive 20-60 spam emails per day? Are virus ‘dancing’ in your network platform? Develop a Social Media usage policy during work hours, keeping in mind that millennials and younger workers, a policy to remove personal devices or prohibit all access and texting during working hours is likely to be resented or simply ignored. You might need a policy on using work time for personal e-mails, private calls and texts. As the line between work and personal-life home continues to blur, this ‘trend’ is on the rise. Too Much Email Don’t fill up your employees’ email inboxes with unimportant mail. Also, don’t expect them to drop whatever they do they can respond to your email immediately. If really urgent, just walk and talk to them or call them. Avoid email chains as to what to order for lunch or about the new fan usage policy. Manage your team properly + KPIs. As a manager -at any level, it is your responsibility to plan your employee’s day. Let me give you an example: at the software division of Boeing -since the late 90s- a software engineer has detailed instructions for every 2-hr work period; yes- that level of granularity (my husband has witnessed it). Word of caution: focus on deliverables and do not micromanage the time of your employees. Each Task should have solid instructions and ideally relevant and constantly monitored KPIs Have clear KPIs for both your Team and all Team- Members and all processes that are covered by the functional area(s) of your team(s). Finally, be visible as a manager- do not manage by assigning tasks via email. You have to be on the office /store floor! Conditions of the Work Environment. A work environment that is dirty, or messy or too hot or too noisy or poorly lit or even not comfortable to sit in, it’s a major productivity killer. All these will drive your employees- despite all possible good will, to immense amounts of lack of concentration and time waste. Recognition and Rewards Management. Give rewards – show to your employees that they are valued! Motivate them to be less wasteful with their work time by giving them recognition and extra incentives. A simple set of movie- tickets for someone’s family might boost their morale and keep them going for a long time. Part of recognition is also listening to your employees; this usually results in less wasted effort, reduced costs, and even zero employee turnover. Time Off: Daily Short Breaks & Vacations Implement several short-breaks during the work-day. Most ergonomic advice suggest a 5- minute break every hour because the majority of people can only focus for one hour or less at a time. Also, when applicable, force employees to take their vacation days (not a good idea to transfer them to next year etc.) to avoid work- burnout. If applicable too, you might want to consider offering an employee flexitime, even temporarily. In Conclusion. I trust that by now, you are aware that your employees/ team- members might be wasting a lot of time at the workplace. Keep in mind, that lack of personal accountability ‘for the standard of the employee’s work- contribution’ might be another common reason for reduced workplace productivity. And now, you have some information on how to address it. If your employees have always clear understanding of how their work adds value to your organisation, if they like their work and their work environment, if they are given clear responsibilities and are held accountable, if they receive regular feedback and communication on future business strategy, if they if they feel really valued, then they will be having pride in their job and self-select not to time waste.

Excuses won't hold for long IndiaShiv AroorJun, 03 2017 11:29:50 IST #Fweekend#Indian army#Indian navy#Indianairforce#Operation jinnah#Special forces#Surgical strike#Uri attack#Women army officers#Women in indian army The signs, both real and wished (for), are everywhere. Is India finally ready to see women in military combat? Six months ago, 135 women from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) underwent special training to be deployed for anti-naxal operations as the country’s first female armed police/paramilitary commandos. The very first. No small step. Last week, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) revealed that it was putting hundreds of its women personnel through commando-style training (including, according to reports, the Filipino martial art Pekiti-Tirsia Kali and starvation endurance) for anti-terror operations at nearly a hundred new Delhi Metro stations set to come up over the next twelve months. Women in Indian Army. PTI photo Meanwhile, in March this year, the Border Security Force got its first ever woman field officer, Tanushree Pareek, an undeniable important occasion that was given its due when the young woman was ordered to lead the passing out parade of her batch. By this time in July, three young women — Mohana Singh, Avani Chaturvedi and Bhawana Kanth — will become the Indian Air Force’s first female fighter pilots. Spotting an opportunity (and why not?) to trumpet their entry into a stream that was so far barred to women, the Indian Air Force created a video film with the catchphrase Ek Ladki Hoon Main. It was an instant success, hitting every right chord on social media and television. The Indian Air Force appeared to be saying, ‘Well, this isn’t lip service any more.’ Also overwhelmingly ‘manned’, the Indian Navy last year took its own big step forward by offering permanent commission to women officers, starting with a modest group of seven, but with the intention to expand these numbers quickly. But let’s face it. These are small beginnings if we want to achieve that lofty goal of gender parity. For starters, the Indian Air Force and Navy are dwarfed by the Army, which is several times larger in manpower (and womanpower) than the other two combined. Where do they stand? Last month the Indian Army offered a tantalising nugget in an official press release. At its Commanders’ Conference helmed by Chief General Bipin Rawat, the Army said it had deliberated, among other things, on the ‘employment of women officers’ and had evolved a ‘positive roadmap’. Make no mistake, the Army weighs its words carefully. A positive roadmap indicates a time-bound action plan. And that actually means something in the military — not a file that’s shelved and never opened again. But what the plan actually is, we have no clue yet. The Army’s diffidence in revealing more details is not in any way surprising. Few in the ranks have forgotten the raging fire that was ignited 11 years ago by then Vice Chief of Army Staff when he was asked in a newspaper interview about the possibility of women getting more opportunities in the olive greens. ‘Ideally, we would like to have gentlemen and not lady officers at the unit level,’ Lt Gen S Pattabhiraman had told the Hindustan Times. The comment reflected what several in service believed (and continue to believe). But few were prepared for it to be articulated the way the three-star general had just done. It set off a chain reaction of anger, outrage and disbelief. Sushma Swaraj, currently India’s Minister for External Affairs, had loudly called for the Vice Chief’s sacking. The fury that had been stirred offered an inflection point from where there has been very slow forward movement. But no return. Flash forward a decade, and there’s something to really talk about. Even if they are small. For instance, the biggest warship India is building at Kochi, the new Vikrant-class aircraft carrier, will have what reports describe a ‘gender-sensitive living environment’ with infrastructure for at least eight women officers. That’s eight women in a complement of 150 officers and 1,500 sailors. Given that Indian warships didn’t even have separate facilities for women before, it’s a start. The Indian Navy has also thrown open its doors, beginning this year, to women pilots who wish to fly long range maritime reconnaissance missions on the new Boeing P-8I aircraft and shorter missions on its Dornier Do-228s. With the Indian Air Force ushering women into its fighter stream, it shouldn’t be long before the navy flips the switch too. Shiv Aroor is the author of Operation Jinnah, published by Juggernaut Books But one final frontier remains far out of reach. Last September’s surgical strike by the Indian Army created a wave of combat pride in the Special Forces. Yet women remain shut out from this world, despite the presence of several willing, keen and capable volunteers. "Special Forces operations aren’t just about physical endurance. They’re about survivability, intelligence and decisiveness. And mental toughness. Given the opportunity to train like us, women would definitely find place in SF units," says an Army Para Regiment officer involved in the counter-attack following last year’s terror strike in Uri that left 19 soldiers dead. Earlier this year, millions worldwide heard for the first time about Jegertroppen or Hunter Troop, the world's first ever all-women elite special forces training programme by Norway’s military. Instituted in 2014, the programme has proven highly successful in churning out elite women commandos for duties in Afghanistan and elsewhere. India has some of the finest special forces units and training centres in the world. It shouldn’t take much to plug trainee female commandos into the existing system. The facilities exist, and the excuses won't hold ground for long. So what’s stopping us? India is definitely ready to take this leap. The only question now, is when.

The city had boasted of unbending faith in the service sectors, which would transform it into a global financial and shipping centre by 2020. Gone are the upbeat rhetoric of such an ascension, but in its place, officials are quietly mapping out new plans to rejuvenate Shanghai’s manufacturing industry and reclaim China’s economic locomotive status. The final wake up call came when Shanghai’s industrial output dropped seven per cent year on year in the first quarter of 2016. Officials knew it was time to act. “There have been increasing questions about Shanghai’s manufacturing sectors following years of declines,” said Chen Mingbo, head of the Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology. “We have an answer today: with efficient coordination, Shanghai’s manufacturing industry still has big growth potential.” Chen admitted that the shrinking contribution of the manufacturing sectors to the economy weighed on local government officials who decided to take drastic actions to stem the slide. Addressing a press conference earlier this week, he stressed the importance of ensuring sustainability in driving the growth of Shanghai’s manufacturing businesses, albeit the city’s land scarcity for industrial development and rising living costs. There have been increasing questions about Shanghai’s manufacturing sectors following years of declines Chen Mingbo, Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology As he shed light on the development plan, Chen pointed out that 1 square kilometre of industrial area should generate at least economic output of 1 billion yuan (US$147 million) a year. Outdated and creaky factories and companies would be replaced by high-tech and promising money spinners. The city pledged to attract more than 60 key industrial projects with annual output of more than 1 billion yuan each between 2016 and 2020, Chen said. Biotechnology, new materials, industrial internet, semiconductor, smart car and airplane manufacturing are singled out to propel Shanghai’s further growth. They will feed into the government’s blueprint drawn up in May to reinforce the return of manufacturing businesses. Under the grand scheme, Shanghai would reserve more land for promising companies, offering preferential rents and incentives such as lower tax payments for small technology firms to enhance their manufacturing might. They had also actively pitched global industrial stars such as Microsoft to expand their investments in the city, Chen said. “Shanghai’s reputation can be a draw to the Fortune Global 500 companies,” Chen said. “They are interested in working with us.” Shanghai district Yangpu unveils ¥12b of start-up backing to transform from ‘rust belt’ to innovation hub Cen Fukang, a deputy director of the Shanghai Planning, Land and Resources Administration, said the city government would keep a flat fee on land-use for the prospective companies for the next 20 years, a departure from the current practice where fees are raised periodically. Shanghai has over the past two years refrained from touting its efforts to build a world-class financial centre after the slow progress made in liberalising the financial markets. To be fair, financial deregulation entails central government decision makers, and is something beyond the authorities in Shanghai. In 2009, the city had for the first time officially unveiled its global financial hub ambition, in tandem with Beijing’s efforts to internationalise the yuan. Piggybacking on the city leaders’ focus on finance until now, Shanghai’s service sectors accounted for 67.8 per cent of the local gross domestic product (GDP) last year. “A developed city can’t do without flourishing a manufacturing industry,” said Bob Zhou, chief executive of Shanghai-based investment group Yinshu Capital. “It is necessary to go back to manufacturing businesses as the city attempts to regain its growth momentum.” Shanghai has lagged behind its provincial-level counterparts in term of economic growth. Between 2008 and 2015, its GDP growth was eclipsed by the national average as its manufacturing sectors slumped. It is under pressure to chase industrial output growth as an increasing number of manufacturers, both home-grown and foreign-invested, relocate their facilities to other mainland cities or to overseas markets, where costs are lower. To move its manufacturing sectors up the value chain, the city has massively adjusted its economic structure since 1990s, closing down a large number of light-industry companies such as textile and daily necessities makers that were struggling with thinning profit margins. Since China began economic reform in the 1980s, Shanghai residents had taken pride in a clutch of brands including Forever bicycles, White Rabbit candies, Feiyue colour TVs and Bright milk which were among the best-selling products on the mainland. Most of the brands have faded in oblivion due to cut-throat competition. In 1985, Shanghai’s auto making industry was catapulted into international limelight after SAIC Motor established a joint venture with Volkswagen to produce sedans for the then fledgling car market. Last year, the manufacturing sectors represented only a quarter of the city’s GDP. Export-oriented businesses are increasingly finding themselves in a bind as the city loses its lustre as a gateway to the rest of the country. Yuan Lamei, owner of a garment company that sells clothes to the European markets, said net profit margins had fallen to a scant 8 per cent from more than 30 per cent a decade ago. “Wage inflation continues, and it’s increasingly difficult to get orders from foreign clients as they set eyes on the manufacturers in Southeast Asia,” she said. “For manufacturing businesses, it looks as if our days are numbered.” City officials do not think so. For manufacturing businesses, it looks as if our days are numbered Yuan Lamei, garment manufacturer Chen said a year of efforts to bolster manufacturing businesses have paid off. In the first quarter of this year, industrial output in Shanghai grew 6.7 per cent from the same period in 2016. “The government has the power to push the development of mega projects,” he said, adding that corporate giants owned by the central government and foreign investors would be lured to help create new jobs and growth engines for Shanghai. Last month, Shanghai officials relished a successful maiden flight of the country’s first self-made narrow-bodied passenger jet, signifying the country’s goal to compete for the global industrial crown. The C919 aircraft assembled by Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) represents arguably China’s boldest attempt to break the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing. Comac and Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) also officially started operations of their 50-50 joint venture in late May in Shanghai to develop a long-haul, wide-bodied passenger plane. The double-aisle plane is expected to conduct a first flight in 2022, with deliveries beginning as early as 2025. Shanghai’s road to become a global financial centre had been a convoluted eight-year affair. Expected liberalisation including the establishments of two new boards at the Shanghai Stock Exchange – the international board and board for emerging industries – never came to pass. The qualified domestic individual investor (QDII2) scheme allowing mainland residents to directly invest in overseas stocks was shelve indefinitely after years of preparations on fears of rampant capital outflows that could exacerbate a weaker yuan. The crude oil futures opened to foreign players to trade in have yet to be launched. A freer capital flow across the border remains a far-cry, the major stumbling block for Shanghai’s rise into prominence in the global financial markets. Shanghai’s new mayor leads off with free-trade zone commitment In 2013, Shanghai established the mainland’s first free-trade zone that aims to facilitate free commodity and capital flows across the border. Interests have been at best modest, with few foreign and domestic companies reaping substantial benefits from the freedom of doing businesses inside the so-called mini-Hong Kong. It faces competition against another 10 similar zones across the nation. “But the ground reality is that Shanghai is still a thriving marketplace to do businesses,” said Cao Hua, a partner at Unity Asset Management. “Businesses all the way from catering to plane-making will gravitate to Shanghai, because it is the metropolis where millions of people have plenty of money to spend. The key lies in what products and services you can make to meet their needs.” SCMP Today: HK Edition Get updates direct to your inbox E-mail * By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy Thank youYou are on the list. business-article-page   Most Popular Viewed 1 Is Hong Kong heading for biggest property crash since 1997? 2 Chinese banks told to report overseas withdrawals and transactions 3 The Chinese airports snapping at Hong Kong’s heels 4 Data spat between home delivery majors causes huge confusion 5 Let’s reconcile to a diet of squid as we overfish to our own peril Shared 1 Is Hong Kong heading for biggest property crash since 1997? 2 Chinese banks told to report overseas withdrawals and transactions 3 The Chinese airports snapping at Hong Kong’s heels 4 Oracle partners Tencent in aiming for China cloud computing 5 Bicycles are eating the lunch of China’s No. 1 car-sharing app Commented 1 Will China’s only vigil for the Tiananmen crackdown survive? 2 Hong Kong ‘turns blind eye’ as workers sleep in cupboards, kitchens, even toilets 3 Young Hongkongers ‘pushed to localism by Beijing policies’ 4 Chinese tourist destroys in seconds what nature took 3,000 years to build 5 China’s now able to lead on climate change … but is it willing?

Trump's move to withdraw from Paris accord cedes global leadership to China Time for China and Europe to lead, as Trump dumps the Paris climate deal Several major US companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration - as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

Lockheed Martin, long expected to be one of the big sellers, put their figure at $28 billion. Lockheed’s sales include 150 Black Hawk helicopters, at the very least, but the company is also trying to sell the Saudis on the THAAD missile defense system, and the small but pricey Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) that the US has been struggling with constantly breaking down. Boeing offered their own estimates on Saudi contracts, saying they believe they’re getting $50 billion. This is stated to include both military sales and commercial sales. They did not offer guidance on how much of the funding was which, nor if this was sales only, or included maintenance deals for the lifetime of the planes. They also offered no specifics on what was being sold. These companies and other well-connected US arms makers are all expected to make quite a bit of money off this new arms deal with Saudi Arabia, as well as more money off of President Trump’s planned military spending increases. As the chance of peace suddenly breaking out looks more and more remote, the arms makers are expected to continue raking in money hand over fist.

The latest announcement was flights to China. (Randall Hill/Reuters) Related Stories WestJet targets expanding long-range routes with up to 20 new Dreamliners Welcome to the discount era: Airlines offer cheap flights, we pay the rest: Don Pittis WestJet Airlines Ltd. is asking Transport Canada for regulatory approval to launch flights to China. CEO Gregg Saretsky made the comments at the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade on Friday, saying offering flights to Asia with lie-flat seats will allow the airline to add a luxury option to its mostly economical offerings. WestJet orders 10 Dreamliners for longer-range routes "We have entered into the process with Transport Canada, and Transport Canada will soon engage the Chinese delegation from Beijing, and before too long we hope to be bringing back the specifics to you," he said. He didn't announce which cities the airline would fly into, nor a potential launch date. Saretsky said the plan is "in-sync with what the Canadian federal government has on its agenda, which is to double the number of inbound arrivals from China by 2022." Last month, WestJet announced it had placed a firm order for 10 Boeing Dreamliners, which will have the range and fuel efficiency to serve new destinations in Asia, South America and expand the airline's presence in Europe. WestJet's first Dreamliner 787s would be delivered between the first quarter of 2019 and December 2021. The Calgary-based airline also has an option to buy an additional 10 Dreamliners to be delivered between 2020 and 2024.  MORE CALGARY NEWS | 'I've never seen anything like that before': Tornado spotted near Three Hills, Alta.  MORE CALGARY NEWS | Province commits $20M to build school playgrounds Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Cardston Lethbridge Milk River Onefour Taber Vauxhall Monday A few showers 19°C Tuesday Sunny 21°C Wednesday Sunny 21°C Thursday Sunny 24°C Friday Sunny 24°C More Weather Latest Calgary News Headlines 'He held her and watched her die in his arms': Calgary man mourns loss of fiance in London attack Man who mowed lawn with tornado behind him says he 'was keeping an eye on it' David Khan chosen leader of the Alberta Liberal Party 1 dead in 'targeted' Saturday night southeast shooting It's back and it's magical: Calgary hula hooping community growing video Top News Headlines 'He held her and watched her die in his arms': Canadian killed in London was struck on bridge 'It's not going to stop me': Londoners defiant in wake of terror attack Libyan-Canadian cleric linked to Manchester bomber plans return to Canada to clear his name 'I lost everything': Regina couple says province's witness protection program failed them Canadian musical about 9/11 wins 3 major New York theatre awards Most Viewed Man who mowed lawn with tornado behind him says he 'was keeping an eye on it' Anti-Islam, Anti-fascist groups clash at Calgary city hall 'I've never seen anything like that before': Tornado spotted near Three Hills, Alta. 3 taken to hospital after shooting in southeast Calgary After a century of stumbles, Alberta's Liberals march on Fatal City Hall C-Train station stabbing a random attack, say police David Khan chosen leader of the Alberta Liberal Party Worker in Lethbridge dies after wind blows concrete wall onto him 1 dead in 'targeted' Saturday night southeast shooting Don't Miss 'He held her and watched her die in his arms': London attack victim from Castlegar, B.C.

It is designed to launch rockets into space. It comes with a wingspan of 117 metres or 385 feet. That makes it longer than a football pitch. Its twin fuselages stretch 75 metres or 285 feet. This compares with Airbus’ A380, which has a wingspan of 80 metres. It is a big beast and weighs almost 230,000 kilograms. It is powered by six engines of the same type used by Boeing 747s. It is hoped that it will be a cheaper option when it comes to launching low-orbit satellites. The advantage of this plane is that it can be used at numerous airports and is not restricted to fixed-launched sites that can be affected by weather.

NASA via AP Bill Ingalls News June 04, 2017 1:06 AM SpaceX launches 1st recycled supply ship By MARCIA DUNN AP Aerospace Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. SpaceX launched its first recycled cargo ship to the International Space Station on Saturday, yet another milestone in its bid to drive down flight costs. After a two-day delay caused by thunderstorms, the unmanned Falcon rocket blasted off carrying a Dragon capsule that made a station delivery nearly three years ago. When this refurbished Dragon reaches the orbiting lab on Monday, it will be the first returning craft since NASA's now-retired shuttles. The first-stage booster flown Saturday afternoon was brand new, and as is now the custom, returned to Cape Canaveral following liftoff for a successful vertical touchdown. "The Falcon has landed," SpaceX Mission Control declared from company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and a cheer went up. The plan is to launch the booster again, instead of junking it in the ocean as so many other rocket makers do. Just two months ago, SpaceX launched its first recycled booster on a satellite mission. Another flight featuring a reused booster is coming up later this month. This Dragon capsule, meanwhile, came back for take two following a few modifications and much testing. Shortly before liftoff, a SpaceX vice president, Hans Koenigsmann, called the Dragon reflight "a pretty big deal." It's all part of the company's quest, he said, to lower the cost of access to space through reusability. "Overall a great day," Koenigsmann later told reporters. "Another wonderful launch," added NASA's Ven Feng, a station manager. SpaceX chief Elon Musk tweeted early Sunday morning: "It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars & airplanes and how it should be for rockets." The Dragon soaring Saturday has the same hull and most of the same parts from its 2014 flight. SpaceX installed a new heat shield and parachutes, among a few other things, for the trip back to Earth at flight's end. The Dragon is the only supply ship capable of surviving re-entry; all the others burn up in the atmosphere. NASA's other supplier, Orbital ATK, will see its cargo carrier depart the 250-mile-high complex on Sunday, six weeks after arriving. Besides the usual supplies, SpaceX's latest 6,000-pound shipment includes mice and flies for research, a new kind of roll-up solar panel and a neutron star detector. For now, SpaceX said savings are minimal because of all the inspections and tests performed on the already flown parts. NASA's space station program manager, Kirk Shireman, told reporters earlier in the week that SpaceX did a thorough job recertifying the Dragon and that the risk is not substantially more than if this were a capsule straight off the factory floor. He said the entire industry is interested in "this whole notion of reuse," first realized with the space shuttles. It was the 100th launch from NASA's hallowed Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, the departure point for the Apollo moon shots as well as dozens of shuttle missions, including the last one in 2011. SpaceX now leases the pad from NASA; the company's first launch from there was in February. SpaceX has been hauling station supplies for NASA for five years, both up and down. This is the company's 11th mission under a NASA contract. The company's next step is to deliver astronauts using modified Dragons. That could occur as early as next year. Until SpaceX and Boeing start transporting crews, astronauts will continue to ride Russian rockets. On Friday, a Russian and Frenchman returned from the space station in their Soyuz capsule, leaving two Americans and a Russian behind. The station was zooming over Oman in the Persian Gulf when the Falcon took flight. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html In this photo provided by NASA, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with the Dragon spacecraft onboard, is seen at Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Saturday, June 3, 2017.

In part that is because the Paris agreement only went into effect last year, it’s voluntary, and doesn’t carry penalties for countries that fall short of emissions-cutting targets. “What you have is a president making a nonbinding withdrawal from a nonbinding agreement,” said Kevin Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners. “And that’s not likely to change fundamentals very much at all.” Many big companies in industries such as autos and aviation have already committed to reducing emissions and are spending billions to do it. They aren’t likely to change course. A study mentioned by Trump estimated that if the U.S. meets its Paris goal for reducing carbon emissions it will cost 2.7 million U.S. jobs by 2025. The study, commissioned by a pro-industry group, projected the sharpest declines in coal, cement, and iron and steel, and the loss of 440,000 manufacturing jobs. Coal and cement producers say the Paris accord would put them at a competitive disadvantage and that they too are taking steps to cut emissions. The American Coal Council said more than 90 percent of U.S. coal plants are equipped with advanced emissions controls, and that advances in technology will lead to further improvement. Cement makers say they use alternative fuels for 15 percent of their power needs. However, many economists think Paris would be roughly a trade-off — fewer jobs in polluting industries would be offset by more in renewable energy. The chief economist of business-research group The Conference Board said the potential number of jobs that might be created in fossil fuels is limited, while the potential for job growth in green technologies is much greater. There are already more than twice as many U.S. jobs in solar energy than coal, about 374,000 to 160,000, according to the Energy Department. Some corporations that had supported the Paris agreement were quick to signal that Trump’s decision would not change their plans. “Our position on climate change has not changed ... we publicly advocate for climate action,” said General Motors. The company reiterated its support for various climate pledges, and it boasted about its Chevrolet Bolt EV, an electric vehicle priced under $30,000. Rebecca Lindland, an executive analyst with Kelley Blue Book, said Trump’s decision won’t have an immediate impact on automakers, who had no specific targets to meet under the Paris agreement. Separately, the Trump administration is reviewing fuel-economy standards that were reaffirmed in the final days of President Barack Obama’s tenure. A weakening of those standards might help sell more SUVs to U.S. consumers, but automakers still have to design and build electric and other fuel-efficient cars to meet mileage standards in California, China, Europe and elsewhere, Lindland said. Oil prices fell Friday on concern that the U.S. exit from Paris could lead to increased production and a continuation of the glut of crude. Several large oil companies including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell had urged Trump not to withdraw. In a statement, Exxon stressed that the accord included emissions-reduction pledges from China and India, developing countries that are major polluters. The company said the U.S. is in good position to compete internationally because of an abundant natural gas supply. New drilling methods have made gas cheaper, allowing it to replace coal in many U.S. power plants. Now, Exxon and others are gearing up to export more liquefied natural gas. Exxon also faces pressure from shareholders, who voted this week for more disclosure about the impact of climate-change regulation on Exxon’s business. Jason Bordoff, an energy-policy expert at Columbia University, said withdrawing from the Paris agreement would make no difference to the U.S. energy outlook or economy. “The outlook for U.S. energy production will be determined far more by market conditions, like the price of oil and gas, than by scrapping the Obama-era environmental regulations,” Bordoff said. The president’s decision should have very little impact on airlines because it’s still in their financial interest to fly cleaner — lower emissions are the result of burning less fuel. Airlines have been spending billions on new, more fuel-efficient planes — fuel is an airline’s second-biggest expense after labor. “No one is going to go back to (Boeing) 707s that leave a big smoke trail in the air just because you can,” said Robert Mann, an aviation consultant and former airline executive. “The (financial) objective is to be efficient.” Whatever the industry, companies will be reluctant to change plans based solely on the withdrawal from the climate agreement because the pendulum could swing back. “It’s easy to imagine a future administration that wants to re-engage in an activist role on climate,” said Book, the energy analyst. “Any long-term investment is going to have to consider the world after Trump.” ——— Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, Paul Wiseman in Washington and Ken Sweet and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report.     Tags: paris, energy, climate, emissions, change, agreement, Other stories from today: Does Trump believe in climate change or not?
