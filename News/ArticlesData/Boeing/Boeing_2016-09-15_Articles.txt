Staff Sgt. Shawn Nickel / CP Share Adjust Comment Print Aerospace giant Boeing is setting the stage to mount a legal challenge against Denmark’s selection of the F-35, a move that shows the potential minefield the Liberal government could be moving into as it prepares to replace Canada’s fighter jets. Denmark rejected the Boeing Super Hornet, touted this summer by Liberal insiders as the best jet for Canada, and instead decided to purchase the same F-35 stealth fighter the Harper government originally wanted to buy. But Boeing says Denmark’s procurement process is flawed and has now submitted a “request for insight” which would require the country’s defence ministry to provide the data it used to select the F-35 over the Super Hornet. Boeing said this is the first stage for a formal legal challenge of the proposed F-35 purchase. Boeing has questioned how the Danes concluded the Super Hornet would cost significantly more than the F-35, pointing out that U.S. Defence Department budget information indicates otherwise. Reports indicate that Denmark would be paying about $83 million U.S. for each F-35; the Danes claimed the purchase of the Super Hornet would cost about $122 million U.S. per plane. Alan Williams, the former procurement chief for Canada’s Defence department, said it appears Boeing has a case with the Danes and under the Canadian system it would also be able to mount a legal challenge. “The current data has the U.S. government putting the fly away cost of the F-35 as about $99 million so if I’m Boeing and see that someone is claiming $83 million then I would know that’s not accurate,” said Williams, who oversaw Canada’s initial entry into the F-35 program. “If the same thing happened in Canada they would also know such a price is fictitious.” Denmark will purchase 27 F-35s. The aircraft was evaluated by the Danes as offering more value than the Super Hornet when it came to military, strategic, economic and industrial criteria. But one of Boeing’s vice presidents said Denmark inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the Super Hornet. “We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet,” said Boeing’s Debbie Rub. Rub said the company believes the Danish evaluation fell short in the four selection criteria and that must be reviewed under the full extent allowed under Danish law. “Denmark deserves to know beyond a shadow of doubt that a fair and transparent process was used to select the country’s future fighter fleet,” Rub added in her statement. Denmark’s Defence Minister Peter Christensen has said Boeing would be given the information it requested. He noted the Danish procurement was “a very thorough and transparent process.” Lockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment. Airbus, the European aerospace giant, has also raised concerns about the Danish evaluation process. The firm led a consortium offering the Denmark the Eurofighter. Airbus noted it is in discussions with Denmark to better understand how the selection of the F-35 was made. During last year’s election campaign, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase the F-35, an aircraft he said was unnecessary for the country’s needs and too expensive. In the summer the Liberal government examined a sole source purchase of Super Hornets. But that was shelved after Lockheed Martin threatened to freeze out Canadian aerospace firms from working on the F-35. Defence minister Harjit Sajjan has said he is interested in an open competition for the replacement of the country’s CF-18 fighter jets. How the Liberals will now proceed on the replacement is unknown at this point. Five companies recently responded to the Liberal government’s call for information about fighter jets. Boeing submitted information on its Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin provided information on the F-35A, Dassault responded with the data on the Rafale, Eurofighter with the Typhoon, and the Saab Group offered details on the Gripen aircraft. The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to the purchase 65 of the planes. But the F-35 program has been dogged by controversy and the aircraft has faced numerous technical problems. The Department of National Defence originally claimed the project would cost around $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page put the price tag for 65 aircraft at around $29 billion. Auditor general Michael Ferguson also issued a report that concluded DND officials withheld key information from Parliament about the fighter-jet purchase, underestimated costs and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. An independent audit ordered by the Conservative government found the purchase of the aircraft would cost $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That figure included everything from maintenance to fuel.   Swedish military publishes gender manual so officers pay attention to sexual... 15 F-35A fighter jets grounded because of peeling insulation Video Connect With Us Email Alerts Get the latest news in your mailbox as it happens Weather Weather Currently Feels Like We want you to have the most accurate weather report you can.

The development may lead to a lawsuit against the Danish MoD’s evaluation regarding the procurement of the country’s next fighter jet. Denmark selected Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II over the Boeing F/A-18 and Airbus' Eurofighter Typhoon. Boeing Global Strike vice-president and general manager Debbie Rub said: “As we said when the decision was announced, we believe the ministry’s evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet. “We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet.” Boeing presented its concerns regarding the evaluation process to the Danish Parliament Defence Committee prior to the award decision earlier this year. "We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet." The company’s primary issue was about the ministry’s estimate that the Super Hornet would cost up to twice as much as detailed in US Department of Defense budget documents. Rub added: “Denmark deserves to know beyond a shadow of doubt that a fair and transparent process was used to select the country’s future fighter fleet. “Our action today underscores our belief that the Ministry’s evaluation of each of the four selection criteria fell short of these objectives and must be reviewed to the fullest extent allowed under Danish law.” Image: Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet.

Boeing challenges Denmark's choice of fighter jets by Staff Writers Copenhagen (AFP) Sept 15, 2016 Gentex receives $82.4 million contract for F-35 pilot masks Washington (UPI) Sep 15, 2016 - Gentex Corp. has been awarded an $82.4 million U.S. Army contact for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter masks and life support systems. The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract will cover joint service aircrew masks for the fighter, as well as life support system and pilot flight equipment that will provide combined chemical and biological protection to pilots during flight. Work locations and funding will be determined with each order. The estimated completion date is September 2026. The Army Contracting Command is the contracting activity. The F-35 Lightning II is intended to replace a range of aircraft across the U.S. military services. Boeing accused the Danish government Thursday of overseeing a "fundamentally flawed" process to replace its fleet of fighter jets which saw the US defence giant lose out to competitor Lockheed Martin. In June, Denmark decided to replace its ageing fleet of F-16s with 27 US-built Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters in a deal valued at 20 billion kroner (2.69 billion euros, $3.02 billion). Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter's Typhoon model were also in the running for the order, which had been debated for over 10 years. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," Debbie Rub, a Boeing vice president, said in a statement. The company had submitted a request for the defence ministry to provide "all materials related to the fighter procurement evaluation and decision announced in June," it said. "We're taking this step because there's too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet," Rub said. She described it as "the first step toward bringing a formal legal challenge." Boeing said it had voiced concern earlier this year over the Danish evaluation process, in particular with a government estimate that "the Super Hornet would cost up to twice as much as detailed in US Department of Defense budget documents." Danish Defence Minister Peter Christensen said it was "natural" that only the company behind the winning bid would be happy with the outcome of the process. "I note that we have had a very thorough and transparent process," he told Danish news agency Ritzau. Denmark is one of nine partner countries, that also include Britain, Canada and Turkey, who are helping pay for the futuristic F-35A fighter jet's development. The country expects to take delivery of the F-35s between 2021 and 2026. Boeing, Saab display new trainer aircraft St. Louis (UPI) Sep 14, 2016 - Boeing and its partner Saab have displayed a new production trainer aircraft to be offered to the U.S. Air Force. The aircraft put on display Tuesday is the T-X, designed specifically for the U.S. Air Force training mission. Boeing said the aircraft takes advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," said Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and chief executive officer. The Boeing T-X aircraft is a twin-tailed, single-engine jet with an advanced cockpit with embedded training. "It's an honor to build the future of Air Force training," said Saab President and CEO Hakan Buskhe. "We have created the best solution thanks to great cooperation and a clear strategy since day one." The U.S. Air Force plans to replace its fleet of aging T-38 aircraft. The Boeing-Saab partnership is one of several competitors for the contract.

By Ananya Roy September 16, 2016 05:54 BST Close Embed Feed Australia examines possible MH370 plane debris found in Tanzania IBTimes US <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19434" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has confirmed on Thursday (15 September) that the large wing part found off a Tanzania coast in June is from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The bureau also said it is conducting further examination of the piece of debris to see if it can provide any clues to the final hours of the flight. On the request of the Malaysian government, the ATSB secured the flaperon found on the island of Pemba and began its examination at its facilities in Canberra. It said that preliminary identification from photographs indicated that the piece was likely to be a section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap. The bureau said in its recent update that examination of the several part numbers found on the flaperon confirmed it belonged to a Boeing 777 outboard flap and that it was "consistent with the physical appearance, dimensions and construction of the part". The ATSB added that a date stamp associated with one of the part numbers showed the manufacture date as 23 January, 2002, which was found consistent with the 31 May, 2002, delivery date for 9M-MRO. The identification stamps also had an "OL" number, which was in addition to the Boeing part number. These numbers were unique identifiers relating to part construction. The Italian part manufacturer matched its records with these numbers and confirmed that all those numbers related to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404, which was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO. Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) confirmed after examination of identification numbers (in picture) on the flaperon found off the Tanzania coast that it belongs to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370Australian Transport Safety Bureau ATSB "Based on the above information, the part was confirmed as originating from the aircraft registered 9M-MRO and operating as MH370," ATSB said. The authorities are now studying the flap section for signs that may indicate the state of flap operation at the time of separation from the wing. "This information may contribute to an increased understanding of end of flight scenarios," the bureau added. Meanwhile, Blaine Gibson, a US lawyer-turned-independent investigator trying to resolve the mystery of the missing MH370, handed over five pieces of debris to ATSB earlier this week for examination. The pieces found off Madagascar bear signs of damage from intense heat or fire. Gibson believes that if confirmed to be from the missing Malaysian flight, these pieces could give the ongoing investigation a new dimension. Australian authorities are running a search for the wreckage in the southern Indian Ocean for the past two years following the plane's disappearance on 8 March, 2014, but have recovered nothing so far. A second sweep of the 120,000sq km ocean floor is set to begin soon to see if the wreckage was missed in the initial sweep.

The lab, which will house 50 data analysts and other staff, will study how Boeing clients can save money through smart planning — such as planning flight routes so that planes needing certain replacement parts will be landing at or near airports where those parts are in-stock, dramatically reducing repair costs.  The following are five items to take away from the announcement. 1) Boeing Vancouver becomes the largest data science group in two key categories. “I believe we are certainly the largest data science group in Vancouver, but also in the global Boeing organization,” said Bob Cantwell, president of Boeing Vancouver. “And really, that’s all because of the talent — the talent that exists here in Vancouver.” Cantwell said the concept for the lab came five years ago, when Boeing realized data analysis could yield potential gains in “disruption management” and maintenance and fuel optimization: “For many of us who came from the airline industry — and lived and breathed these problems everyday — we understood that the power that was going to be unleashed by this new talent and this technology that we’re seeing amongst us here.” 2) The lab provides Boeing with a significant advantage when selling its aircraft. Kevin Crowley, vice-president of Boeing Digital Aviation, said the plane maker is facing increasing competition from European giant Airbus, and the company needs something more than aircraft engineering to attract clients. “We’re still very competitive, but we have to have a competitive edge that’s based on something more than the aerodynamics of our airplanes, our knowledge of materials … those type of things,” Crowley said. “We have to have more of an edge when you come right down to it … mining the data and being a better partner for our customers.” 3) The data analysis applies mostly to civil aerospace, but can be applied to military uses. “Some of the tools that our commercial airline customers have enjoyed for quite awhile are actually being applied on Royal Canadian Air Force programs,” said Roberto Valla, vice-president of global sales for Canada. He noted the RCAF’s Chinook helicopters and some transport planes already use software tools developed in Richmond by AeroInfo. “I think hopefully the one thing all of you will take away from this … is that fact that the Boeing company has been, is, and will remain committed to Canada.” 4) Seemingly minuscule fuel savings in percentage terms are huge in reality. Dawen Nozdryn-Plotnicki, Boeing Vancouver’s director of advanced analytics, said even a one-per-cent cut in fuel use by all Boeing aircraft worldwide would mean savings worth $1 billion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 6.6 million tonnes. “That’s the equivalent, per year, to 1.4 million cars we can take off the road. … That’s why this team right here (in Vancouver) has worked on solutions that will allow us to be able to realize that kind of savings.” 5) B.C. may get more aerospace operations like Boeing Vancouver in the coming years. Amrik Virk, the B.C. technology minister said B.C. will announce in the coming weeks that a technology fund that will provide $100 million in venture capital for small companies to expand. Virk said he hopes that will spur an increase in startup activity in the tech industry that, along with the Boeing decision, could create an aerospace technology hub here. chchiang@postmedia.com Hanjin Shipping vessels now 'under arrest' off B.C. coast over $3.6...  Adorlee tackles beauty, beasts dealing with China's free-trade zones Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Friday, Sep 16, 2016 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Debris found off Tanzania part of Missing MH370 plane (Xinhua)    09:12, September 16, 2016 KUALA LUMPUR, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- The piece of debris discovered on an island off Tanzania in June this year has been confirmed to belong to the Boeing 777 plane of Malaysia Airlines MH370, Malaysia's transport minister Liow Tiong Lai said in a statement on Thursday. Several part numbers, along with physical appearance, dimensions, and construction have been confirmed to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap, while a date stamp of Jan. 23, 2002 on one of the part numbers was consistent with the delivery date for MH370, said Liow. In addition, the Italian part manufacturer has confirmed that all numbers on the discovered object relates to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404, which was consistent with the part used on the plane delivered to Malaysia Airlines, registered as 9M-MRO for the MH370 plane. The conclusion was based on the examination of experts from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the MH370 Safety Investigation Team, according to Liow. Liow said further examination of the debris will continue so as to uncover further evidence which may provide insight into the circumstances of Flight MH370. Previously, a piece of debris found on the French island of Reunion in July 2015 has been confirmed to be part of MH370. Government of Malaysia, Australia and China announced in July that search for Flight MH370 would be suspended upon completion of the current search area, but promised to resume search should new evidence emerge.

The smallest aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus Group are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world's biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 per cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services.

At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. REGIS DUVIGNAU/REUTERS Employees work during the delivery of the first series-production LEAP-1A propulsion systems by Aircelle for the A320neo aircraft Airbus family at the Aircelle plant in France. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said. Ad Feedback "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 6400km, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1900km. While ranges have increased, the 5400km reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 3200km miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The UK and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 4800km. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 6400km using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The US carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 5600km from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 - dubbed the Max 10 - that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris.

TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 5600km from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 - dubbed the Max 10 - that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming."  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next News story: Zika virus: Where is it found, what are the dangers and symptoms, how do you prevent it spreading?

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents Boeing/Saab T-X Trainer Unveiled | B-52s to Get New Ejector Seats – Contract to AMI Industries | US Extends Landmark $38B Mil Aid Package to Israel Sep 16, 2016 00:58 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas Cost reductions at Boeing have resulted in the curbing of paid overtime by 80,000 salaried workers based in the US from October 14. The move is part of company-wide attempts to slash costs amid intense market competition. A company memo stated “By curbing exempt overtime pay, Boeing is challenging leaders and employees to come up with work solutions that curb the need to work overtime.” Boeing and Saab have officially unveiled their new production trainer aircraft for the USAF T-X trainer competition. The Boeing/Saab T-X aircraft is a twin-tailed, single-engine jet with an advanced cockpit with embedded training, taking advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. While the offering faces off with several other designs from rival manufacturers and consortiums, the company stated that their “T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come.” B-52s are set to be fitted with new ejector seats following a USAF contract award to AMI Industries. The $14 million deal will see the company install the Advanced Conception Ejection Seat (ACES) II ejection seat. Due for completion in December 2018, the ejection seat will be composed of a detachable seatback and bucket structure that does not require removal of the B-2 escape hatches for any maintenance task. Elbit subsidiary EFW has won a $102 million US Army contract to provide the service with mortar weapon systems. Under the deal, EFW will deliver 60mm, 81mm and 120mm mortar systems to the Army with completion expected for September 2021. Middle East & North Africa Israel is to receive $38 billion in military aid from the US over the next ten years in what is a landmark military assistance package. The deal, which has been in the works for more than ten months, includes the promise by Israel not to seek additional funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually. Having the new pact signed prior to the upcoming US Presidential elections allows Tel Aviv to avoid uncertainties surrounding the next president, whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump, and to give Israel’s defense establishment the ability to plan ahead. Europe A legal challenge has been launched by Boeing against the Danish Ministry of Defense for selecting the Lockheed Martin F-35A over the F/A-18E/F as the air force’s next generation fighter. Citing a “flawed” evaluation process, Boeing submitted a request for insight to the Ministry of Defence to obtain all materials related to the selection. Denmark’s parliament approved a recommendation by the MoD to buy 27 F-35As in June after the fighter beat out the F/A-18 in the military, strategic, economic and industrial judging categories. Asia Pacific It’s been revealed that China will be taking delivery of four Su-35 fighters by the end of 2016. The disclosure was made by the Governor of Khabarovsk Territory Vyacheslav Shport during the opening of a production plant. Some experts mark the Su-35 as a potential rival for the F-15, Eurofighter, and Rafale fighters. India’s government has launched its investigation into corruption allegations against Brazil’s Embraer regarding the purchase of three EMB-145 aircraft from the company in 2008. The $210 million procurement was destined for the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as part of its indigenous airborne early warning and control systems (AEW&C) program. Embraer has been under investigation by the US Justice Department since 2010 after a defense contract with the Dominican Republic raised suspicions of kickbacks. The US investigation has extended to examine Embraer’s business dealings with eight more countries, including Saudi Arabia and India.

Boeing Co and SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, are building spaceships to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is looking to turn over crew transport to SpaceX and Boeing before the end of 2018, breaking a Russian monopoly. SpaceX is aiming for its first test flight to the station in 2017. “We’re full-steam head for certification. We’re still trying to remain on schedule,” Abhishek Tripathi, director of certification for SpaceX, said during a webcast panel discussion at an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Long Beach, California. “I know what I need to do in the next day and in the next month,” Tripathi said, adding that his work is not being affected by the accident investigation. SpaceX, with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration, is working to figure out why one of its Falcon 9 rockets burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre launch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The blaze destroyed the communications satellite, owned by Israel’s Space Communication Ltd, which was scheduled to be carried into orbit two days later. SpaceX has not yet disclosed how much damage was done at its primary launch site. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Wednesday the company was hoping to resume flights in November at a second, nearly complete launch pad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, adjacent to the Air Force base. The company, which has a backlog of 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion, also flies from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

X Close Nation Home > News > Nation < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 16 September 2016 ‘Pemba debris is from MH370’ by tho xin yi SEPANG: Plane debris discovered on the island of Pemba off the coast of Tanzania is confirmed to be part of the missing MH370. This has been deduced after several numbers as well as its physical appearance and dimensions were found to match the ill-fated aircraft. Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said both the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the MH370 Safety Investigation Team had determined that the numbers, appearance, dimensions and constructions matched that of an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap. “A date stamp indicated that it was manufactured on Jan 23, 2002, and consistent with the May 31, 2002, delivery date for MH370. “Besides the Boeing part number, all identification stamps have a second “OL” number which are unique identifiers relating to the part. The Italian part manufacturer has confirmed that all numbers located on the recovered debris relate to the same outboard flap shipped to Boeing and delivered to Malaysia Airlines,” he said here yesterday. Experts from ATSB, said Liow, recently completed their examination of the debris discovered on June 20. “The investigation team will look into other details now and study how the accident happened – whether it was a controlled or uncontrolled ditch – into the sea,” he said after welcoming AirAsia’s latest aircraft, an Airbus A320neo, at the Sepang Aircraft Engineering hangar here yesterday. The ministry, said Liow, would continue to provide updates as and when new information became available. “We wish to extend our appreciation to the authorities in Tanzania and Australia for their support and assistance,” he said. MH370, a Beijing-bound flight carrying 239 people, disappeared on March 8, 2014. The search for the aircraft is ongoing in the southern Indian Ocean. Earlier, Liow said Malaysia wanted to seek re-election into the the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), adding that it would submit its candidature during the 39th session in Montreal later this month. “Malaysia was first elected to the council in 2007 and has taken on an active role. We have been reelected for the third consecutive term. “I look forward to the participation of airlines, regulators and industry in ensuring that Malaysia continues to retain the seat, and collaboration to further enhance the aviation industry in the country,” he said. On the Airbus A320neo, AirAsia group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said it delivered 15% in fuel savings and with additional range capacity of 500 nautical miles, this would translate into low fares.

Spirit AeroSystems Courtesy photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Officials at Spirit AeroSystems are paying attention to demand in the widebody jetliner market and how its largest customer reacts to it. That’s what Spirit president and CEO Tom Gentile said at Morgan Stanley’s Laguna Conference for investors on Thursday in California. Gentile was responding to a question about whether he had concerns regarding demand for widebody airliners and what a production rate cut by Boeing on its 777 would mean for the Wichita-based aerostructures supplier. Spirit builds the 777’s forward fuselage, wing leading edge, nacelles and struts. “We’re watching very closely … to what Boeing is saying and the rest of industry and being prepared to react,” Gentile said in a question-and-answer session with a Morgan Stanley analyst Thursday afternoon. Next year, Boeing plans to trim the rate from 8.3 777s a month to seven a month beginning in 2017. Since Boeing made that announcement earlier this year, demand for twin-aisle passenger jets has softened considerably, and many analysts think that could lead to another rate cut. “If there is a production cut, obviously that would reduce our revenue and profit in proportional amounts,” Gentile said. The effect of a second rate cut could be partially offset by an increase in production on the narrowbody 737 line – 737 production is expected to go from 42 airplanes a month to 47 next year – but not enough to fully offset it, he said. That would mean Spirit would look at how it could “accelerate some of our cost reduction initiatives,” Gentile said, including “how do we streamline some of our overhead and infrastructure, how do we combine things, how do we work with our supply base.” Spirit and Boeing officials also continue to work on a long-term pricing agreement for the manufacture of the 787-9 and the 737 Max. “We’re making good progress and we do expect to come to a resolution,” Gentile said, adding that there is no timetable for reaching an agreement.

Back To Top[*] China becomes first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast Sep. 16, 2016 - 05:30AM JST Boeing has forecast a demand for 6,810 new airplanes in China over the next 20 years. Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at $1.025 trillion. China is the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing’s forecast. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4% annually in China over the next 20 years.” Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes, such as the new 737 MAX 8 and current 737-800, through 2035, accounting for 75% of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year’s forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China’s single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18% of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China’s widebody fleet only represents approximately 5% of the global widebody segment. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Tinseth. Driven by China’s growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects investments of $5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies. Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

In May, the Danish ministry concluded in a report that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, but Boeing disputes this, saying the aircraft would last 9,500 hours. The report also estimated the total cost of the Lockheed-made F-35 at 42.2 billion Danish crowns (about $6.4 billion), compared with 60.6 billion crowns for the Super Hornet. ...

Boeing curtails OT pay for 80,000 workers in latest cost-cutting move By Dominic Gates Seattle Times Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Payroll cut So far this year, Boeing has shed just shy of 4,000 jobs in Washington. The company has also curtailed business travel, reduced purchases of advertising and squeezed out supplier costs. In another move to cut costs, Boeing told white-collar, salaried employees across the company on Tuesday that starting next month overtime pay will be severely limited. Citing “Boeing’s highly competitive market,” an internal memo says the company will “discontinue” paid overtime for U.S.-based salaried employees “except in the case of preapproved production- or mission-critical work.” The new policy, effective Oct.14, includes both nonunion salaried employees and some groups of unionized employees – including engineers. It covers about 80,000 employees, the company said. The policy is generating a lot of buzz among white-collar staff, said one Commercial Airplanes nonunion employee, who asked not to be identified when speaking without company permission. “For many, this is a pay cut,” the employee said. Boeing has been on a cost-cutting binge all year. Commercial Airplanes boss Ray Conner warned in February that Boeing was being “pushed to the wall” under pressure from Airbus and that jobs would have to be cut. In the memo that went out to managers Tuesday, company executives emphasized that employees are expected to get their work done without paid overtime. Joelle Denney, vice president of human resources at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said “nonunion employees are paid an annual salary to cover the roles and work assigned them, including the need to work more than 40 hours in a week without extra pay when their job requires it.” Scott Drach, vice president of Human Resources in Boeing’s Defense and Space unit, said “this new policy helps us change the focus from paying for hours worked to paying for business results.” If critical overtime work is necessary, overtime will be paid only when approved in advance by the employee’s direct manager, says the memo. “On the rare exception that it is required, review overtime requests with each employee to validate that there are no other options,” the memo directs managers. Federal law requires employers to pay overtime above a 40-hour week at a rate of time-and-a-half unless an employment agreement or collective-bargaining contract mandates otherwise. Salaried workers are generally exempt from this federal law and are not automatically entitled to overtime pay. However, Boeing has offered an “extended workweek” policy to this exempt group of employees that pays for overtime at the employee’s regular rate plus $6.50 per hour. It is this extended-workweek policy that is being discontinued except for critically needed work. Engineers represented by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace , who are salaried, are among those exempt from the federal overtime standard. Engineers will be affected by the new policy in that the amount of overtime available will be curtailed. However, under the SPEEA contract, any overtime they are granted must still be paid at the extra $6.50 per hour on top of their standard pay rate. Rich Plunkett, SPEEA’s director of strategic development, said in an interview Wednesday that many engineers are required to work mandatory overtime. He said the new policy suggests that might come to an end, “meaning that work won’t get done.” Plunkett added that the pressure on managers to justify any approval of overtime, and to do so only rarely, will inevitably drive managers to ask people to work extra hours without charging it to the company. The clampdown on overtime comes as Boeing engineers are scrambling to ramp up output, complete the designs of the 787-10 and 777X, and fix various production issues, including the new robotic system for 777 fuselage assembly. The memo states that nonunion employees will be paid for any overtime that is granted only if they work more than 44 hours in a week. There are no changes to overtime-pay policy for nonexempt employees such as the Machinists. Explaining the reason for the policy shift, Heidi Capozzi, Boeing’s senior vice president of human resources, said in the memo that “it really is a competitiveness issue.” “Today’s business environment requires us to become more efficient,” she wrote.

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 3:28 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Boeing challenges Denmark's choice of fighter jetsAFP – Thu, Sep 15, 2016 4:58 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter, was in the running for the Danish order, which had been debated for over 10 years Boeing accused the Danish government Thursday of overseeing a "fundamentally flawed" process to replace its fleet of fighter jets which saw the US defence giant lose out to competitor Lockheed Martin. In June, Denmark decided to replace its ageing fleet of F-16s with 27 US-built Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters in a deal valued at 20 billion kroner (2.69 billion euros, $3.02 billion). Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter's Typhoon model were also in the running for the order, which had been debated for over 10 years. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," Debbie Rub, a Boeing vice president, said in a statement. The company had submitted a request for the defence ministry to provide "all materials related to the fighter procurement evaluation and decision announced in June," it said. "We're taking this step because there's too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet," Rub said. She described it as "the first step toward bringing a formal legal challenge." Boeing said it had voiced concern earlier this year over the Danish evaluation process, in particular with a government estimate that "the Super Hornet would cost up to twice as much as detailed in US Department of Defense budget documents." Danish Defence Minister Peter Christensen said it was "natural" that only the company behind the winning bid would be happy with the outcome of the process. "I note that we have had a very thorough and transparent process," he told Danish news agency Ritzau. Denmark is one of nine partner countries, that also include Britain, Canada and Turkey, who are helping pay for the futuristic F-35A fighter jet's development. The country expects to take delivery of the F-35s between 2021 and 2026. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Crean enlisted to help Latrobe ValleyAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7335 -0.0081 -1.09% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5955 -0.0014 -0.23% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6930 -0.0047 -0.67% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

The Presidential Aircraft Recapitalisation (PAR) programme will replace presidential air transport VC-25A in the 2024 timeframe. The RFP was released following authorisation from US under secretary of defence for acquisition, technology and logistics Frank Kendall, which will enable to continue a deliberate step-by-step approach to reduce programme and cost risk. "We are committed to providing the (Executive) Office of the President of the United States with safe, reliable air transportation that provides high levels of security and communication capability." The proposal will allow Boeing to apply the results of the ongoing risk reduction activities to the proposal for the contract modification. The 747-8 will be modified to include electrical power upgrades, a mission communication system, a medical facility, executive interior, a self-defence system, and autonomous ground operations capabilities. Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) programme manager colonel Amy McCain said: “This is a significant step forward for this programme, which emphasises cost control and risk reduction, in balance with system performance, to meet the requirements of the presidential mission. “We are committed to providing the (Executive) Office of the President of the United States with safe, reliable air transportation that provides high levels of security and communication capability.” A third production representative aircraft is still under consideration for future procurement. McCain added: “The results of our ongoing risk reduction efforts are providing data that we can use to make sound decisions regarding the requirements and design trade-offs. "These requirements decisions will then be applied to Boeing’s EMD proposal. “We are focused on driving out costs where we can, to ensure this programme is affordable.” Related Content Follow Us:   Related News Deals this week: Boeing, Technica, Raytheon The Boeing Company has secured a $478.79m-worth prime contract award from...

Charles Mudede Seattle Is the No. 1 City in North America for Chinese Buyer Inquiries: This claim was made in The Province, a daily newspaper in British Columbia. The claim is backed by data gathered by Juwai.com, "a popular website in China that connects investors with international home sellers and real estate agents." The thing is this: The biggest city in British Columbia, Vancouver, recently imposed a huge tax (15 percent) on home purchases by foreign buyers. Most of these buyers are from China, and most have long concluded that the market they helped to inflate is now too expensive. The tax came at a time when profits from this form financial speculation were getting too squeezed. In short, the tax came too late. This global money is now looking for markets that are hot and cheaper. Seattle fits the bill. The Province reports: [Dean Jones, owner of Realogics Sotheby’s International Realty in Seattle,] said his company’s top sales in August were for Chinese buyers who set new prices in two Seattle neighbourhoods. They bought homes for about Canadian $6.5 million that would have cost about twice as much in comparable Vancouver neighbourhoods... The post also points out that many in China actually sympathize with the "pissed off" and priced out citizens of Vancouver and respect the government's decision to tax foreign buyers. Why? Because they are also experiencing the same fucking thing in their own cities. Their housing markets have been insanely inflated by speculators. The problem is not Chinese people. The problem is surplus capital. It's a real thing and it's constantly looking for places to grow. Boeing Screws Its Workers Again: This time around, white-collar, salaried employees of Boeing, a recent recipient of history-making tax breaks, are to be turned upside down and vigorously shaken for spare cash. Boeing believes this money will help to "cut costs" and protect profits for its shareholders. The shaking, which will take the form of severe limits on overtime pay, begins on October 14. Boeing told these workers that blame must be placed not on the company but on the competitive market. So, don't take it personally. It's just business. But many of the workers are not buying this neoliberal reasoning. They see what is what. They know they are getting a cold pay cut. This is not about competition; it's about class struggle. E. coli Outbreak Associated with Mexican Restaurant in the University District: This outbreak, which King County Public Health has linked to Memo’s Mexican Food, is not connected with the recent outbreak linked to Matador restaurant in Ballard. The one thing you must do today is feel sorry for those going through this illness. It is no joke. It lasts for a week or so and subjects you to painful cramps that come in waves. Mother Charged for Throwing Her 4-Year-Old Boy From a Small-Town Bridge: She claims it was all done in the name of fun, and that her boy, who wore a lifejacket, and who survived the fall into the waters of Wynochee River, wholly enjoyed the wholesome experience. But the authorities in Montesano, Washington failed to see the fun in all of this. To their eyes, she and the man she was with at the time of the tossing committed a crime. Body of Fisherman Recovered From Columbia River: His boat was found drifting on the river on Sunday. His body was pulled from the river yesterday. It was near the tip of an island. It once belonged to a fisherman from Sandy, Oregon. He was killed by water. The river is a strong and sullen god. Donald Trump Gets No Love in New Hampshire: New York Times reports that the Union Leader, a New Hampshire newspaper that has been "a conservative bulwark for generations," will for the first time in over a century not be endorsing a Republican nominee for president. It is instead endorsing the Libertarian Gary Johnson. The paper sees in this candidate the "lesser of two evils."

A Pennsylvania Teacher Brought a Loaded Gun To an Elementary School: And students found it left on a toilet tank in the bathroom.

Boeing said it had submitted a request to the country's ministry of defence that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision announced in June. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Boeing vice president Debbie Rub. In May, Boeing challenged the Danish government's recommendation to buy 27 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, questioning data which suggested its Super Hornet fighter jet was a more expensive option. Denmark's Defense Minister Peter Christensen confirmed that Boeing would get access to the requested information. "I note that we had a very thorough and transparent process before the Danish choice of fighter jet. This led to a broad political agreement," Christensen said in an email. A ministry report in May evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours. The report also concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns ($6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns. ($1 = 6.6284 Danish crowns) (Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; Editing by Alexander Smith) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Enlarge Caption  Email More A A COPENHAGEN: Boeing formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet over its own Super Hornet, saying on Thursday the choice was based on a "flawed evaluation process". Boeing said it had submitted a request to the country's ministry of defense that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision announced in June. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Boeing vice president Debbie Rub. In May, Boeing challenged the Danish government's recommendation to buy 27 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, questioning data which suggested its Super Hornet fighter jet was a more expensive option. Denmark's Defense Minister Peter Christensen confirmed that Boeing would get access to the requested information. "I note that we had a very thorough and transparent process before the Danish choice of fighter jet. This led to a broad political agreement," Christensen said in an email. A ministry report in May evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours. The report also concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns (US$6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns.

The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 percent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range -- just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 2,000 miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 -- dubbed the Max 10 -- that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming."     Next Article Loading comment count...

Boeing and Saab revealed their entry for the US military's T-X trainer replacement program. The new jet, simply called T-X, is like the lovechild of a F/A-18 Hornet and an F-16 Falcon, and as Boeing tells it, will provide "performance, affordability, and maintainability advantages" over the competition. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space, and Security's President and CEO said in an official statement. And Caret isn't not kidding about the Boeing T-X being both real and ready – Boeing is so confident that it built two examples before the official unveiling on Tuesday. The first jet, which Defense News reports will fly by the end of the year, debuted to media with the kind of pomp usually reserved for automotive debuts. Boeing/Saab will use the second jet – also featured on Tuesday – for structural proof testing. The needs of a training aircraft are quite different than those of a traditional fighter. The T-X features stadium-style seating, so the instructor riding in back has nearly as good a view as the student in front. Student evaluations should be easy, too, as the open software transmits data effortlessly between ground training systems and the jet itself. Functionally, Boeing claims the twin-tail layout provides more agility than a single-tail design – remember, the military's newest jets, the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II both use twin-tail layouts – while the Air Force can mount two weapon hard points on the jet's wings. According to Defense News, four manufacturers – Boeing/Saab, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin/KAI, and Raytheon/Leonardo/CAE – are vying for the contract to build 350 new trainers to replace the Air Force's fleet of aging T-38 Talons.

(Reuters/Toby Melville) Share Written by Caitlin Dwyer September 15, 2016 The couple sat at a steakhouse, a good bottle of merlot between them. Outside the big bay windows, boats were moored to a dock, rocking gently on Puget Sound’s tinfoil blue. Mike Sanders gazed at his wife across the table and thought about how he wanted to do something special for next year’s 15th anniversary. Lifting a glass of wine, he found himself unexpectedly proposing a trip to Hawaii. His wife’s eyes lit up. “There’s times when you say something and you’ll do anything to stuff those words back in your mouth,” Sanders recalls ruefully. Sanders was desperately afraid of flying. Not only of flying, but of airports, airport security, elevators and bridges—anything that forced upon him the sense of being stuck in a tight space. He often had anxiety attacks just picking people up from the airport, and the sound of the flight attendants closing plane doors triggered panic. He couldn’t imagine how he was going to sit inside an airplane for five hours over open ocean, with no way of getting out or getting off until the craft landed. But now he’d planted the idea of Honolulu in her head, and he knew he had to try. *** Clinical aviophobia affects about 6.5% of the US population, and about 15% of us have at least some anxiety about flying, according to a 2015 survey by Chapman University. But our fears are largely misplaced. In 2013, over 32,700 Americans died in highway fatalities. Only 443 Americans that year died in all sectors of aviation, including skydiving, air shows, and those little charters that haul prospectors to remote rivers in Alaska, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Yet these statistics are of little comfort to nervous fliers. They tend to pay more attention to the highly-publicized crashes that happen every so often: the Germanwings flight flown into a mountain in the French Alps by a suicidal pilot in 2015; the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014; the EgyptAir jet that crashed into the Mediterranean in 2016. Those high-profile disasters are extremely rare. But they can dominate the 24-hour news cycle, sending media consumers into loops of anxiety. Luckily, there are people who devote their careers and volunteer their weekends to educate the anxious and help them recapture some of the joy of flying–or at least endure the bumps with equanimity. Breaking the cycle of fear requires a combination of coaxing, practice, and sitting through a good old-fashioned science class. *** Sanders hadn’t always been afraid of flying. His father was an amateur pilot, and as an adult, he often traveled for work. But when he was in his 30s, his mother became ill, and he began flying to see her between legs of business trips. “I never connected the dots. I wasn’t a big drinker, but I’d have a couple glasses of wine on the plane to dull the anxiety,” he recalls. Then he started adding prescription pills. Then he stopped flying altogether.  “They construct elaborate first-person, intense stories about their worst fears, then read them over and over until they cease to be anxious.” “Somebody who develops an anxiety disorder around flying reacts to it in a kind of catastrophic way,” says Dr. Jason Guy Richards, a psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorders. “They are distracting themselves rather than processing it out. If you find ways to reify its danger, that’s what causes it to grow.” Dr. Richards adds that “escape and avoidance behaviors”—such as refusing to even drive near the airport, much less fly—are common. But confronting the fear is actually the best way to manage it. In Dr. Richards’ office, patients do disaster scripting. “They construct these really elaborate first-person intense stories about their worst fears of flying, then read them over and over until they cease to be anxious about the words and images,” says Dr. Richards. It may sound cruel to force already-skittish fliers to contemplate engine failure and fiery crashes. But desensitizing patients to their fears can actually help them to stop avoidance behaviors. Sometimes, the patient and psychologist sit inside a parked, locked car—mimicking the claustrophobia of a plane—and read the scripts together. “We get very good results from that,” he says. With Hawaii looming, Sanders also decided to face his fears. He signed up for a course at SeaTac’s Fear of Flying clinic, where a volunteer team of pilots, psychologists, flight attendants, and clinic graduates would help him control his phobia. At the clinic, clients learn from experts like Captain Robin Boone, who flew for Northwest Airlines for 35 years. Boone is both utterly convinced of the safety of planes and passionate about correcting misinformation. “So many people are just wracked with fear about flying, and it’s chiefly due to myths, falsities, lack of knowledge,” says Captain Boone. “I’ve never met a fearful pilot. Why aren’t pilots afraid? They know how flying works!”  “I’ve never met a fearful pilot. Why aren’t pilots afraid? They know how flying works!” Over two full weekends, clinic clients pick up the skills they need to take to the skies. Armed with binders full of diagrams and explanations, they tour air traffic control towers and maintenance facilities to see the complex ground systems that support flight. Some of the most common anxiety triggers for fearful fliers are crowds, enclosed spaces, and anticipation of motion sickness. So a psychologist teaches visualization, breathing, and body relaxation techniques to cope with those situations. A meteorologist explains why lightning strikes won’t harm an airplane. Pilots demonstrate the redundancies built into mechanical systems. Sanders particularly responded to understanding the science behind flying: “You’re arming yourself with knowledge,” he says. “With a little bit of knowledge, all of a sudden you can fight the anxiety.” The clinic’s graduation is a short flight together, often from Seattle to Spokane, Washington. For many, this is trial by fire. Captain Boone recalls one man who “had pulled the window shade all the way down, eyes closed, gripping his hands … I said, ‘Come on let’s raise it just a little bit.’ He raised it about an inch and saw a little daylight. Then a little more. Finally he said, ‘Look at that! There’s cars out there! There’s people!‘ He had a smile on his face as big as a Cheshire Cat.” Airplane manufacturers are also doing their part to help anxious fliers cope. Turbulence, for example, is one of the big triggers in aviophobia. As Captain Boone puts it: “Turbulence can’t hurt you, period.” But for many of us, jolts of rough air trigger some innate urge to grip the seat cushions and pray—or at the very least, complain that the beverage cart can’t come around. As manufacturer of many of the world’s commercial airplanes, Boeing has studied passenger response to turbulence. Boeing’s 787 “Dreamliner” planes incorporate a “smooth ride technology” that helps the plane anticipate high-amplitude pops. By monitoring changes in airflow and sending that information to the flight controls, the plane can adjust accordingly before the turbulence hits. “It’s kind of like putting the airplane on Prozac,” says Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing.  Boeing decided to make cabin windows 65% bigger after research showed that people who sit by the windows often feel calmer. Mechanics aside, the size of windows, lighting in the cabin and size and location of overhead bins all create a holistic feeling that can affect how anxious passengers get on a flight. Boeing decided to make cabin windows 65% bigger after research showed that people who sit by the windows often feel calmer. Tucking overhead bins away from the seats creates a more spacious feeling for passengers, relieving claustrophobia. Colorful interior lighting which modulates throughout the flight is intended to alleviate the hard shock of entering a new time zone. Boeing even spent time redesigning the bin latches to blend into the new aesthetic. Obviously, there’s a commercial advantage to such a philosophy—happier passengers fly more frequently. So Boeing’s design and engineering aims to reconnect people to the marvel of flight. “It’s already in their brains. We want our designs to re-trigger that,” says Emery. “Just about every feature that we have, if it opens up the sky to you, that’s what we’re going for.” *** There is one group of people for whom the delight and discovery of flying seems never to fade: pilots. “I saw the Northern Lights from 40,000 feet, flying west during one of the meteor showers in the fall,” says Captain Boone. He adds that in 21,000 hours in the air, he has never once been bored in the cockpit. “From coast to coast, for four hours, we were just regaled by this display.”  “The ordinary things we thought we knew become new or more beautiful.” In Skyfaring, his poetic memoir of life as a pilot, Mark Vanhoenacker muses that flying, at its best, reconnects us to a sense of wonder: “Airplanes raise us above the patterns of streets, forests, suburbs, schools, and rivers. The ordinary things we thought we knew become new or more beautiful, and the visible relationships between them on land, particularly at night, hint at the circuitry of more or less everything.” Perhaps that sense of wonder is a stretch for most passengers. The simple ability to fly without fear is a good enough goal. Sanders—now a volunteer for the Fear of Flying clinic—did go to Hawaii with his wife for their anniversary, and they have returned every year since. That said, he’s still not thrilled by flying. “About partway through the first leg to Honolulu, I started to become anxious,” says Sanders. “I told myself hey, you don’t have to be euphoric.” Nowadays, he just tries to watch a movie and eat some peanuts “in reasonable comfort.” By now Sanders has settled into a routine. He crosses the sliver of open air between the jetway and the plane and feels, for a brief moment, the blast of wet Seattle cool; enters the tight, recycled tautness of the machine’s interior atmosphere; smiles, perhaps slightly nervously, at the flight attendants. And then he does one more thing: he always shakes hands with the pilot. Something about looking the pilot in the eyes, seeing his uniform and feeling a firm grip, comforts him. And then he straps in and rises, fast and furious, through the Seattle drizzle, bumps through the thick coating of clouds and bursts into unexpected sunlight. The sky is endless and pearl-blue, the clouds ripped open by the tips of mountains. Then the plane banks, and people shift their gazes from the sparkle of sunlight to the dull glow of screens and magazines. They turn toward open ocean. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

They hope the single-engine two-seat aircraft will be able to replace the US Air Force's ageing fleet of T-38 trainer jets and meet the growing demand for future pilots capable of flying fifth-generation fighters. Recently, Sweden's Air Force itself experienced trouble in that the trainer planes it currently has in use have become far too obsolete to provide for the instruction of future Gripen pilots. Consequently, Saab, which previously suffered a row of painful setbacks when trying to sell its fifth-generation Gripen E jets across the globe, is now pinning its hopes on the T-X becoming a fixture in the US Air Force, which would obviously serve as its best advertisement in large parts of the world. The T-X is a "blank sheet" aircraft, specifically designed to meet US Air Force requirements for the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning. According to Boeing, the design is inexpensive, flexible and easily upgradeable. Remarkably, its twin tails were derived from Saab's Gripen and offer greater maneuverability and a higher attack angle.

Since a minimum order of 350 aircraft is anticipated, the major contract, worth 11 billion dollars, has attracted other major players as well.

The whole deal is estimated to be worth about $8 billion, and the Finnish military and politicians are looking at five different options, namely Saab's Gripen, Lockheed Martin's F-35, Boeing's F-18 Super Hornet, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault's Rafale. Saab's competitive edge is, first and foremost, its price. "A small nation like Finland needs to be able to afford to both purchasing and actually flying its jets. You do not buy something you can ill afford to use. But above all, it is important to have a plan that is capable of doing the job," Kim Jäämeri, the head of Finland's air force, told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. Another competitive advantage of the Gripen is that Sweden and Finland traditionally maintain a very high level of cooperation. It could be further facilitated if the two countries used the same fighter jet. According to circulating rumors, the Gripen and the F-35 are the two hottest candidates. The F-35 is scheduled for use in the US and by a number of its allies, including Norway. ...

Dubstep music played while flashing lights illuminated a drop cloth unveiling of the aircraft model. Then company executives had one more surprise: two of the actual jets. The first Boeing T-X trainer aircraft was revealed to the public in St. Louis, Sept. 13th, 2016. This aircraft will represent Boeing in the upcoming competition for the U.S. Air Force Training Mission. Photo: Boeing “Our T-X design features: twin tails, a modern design that allows better maneuverability than a single tailed aircraft, stadium seating that provides rear visibility to the instructor … and a maintenance friendly design,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said at the event in St. Louis, according to Defense News. “Just as impressive is what you can’t see. What you can’t see is the advanced design and manufacturing that went into this.” Boeing partnered with Swedish firm Saab to make the trainer, which is powered by a single GE 404 engine made by General Electric. The aircraft has a glass cockpit and open software to communicate across the trainer’s systems and with the ground, according to a release from Boeing. The plane comes with a non-required perk, as well: the potential to accommodate two hardpoints where external or internal loads can be placed. Trainees will also be able to practice refueling in the air if the Air Force chooses to do so.

Smallest jets from Boeing, Airbus offer 15% fuel saving and will open up new direct routes Thu, Sep 15, 2016, 12:57 Irish travellers are likely to be among the first to fly across the Atlantic in smaller planes. Photograph: Reuters         The smallest aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus are about to find a new role operating transatlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world’s biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 per cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range – just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern United States and western Europe. While eight hours on a 130ft plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travellers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that would not otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Cork and Shannon Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal’s TAP are among airlines buying the jets for transatlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing’s Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Cork and Shannon and Edinburgh and Birmingham in England to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. “The Max is very competitive,” Norwegian Air chief executive Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. “It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can’t go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure.” Boeing’s 757, the world’s longest single-aisle jetliner with about 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess modern models. ADVERTISEMENT Shorter flights The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on transatlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current transatlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada’s WestJet Airlines and link St John’s, Newfoundland, with Dublin – distance 2,000 miles – and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The UK and Irish routes planned for Norwegian’s 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they’ll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus’s A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, Norwegian spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The US carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with “transatlantic range”. TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the US. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country’s sixth-largest city. Aer Lingus Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, chief executive of parent company IAG, said in July, adding that the jet represents a “fantastic opportunity”. It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favoured successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. “For the moment we haven’t really got the planes out there,” said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. “But they’re coming.”       Topics: Bjorn Kjos Lasse Sandaker Nielsen Willie Walsh Yan Derocles Aer Lingus Airbus Boeing British Airways Iag Jetblue Airways Norwegian Air Norwegian Air Shuttle SAS Group United Continental WestJet Read More Ryanair’s profit forecast faces pressure as the airline cuts fares Wow Air to fly Dublin-Miami via Rekjavik Aer Lingus smartens service for ‘guests’ – just don't be late Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Germany says Commission has no right to decide on its fiscal space Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Among its plans is the 'double bubble' D8, which is a twin-hull plane that is designed to make the experience of flying more fuel efficient, with faster loading and unloading and a quieter, more comfortable takeoff. The design was initially developed by Aurora Flight Sciences and MIT in 2008, and now Nasa has awarded the company a $2.9 million (£2.19 million) contract to make a scale model of the aircraft. Scroll down for video  The 'double bubble' D8 plane is a twin-hull plane that is designed to make the experience of flying much easier, with faster loading and unloading and a quieter, more comfortable takeoff. The design started development by Aurora Flight Sciences and MIT in 2008, and now Nasa has awarded the company a $2.9 million (£2.19 million) contract to make a scale model BENEFITS OF THE D8  Increased fuel efficiency Improved air quality Less community noise Greater airport compatibility Faster boarding and deplaning Higher efficiency, even at transonic cruise speeds Improved passenger experience The X-planes were a celebrated part of post-war aviation, helping Nasa break the sound barrier and create more efficient planes.  The Virginia-based Aurora Flight Sciences is hoping to create the latest generation of X-plane with the D8, and says the plane will begin service in 2027. The 'double bubble' D8 Series future aircraft design concept came from a research team led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  It is designed to be over 50 per cent more fuel efficient than current best-in-class aircraft.  On a flight from LAX airport in LA to JFK in New York - a distance of 2,475 miles (3,983 km) - the D8 would save 2,095 gallons (9,524 litres) of fuel compared to the most efficient commercial aircraft available today.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Samsung blames manufacturing issues for exploding Galaxy...

A subscale model is shown being tested in a wind tunnel at MIT The design has the potential to cut fuel burn by 71 per cent, reduce noise and cut LTO NOx emissions by 87 per cent compared to a Boeing 737-800 narrow-body aircraft. A subscale model is shown being tested in a wind tunnel at MIT 'The idea there is to take some of the lift that you would normally get from the wings and try and move that to the fuselage,' said Michael Rogers, a research at Nasa's Ames Research Center.  'Another thing that's done to enable laminar flow on this vehicle is to reduce the sweep of the wings.  'It is easier to maintain laminar flow if the wings, instead of being swept back like a lot of modern commercial transports, are more sort of perpendicular to the side of the body of the plane.' According to Aurora, the D8 takes its inspiration from the famed Boeing 707 of 1958, which not only introduced the public to single-day world travel, but also used a tube-wing design that redefined passenger aircraft. The D8 is designed to fly at 582 mph (936 km/h) with 180 passengers over a range of 3,500 miles (5,500 km).

A scale version of the 'Blended Wing Body' (BWB) aircraft is currently being tested at a Nasa facility. The triangle-shaped plane, that could one day be used by the US military, is reminiscent of spy planes and designed to cut through the air more efficiently. Boeing is developing the plane alongside Nasa, and testing at the Nasa Langley Research Center in Virginia, in a 14- by 22-foot (4.2 by 6.7 metre) subsonic tunnel, and will continue testing until the end of September. In the BWB design, the wing blends seamlessly into the body of the aircraft, which makes it extremely aerodynamic and creates dramatic cuts in fuel consumption, noise and emissions. Boeing and Nasa researchers are using a 6 per cent scale, 13-foot-wingspan model to test their designs. The researchers will be mapping the flow of air over the aircraft using lasers and smoke with a technique known as particle imagery velocimetry (PIV).

ROS LBoard 1 ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Liow confirms flap found in Tanzania belongs to MH370 Tarrence Tan | September 15, 2016 Transport minister says the serial number and date stamp on the debris was confirmed by Boeing and its retailing manufacturer to belong to the ill-fated Boeing 777. VIDEO INSIDE SEPANG: Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai today confirmed that the large piece of plane debris found off the coast in Tanzania in July belongs to flight MH370, which went missing two years ago. Liow revealed that the serial number and the date stamp on the debris – which was an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap – was confirmed by both Boeing and the retailing manufacturer as belonging to the Malaysia Airlines’ aircraft. “This means we have to study how the accident happened. Was it a controlled or uncontrolled plunge into the sea? “All this will be analysed in detail and we hope we can get more details from this debris,” he told reporters after officiating AirAsia’s Airbus A320NEO welcoming ceremony today. Present were AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes, British High Commissioner to Malaysia Victoria Marguerite Treadell and Ambassador of France to Malaysia Christophe Penot. In July, a piece of aircraft debris, believed to be the outboard wing flap, was found on Pemba island, Tanzania, in the Indian Ocean. The part was then transported to Australia and analysed by its Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB). In the same month, Australia’s Infrastructure and Transport Minister Darren Chester said that the debris was very likely from the missing MH370. So far, debris believed to be from MH370 has washed up on Reunion Island, Mozambique, Mauritius and South Africa. Flight MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board after taking off from Kuala Lumpur and heading for Beijing. Most of the passengers on board MH370 were from China. There were 50 Malaysians on board the plane. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story. We welcome your opinions to allow a healthy debate.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google September 14, 2016 Boeing 737 Max jets will launch the age of $69 one way trans-Atlantic fares and it should start in March 2017 airplanes, economic impact, europe, future, tourism, united states, world Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA hopes to sell one-way tickets to Europe for $69 as early as 2017 by flying from U.S. airports that have low fees, Chief Executive Officer Bjørn Kjos said in an interview. Norwegian has 100 737 MAX jets from Boeing on order and expects to receive five in 2017. Boeing has said the 737 Max jets could be ready for delivery as early as March 2017. The 737 max 8 will have a range of a little over 4000 miles. According to Norwegian Air chief commercial officer Thomas Ramdahl, his airline is awaiting Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplanes to begin offering $69 trans-Atlantic flights. Ramdahl told Business Insider that his airline plans to make an announcement around November or December of this year with firm details of the $69 fares. "I can promise you that you will see trans-Atlantic flights on the 737Max next year," Ramdahl told us in an interview last week. "And that's when you will see the $69 fares." The 737 MAX 8 features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. As as result, the new jet offers airlines the range and performance to operate trans-Atlantic service with the lower cost of a narrow-body jet. the Boeing Co. is talking up ideas with potential customers that could include stretching the fuselage of the coming 737 MAX 9. The stretched MAX, the so-called MAX 10 — which would also include some engine upgrades — would reportedly be ready as early as 2020. The other option would involve larger CFM Leap-1A engines and could enter the market in 2022. Boeing is slated to deliver its first 737 MAX, one of the smaller Dash 8 models, to Southwest Airlines next year. Personal Norwegian Experience I have personally flown Norwegian three times on round trips. During off season prices from Oakland to Stockholm can be about $500 round trip. There is Vegas to Oslo flights in Nov as little as $300 round trip. Buying the tickets direct or with a discounter, the meals and checked bags are all extra (except the carry on bag). Picking the seat is extra. So we did not pick the seat and checked only one bag. Meal price comparable to price at a european airport. It is possible to bring sandwiches and snacks on board.

The challenge is identifying what in the various reports is directly relevant to the New Zealand aviation sector, and then determining how New Zealand companies can pursue the opportunities they present. Some of the interesting announcements included: Boeing predicts China will need 6810 new aircraft in the next 20 years Boeing’s 2016 market outlook estimates 15,130 new aircraft will go into Asia/Pacific in the next 20 years, Airbus puts it at 13,460. Asia/Pacific is predicted to need between 232,000 and 248,000 new pilots and between 217,700 and 268,000 new engineers in commercial aviation in the next 20 years, according to Boeing and Airbus China needs 2800 – 3000 new pilots per year but trains less than half that number Vietnam ordered 40 new aircraft from Airbus earlier this month, bringing total aircraft on order to 151. It has minimal domestic training capability New Zealand is well placed to take advantage of many of the training opportunities that are arising. In 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand introduced a new Part 147 maintenance training organisation rule and a new integrated professional pilot training programme. The new training rule and programme are aligned to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) rules which are followed in much of the Asia/Pacific region. ‘We can now provide training that our customers are familiar with, we have become more relevant and more credible to them’, said Nicholson. This is an important step in realising some of the new business opportunities. A number of our trainers are now recognised by the aviation regulators in several Asia/Pacific markets and several have been approved to train for specific markets. ‘Approval by overseas markets is another positive step’, said Nicholson.. While India and the UK have been important markets for our training industry for many years, we are seeing markets such as China, Japan, Indonesia, the Middle East, PNG and Vietnam becoming increasingly important. In many cases, the ability to open and build markets works best when Government and Industry work collaboratively. Vietnam is a good case in point where a Government to Government aviation collaboration agreement was signed last November and a good number of Vietnamese are now being trained by New Zealand companies, both in Vietnam and New Zealand. Developing opportunities presented by recent announcements in the Asia Pacific region is not for the faint hearted. It requires commitment, can be helped by collaboration between New Zealand companies, and can be accelerated where Industry and Government address one of the biggest challenges faced: ‘Why New Zealand’. ‘Get things right and our aviation training industry has a very bright future’, said Nicholson. -- Key facts about Aviation New Zealand Aviation New Zealand exists to lead, inspire and grow the New Zealand aviation industry. It was established in 1950 to encourage the safe growth of the aviation industry in New Zealand. In more recent years, it has also become involved in helping the international development of its members. o Aviation New Zealand has over 300 members and over 1300 on its database o Members include agricultural companies, air operators (fixed wing and rotary), aircraft designers and manufacturers, the UAV industry, airports, aviation trainers, emergency and medical services companies, helicopter companies, and parts manufacturers. Key facts about aviation in New Zealand An ‘early adopter’ in aviation terms – first international customer for Boeing; first pilot training school 1916; first airmail 1919; and quick appreciation of the suitability of aviation for agriculture, tourism and forestry. 4639 aircraft in New Zealand, one per thousand people, give New Zealand one of the highest aircraft per capita ratios in the world. Decades of policy innovation to support competition, safety and growth; 30m km² of safely managed airspace; and exports to over 100 countries on all continents. Aircraft fit-outs, new aircraft (including UAVs), GPS track and tracing systems, high precision processes (for example bait and fire fighting), composites, titanium powders, and aviation industry business and operational systems are just some of the exciting technologies and practices developing in New Zealand which set the scene for growth in the next 100 years. © Scoop Media   Tweet         Business Headlines | Sci-Tech Headlines BUSINESS, SCIENCE & TECH > >   Geographical Indications Bill Passes: Wine Industry Welcomes New Legislation “Our ‘Geographical Indications’ - the names and places where our wines come from - are at the very heart of the New Zealand wine story and this new law provides an additional level of protection for them.” More>> ALSO: NZ Govt - Good news for wine and spirit industries NZ First - Geographical Indicators Bill Patronises Maori Spirits NZ - Spirits NZ Welcomes Passage of Geographic Indicators Bill The Price Of Cheese: Appeal Court Turns Down Fonterra Bid To Keep Inferior Terms Fonterra Cooperative Group has lost its bid to overturn a High Court ruling against inferior terms offered to the suppliers of the failed New Zealand Dairies Ltd business in South Canterbury.

In 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand introduced a new Part 147 maintenance training organisation rule and a new integrated professional pilot training programme. The new training rule and programme are aligned to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) rules which are followed in much of the Asia/Pacific region. ‘We can now provide training that our customers are familiar with, we have become more relevant and more credible to them’, said Nicholson. This is an important step in realising some of the new business opportunities. A number of our trainers are now recognised by the aviation regulators in several Asia/Pacific markets and several have been approved to train for specific markets. ‘Approval by overseas markets is another positive step’, said Nicholson.. While India and the UK have been important markets for our training industry for many years, we are seeing markets such as China, Japan, Indonesia, the Middle East, PNG and Vietnam becoming increasingly important. In many cases, the ability to open and build markets works best when Government and Industry work collaboratively. Vietnam is a good case in point where a Government to Government aviation collaboration agreement was signed last November and a good number of Vietnamese are now being trained by New Zealand companies, both in Vietnam and New Zealand. Developing opportunities presented by recent announcements in the Asia Pacific region is not for the faint hearted. It requires commitment, can be helped by collaboration between New Zealand companies, and can be accelerated where Industry and Government address one of the biggest challenges faced: ‘Why New Zealand’. ‘Get things right and our aviation training industry has a very bright future’, said Nicholson. — Key facts about Aviation New Zealand Aviation New Zealand exists to lead, inspire and grow the New Zealand aviation industry. It was established in 1950 to encourage the safe growth of the aviation industry in New Zealand. In more recent years, it has also become involved in helping the international development of its members. o Aviation New Zealand has over 300 members and over 1300 on its database o Members include agricultural companies, air operators (fixed wing and rotary), aircraft designers and manufacturers, the UAV industry, airports, aviation trainers, emergency and medical services companies, helicopter companies, and parts manufacturers. Key facts about aviation in New Zealand An ‘early adopter’ in aviation terms – first international customer for Boeing; first pilot training school 1916; first airmail 1919; and quick appreciation of the suitability of aviation for agriculture, tourism and forestry. 4639 aircraft in New Zealand, one per thousand people, give New Zealand one of the highest aircraft per capita ratios in the world. Decades of policy innovation to support competition, safety and growth; 30m km² of safely managed airspace; and exports to over 100 countries on all continents. Aircraft fit-outs, new aircraft (including UAVs), GPS track and tracing systems, high precision processes (for example bait and fire fighting), composites, titanium powders, and aviation industry business and operational systems are just some of the exciting technologies and practices developing in New Zealand which set the scene for growth in the next 100 years.

The airline will run a twice-weekly service operated by an A330-200 aircraft with 250 seats. (AP) BEIJING, Sept 14, (AFP): China will become the world’s first trillion-dollar aviation market as its expanding middle class takes to the skies in ever greater numbers, US manufacturer Boeing predicted Tuesday. The world’s most populous country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth $1.03 trillion by 2035, Boeing said in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in China and throughout Asia, Boeing said. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 percent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. China’s rapidly growing e-commerce business — already the largest in the world — also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing’s deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe’s Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The US firm says it made more than half of China’s commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 percent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919, China’s first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Tinseth said Boeing was “absolutely” vigilant about Chinese competitors. “With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity” for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. “There are areas with COMAC where we’re partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors,” he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth $5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

QuickTake Jumbo Jets The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 percent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range -- just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. A Boeing Co. Max 737 jet. Photographer: Mike Kane/Bloomberg While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn’t otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Portugal’s TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing’s Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. “The Max is very competitive,” Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. “It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can’t go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure.” Boeing’s 757, the world’s longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS AB serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada’s WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John’s, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 2,000 miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian’s 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they’ll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus’s A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. Irish Interest JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with “trans-Atlantic range.” TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country’s sixth-largest city. Ireland’s Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a “fantastic opportunity.” It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 -- dubbed the Max 10 -- that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade’s end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It’s also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. “For the moment we haven’t really got the planes out there,” said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. “But they’re coming.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

TrendsMalaysia MH17 plane crash The video, published by the Segodnia.ru website, recalled that as the sole developer and manufacturer of all components of the BUK missile systems, Almaz-Antey held two consecutive experiments to shed the light on what happened to MH17. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine’s Donetsk Region on July 17, 2014. The lives of 298 people were lost in the tragedy, which took place in an area where Kiev’s troops were battling rebels who are rejecting the coup-imposed central power and battling for the establishment of a self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Two years after the crash, the official Dutch investigation ruled that the plane was brought down by a Russian-made BUK air defense system, but didn’t name the responsible side. Read more Russian bloggers slam Bellingcat MH17 investigation for ‘falsified evidence’ During the test firings, the Russian arms maker attempted to verify or refute the conclusions of the Dutch-led investigation into the tragedy, and revealed that the experts were wrong about the type of rocket that hit the plane, the place from where it was launched and the spot on the jet’s cockpit where the explosion took place. The international inquiry, however, ignored Almaz-Antey’s findings in an attempt to “make the events fit the already prepared scenario,” the company believes. The video alleges that the Dutch investigators pointed to the wrong type of warhead, having found just a couple of butterfly-shaped holes on the cockpit of the Malaysian Boeing downed over Ukraine. Meanwhile, one of the experiments by Almaz-Antey with same payload has produced dozens of such holes, which suggests that the international experts made a mistake in establishing the exact type of rocket that hit the plane. The angle at which Flight MH17 was hit, and therefore the place from where a missile was launched, were also calculated wrongly by the Dutch investigators, Almaz-Antey said. The plane’s cockpit was perforated by destructive agents during the Russian test. But on the debris of the downed Malaysian jet there were plenty of non-penetrating scratches, which indicate that the destructive agents traveled on a tangential trajectory. Russian arms producer challenges media criticism of its #MH17 crash inquiry – report https://t.co/5J9SH6SCi3— RT (@RT_com) September 15, 2016 The video also draws attention to alleged violations and investigation procedure failures during the MH17 inquiry. Not all of the rubble was collected at the crash site by the Dutch experts, it said. While the collected fragments that contradicted the results that the investigation wanted to achieve were showcased separately from the other parts. “But these are the debris that can drastically change the perception of what happened” to the Malaysian airliner, the authors of the video stressed.

Some companies, including United Continental Holdings Inc., are still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives, their fuel consumption way in excess of that of modern jets. The 737 is itself a fifty-year-old design, still in production but much-tweaked. It and the A320 were designed for much shorter flights. The original 737-100 seated just 85 people and was limited to trips of about 1,930 km. While ranges have increased, the 5,310-km. reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes, where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 800 km. in an emergency. There is also talk, on such industry websites as AirInsight, of Bombardier’s CSeries twin-engined airliner being used over the Atlantic in a dedicated business-class service, or carrying heavier loads if it turns out, as some have been saying, that the new Canadian jet has greater range than expected. A handful of carriers operate the older narrow-body planes on services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range.

pacific 16.09.2016 Kuala Lumpur Features archive related news Japan, Malaysia affirm shared stance on sea disputes Japan, Malaysia PMs committed to regional trade pact Malaysia ex-PM urges rallies for protest against Razak Malaysia hopes to name MH17 shooter early 2018 Malaysia begins pilot job project for Rohingya refugees By P Prem Kumar KUALA LUMPUR A team investigating missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will begin probing whether the commercial aircraft was deliberately ditched or experienced an uncontrolled fall while carrying 239 people, according to Malaysia's transport minister. Liow Tiong Lai told Anadolu Agency on Friday that both the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the MH370 Safety Investigation Team will look into details of debris confirmed to belong to the aircraft to determine the falling mode of MH370 in March 2014. "The teams will examine into other details now and study how the accident happened -- whether it was a controlled or uncontrolled ditch into the sea," he said in a telephone conversation. The minister had earlier dismissed a report claiming that evidence had shown that MH370 was deliberately crashed into the Indian Ocean by its pilot, and underlined that the ATSB had reported the incident was an "uncontrolled ditch". His comments Friday come a day after he confirmed that a piece of debris -- an inboard flap of a Boeing 777 -- found in Tanzania last June originated from MH370. In a statement late Thursday, Liow said the debris was determined to be from the missing aircraft after several numbers as well as its physical appearance and dimensions were found to match those of the ill-fated flight. "A date stamp indicated that it was manufactured on Jan 23, 2002, and consistent with the May 31, 2002, delivery date for MH370,” Liow said. "Besides the Boeing part number, all identification stamps have a second OL number which are unique identifiers relating to the part," the minister highlighted. He added that an Italian parts manufacturer had confirmed that all numbers located on the recovered debris relate to the same outboard flap shipped to Boeing and delivered to Malaysia Airlines. Flight MH370, carrying 239 passengers and crew, disappeared from radar shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur enroute to Beijing on March 8, 2014. The jetliner has yet to be found despite massive search operations in the southern Indian Ocean where the aircraft was believed to have ended its flight after diverting from its original route. The search and rescue mission -- which began immediately after -- involved some 160 assets as well as experts from 25 countries. To-date, at least six pieces of aircraft debris found along Africa’s east coast have been confirmed as “almost certainly” coming from MH370 . After 10 months of intensive undersea search for the vanished flight, on Jan. 29 2015 Malaysia declared that MH370 was lost in an accident, killing all passengers. On July 29 last year, a piece of aircraft debris was found washed ashore on the French island, east of Madagascar. The debris -- believed to be from a Boeing 777 -- was sent to Toulouse, France, for analysis the following day. Days after, Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that the flaperon was from MH370, and that the flight indeed ended in the Indian Ocean. On July 22, ministers from Malaysia, Australia and China decided during a tripartite meeting to suspend the search operations for MH370, after competing the current earmarked 120,000-square kilometer search area.

X Travel Warrior: Aircraft sales set to gain altitude in China, says Boeing Growth in air travel predicted to rise 6.4 per cent annually over next 20 years Fri, Sep 16, 2016, 05:00 Joan Scales China is predicted to spend more than $1,025 trillion on aircraft over the next two decades.         Boeing has revised upwards the 2015 estimate of the number of aircraft China airlines will order from 6,330 to 6,810 over the next two decades. China will spend more than $1,025 trillion (€915 billion) on aircraft. The order is part of China’s 13th five-year plan, which began this year. Air travel is booming in China with a new middle class taking overseas trips. Growth is expected to rise 6.4 per cent annually over the next 20 years. China is also expected to overtake the United States in business travel in the next year. Concur, the expense management company owned by SAP, is to acquire the online travel company Hipmunk. Established in 2010 with funding of $20 million, Hipmunk offers flight searches and accommodation including hotels and Airbnb rentals. Concur allows employees to book travel in compliance with company policy. Hipmunk chief executive Adam Goldstein said: “This combination with Concur means we can do a even better job for frequent travellers.” Instead of channel-hopping when you stay in a Marriott hotel, how about browsing the inspirational offerings from TED? A partnership between the two companies will mean offerings of talks, blogs and quotes with a different theme each quarter. TED will curate content for Marriott guests delivered over in-room entertainment systems and wifi. Marriott regulars will have a chance to attend a series of five TED Talks Fellows salons at properties in Washington state, London, Dubai, Bangkok and Santiago. Between now and December 2nd, British Airways is giving free upgrades to first class to some of its business-class passengers. In an effort to increase the profile of Club World and first class, some lucky travellers will get an upgrade in one direction. Your upgrade can be free when you book an eligible R. D, or C class, or a full flexible J-class fare for travel up to December 23rd. You cannot book it online it has to be booked direct with BA or through a licensed travel agent.

Carry on: Boeing stretches 737, China’s trillion-dollar fleet and more Nevil Gibson WEEKEND REVIEW Friday September 16, 2016 Share Boeing 737-8 Max In Carry On, Nevil Gibson reveals Boeing's plans for a bigger 737 Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Boeing to stretch 737 Max Boeing is studying two designs for its so-called Max 10, a potential stretch of its largest 737 aimed at making up ground on Airbus’ longest single-aisle jet. One option is a simple lengthening of the 737 Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of Airbus’s A321neo. The alternative is a more elaborate revamp that would feature a larger new generation engine option (neo). The upgraded Max 9 version could enter the market by early 2020, while the more complex one wouldn’t begin service until almost two years later. Airbus, meanwhile, has already received almost 1300 orders for the A321neo, with a long-range version scheduled to begin commercial operation in 2019. Boeing tips trillion-dollar fleet for China Boeing says in a new forecast that China will be the first country with a trillion-dollar airline fleet. The manufacturer says Chinese airlines are likely to purchase 6810 planes worth $US1.025 trillion in the next 20 years. This estimate is 7.6% higher than the 6330 aircraft predicted last year. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," says Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing. China’s passenger traffic is forecast to increase 6.4% annually over the next 20 years. Singapore turns back on A380 Singapore Airlines (SIA) won't be renewing the lease on the first ever Airbus A380 to enter service. The 10-year lease expires next month and four others are on a similar arrangement. SIA has a total of 19 A380s in its fleet and is not ordering any more. In July, Airbus said it would slash production of the A380 to 12 planes a year in 2018 from 27 last year due to lack of orders. National Travel Industry Awards Air New Zealand collected two awards – best international airline online and best agency support. Etihad Airways was named best international airline offline.

A large piece of debris found in Tanzania recently which has been confirmed as a part of a wing flap from missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet MH370. Photo: Australian Transport Safety Board The fragment, said to be the inboard section of the right, outboard flap of the plane, was recovered in June. MH370, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, had 239 people on board when it vanished in March 2014. The Boeing 777 is presumed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean after veering off course. The piece is now being examined for any evidence that may indicate how the flap was operating at the time of separation from the wing, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a report. This could help throw light on whether the plane was being flown when it came down in the sea. The part numbers and a date stamp on the piece, recovered on Pemba island, helped the investigation. Aircraft debris, suspected to be part of the missing MH370 Malaysian airlines plane, found at the Gris Gris public beach near Souillac, in the southern part of Mauritius Island on May 24. Photo: AFP PHOTO / Mauritius National Coastguard In addition to the Boeing part number, the report said, the identification stamps had an "OL" number, both unique identifiers to part construction. The Italian part manufacturer then recovered build records for those numbers, confirming that they belonged to the missing plane. A number of other pieces of debris, some confirmed to have come from MH370, have been found in recent months off the coast of neighbouring Mozambique and Madagascar. They include a section of the wing called a flaperon, found on Reunion Island, and a horizontal stabilizer from the tail section and a stabilizer panel with a "No Step" stencil discovered in Mozambique. All the debris are believed to have been driven westwards from the presumed crash site on ocean currents. Australia has been leading the search for the missing aircraft, using underwater drones and sonar equipment deployed from specialist ships. The search, also involving Malaysia and China, has led to more than 105,000 sq km of the 120,000 sq km search zone being scoured so far. But countries have agreed that in the absence of "credible new information" the search is expected to end later this year. - BBC Tags: transport MH370 Malaysia Airlines Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Google Plus Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Copyright © 2016, Radio New Zealand Next story in World Suicide blast kills Pakistan worshippers Related Stories Malaysian authorities 'ignoring' new MH370 evidence 10 Aug 2016 A group representing the families of those onboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 say the Malaysian Government isn't interested in investigating what could be crucial new evidence.

Saturday, November 19, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Nation  Malaysia confirms Tanzania debris came from MH370 September 16, 2016, Friday PUTRAJAYA: Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) experts have concluded that the debris discovered on the island of Pemba, off the coast of Tanzania, in June this year originated from the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 aircraft, said Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai. He said the ATSB, with the concurrence of the MH370 Safety Investigation Team, made the conclusion based on thorough examination and analysis of the debris, an outboard flap which was found on June 20 this year. Liow said ATSB had identified several part numbers, along with physical appearance, dimensions and construction, and confirmed the piece to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap. “A date stamp associated with one of the part numbers indicated manufacture on Jan 23, 2002, which was consistent with the May 31, 2002, delivery date for MH370,” he said in a statement here yesterday. In addition to the Boeing part number, he said, all identification stamps had a second “OL” number that were unique identifiers relating to parts construction. Liow said the Italian parts manufacturer had confirmed that all numbers located on the part related to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404. He said the manufacturer also confirmed that aircraft line number 404 was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO (MH370). “As such, the experts have concluded that the debris, an outboard flap originated from the aircraft 9M-MRO, also known as MH370,” he said. Liow said further examination of the debris would continue in hopes that further evidence might be uncovered to provide new insight into the circumstances surrounding flight MH370. He said the Transport Ministry would continue to provide updates as and when new information becomes available. Liow also extended the ministry’s appreciation to the authorities in Tanzania and Australia for their support and assistance. Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board. The plane has yet to be found despite a massive search operation in the southern Indian Ocean where it was believed to have ended its flight. – Bernama What do you think of this story?

Denmark this year said it would buy the Lockheed Martin Co. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's biggest weapons program. Boeing had offered its F/A-18 Super Hornet. The Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a consortium of Airbus Group SE, BAE Systems PLC, and Leonardo-Finmeccanica SpA also lost out. Though U.S. contractors often challenge Pentagon decisions, such action is rare overseas. "We believe the Ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," Debbie Rub, vice president and general manager for global strike programs at Boeing, said Thursday. The Danish Defense Ministry in May recommended the purchase of 27 F-35 combat planes to replace the country's aging F-16 jets. Denmark has been using the F-16, also made by Lockheed Martin, in the Middle East as part of the coalition striking Islamic State targets. The decision was later endorsed by the government in June. Denmark said it planned to take delivery of the planes between 2021 and 2026. The decision was a setback for Boeing, which has been scrambling for export orders to keep the F/A-18 in production. U.S. orders for the plane are nearing an end. "We're taking this step because there's too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet," Ms. Rub said. Boeing has slowed production to just two jets a month, though the company has become more confident over the past year that it can keep the line in St. Louis open into the 2020s. Dan Gillian, the jet's program manager, said this week Boeing was confident about securing additional orders from the U.S. Navy. It is also trying to complete an order for as many as 28 planes from Kuwait that is still awaiting final U.S. government approval after Israel raised concerns about the planned deal. Boeing also remains hopeful it can secure a share of Canada's plan to update its fighter fleet after shelving an initial plan to acquire F-35s from Lockheed Martin Corp. The Danish Defense Ministry published its selection criteria and said the F-35 won in all categories covering everything from military performance to industrial aspects. The document angered both losing bidders. Boeing said it has submitted a so-called Request for Insight to the Danish Defense Ministry, requiring it to turn over documents related to the decision. The ministry said Boeing would be given access to the information. A spokeswoman said the process had been "transparent" and led to broad political agreement. "It is natural that in a process like this only the company that wins ends up being satisfied," she said. Airbus, which led the losing Eurofighter bid, Wednesday said it noted Boeing's move "with interest." The Toulouse, France-based plane maker said "we have similar concerns about the rigor of the competition and the quality of the technical assessment of the candidates." Airbus said it remained in talks with the Danish government to have those concerns addressed.

Your next trans-Atlantic trip may be on Boeing's humble 737 (Bloomberg)—The smallest aircraft made by Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world's biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 percent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest intercity services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range—just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time, people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh; Birmingham in England; and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic Coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of more modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operates services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS AB serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City Airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with near-normal loads are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin—distance 2,000 miles—and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway as well as Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus' A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. IRISH INTEREST JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city. Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9—dubbed the Max 10—that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of midrange aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years.

Boeing said it had submitted a request to the country's ministry of defence that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision announced in June. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Boeing vice president Debbie Rub. In May Boeing challenged the Danish government's recommendation to buy 27 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, questioning data which suggested its Super Hornet fighter jet was a more expensive option. A ministry report in May evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours. The report also concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns ($6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns.

Additionally, the company said the initial run of the iPhone 7 Plus has sold out globally. United Technologies — Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes has added the chairman's title, effective immediately. Edward Kangas, who had been non-executive chairman, will now serve as independent lead director. Sony — Sony has no plans to market a smartphone-based headset, according to the head of its gaming division, who told Reuters the company is focusing on expanding content for its dedicated virtual reality headset into non-gaming areas. McDonald's — McDonald's has received at least three final bids for its China and Hong Kong outlets, according to Reuters, with offers worth up to $3 billion. Wynn Resorts — Wynn is poised to add to its 20 percent September gain in today's trading, on continuing indications of a recovery in the Macau gambling market.

Plane Part Found Off Tanzania From Flight MH370 International Business Times 15-09-2016 Suman Varandani © Provided by IBT US A large flap section found on the island of Pemba, off the coast of Tanzania, belongs to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Thursday. The announcement by ATSB, which is leading the search for the Flight MH370, comes as the search for the missing plane is set to be suspended in December. ATSB released photos of the flap section and explained why they believe the debris piece was from the outboard flap of a Boeing 777, the same aircraft as Flight MH370. Over the last few months, several debris pieces have been found, with some being linked to the missing jet. However, there is still no evidence as to what happened to the place which disappeared from radar on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. "On arrival at the ATSB, several part numbers were immediately located on the debris that confirmed the preliminary identification. This was consistent with the physical appearance, dimensions and construction of the part," ATSB wrote. "All of the identification stamps had a second “OL” number, in addition to the Boeing part number, that were unique identifiers relating to part construction. The Italian part manufacturer recovered build records for the numbers located on the part and confirmed that all of the numbers related to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404. Aircraft line number 404 was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO." © Photo: ATSB Exemplar part number and date stamp. Exemplar part number and date stamp. Photo: ATSB The ATSB announced last month that replicas they have made of a flaperon found last year in the French-controlled Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean will be used to determine how the debris, affected by the wind and the currents, drift. Several conspiracy theories have surfaced over the plane's disappearance, with some allegations against the plane's captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Over the weekend, reports surfaced that a debris piece found in Madagascar hinted at a fire on board the jet.

(Photo: ATSB)  Enlarge Caption  Email More A A KUALA LUMPUR: A large piece of debris that was discovered on Pemba island off the Tanzanian coast on Jun 20 came from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai confirmed on Thursday (Sep 15).  In a statement, Mr Liow said this was deduced by experts from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) with the concurrence of the MH370 Safety Investigation Team. Earlier, in July, Australia's Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Darren Chester had said that it was "highly likely" the part came from the ill-fated Boeing.  One of the reasons was that "several part numbers, along with physical appearance, dimensions and construction confirmed the piece to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap", said the minister. He added that a date stamp associated with one of the part numbers indicated manufacture on Jan 23, 2002, which is consistent with the May 31, 2002 delivery date for MH370.   Other clues include how the Boeing part number and all the identification stamps had a second "OL" number that uniquely identify part construction. The Italian manufacturer of the flap also supported that all the numbers located on it relate to the same serial number part that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404 - tacked to a delivery to Malaysian Airlines registered as 9M-MRO or MH370.  "Further examination of the debris will continue," the statement read.  - CNA/hs Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The US planemaker is deep in talks with customers over ways to fill the gap in its offerings between the narrow-body 737 and wide-body 787 Dreamliner families, as Airbus Group SE grabs sales with the A321neo jet. Talks are focused on two potential planes: The so-called Max 10, a stretched version of the largest 737 model that could reach the market by decade’s end, and the first of a family of mid-range jets to debut about five years later. “We could potentially do both,” Muilenburg said yesterday at a Morgan Stanley conference, noting that sticking with its current portfolio is also an option. “We’re looking across all of those scenarios. We don’t see any of those changing our R&D and capex profile over the five-year time period because of the timing.” Keeping new airplane spending in check is crucial for Boeing, which is finally breaking even on the 787 Dreamliner after a decade of production and about US$30 billion (RM123.8 billion) in deferred costs. The Chicago-based company’s research and development spending should peak this year, Muilenburg said, as Boeing starts to make the first 787-10, prepares for the 737 Max’s debut next year and finalises design for the 777X, which is targeted for a 2020 market entry. Cash challenges Since he took over as chief executive last year, Muilenburg has sought to improve efficiency within Boeing’s sprawling factories and through its supply chain. Raising profit margins to the “mid-teens” by decade’s end would give the aerospace company the means to invest in products while still handing over a cash bounty to shareholders. But Boeing could be hard-pressed to hit cash-flow targets as it counts on the 787 Dreamliner and higher narrow-body output to offset lower production rates for the 777 and the costs of developing the initial 777X, David Strauss, an analyst at UBS Group AG, said in a Sept 12 report. He estimates the 777X will burn US$7 billion to US$8 billion prior to initial delivery in 2020. “We think BA cash generation will come through below expectations as 787 progress is offset by initial 777X investment, tougher pricing in the backlog, pension, customer advances and cash taxes,” Strauss wrote. ‘Viable option’ Muilenburg is confident Boeing could develop a new narrow-body quickly and without much strain on its resources if there is sufficient interest from airlines and lessors. The new model, dubbed the Max 10, would enter service by 2019 or 2020 and be a “relatively minor development program,” he said. “That’s a viable option and a potential opportunity for us in the marketplace,” Muilenburg added. “We’re thinking through the business case right now, talking with customers.” Bloomberg reported Sept 8 that Boeing and CFM, the engine maker for the Max, have focused in recent weeks on a simple redesign of the 737 that would approach the range and capacity offered by Airbus’s hot-selling A321neo. The new, longer jet would need a relatively uncomplicated new landing gear and would benefit from a performance upgrade that increases the thrust of the Leap-1B engines developed for the latest 737 models. Boeing also is studying a more extensive revamp of the aircraft that would use a larger engine created for Airbus by CFM, which is a venture of General Electric Co and Safran SA. The engineering and design work on the proposed models would come as Boeing wraps up the most intensive planning for the planes already in its new-product pipeline. “I like the sequencing,” Muilenburg said. “If we need to, we can do a Max stretch or a middle-of-market airplane or both and they would feather in very nicely and give us a nice, stable R&D profile.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Joe Sutter, father of the Boeing 747, dies at 95 Boeing says it will cut more than 4,500 jobs by mid-2016 United reported to have ordered 25 more Boeing 737s worth US$2b Boeing wins US$1.3b 737 order from China’s Okay Air Boeing forecasts 2016 earnings below estimates as shares tumble Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Boeing to curb overtime for US salaried workers to reduce costs Reuters 9/14/2016 By Alwyn Scott Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it is curbing use of paid overtime by 80,000 salaried workers based in the United States, part of a company-wide effort to reduce costs to deal with intense competition. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 146.03 +0.70 +0.48% Starting Oct. 14, Boeing will halt overtime for salaried employees not entitled to overtime pay by law "except in the case of pre-approved production- or mission-critical work," according to an internal memo confirmed by a company spokesman. When such work is needed, "Boeing organizations that pay exempt overtime — and most don't — will pay it only when it is discussed with and approved in advance by the employee’s direct manager," the memo said. Pay for Boeing's union employees will follow existing labor contracts and overtime for those workers is already managed. "This new policy is another step in the company’s efforts to improve our affordability and competitiveness so that we can better position ourselves to grow sales to customers," spokesman Chaz Bickers said in an email. Boeing is under intense pressure to win sales over rival Airbus (AIR.PA), as airlines have slowed buying new jetliners. Weak sales, particularly of twin-aisle jetliners, may make Boeing miss its target of selling about 740 plane sales this year, Boeing's chief executive said on Wednesday.© REUTERS/Robert Sorbo/File Photo File photo of fuselage of a Boeing 787 in Everett The overtime memo told managers of U.S.-based exempt salaried employees that they should arrange staffing to reduce the use of overtime through such measures as sharing work across similar teams, training employees or using flexible schedules. "By curbing exempt overtime pay, Boeing is challenging leaders and employees to come up with work solutions that curb the need to work overtime," said the memo, which was first reported by the Seattle Times. Boeing's white-collar engineering union said the new policy likely would not affect many of its 19,000 members, since they are governed by labor contracts. Professional engineers receive regular pay plus $6.50 an hour when they work past 40 hours. A group of about 20 pilots do not have that provision. A spokesman for the machinists union said it was not immediately clear what impact the change would have on its 31,000 members.

They were guys he met online. “Looking at them in a bar, you would have no idea,” Hillman said. ”They’re just normal guys.” The men worked for some of the region’s most prominent employers: Microsoft, Boeing, Amazon. One was a radiologist. Another was a dentist.   During their meetups in local bars, the men would discuss their “hobby” — hiring Korean prostitutes. “I remember sitting there the first time, and I was just like ... looking around, praying that nobody would see me sitting with these guys and would hear what they were saying,” Hillman said. The men didn’t know that Hillman, the man they had invited into their elite circle, was actually an undercover detective. Law enforcement is beginning to take notice of so-called “John boards” — review sites where customers rate prostitutes. The men busted in this Seattle group earlier this year exposed a secretive world where online sex buyers are treading on a whole new level of criminal behavior. The men had met on TheReviewBoard.net (that now leads to a notice saying it was seized by the King County Sheriff's Office). It’s one of many sites across the country where men rate prostitutes. Investigators estimate the Review Board had between 15,000 and 20,000 members. The men would describe a woman's weight, race, breast size, which sex acts she was willing to perform and her hourly rate. Hillman wrote fake reviews and was invited to join a subgroup that called itself “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.” Police documents show they were spending $300 per session, multiple times a week. Screen capture from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen’s password-protected website showing activity and handles of active members. - Photo courtesy of King County Sheriff’s Office The League attracted the attention of law enforcement not because its members bought a lot of sex, but because of how they worked together. The men wrote glowing reviews to draw customers to their favorite women. That kept the women in town longer and encouraged the seven agencies supplying the women to send new prospects their way. “So they were really operating as pimps,” said Valiant Richey, a senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County and one of the lead attorneys on the case.  “They’re charged with promoting prostitution because they expanded the market, they facilitated visits to these women, they connected new buyers to the women and helped with the screening process." After six months of undercover surveillance, law enforcement closed in. They busted eight brothels. A dozen Korean women were offered human trafficking victim services and released. Surveillance video recorded by undercover detective Luke Hillman of the King County Sheriff’s Office during one of The League’s meet-ups in a Seattle bar November 10, 2015. In this clip, League leader Charles Peters describes the growing number of “K-girls” (Korean prostitutes) in the area and concerns that the market has gotten too large. The league’s website and the larger website, the Review Board, were seized. “We’ve just taken down one small tentacle of what’s going on,” said King County Sheriff John Urquhart at a news conference announcing the arrests in January. “There are still umpteen websites out there that we haven’t gotten to — yet.” Instead of charging the 16 league members with buying sex, a misdemeanor, they were charged with promoting prostitution — a felony. More than half have pleaded guilty. At his sentencing, one of the men, Paul Rhinehart, expressed remorse and said he’d been drawn into friendships and lost perspective. “I took on a misguided feeling that this was a community like other legitimate communities,” he told the court. About 15 percent of American men buy sex at some point. Only a small fraction of them are “hobbyists” like the men in Seattle. This review board is gone, but it has left a digital trail that could help law enforcement come to a better understanding of how frequent buyers operate. Alex Trouteaud of youthSpark in Atlanta studied the data on North American sex buyers. He found 5 percent of them account for nearly half of illegal sex transactions. In order to feed their habit, these buyers need to find new sources of sex and avoid the cops. That means they have to share intel. “'John boards are far and away the fastest and easiest place to find these individuals,” Trouteaud said.  Prosecutors said the Seattle case opened up a new window into the sex trade, where internet crowdsourcing allows buyers to work together to blur the lines between supply and demand.   This story was produced with Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Wearable computing vendors such as Honeywell International Inc. and Zebra Technologies Corp. could see a steep jump in sales by 2021, as retailers and logistics providers are on track to triple their spending on wearable scanners for fulfillment work, a report says. Led by demand from the warehousing, manufacturing, and transportation industries, global shipments of wearable scanners are forecast to reach nearly 22 million units by 2021, up from seven million units in 2016, according to the London-based analyst firm ABI Research. Companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Boeing Co., Deutsche Post DHL Group, FedEx Corp., IBM Corp., and UPS Inc. need a more efficient way for their workers to scan barcodes on packages during picking and packing operations, the firm says. In response, wearable computing devices are quickly migrating from consumer applications like the Fitbit and Apple Watch to business tasks such as warehousing and fulfillment, according to the ABI report "Enterprise Wearable Scanner and Reader Technologies: Devices, use cases, and supplier ecosystem analysis." That trend is driving demand for products such as wearable ring scanners from Honeywell and Zebra, glove scanners from manufacturers like ProGlove, and smart glasses from providers such as Vuzix Corp., ABI says. "Wearable scanners boost business productivity, offering workers a faster, hands-free alternative to the need for traditional hand-held scanners and paper picklists," Stephanie Lawrence, an ABI research analyst, said in a statement. "Ring barcode scanners, glove scanners, and smart glasses are the most popular forms, which, depending on the device type, allow their wearers to scan barcodes, record processes, and access information without interruption." #Logistics #Automatic Data Capture Resources Mentioned In This Article ABI Research Amazon.com Boeing Inc.

This research report titled 'Global CFD Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. The report presents the vendor landscape and the corresponding detailed analysis of the major vendors in the market based on revenue. The report, also, considers the revenue obtained from the sales of software licenses. The aerospace and defense industry manufacturers are facing high pressure to reduce the product development cycle. CFD is mainly used in the second stage of the product development cycle. In the designing stage, the simulation and optimization processes are carried out using software such as computer-aided engineering (CAE) software. The designing stage is a vital stage in the product development life cycle as it can reduce the time and cost of production of aerospace and defense products. Hence, industries are highly dependent on the software to reduce product development cycle time.

Technavio's ICT analysts categorize the global CFD market into four major end-user segments. They are: Aerospace and defense industry Automotive industry Electrical and electronics industry Others Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=52389 Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question about this market and they will have your answer within 24 hours. Aerospace and defense industry The aerospace and defense industry accounted for a market share of almost 41% in the global CFD market in 2015. Most of the major players in the market are owned or controlled by the governments of their countries and consider the revenue generation as confidential. In 2015, the high adoption of CFD by companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, General Dynamics, and Bombardier Aerospace for R&D activities contributed to the growth of the global CFD market. The aerospace and defense industry also had high R&D investments in 2014 and 2015. Before the evolution of CFD, aircraft manufacturing companies used wind tunnel testing and flight testing to check the performance of designed products. With the development of fast and highly efficient computers, the traditional tools and methods of testing were replaced by numerical simulation methods based on the Navier-Stokes equation. The Navier-Stokes equation is used to describe the motion of fluid substances using Newton's second law of motion. According to Ishmeet Kaur, a lead enterprise application research analyst from Technavio, "CFD is widely used in various design stages of aircraft manufacturing and R&D. It is also used to design external aerodynamics, fuel systems, engine core compartments, missiles, cockpit and cabin ventilation, and submarines Automotive industry The automotive industry accounted for a market share of over 30% in the global CFD market in 2015. The increase in sales of automobiles and commercial vehicles in General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler made 2015 a profitable year for automakers in the US. The demand for more sophisticated technologies from customers has increased resulting in a greater demand for CFD. CFD is mainly used in the design and development of interior and exterior features such as enhanced night vision with pedestrian detection and automatic high beam control. "Advances in computing and complex code solving programs has helped the CFD market in the automotive industry with more accurate prediction and analysis. CFD is used for all components that interact with fluids such as lubricants, fuel, water, coolants, and exhaust gases," says Ishmeet. Electrical and electronics industry The electrical and electronics industry was one of the fastest growing segments in the market in 2015 with a market share of approximately 13%. This industry is growing at a fast pace in APAC because of the growing demand for semiconductor components, consumer durables, electronics goods, and high-technology products, especially in China, South Korea, India, and Japan. The countries in APAC that played a significant role in the cloud CFD market include China, Japan, and Taiwan. Smartphones were the major areas of R&D in the electrical and electronics industry. The adoption of CFD in the electronics industry is higher compared to the electrical industry. This is because electronics components are more sensitive to heat and pressure variations and their designing process requires proper CFD analysis. Miniaturization is a trend in the electronics industry, which will drive the need for proper design.

But many of them pack a total-return punch, too. Thinkstock By Dan Burrows September 16, 2016 With the market not far off all-time highs, you might think it’s not the best time to go looking for the best dividend stocks to buy. You’d be wrong. Just because dividend yields market-wide are off versus a year ago doesn’t mean dividend stocks any less attractive for long-term investors. Indeed, dividend stocks never go out of style for patient investors. See Also from Kiplinger: 8 Risky Stocks That Are Worth a Gamble Be that as it may, yields on the best dividend stocks in the S&P 500 aren’t what they once were. Sure, companies are increasing their dividend payments, but share-price gains are offsetting any bump to dividend yield. Just look at the dividend yield on the S&P 500. It’s down to 2.12% today vs. 2.2% a year ago — not large on the aggregate, but it’s not the right direction, either. In a way, the thirst for yield only makes the search for the best dividend stocks even more important. The key is to get the largest yield possible with the least amount of risk. Advertisement Large caps — preferably blue chips — with ample yields and a long history of rising payouts will serve your equity income portfolio well if given enough time. Although current yields may be underwhelming, they won’t stay that way on your own personal costs basis if you hang on through hike after hike. The trick is to find the best S&P 500 dividend stocks and hang on. Here are the top names in the index. Procter & Gamble Dividend Yield: 3.1% Advertisement It doesn’t get more blue chip than Procter & Gamble Co. (PG). This component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average has paid rising dividends since the 19th century. That gives investors confidence that the payouts will keep coming no matter what. Admittedly, Procter & Gamble isn’t running completely unimpeded. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report saw earnings and revenues decline thanks to hiccups in the beauty, home care and other divisions. Still, PG is getting its house in order. It’s in the midst of a $10 billion cost-cutting program, which is something that is always music to the market’s ears. It’s also returning billions of dollars to shareholders via stock buybacks. Happily, defensive names like Procter & Gamble are in vogue these days. PG stock is up 10% for the year-to-date vs. a gain of less than 5% for the broader market. Advertisement Wells Fargo Dividend Yield: 3.2% OK, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) might not be the most popular name after its jaw-dropping accounts scandal, but so what? It’s still a quality business with a quality stock. Wells Fargo’s reputation took a hit, and now Congress is doing its typical bluster — this time over senior management. Advertisement But, as bank crises do, this will blow over. Shares in WFC went to $46 from $51 on the news. That has the dividend up to a very attractive level. True, banks are constrained when it comes to formulating their capital plans. But — again — the scandal doesn’t have anything to do with capital requirements. See Also from Kiplinger: 6 Good Dividend Stocks Yielding 5% or More When you can get one of the nation’s top banks on sale, you go for it. Cisco Systems Dividend Yield: 3.4% Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) is one of the first names when it comes to tech dividends. But Cisco offers a heck of a lot more than just dividends. CSCO is following the same playbook as every other legacy tech name. It’s making the long, painful and slow transition to cloud-based services and away from hardware. The arrow hasn’t always been pointed up, but Cisco has been regularly topping Wall Street’s earnings and revenue targets. Cost cuts also increase investor confidence in this company Cisco has been a total-return machine so far this year, with price appreciation of nearly 15% on top of the healthy dividend. With cloud-based services still ramping up, you can expect more of the same. Boeing Dividend Yield: 3.4% It’s in fashion to worry about Boeing Co. (BA), but the company isn’t that troubled. Boeing beat analysts’ profit estimate over the summer and the cash-flow picture continued to strengthen. In a tip to the benefits of diversification, margin growth in the company’s defense business is making up for some of the drag coming out of the commercial segment. Right now, Boeing is duking it out with Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) over a combat jet deal in Denmark — a rare challenge in the international defense world. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Stock Splits Investors Are Dying to See BA stock is still off for the year-to-date with an 11% decline. That underperforms the broader market by a wide margin, but it also has the dividend yield flying high. Gushers of cash flow ensure that the payouts will keep coming. Pfizer Dividend Yield: 3.5% Mega-Pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is on a mergers and acquisitions bender that promises long-term price appreciation to go along with a steady dividend stream. PFE’s $14 billion acquisition of Medivation bolsters the long-term bull case on Pfizer stock. The pharmaceutical giant is building up its oncology portfolio in a big way. It already has a hit with Ibrance, a breast cancer drug on the cusp of becoming a blockbuster, and MDVN complements that nicely. Then there’s the $5.2 billion acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, which landed Pfizer crisaborole — a non-steroid eczema treatment that’s being studied for efficacy against psoriasis. Like a lot of defensive names, PFE is having a good year. Shares are up 6% for the year-to-date. The S&P 500 is ahead by only 4.5% so far in 2016. IBM Dividend Yield: 3.6% International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) is another classic tech name trying to get with the times. Happily for shareholders, last quarter’s report showed good progress with its turnaround plan. IBM beat Street forecasts on the top and bottom line thanks partly to its focus on new business areas. The legacy business continued to shrink, but that was partially offset by growth in the segment that includes things like Watson, security and cloud computing. Analytics, social and mobile are also some of the keys to IBM’s future. Watson alone is a reason to love this company, with Deloitte estimating that the cognitive computing market could reach $50 billion in the next five years — in just the U.S.! IBM stock is another total-return winner these days. It’s up 13% YTD on price alone. And the dividend has nearly doubled over the past half-decade. AbbVie Dividend Yield: 3.6% AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) stock is having a market-beating year with its gain of more than 7%, and the dividend only pads that lead. Slow-but-steady growth is a basic part of the equation. AbbVie successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx in June, which bolsters its portfolio of oncology treatments. In other fundamentally good news, the FDA recently approved Humira in non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult patients. That makes it the only non-steroidal drug available for the disease. With a long-term growth rate of more than 15%, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 11 gives ABBV a compelling valuation. And dividend growth is fantastic. AbbVie has only been around since 2013, and its payout has grown by more than 40% in that short time. Verizon Dividend Yield: 4.49% You can’t talk about dividend stocks without talking about the telecommunications sector. That’s why you have to look at Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). Sure, Verizon is boring, but it’s supposed to be. As much as traditional telecommunications is a poky business, VZ is making some interesting moves. Most famously it recently acquired the core properties of Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) to drive new revenue streams and position itself for the future. And a little further back, Verizon acquired AOL. You might scoff at Verizon picking up has-been Internet properties, but they actually provide VZ with potential growth in digital content and advertising technology. See Also from Kiplinger: 4 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Worth the Risk And lest you think defense is not cool, VZ stock is up 12% so far in 2016. If it can keep up its mojo, it will continue to be a total-return monster. AT&T Dividend Yield: 4.8% Speaking of total-return monsters, you have to give a shout out to AT&T Inc. (T). Verizon’s main competitor routinely offers one of the heftier dividend yields in the S&P 500. Even if this were just a list of the largest dividends in the index, T would warrant a spot. But AT&T isn’t just a high dividend — it’s a high-quality dividend. An earnings beat helped by its acquisition of DirecTV and advances in the wireless business was applauded by the market and analysts alike. After some upgrades, fully 15 of the 31 analysts covering the stock rate it a buy. See Also from InvestorPlace: The 5 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks With the Highest Yields More impressively is that shares are having a huge year. T stock is up 17% YTD. That has weighed on the dividend yield, to be sure … but then, where else are you going to get that sort of return for this kind of risk? General Motors Dividend Yield: 4.9% The market is rightly worried about General Motors Co. (GM) hitting the peak of the latest car-buying cycle, but it’s overdoing its concerns. It feels like GM stock has been discounted for a worst-case scenario, if not more. GM once again printed strong quarterly numbers back in July. It set a record for earnings and lifted its full-year guidance. Higher-margin pickup trucks and large SUVs helped pick up the slack, and Europe has even become a positive once more. If we’re at the cyclical peak, don’t tell General Motors. This article is from Dan Burrows of InvestorPlace. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Delta Airlines flight 1086 landed on LaGuardia Airport’s runway 13, veered to the left and departed the side of the runway, contacted the airport perimeter fence and came to rest with the airplane’s nose on an embankment next to Flushing Bay. The NTSB investigation found that the probable cause of the accident – in which 29 of 127 passengers suffered minor injuries – was the captain’s inability to maintain directional control of the Boeing MD -88 due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplane heading. The aircraft was substantially damaged. “The passengers and crew of Delta flight 1086 were fortunate to have survived this crash with no loss of life or serious injuries,” said NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart. “Proper use, in real time, of precise, accurate, and timely information about the condition of the runway can help make winter operations safer, as well as the study and use of large quantities of data to inform best practices. If today’s recommendations are acted upon, future landings on contaminated runways will be safer because of actions to enable the timely communication and use of information to eliminate potentially life-threatening unknowns.” The NTSB investigation also revealed that, during the accident sequence, damage to the aircraft resulted in the loss of the interphone and public address system as methods of communication after the accident. As a result, the announcement to evacuate the aircraft was delayed and more than 17 minutes passed before all passengers were off the aircraft. The NTSB made 10 recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration, two to Boeing, one to the U.S. operators of MD-80 series airplanes, and one to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The primary electric thruster is designed to lift the satellite through its geostationary transfer orbit, slowly but steadily. These electric thrusters take a satellite into orbit without using ‘conventional’ chemical rocket thrusters. Intelsat said the Boeing-built High Throughput satellite, destined to operate from 60 deg East, would not now arrive at its orbital position as expected in Q4, and following testing come into service before year-end. It is designed to replace Intelsat 904 when it arrives on station. However, the Thruster problem means that it will take a few more weeks to reach orbit. Intelsat’s president Steven Spengler told the Euroconsult Satellite Business Week in Paris that I-33e would not now enter service until Q1/next year. He implied that this was the limit of the impact. It has now emerged on the sidelines of the conference that the problem might trim up to 1.5 years from the satellite’s operational life. The problem means that this glitch could lead to an insurance claim of up to a reported $40 million payout.

Then wing your way over to the collection of furniture and artifacts from the latest edition of the Boeing Store Custom Hangar catalog, home accessories derived from genuine aircraft parts. Our favorite is the sleek, retro-looking chair made from the engine cowling of a DC-9 jetliner. For just $8,500, you can pretend you're Bob Newhart's neighbor, airline navigator Howard Borden, although the chair's stylin' appearance is a bit more swinging '60s than early '70s. Can't quite afford to pay first-class prices? Cheaper items include a leather billfold made out of the seats of an Alaska Airlines 737 ($55), a carbon-fiber key ring composed of "upcycled" scraps from the production of a 787 Dreamliner ($100), or a business card holder that features an engine blade used on an F-4 Phantom ($100).

Dress up like a gremlin and bring it to a Halloween party with William Shatner? It's clearly marked "not for flight use." But maybe the oddest item offered sells for a whopping $19,500. It's an ejection seat from a F-100 supersonic fighter plane. You've seen them in action in a million action movies and perhaps as many cartoons, but it's no longer capable of flinging you out of the air if the situation gets thorny. So sadly, it's not going to provide you with a quick escape from that next Trump-Clinton family argument. We can dream.

The breakthrough towards developing commercially viable low carbon fuel is the result of a partnership between Virgin Atlantic and LanzaTech. Since 2011 they have been committed to producing the world’s first jet fuel derived from waste industrial gases from steel mills via a fermentation process. The Lanzanol was produced in China at the Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials certified Shougang demonstration facility. The innovative alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process was developed in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab with support from the US Department of Energy and with the help of funding from HSBC. LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic are now set to continue to work with Boeing and a host of industry colleagues to complete the additional testing aircraft and engine manufacturers require before approving the fuel for first use in a commercial aircraft. Assuming all initial approvals are achieved, the innovative LanzaTech jet fuel could be used in a first of its kind proving flight in 2017. Following a successful ‘proving flight’ the data collected will enable the partnership to seek approval to use the fuel on routine commercial flights. This would also help pave the way for LanzaTech to fund and build their first commercial jet fuel plant to supply fuel to Virgin Atlantic and other airlines. As a U.K. based partnership it is hoped the first LanzaTech jet fuel plant would be based in the U.K. Sir Richard Branson said, “This is a real game changer for aviation and could significantly reduce the industry’s reliance on oil within our lifetime. Virgin Atlantic was the first commercial airline to test a biofuel flight and continues to be a leader in sustainable aviation.” “We chose to partner with LanzaTech because of its impressive sustainability profile and the commercial potential of the jet fuel. Our understanding of low carbon fuels has developed rapidly over the last decade, and we are closer than ever before to bringing a sustainable product to the market for commercial use by Virgin Atlantic and other global airlines.” Dr Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive of LanzaTech, said, “We can now truly imagine a world where a steel mill can not only produce the steel for the components of the plane but also recycle its gases to produce the fuel that powers the aircraft. This program illustrates that such breakthroughs are only possible through collaboration. In this case, it is governments (US DOE, FAA, DARPA), laboratories (PNNL, AFRL, SWRI, MTU, UDRI), NGOs (RSB) and industry (Virgin, HSBC, Boeing, Shougang, Airlines for America) coming together to disrupt our current global carbon trajectory.” “We look forward to working with colleagues past, present and future to make this pioneering new fuel a commercial reality."       Related Articles UPM joins below50 coalition to scale up sustainable fuels White House decarbonization report addresses biofuels, biomass Groups celebrate Navy’s first ‘net-zero’ energy base ICM: Flight powered by biofuel made from residual wood Changing cell behavior could boost biofuels, medicine Gevo: Cellulosic ATJ fuels flight, isobutanol blend sold in Texas       Join Our Mailing List ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT   ADVERTISEMENTS Home Subscribe Now Advertising Magazine Blog E-Newsletter Events About Us Contact Us Ethanol Producer Magazine Biodiesel Magazine © Copyright 2016 - BBI International - All rights reserved.

Nicole Gelinas September 15, 2016 Public safety Sully—the Clint Eastwood-directed movie about US Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger’s crash-landing of a passenger plane in the Hudson River seven years ago—is a hit. The story carries a comforting message: flying is so safe that even a crash is just an inconvenience. But safety itself breeds danger. This week, federal regulators released their report into the near-catastrophe of Delta Flight 1086 from Atlanta to New York 18 months ago. The litany of human errors that investigators catalogued got little attention. But the report should serve as a reminder: flying is not inherently safe. It is safe only when people respect the system that keeps it safe. If Delta Flight 1086 had crashed at LaGuardia on a snowy day last March, killing some of the 132 people on board, the tragedy would have generated front-page headlines for weeks. Americans can be thankful that they haven’t seen such headlines in more than seven years. No American airliner has fatally crashed since 2009, when 50 people died as a Continental commuter flight crashed near Buffalo. Americans who fly today fear terrorism, not mechanical or human error. This safe stretch is unprecedented. Before 2007, America rarely had a year without a major plane disaster. In November 2001, American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in Queens, killing 265 people. In 1996, TWA Flight 800 crashed off Long Island, killing 230. In 1990 and 1985, Americans saw three major air crashes in the news. Go back further, and commercial flight was truly dangerous. Last year, Judy Blume published her novel, In the Unlikely Event, based on her experience growing up in the 1950s near Newark Airport, when three planes crashed in just eight weeks. Delta’s flight last year came close to breaking the current streak. On March 5, the airliner’s plane was “substantially damaged,” investigators from the National Transportation Safety board concluded this Tuesday, when the Boeing MD-88 ran off the runway and stopped just short of Flushing Bay. Almost everything that can go wrong on an airplane did go wrong on Flight 1086. The pilots faced an immediate challenge: bad weather. With plenty of experience, they knew that landing at LaGuardia in the snow would be a challenge. As the NTSB reports, they spent “considerable time” during the flight analyzing whether they’d be able to stop the plane on the runway. They also asked for braking reports 35 minutes before landing. But crews from the Port Authority, which runs the airport, were clearing snow, so no one was landing planes to report conditions. Plus, the Port Authority wasn’t using the best technology to measure “friction,” even though it said it was doing so. The airport operator’s “policies . . . need clarification,” investigators said. Pilots, then, didn’t get braking reports until 16 and eight minutes before landing, when they learned that conditions were good. Upon emerging from clouds, though, “the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runway’s surface,” the NTSB reports. Instead, “the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow.” Faced with “situational stress,” the captain essentially panicked. Because of that stress and “operational distractions,” investigators say, he landed the plane with an “aggressive” move, putting the engines into reverse to help stop the plane. The move exceeded the setting for a “contaminated runway” by 59 percent. That abrupt strain on the plane caused a “loss of aerodynamic directional control”—basically, Flight 1086 was a runaway plane. What ultimately saved the passengers and crew was dumb luck. After the crash-landing, it took 17 minutes to get everyone off the plane. The crash broke a wing and knocked out the plane’s communications, but the plane didn’t catch on fire or explode. The captain—likely still rather stressed out—“did not convey a sense of urgency to evacuate the cabin,” investigators concluded. Flight attendants were “confused” and didn’t follow proper procedures. The fact that passengers “climbed off the plane dressed in their heavy winter coats and scarves”, as ABC7 reported, shows either that flight attendants didn’t clearly instruct them to leave everything behind, or that passengers didn’t listen, wasting time that could have been critical. After the evacuation, the plane’s crew couldn’t give rescuers an accurate passenger count, leaving out two infants. “Flight and cabin crews . . . should be able to provide emergency responders with an accurate passenger count . . . upon exiting the airplane,” investigators noted, because such information could be lifesaving in a rescue effort. Federal investigators painstakingly set out this chain of events as a warning. Had just a few things gone differently, their report could easily have become a document of the banal series of actions, inactions, and errors that caused dozens of people to die. In a crisis, frightened crew members and passengers did the wrong thing, multiple times, with their errors compounded by the fact that they and others didn’t do their jobs properly before it became an emergency. The NTSB account is a useful reminder: airplanes are not magical machines, and they cannot land in any weather. Plane and runway engineers build in room for error. But ground and flight crews still can make enough errors to use up all of that room. The crew and passengers of Delta Flight 1086 were fortunate that their bad day never became more than a news blurb. Sometimes fate is on your side. But sometimes, it isn’t. When flying is this safe, it’s easy to forget that it’s not safe at all—and that it’s better for professionals to depend on good practices, not good luck, to save lives.   Nicole Gelinas is a City Journal contributing editor, the Searle Freedom Trust Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the author of After the Fall: Saving Capitalism from Wall Street—and Washington.

Boeing Co and SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, are building spaceships to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Asterias stem cell therapy shows promise in spinal cord paralysis: U.S. study An experimental stem cell therapy developed by Asterias Biotherapeutics restored some movement to patients paralyzed by recent spinal cord injuries, according to interim data from a small study being presented on Wednesday. One of the five patients in the trial regained use of both arms and hands, and is now able to feed himself, send texts on a phone and operate a wheelchair, the Fremont, California-based company said. Endangered Hawaiian crow shows a knack for tool use An endangered crow species from Hawaii that already is extinct in the wild displays remarkable proficiency in using small sticks and other objects to wrangle a meal, joining a small and elite group of animals that use tools. Scientists said on Wednesday that in a series of experiments the crow, known by its indigenous Hawaiian name 'Alala, used objects as tools with dexterity to get at hard-to-reach meat, sometimes modifying them by shortening too-long sticks or making tools from raw plant material. China launches second experimental space lab module China launched its second experimental space laboratory on Thursday, part of a broader plan to have a permanent manned space station in service around 2022. Advancing China's space program is a priority for Beijing, with President Xi Jinping calling for the country to establish itself as a space power, and apart from its civilian ambitions, Beijing has tested anti-satellite missiles. Possible air pollution link to Alzheimer's A possible causal link between air pollution and Alzheimer's disease has been suggested by scientists after they conducted detailed studies of brain tissue, in a joint British-Mexican project. Study co-author Professor Barbara Maher, of Lancaster University, and her research team examined the brain tissue of 37 individuals who had lived in either Mexico City or Manchester, both air pollution hotspots. SpaceX aims to resume launches in November, president says SpaceX is aiming to resume flights in November following a launch pad fire that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket and an Israeli communications satellite it was due to lift into orbit, the company's president said on Tuesday. The space services company suspended Falcon 9 flights while it investigates why the rocket burst into flames on Sept 1 as it was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Scientists decipher color of 'super cute' bristly dinosaur Scientists guided by small structures preserved in fossilized skin have deciphered the color and camouflage pattern of a little dinosaur with a parrot-like beak and bristles on its tail that roamed thick forests in China about 120 million years ago. Psittacosaurus was mainly brown but with a paler underside of the tail and belly, a pattern called countershading that may have helped the 5-foot-long (1.5-meter) bipedal plant-eater go unnoticed by hungry predators, the scientists said on Thursday.

NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- "Closed molding composites market projected to register a CAGR of 7.45% during forecast period" The closed molding composites market is projected to reach USD 66.58 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 7.45% between 2016 and 2021. The major driver stimulating the closed molding composites market is high demand from the aerospace & defense industry, as they have the ability to reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency. The advantages of closed molding processes over traditional molding processes (open mold process) such as improvement of productivity through innovative engineering approaches, minimization of energy consumption, and reduction of emission levels also drive the market. "Aerospace & defense is the fastest growing application segment in the closed molding composites market, in terms of value." The key drivers of closed molding composites in the aerospace & defense industry are the rise in number of airplane deliveries, high performance properties such as lightweight, excellent safety & acoustic features, and government regulations. Advanced closed molding composites offer higher fatigue tolerance, which helps in improving or increasing the structure of components. To comply with regulatory norms, aerospace manufacturers such as Boeing (U.S.), Airbus (France), GE Aviation (U.S.), and others have started using these composites to manufacture primary & secondary structures and interior components of aircraft. Thus, aerospace & defense application is likely to be the most profitable investment pocket for stakeholders. "Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing market of closed molding composites." Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing market for closed molding composites in the next five years. The market in this region is driven by increasing consumption of closed molding composite in various industries such as wind energy, construction, electrical & electronics, and transportation. China leads the market in Asia-Pacific. Its consumption has grown remarkably owing to growth in the wind energy, sporting goods, and aerospace & defense industries. The wind energy industry in China witnessed the highest number of wind energy installations in 2015; it added 30.8 GW of new capacity.

Boeing Co and SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, are building spaceships to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is looking to turn over crew transport to SpaceX and Boeing before the end of 2018, breaking a Russian monopoly. SpaceX is aiming for its first test flight to the station in 2017. "We're full-steam head for certification. We're still trying to remain on schedule," Abhishek Tripathi, director of certification for SpaceX, said during a webcast panel discussion at an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Long Beach, California. "I know what I need to do in the next day and in the next month," Tripathi said, adding that his work is not being affected by the accident investigation. SpaceX, with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration, is working to figure out why one of its Falcon 9 rockets burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The blaze destroyed the communications satellite, owned by Israel's Space Communication Ltd, which was scheduled to be carried into orbit two days later. SpaceX has not yet disclosed how much damage was done at its primary launch site. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Wednesday the company was hoping to resume flights in November at a second, nearly complete launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, adjacent to the Air Force base. The company, which has a backlog of 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion, also flies from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Samsung’s recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after several dozen caught fire and exploded may stem from a subtle manufacturing error, but it highlights the challenge electronics makers face in packing ever more battery power into ever thinner phones, while rushing for faster release dates. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) Click here to watch both videos in this story on your mobile app.  BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — U.S. regulators issued an official recall of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 phone on Thursday because of a risk of fire. Samsung already has voluntary recalled the devices after a few dozen devices exploded or caught fire. That was out of about 2.5 million phones sold. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is stepping in on a formal recall. Its chairman, Elliot Kaye, blasted Samsung for trying to do the recall on its own, saying that anyone who believes that to be adequate “needs to have more than their phone checked.” FILE – In this Thursday, Aug. 11, 2016, file photo, models hold Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones during a launch event at the company’s headquarters in Seoul, South Korea.  (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) Samsung promised replacement devices, but that was put on hold while regulators reviewed the situation. Kaye said customers will now be offered full refunds, not just replacement devices, if they choose. Note 7 owners need to contact Samsung and provide a number from the back of the phone to determine whether that unit is at risk. Kaye said about 1 million devices are affected. The recall comes at a crucial time for Samsung, as its rival Apple just announced its own latest versions of the iPhones, which go on sale Friday. The Note series is one of Samsung’s most expensive, and demand for the phone had been high. U.S. aviation safety officials also have taken the unusual step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge the phone during flights, or put them in checked bags.

The additional United flights will also offer additional opportunities for tourism to Puerto Rico, further boosting the local economy.

Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 percent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Sept. 19. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and — not least — the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a "tiny error" in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. "If Koh's argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company," Park said. "But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem." Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple's September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 percent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 percent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That's what happened with the Note 7, Samsung's Koh explained. "The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together," he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7's design that it compromised safety. "There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity," said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute's battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. "Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode," Doh said. "It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety." The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone's battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is "one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we've seen in a phone," said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. "We don't think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries — more likely just a manufacturing defect," IFixit's Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. "You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else," he said, adding that the two rivals are "constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping." While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung's smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. "The security of the battery isn't directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not," Cho Joon-ho, head of LG's mobile business, told reporters. "But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand." __ AP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechMultimedia How ‘better, faster’ batteries backfired for Samsung 2016-09-15 15:02 - Mark Gurman and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier Post a comment 0 share: Samsung's Note 7 has experienced exploding battery problems. (Ariel Gonzalez / YouTube) RELATED ARTICLES Samsung struggles with critical Note 7 recall Exploding phones? Samsung's heir apparent has bigger challenges Samsung 'fixes' Note 7 by limiting recharges to 60% Tokyo - Samsung Electronics, under pressure from consumers for longer-lasting batteries that charge faster, pushed the limits of lithium-ion technology. The effort backfired when some of its new Note 7 handsets caught fire and exploded. Building a better battery has long bedeviled the tech industry. Smartphones are constantly improving, with sharper displays, improved software and cameras rivaling those used by the pros. Not so the batteries, which despite advances still die faster than consumers like and take too long to recharge. “It’s the race to add new capabilities and features to the phone that demands a more capable battery,” said Martin Reynolds, a Gartner analyst. On top of the demands placed on their performance, batteries are getting slimmer and smaller, as smartphone makers try to win over consumers with thinner devices. That’s putting strain on the manufacturing process, and raising the risk of defects that can lead to the kind of malfunctions seen in Samsung’s phones. The Note 7 was supposed to stand out with its stylus, large edge-to-edge display and faster charging technology. Samsung rolled out the device in August, just before Apple unveiled a new batch of iPhones. It was an opportunity for the Suwon, South Korea-based company to outshine its biggest smartphone rival. Instead, it backfired. Usually, smartphone makers and wireless providers rigorously test products before they reach customers, although the process is mainly focused on making sure the devices are compatible with wireless networks. Samsung provided carriers with the typical amount of testing time before the launch date, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung first showed prototypes of the Note 7 to carriers in April and testing began in May, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements aren’t public. At least one major Samsung partner is reassessing its testing procedures to catch issues like this in the future, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The South Korean manufacturer is holding multiple meetings each week with major carrier partners to discuss the latest details from its investigation and assist in mitigating the issue, the person said. Headaches involving the production of lithium-ion batteries aren’t unique to the smartphone industry. Overheating battery packs made by Sony led to the recall of millions of laptops made by Dell, Toshiba and others in 2006, while Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner suffered from electrical fires after the airplane’s 2011 debut. “Based on our investigation, we learned that there was an isolated issue with the battery cell,” Samsung said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Overheating of the battery cell occurred when the anode-to-cathode came into contact with each other, causing a very rare manufacturing process error.” Samsung is working to fix the problem. While only about three dozen cases were reported, the company is seeking to replace 2.5 million Note 7 phones, an endeavor that could cost as much as $2bn. On Wednesday, Samsung placed advertisements in South Korea’s major newspapers to apologise for the incident. In an effort to prevent any more device explosions, the company is also rolling out a software update on September 20 that will limit the battery charge at 60%. Availability of that update outside South Korea will vary depending on each market, Samsung said. The Note 7 features a larger battery than its predecessor, one that can store 3500 milliamp hours of electric power, compared with 3000 mAh for the Note 5 (Samsung skipped a number this year, to match its flagship Galaxy S7). By comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus, the Note 7’s main competitor, has a 2900 mAh battery. While Apple has also sought to upgrade its battery technology to support better screens and faster graphics, it hasn’t often promoted battery life as a feature itself. Last week’s iPhone event was an exception, when the company highlighted that the iPhone 7 can last almost two hours longer than its predecessor thanks to better software and processor design. Samsung SDI was the main battery supplier for the Note 7, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The batteries failed because a separator within the cells was too thin and electrodes weren’t properly insulated, according to a government quality inspection agency in China, where almost 2,000 Note 7s were distributed as test devices. Samsung, which is preparing to get replacements into the hands of customers from Sept. 19, said in a statement that “all Galaxy Note7 replacement devices will be equipped with the battery from other suppliers.” For the past few years, Samsung has adopted Quick Charge, a technology developed by Qualcomm Inc., throughout its product lineup, including the Note 7. Using specialised chips, circuits and software, the mechanism works in tandem with a specific charger to speed up the process. While that has enabled rapid charging - up to 50 minutes faster than its predecessor - it’s also pushing up against the physical limits of the materials and design used in battery technology. Gartner’s Reynolds noted that fast charging is essentially a solution to the problem of short battery life. “It’s a feature driven by short battery life in general, not something that people really want,” he said. The first batch of Note 7 batteries probably had a flaw in their design that didn’t work properly with the chemistry in some units, according to Kyle Wiens, creator of iFixit, a popular website that dissects the innards of gadgets to gauge the ease of repairing the devices. Fast charging “crams as much energy as possible into the battery, and the closer you push it to the edge, the more of a potential safety issue there is,” he said. share: More In This Category PICS: Inside one of SA's biggest TV manufacturing plants Exploding Note 7 costumes steal Halloween's scariest do-ups WATCH: Xiaomi to sell a borderless concept smartphone WATCH: Nintendo offers sneak peek of its 'Switch' console Most Popular Read Top 5 smartphones for under R300 a month Top tips on protecting your devices from hackers Here's how to go Ninja mode on social networks R11m French tech lab launched in Cape Town Airbnb includes Cape Town in new ‘Trips’ offering Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

"Because this product presents such a serious fire hazard, I am urging all consumers ... to take advantage of this recall right away," said Elliot Kaye, chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Samsung had already initiated a voluntary recall, but the company has been criticized for not offering clear information about the problem or how it would be resolved. While speaking with reporters, Kaye appeared to blast Samsung for not co-ordinating with his agency. "As a general matter it's not a recipe for a successful recall for a company to go out on its own," he said, adding that anyone who believes a unilateral effort would be sufficient "needs to have more than their phone checked." Samsung has said the problem involves about 2.5 million smartphones worldwide; authorities say that includes about 1 million in the United States. While the company was previously offering to replace the phones, it will now offer consumers the choice of a replacement or a full refund. The recall comes as Samsung is locked in a fierce battle with Apple for the attentions of high-end smartphone buyers. Apple just introduced the latest versions of its iPhone, which go on sale Friday. Samsung had beaten Apple to market with the Note 7 by several weeks. It was drawing favourable reviews for the phone, which started at $850 in the U.S., before consumers began reporting problems with the battery overheating, sometimes causing fires or explosions. One family in St. Petersburg, Florida, said a Galaxy Note 7 left charging in their Jeep had caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung has received 92 reports of the batteries overheating in the U.S., including 26 reports of burns and 55 of property damage, according to the U.S. commission's website. It said property damage included fires in cars and a garage. Meanwhile, U.S. aviation safety officials have taken the unusual step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge the phone during flights, and not to put them in checked bags. A top Samsung executive in the United States on Thursday apologized to customers and pledged to expedite the recall. "We did not meet the standard of excellence that you expect and deserve," said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America, in a video released by the company. Critics say Samsung didn't follow commission rules that call for companies to co-ordinate the handling of recalls with the commission, including the use of joint public announcements, although Baxter said Thursday that his company notified the commission before it announced it would stop selling the Note 7 on Sept. 2. Samsung announced then that it would replace any Note 7 phones it had sold, with replacements available within a week. But its press releases didn't tell consumers to stop using the device. A week later, the company and the commission issued separate statements that urged consumers to stop using the Note 7. At that point, Samsung said it would offer replacement Note 7 devices once the commission had approved them. Samsung's statements left many customers confused, said Tuong Nguyen, a tech industry analyst with Gartner, "and that might have an impact on overall consumer confidence, especially since we're talking about a high-end device, their flagship phone." People who bought the phone did so to get the best possible quality and service, he said, adding that the handling of the recall "kind of seems like a strike on both counts." Some purchasers of the Note 7 say they're willing to try another Samsung device. "I think I would," said Robert Lerner, a 64-year-old financial consultant who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. "But I'm not going to go get it the first week," he added, because he wants to make sure there aren't more problems with the Note 7 replacements. Brooklyn office worker Joe Franco said he was frustrated, especially after getting conflicting information from his cellphone carrier, Sprint, about how to get a replacement. "I love the phone. It's an excellent phone. But I'm scared it's going to explode," said Franco. The 23-year-old said he's currently using an old phone borrowed from a friend, which he said was "really impractical." Samsung said Note 7 owners who don't want a refund can choose to get a new Note 7 -- which the company now says will be available in the U.S. by Wednesday -- or the smaller and cheaper Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge right away, with a refund of the price difference. Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Kaye at the consumer safety commission said Note 7 purchasers should check the back of their device for an identifying number, and visit Samsung's recall website or call a hotline at 1-844-365-6197 to find out if the device needs to be turned in. If so, consumers can take the device back to Samsung or to the phone carrier that sold it. About 97 per cent of phones sold in the U.S. are being recalled. Anderson reported from New York.

Her success didn't come easy but her domination in a typically male-dominated industry is inspiring. Going to college was never an option for Jan Smith. In fact, she was the first in her family to graduate from a university. "Which was a huge thing for my family back in the 60's," said Jan Smith. With her math degree, she started her career working for Boeing's Space Program. "To work the space program that was going to lead to a man on the moon, was the most exciting opportunity," said Smith. That job would eventually lead Smith to a career as a software engineer, spanning 35 years. In 1989, she decided to leave the big business world and start her woman-owned small business, S-Cubed. "I started S cubed really as a consultant, believe it or not, thinking I would slow down and enjoy life a little more," added Smith. +1  S-Cubed is a technical services company that maintains helicopters and also has military contracts with companies in the country and worldwide. The company now employs more than 500. "We have a safety record that is three-times better than the army, and it's those kinds of performance that's enabled us to continue to grow," said Smith. Smith says it hasn't always been easy to achieve success in a predominately male-field. "You have to be committed and you have to be able to accept a lot of 'no's'and not give up," said Smith. But being named as an honoree for "Women Honoring Women," is one of her most proud accomplishments. "Pretty much a dream come true for me... there are so many other women in this community that are looking for that opportunity to grow and expand their company," added Smith. Now, S-Cubed has 50 operations worldwide. The "Women Honoring Women" event will be Thursday, September 15th, at the Von Braun Center. It kicks off at 5:30.

Liow said the debris found was confirmed to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap with a date stamp consistent with MH370’s delivery date, with the Italian manufacturer also confirming that all numbers on the said part relates to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404, the same aircraft line number that was delivered to Malaysian Airlines registered as 9M-MRO (MH370). “As such, the experts have concluded that the debris, an outboard flap originated from the aircraft 9M-MRO, also known as MH370,” he said in a statement today. “Further examination of the debris will continue, in hopes that further evidence may be uncovered which may provide new insight into the circumstances surrounding flight MH370,” he added. Liow said that the ministry will continue to provide updates as and when new information becomes available. The examination of the debris was conducted by the Australian Safety Bureau (ATSB). The debris was found on June 20 on the island of Pemba off the coast of Tanzania this year, with authorities suspecting early on that it was “highly likely” from MH370. Previously, investigators had also confirmed a piece of plane debris found on the shores of Reunion Island on July last year to be part of MH370. More debris found in Mozambique, South Africa and Mauritius’s Rodrigues Island have also since been said to be likely parts of the missing plane. Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew onboard. The Malaysia-China-Australia tripartite had in July announced it would be suspending the search of the vanished aircraft after completing the priority 120,000 sq km search area, which is estimated to completed between October and December.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts More arrests on Bersih 5 eve, Maria and Mandeep may miss rally, Red Shirts leader missing Cops detain Bersih 2.0 chairman, committee member ahead of rally Police road diversions in KL from 7am Now, DAP MP arrested for sedition, taken to Seremban High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Rafizi sentenced to 18 months’ jail, might lose MP seat Do Malaysians trust the news they read?

The Dow industrial and the S&P 500 closed in negative territory Wednesday in the wake of slumping crude-oil prices, erasing earlier gains for the major benchmarks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq bucked the losing trend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 31.98 points, or 0.2%, to close at 18,034.77. The S&P 500 index fell 1.25 points to end at 2,125.77, weighed by a 1.2% drop in the energy sector. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 18.52 points, or 0.4%, to close at 5,173.77. In the tech sector, Apple climbed 3.6% as analysts outlined reasons the tech giant is still a buy. However, the tech giant's gains were overshadowed by big declines in IBM and Boeing. The economic calendar was relatively thin on Wednesday. Market reaction to the August import-price index was muted. Import prices slipped 0.2% due to lower oil, while export prices dropped 0.8%, driven by a fall in farm crop prices. Shares of Monsanto rose 0.6% after Bayer raised its offer for the U.S. seeds major to $128 a share. Both companies announced Wednesday that they had approved the deal. Ford Motor Co. fell 1.9% after the car maker outlined plans to deliver profitable growth for the next several years, including investing in electric and autonomous vehicles. The benchmark 10-year Treasury slid 4.3 basis points to 1.691%. But as crude oil's decline accelerated, stocks failed to capitalize on their gains. A report on oil supplies published by the Energy Information Administration showed inventories declined by 600,000 barrels last week, much smaller than the 14.5 million barrel drop from the week before. Oil prices briefly spiked after the report, but have since turned lower as analysts concluded that the sector is still bogged down by excess inventory. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery settled at a two-week low. Bullion prices ended higher at Comex. Gold futures settled higher on Wednesday, as support from a retreat in the U.S. dollar prompted prices to snap a five-day slide. But investors remained wary ahead of next week's meetings for the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan that may yield changes to monetary policy. December gold rose $2.40, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,326.10 an ounce. December silver rose 9.1 cents, or 0.5%, to $19.066 an ounce. Today's participation was above the recent average as more than 878 million shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include weekly initial claims, Retail Sales for August, PPI for August, the Philadelphia Fed Survey for September, the second quarter Current Account Balance and Empire Manufacturing for September each crossing the wires at 8:30 ET. Separately, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for August will be released at 9:15 ET while Business Inventories for July will cross the wires at 10:00 ET.

Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 per cent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Sept. 19. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and — not least — the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung’s mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a “tiny error” in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research centre at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. “If Koh’s argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company,” Park said. “But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem.” Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple’s September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 per cent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 per cent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favoured by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That’s what happened with the Note 7, Samsung’s Koh explained. “The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together,” he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7’s design that it compromised safety. “There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity,” said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute’s battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. “Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode,” Doh said. “It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety.” The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone’s battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is “one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we’ve seen in a phone,” said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. “We don’t think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries — more likely just a manufacturing defect,” IFixit’s Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. “You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else,” he said, adding that the two rivals are “constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping.” While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung’s smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. “The security of the battery isn’t directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not,” Cho Joon-ho, head of LG’s mobile business, told reporters. “But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand.” __ AP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco. __ Lee can be reached on Twitter: www.twitter.com/YKLeeAP Her previous works can be found on: http://bigstory.ap.org/content/youkyung-lee shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Officially, it is slated to end its operational life in 2024, about the time that NASA’s Journey to Mars program is scheduled to shift into high gear with “proving ground” missions in cislunar space near the Earth’s moon. The assumption had been that the space station, conceived over 30 years ago during the Reagan administration, would be abandoned and taken out of orbit so that it would burn up harmlessly over the ocean. But NASA official Bill Hill recently suggested that the space agency and its international partners would hand off the ISS to a private company. Commercializing the space station makes sense. It’s bipartisan, for a start. President George W. Bush set into motion the commercialization of human space travel, President Obama has embraced the idea, and the transition is under way. The last NASA-operated crewed flight of the space shuttle occurred in 2011. The first commercially-crewed spacecraft, operated by Boeing and SpaceX, are due to start flying in 2018. FLORIDA TODAY Trump vs. Clinton: Who wins on space? On the other hand, some problems may crop up from the move to “hand off” the International Space Station. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees the space agency, wants to extend the operational life of the ISS to 2028 in a new NASA authorization bill. He would have to be convinced that commercializing the ISS is a good deal for American taxpayers. If the bill is pushed back to next year, which would not be surprising, there could be a new chairman to convince. One obstacle to commercialization may be price. The space station cost about $100 billion to build. Even considering depreciation and a short expected remaining operational life (perhaps four more years to 2028, perhaps longer), the ISS is a valuable piece of real estate. Congress may balk at the idea of giving it away. At the same time, where do you find a buyer for a used space station? Few customers likely could afford it. Also, there’s the question of whether a slightly used space station would prove to be unfair competition for proposed private space facilities. Bigelow Aerospace and a new startup called Axiom Space are planning commercial space stations. Does enough business exist to support a commercial ISS and one or more purely private space stations? The answer to that question depends on how low launch costs go by the mid-2020s. SpaceX, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance are all working to create reusable launch vehicles and spacecraft. As the cost of space travel decreases, the number of possible customers for commercial space stations increases. FLORIDA TODAY Schedule of upcoming Florida rocket launches FLORIDA TODAY Blue Origin to launch 'New Glenn' rockets from Cape Canaveral The destruction of a SpaceX Falcon 9 along with its payload, an Israeli communications satellite, during a static test fire this month underscores the fact that space travel is not yet as routine and free of accidents as air travel. But as commercial companies gain more experience and refine their technology, their safety record and ability to reuse spacecraft should improve. One way to win broad support for commercializing the International Space Station may be to lease it rather than sell it or give it away. The idea is that the international partners would receive rental payments from a commercial operator which, in turn, would sell time on the ISS for profit. NASA and its partners could plow the rents from the ISS into other programs, say the Journey to Mars that seeks to put astronaut boots on the ground of the Red Planet by the 2030s. Can the ISS be turned into a profit-making enterprise? The answer depends on a lot of currently unknowable unknowns. But absent a hefty budget increase that would allow NASA to both run a space station and send astronauts to Mars, it is going to have to get creative if it expects to prosper in the 2020s and beyond. The space agency will have to unload the ISS one way or another. If it can turn it into commercial space and make a little money in the process, so much the better. Mark R.

The company stated that it has suspended Falcon 9 flights until it completes its investigation into why the rocket burst into flames during fueling for a routine prelaunch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. SpaceX had previously stated that a nearly-completed second launch site in Florida, located at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC), would be finished in November. The pad was last used to launch NASA’s space shuttles five years ago. Boeing has landed a $700 million US defense contract for Small Diameter Bomb Increment 1 weapons. The USAF deal will see the company deliver the munitions by December 12, 2021 and includes foreign military sales. Documents endorsed by retired top US military officers and former national security officials warn of the potential danger posed to US military operations by climate change. A statement in support of the findings was released yesterday and signed by more than a dozen former senior military and national security officials, including retired General Anthony Zinni, former commander of the US Central Command, and retired Admiral Samuel Locklear, head of the Pacific Command until last year. They called on the next US president to create a cabinet level position to deal with climate change and its impact on national security. The first units of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead rocket has rolled off Lockheed Martin’s production line. A company statement said the warhead was designed to engage the same target set and achieve the same area-effects requirement as the old MLRS submunition warhead, but without the lingering danger of unexploded ordnance. Lockheed received a US Army initial production contract for the warheads in June 2015. Middle East & North Africa A Yemeni industrial site, supposedly a rebel missile manufacturing site, has been bombed by Saudi-led coalition forces. The bombing, which occurred on Tuesday in the capital of Sanaa, caused a fire that destroyed half the premises and resulted in several million dollars worth of damage. Local businessmen claim that plants located on the site were only used for the manufacture of piping and building supplies. Africa South Africa’s Defense Minister announced plans to update the country’s indigenous Rooivalk attack helicopter. Speaking at this year’s African Aerospace & Defence Show, Nosiviwe Masipa-Nqakula said the helicopter has “blooded” itself having carried out a series of successful operations as part of the United Nations’ peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Manufacturer Denel is also working on marketing the helicopter to other African governments who are fighting insurgencies, namely Nigeria and Egypt, and further afield governments like India and Brazil. Europe Deliveries of the Leonardo Aermacchi M-346 advanced jet trainer destined for Poland will soon be underway following the successful conclusion of electromagnetic testing in an anechoic chamber. The next phase of experimental and certification flights will see two Polish aircraft have their communications and avionics systems tested, before moving on to trials of their embedded tactical training simulation (ETTS) equipment. The first of eight aircraft will touch down in Poland in November. Asia Pacific Weapons Experts have warned of the ramping up of uranium enrichment by North Korea. The new uranium, when combined with current plutonium stocks, will give the regime enough material for 20 nuclear warheads. Pyongyang’s ability to evade a decade of UN sanctions has allowed it to develop the uranium enrichment process, enabling it to run an effectively self-sufficient nuclear program that is capable of producing around six nuclear bombs a year.

Michael’s father was a gifted mechanic who served in the U.S. Army Air Corp in World War II. After the war, he became a career military man serving throughout Europe before coming back to Indiana in the late 1950s where Michael was born. When Michael was a year old, his father’s next assigned location was March AFB and the family moved to Edgemont, a small town near Moreno Valley in Riverside County. The youngest of three, Michael, and his father were close and he spent hours learning the skills his father had to teach him on working with his hands and mind: bikes, electronics, and his beloved go-cart that they built. Living so close to the Riverside Raceway, he would go to the races (he loved drag races most) late in the day when they opened the gates for free so that he could watch and learn. It was no surprise that Michael’s favorite subjects in school were Science and Math. At age 11, he began a love affair with astronomy that would stay with him to this day when a neighbor gave him his first chance to see the moon through his telescope and he was hooked. His father bought him his first telescope from Fedco (remember them?). His mother happened to see a posting in the local paper for an astronomy club which he began attending and by age 12 was already building his first telescope. While going to college Michael worked full time in electronics shops and then an automobile crash test lab, learning the engineering skills that would define his future. He would graduate in 1985 with his degree in Engineering Technology in Electronics with a promising future ahead. He went to work as an engineer for Nissan for almost seven years, but during these years he was already hard at work laying the ground work for his own company. One of his partners had worked with him at the test lab and the other was a classmate All three shared a vision and passion for crash testing so it seemed a natural evolution to start their own business, Diversified Technical Systems (DTS) which began as a Partnership in 1990, becoming an S-Corp in 1996. In the early stages of building DTS, they all worked out of a garage-office space. In 1994 Michael stumbled upon Seal Beach when he was invited to a party, fell in love and stayed. Shortly after this in 1995, they got their first contract opportunity that would set DTS in motion and they knew they needed to find a real business space. As it happened, a “For Rent” sign was up at 909 Electric and within days, they opened their two room company at this location. Michael and partners Steve Pruitt and Tim Kippen quickly gained other business and ultimately have become the world leader in providing data acquisition needs for demanding, high impact testing applications for the automotive, aerospace, military and other substantial industries. As DTS has grown, so did their staff and several years ago, they left their start up location to move to bigger quarters in the Boeing Business Center. They now have offices and employ people in Michigan, Asia-Pacific, France, Japan and the U.K. Most recently their equipment has been on board the Orion spacecraft as it gets tested for its ultimate trip one day to Mars, quite an accomplishment for a boy who dreamed of watching the stars. Michael never stops learning; in fact, he met his wife Bridget while taking a cross country skiing class at Long Beach City College in 1990. They lived on Fifth Street before moving to their home in Bridgeport in 2003 where they live today. Perhaps it was serendipity or maybe a sign, but the night they moved in they were able to view a meteor shower from their roof deck. Michael’s free time is sparse these days but when he has some, his first love is still astronomy and now he shares that love and passion with the community, holding community astronomy nights at the pier, Girl Scout House and other places when there are events to see in the night sky.  His telescope collection now stands at seven. He reads constantly and travels the world to have opportunities to view celestial events such as meteor showers and lunar eclipses. He has traveled to the William Herschel Observatory in Slough, England, the real birthplace of modern astronomy. And if all that wasn’t enough, Michael also sits on the Board of Directors for the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. As the current Chairman, he will have a unique opportunity to travel to Chile this October to tour their observatories in the Southern Hemisphere that are doing groundbreaking work in astronomy. I asked Michael if he would go into space if it was available to him today, and surprisingly he told me “no.” He enjoys his feet on the ground and his eye to the stars. When asked how he would like to be remembered he did not hesitate to tell me this: “I would like to be remembered as a person who inspired people to seek a deeper understanding of their world.”  Do you have a Neighbor you think we should know?

The closure was listed as permanent in the records. USL launched its first transpacific service in 2003, offering a weekly schedule to Long Beach from Shekou and Hong Kong. In 2015, operations were expanded to include services from Vietnam to Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City. In 2006, the company announced ships would sail daily from Los Angeles to Australia/New Zealand, in addition to services from New Zealand and Australia to Hong Kong/South China and North America. In 2007 USL was bought by ANL Singapore, a subsidiary of the CMA CGM Group. Other layoffs in the county include: • National Oilwell Varco will cut 72 jobs, also effective in October, at its Orange office. The Texas-based company provides equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production operations. • Morning Sun Shirt Company in Garden Grove will cut 76 jobs, effective in November. The company was formed in Costa Mesa in 1981 as a management and ownership change in a T-shirt shop. • ITT Technical Services let go almost 800 people this month. The layoffs included 76 people from the company’s Orange office. Its campuses were to shutter Friday. ITT offered technology-oriented degree programs. The for-profit college was cut off from the Department of Education’s student loan program. Around 8,000 employees were laid off and roughly 35,000 students were affected. • Good Hope International in Anaheim laid of 60 people this month. Good Hope International is an affiliate of Wincome Group, which was awarded $300 million in future tax subsidies for the building of two four-diamond hotels by the Anaheim City Council earlier this year. The hotels would replace Wincome’s Anaheim Plaza and Suites and the Anabella Hotel. • Airplane giant Boeing has also announced substantial layoffs. In September, the company listed 73 in Huntington Beach and 38 in El Segundo as “layoff unknown at this time.” In October the company also will terminate 37 jobs in Huntington Beach and 20 in El Segundo, also listed as “layoff unknown at this time.

The Elon Musk-owned company said Thursday it’s still pointed toward its first test flight to the International Space Station in 2017 while officials investigate an explosion that destroyed a test rocket and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite on Sept. 1, according to Reuters. “We’re full-steam head for certification. We’re still trying to remain on schedule,” director of certification for SpaceX, Abhishek Tripathi, said during a webcast panel at an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Long Beach, California. Tripathi said the private space exploration company’s plans aren’t being affected by the Federal Aviation Administration’s investigation into why one of its Falcon 9 rockets exploded during fueling just as it was about to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Related Stories SpaceX Aims To Resume Launches In November How Big Is Blue Origin's New Rocket, The New Glenn? According to Reuters, Tripathi’s comments came one day after Space X president Gwynne Shotwell said the company was planning to continue flights in November NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, which is also located in Cape Canaveral. Along with Musk’s Boeing, SpaceX is attempting to help NASA fly astronauts to the ISS rather than relying on Russia to transport them, but come November it could face an even more crowded marketplace. While SpaceX already has 70 missions worth more than $10 billion planned, at least 10 other rocket companies are competing to launch satellites into space, according to the Los Angeles Times. Besides the ventures of Musk’s billionaire brethren like Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, companies like United Launch Alliance are planning to turn around orders for satellite launches in just three months. “Because it’s going to be so many companies trying to launch so many satellites, I think most of these companies will take what they can get,” senior space analyst at the Teal Group Marco Caceres told the LA Times. “The bigger issue is going to be who can launch sooner.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

He was commenting on a New Zealand Helicopter Survey completed for the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) in August 2016. The survey gathered information from industry participants about their views on issues underlying safety performance. New Zealand has a good reputation internationally for providing a safe aviation environment. ‘This is a tribute to the regulator, the companies that make up the aviation industry, and the relationship that exists between the regulator and industry’, said Nicholson. Safety is critically important in the aviation industry. Anything that compromises safety affects the country’s reputation. Industry association Aviation New Zealand for example, was created in 1950 by industry to encourage the safe development of aviation in the country. Aviation New Zealand (including the New Zealand Helicopter Association - NZHA) has been involved for many years in programmes to encourage and promote aviation safety. Sometimes this has been in association with the regulator and at other times, this has seen industry take the lead. AIRCARE™ was developed and introduced by industry. It brings flight safety and environmental safety together in one safety assurance programme. Forty-one helicopter companies are AIRCARE™ accredited. These companies generally achieve a higher level of flight safety and environmental safety than non accredited companies. CAA and the NZHA regularly produce Activity and Safety Updates and NZHA produces Safety Bulletins. These comment in particular on accidents reported to CAA and generalise the learning from them so that all industry members benefit. As we understand it, the regulator/industry cooperation that results in these reports is leading edge with other industry associations keen to learn from the New Zealand experiences. The NZHA and Aviation NZ run annual conferences that focus on the issues of the day and tomorrow. This year’s conferences in June, among other things, addressed operator fatigue, learning from accident and incident reports, risk management and the importance of role training. It is important that as an industry, we address the perceptions coming from the August CAA Safety Survey. We (industry and CAA) are responsible for safety. We have to ensure that some of the behaviours apparent in the survey are discouraged and eradicated. ‘The programmes that we provide for our members are one way of ensuring this happens’, said Nicholson. ‘We would welcome other helicopter companies joining us to participate in those programmes’. Key facts about Aviation New Zealand Aviation New Zealand exists to lead, inspire and grow the New Zealand aviation industry. It was established in 1950 to encourage the safe growth of the aviation industry in New Zealand. In more recent years, it has also become involved in helping the international development of its members. - Aviation New Zealand has over 300 members and over 1300 on its database - Members include agricultural companies, air operators (fixed wing and rotary), aircraft designers and manufacturers, the UAV industry, airports, aviation trainers, emergency and medical services companies, helicopter companies, and parts manufacturers. Key facts about aviation in New Zealand An ‘early adopter’ in aviation terms – first international customer for Boeing; first pilot training school 1916; first airmail 1919; and quick appreciation of the suitability of aviation for agriculture, tourism and forestry. 4639 aircraft in New Zealand, one per thousand people, give New Zealand one of the highest aircraft per capita ratios in the world. Decades of policy innovation to support competition, safety and growth; 30m km² of safely managed airspace; and exports to over 100 countries on all continents. Aircraft fit-outs, new aircraft (including UAVs), GPS track and tracing systems, high precision processes (for example bait and fire fighting), composites, titanium powders, and aviation industry business and operational systems are just some of the exciting technologies and practices developing in New Zealand which set the scene for growth in the next 100 years. © Scoop Media   Tweet         Business Headlines | Sci-Tech Headlines BUSINESS, SCIENCE & TECH > >   Geographical Indications Bill Passes: Wine Industry Welcomes New Legislation “Our ‘Geographical Indications’ - the names and places where our wines come from - are at the very heart of the New Zealand wine story and this new law provides an additional level of protection for them.” More>> ALSO: NZ Govt - Good news for wine and spirit industries NZ First - Geographical Indicators Bill Patronises Maori Spirits NZ - Spirits NZ Welcomes Passage of Geographic Indicators Bill The Price Of Cheese: Appeal Court Turns Down Fonterra Bid To Keep Inferior Terms Fonterra Cooperative Group has lost its bid to overturn a High Court ruling against inferior terms offered to the suppliers of the failed New Zealand Dairies Ltd business in South Canterbury.

The event was in support of the CancerCare Manitoba Foundation and the Children’s Hospital Foundation of Manitoba. According to organizers, the festival has raised more than $1.25 million over the past four years for pediatric clinical trials, and care and support for children fighting cancer. The long brightly coloured canoe-like dragon boats are powered by teams of 20 paddlers, a steerer and a drummer, and feature a dragon head on the prow. Regina Ramos Urbano paddled for ChemoSavvy Thunder, a team consisting entirely of breast cancer survivors. “A cancer diagnosis can be devastating, so I was happy to join a group of supportive, amazing, and hopeful women who not only understood what I was going through, but provided me with encouragement and inspiration to stay healthy and become fit,” said Regina. ChemoSavvy Thunder and ChemoSavvy Lightening captured first and second place honours respectively in a competitive field of 17 teams in the All Female category. Over 60 teams competed in three categories. The Boeing Water Dragons won the Mixed Competitive category and Dragon Boxers won in the Mixed Recreational category. Trophies were awarded to company teams in four Manitoba industries: engineering (Stantec Slayers); heath care (Gunnars Galley); manufacting (Boeing Water Dragons) and; legal, financial and insurance (TD Titans). Non-racing awards included: Best Decorated Paddlers Village (Gate Keepers); Best Team Cheer (Broad Strokes) George Jarvis Sportsmanship (HMC); Volunteer of the Year (Roger Paquette); Peggy Delaney Best Steersperson (Dave Phillips).
