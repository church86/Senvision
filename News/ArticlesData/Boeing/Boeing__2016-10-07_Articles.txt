(Photo: Bill Carey) Qatar Airways has placed an order with Boeing for 40 787-9 and 777-300ER widebody airliners, plus signed a letter of intent for up to 60 737 Max 8s, which would be the Gulf carrier’s first narrowbody purchase from Boeing in 15 years. The transactions combined are valued at $18.6 billion at list prices. During a press conference that Qatar Airways hosted in Washington, D.C., on October 7, chief executive Akbar Al Baker said the carrier remains committed to a 50-aircraft package with Airbus for A320neo and A321neo airliners, though it has cancelled initial orders because of delivery delays. “We never renege on contracts that we sign. We have a contract signed with Airbus for 50 neo airplanes, and we will continue to get those airplanes,” he said. “The [Boeing 737] that we are ordering today is to serve the ever-expanding network and we are taking these Max airplanes in order to get a firm delivery schedule. “As you know the neos are having problems,” Al Baker added, in reference to early problems with Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered aircraft. “The airlines that have received them are not getting the quantities that they require because of the ongoing issues with the aircraft. For us, to mitigate our [issues] we have no alternative but to order the reliable 737 family of aircraft, which will fuel our continued demand for growth.” Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner, Qatar minister of finance Ali Sharif Al Emadi and U.S. deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken joined Al Baker for the announcement at a Georgetown hotel. Specifically, Qatar Airways ordered 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs valued at $11.7 billion. The 60 737 Max 8s would cost $6.9 billion at list price. Plans call for the 737 deliveries to begin next year, Boeing said. During questioning, Al Baker denied any linkage between the airline’s order and the recently approved U.S. foreign military sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighters to Qatar. “We don’t relate anything to anything,” he said. “Qatar Airways has an independent policy of ordering airplanes. So nothing is attached to anything.” Nor was the order influenced by discussions the U.S., Qatari and UAE governments have held over civil aviation agreements between the countries, Al Baker said. The talks were undertaken after U.S. carriers American, United and Delta accused their Gulf counterparts—Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad  Airways—of anti-competitive practices. “We don’t attach any orders that we place with Boeing to get any special favors for anybody,” Al Baker said. “We have an air services agreement signed between the United States and my country. We meticulously follow each and every condition and clause of that air services agreement…At the end of the day, the business and commercial and economic relationship between our two countries will prevail and not the vested interest of any business entity.” Aircraft http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-10-07/qatar-airways-places-18-billion-order-boeing-airliners There are no comments yet, please Login or Register to begin a discussion.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 8, 2016 at 12:13PM Boeing's KC-46 leads the way -- all the way to Japan. Image source: Boeing. America's defense contractors have a lot of customers, and in a lot of different countries. One of the most important of these is Japan. I know that in theory, Japan's "military" is "only" a self-defense force, but it's a big one. With an annual defense budget measured in the tens of billions, Japan has ranked as the world's 16th-largest weapons importer over the past 15 years. What's more, last year, Japan "reinterpreted" Article 9 of its Constitution to permit various forms of cooperation with military allies -- and in ways formerly verboten to the Self-Defense Forces. Already, the effects of that reinterpretation are making themselves felt. And pretty soon, they should become visible on Boeing's (NYSE:BA) bottom line. Extending Japan's wings Last month, in one of its regular "notifications" to Congress, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced that the Government of Japan has requested permission to buy four KC-46A "Pegasus" aerial refueling aircraft from Boeing. According to DSCA, selling these tankers to Japan will not "affect the basic military balance in the region." It will, however, improve "Japan's capability to participate in Pacific region security operations," improve "Japan's national security posture," and "provide Japan a needed capability to a close ally and support U.S. security interests in the region" -- as is now permitted by the reinterpretation of Japan's Constitution Article 9. Including electronics equipment from Raytheon, missile defense accoutrements from Northrop Grumman, and engines from United Technologies, the total value of the contract is expected to be $1.9 billion -- with Boeing acting as prime contractor. Boeing Stock Market capitalization $82.5 billion Revenue $96.8 billion Net profit $3.7 billion DATA SOURCE: S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE. So what does this mean for Boeing and its shareholders? The size of the proposed Japan contract is impressive in and of itself. But perhaps even more important than the dollar value is the vote of confidence Japan has given Boeing. Remember, the U.S. Air Force itself only OK'd the KC-46 for low-rate initial production (LRIP) a couple of months ago. And just weeks after that happened, Japan placed an order to buy some. Clearly, Japan is champing at the bit to buy this plane -- and where Japan leads, the hope is that other buyers will follow. This is a rare bit of good news for Boeing's KC-46A program, which has been kind of a disaster up until now. Boeing bid low to win a contract to build it for the Air Force, then was forced to eat more than $1 billion in cost overruns on the airplane's development. At this point, for Boeing to have even a chance of breaking even, it needs to sell more Pegasi than the Air Force is prepared to buy -- so as to spread out development costs among as many plane sales as possible. Japan's purchase suggests this may be a viable path forward for Boeing. Should you buy Boeing stock? It's not, however, a good reason to buy Boeing stock in and of itself. Remember, Boeing's entire military aircraft business accounts for just 14% of the company's total sales -- the company's civilian operations are much more significant -- and KC-46 is just one small sliver of Boeing's total military aircraft business. Before buying Boeing stock, you'll want to take a closer look at the company as a whole. So let's do that: Boeing Stock Price-to-earnings ratio 23.8 Price-to-free cash flow 10.6 Price-to-sales 0.85 Projected 5-year growth rate 12.5% Dividend yield 3.3% DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCE, S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE. How does a value investor use numbers like these to determine if a stock like Boeing is worth buying? Start by adding the company's projected growth rate to its dividend yield. These two numbers combined give you the "total return" you're expecting on an investment in Boeing: 15.8%. Ideally, you want to buy the stock when its price-to-earnings or its price-to-free cash flow ratio (or even better, both) are equal to or less than that total return number. Currently, Boeing's P/E ratio fails this test. But its price-to-free cash flow ratio -- actually, the valuation metric that I prefer -- passes with flying colors. Moreover, I can't help noticing that Boeing's price-to-sales ratio, which I've found especially useful for finding bargain stocks in the aerospace and defense industry, is currently clocking in well below the 1.0-times-sales rule of thumb for fair value. The upshot for investors In my book, I'm scoring Boeing at "two out of three ain't bad" on these valuation metrics. Boeing's GAAP-derived P/E ratio looks a bit high -- due, in part, to all the writedowns that Boeing has been forced to take on the KC-46 project. But its low P/FCF and P/S ratios, combined with a respectable growth rate and strong dividend yield, tell me that investors are underestimating the value in Boeing stock today. I think the stock's a buy. In fact, after crunching all these numbers, I think I just might pick up a few shares myself. Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Videographer, Radko Nasinec, captured the cringe-worthy footage of the Boeing 737-430 narrowly avoiding a crash as its wheels grazed the runway. The video, which was shot at the Václav Havel Airport in Prague, Czech Republic, shows the passenger plane swaying back and forth and dipping to the right as it was attempting its first landing, according to ABC News. In the video, the plane can been seen descending and preparing for a landing. During the aircraft's descent, the plane rocked from side to side. As the plane attempted to land, the pilot was forced to pull up quickly because of the large gusts of wind that caused it to sway violently back and forth. The pilot, who has been hailed a hero, reascended and flew the plane back into the holding pattern in preparation for the second landing. During the second attempt to land, the plane once again swayed back and forth on its way down, but this time the pilot was able to make a safe landing. - Daily Telegraph UK Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Rosemary McLeod: Morgan's timing is perfect The timing was right: catch the momentum of the American election, and eclipse it.

By Samantha Payne October 8, 2016 17:53 BST Reuters Boeing has reportedly come to the financial rescue of Monarch Airlines. Forty five new planes will be added to its fleet from 2018. The £165m (£205m) deal, the largest in Monarch's history, will secure the future of the low-budget airline. Monarch has endured a turbulent time recently, partly caused by declining demand for package holidays after terrorist attacks in Egypt and Turkey. It has also been affected by the emergence of new players such as WOW Air and Whizz Air onto the low-cost airline market. Greybull Capital, Monarch's majority shareholder, said Boeing's investment will now help the airline renew its Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL), which expired on 30 September. In an email seen by Sky News this week (7 October), the airline's chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, wrote:"I was at the CAA on Monday and have been spending a lot of time over the last two days with our legal and finance teams, as we dot the i's and cross the t's on the largest investment in our history - on the back of which we expect the CAA to renew our licences and which will help us move into the next stage of our growth and development. "It's been another busy week for all of us following the events of last Friday and the extension to our ATOL licences. All parts of the business are working hard, both to keep things 'business as usual' and maintain consumer and customer confidence, in the face of continued media and social media commentary and speculation. "As soon as we are able to give details of our investment and confirm the renewal I will. But to manage your expectations, this will be on the 12th (Wednesday). As said before, there is a process the business must follow and this takes time."

Remember, the U.S. Air Force itself only OK’d the KC-46 for low-rate initial production (LRIP) a couple of months ago. And just weeks after that happened, Japan placed an order to buy some. Clearly, Japan is champing at the bit to buy this plane — and where Japan leads, the hope is that other buyers will follow. This is a rare bit of good news for Boeing’s KC-46A program, which has been kind of a disaster up until now. Boeing bid low to win a contract to build it for the Air Force, then was forced to eat more than $1 billion in cost overruns on the airplane’s development. At this point, for Boeing to have even a chance of breaking even, it needs to sell more Pegasi than the Air Force is prepared to buy — so as to spread out development costs among as many plane sales as possible. Japan’s purchase suggests this may be a viable path forward for Boeing. Should you buy Boeing stock? It’s not, however, a good reason to buy Boeing stock in and of itself. Remember, Boeing’s entire military aircraft business accounts for just 14% of the company’s total sales — the company’s civilian operations are much more significant — and KC-46 is just one small sliver of Boeing’s total military aircraft business. Before buying Boeing stock, you’ll want to take a closer look at the company as a whole. So let’s do that: Boeing Stock Price-to-earnings ratio 23.8 Price-to-free cash flow 10.6 Price-to-sales 0.85 Projected 5-year growth rate 12.5% Dividend yield 3.3% DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCE,S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE. How does avalue investoruse numbers like these to determine if a stock like Boeing is worth buying? Start by adding the company’s projected growth rate to its dividend yield. These two numbers combined give you the “total return” you’re expecting on an investment in Boeing: 15.8%. Ideally, you want to buy the stock when its price-to-earnings or its price-to-free cash flow ratio (or even better, both) are equal to or less than that total return number. Currently, Boeing’s P/E ratio fails this test. But its price-to-free cash flow ratio — actually, the valuation metric that I prefer — passes with flying colors. Moreover, I can’t help noticing that Boeing’s price-to-sales ratio, which I’ve found especially useful for finding bargain stocks in the aerospace and defense industry, is currently clocking in well below the 1.0-times-sales rule of thumbfor fair value. The upshot for investors In my book, I’m scoring Boeing at “two out of three ain’t bad” on these valuation metrics. Boeing’s GAAP-derived P/E ratio looks a bit high — due, in part, to all the writedowns that Boeing has been forced to take on the KC-46 project. But its low P/FCF and P/S ratios, combined with a respectable growth rate and strong dividend yield, tell me that investors are underestimating the value in Boeing stock today. I think the stock’s a buy. In fact, after crunching all these numbers, I think I just might pick up a few shares myself.

The armed forces will modify one of its $204 million KC-30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft into a VIP jet that can carry up to 270 passengers. It's not clear how much the plane, which is essentially the same as an Airbus A330 commercial jet, will cost to refit with Defence telling The Age it will come out of $190 million already set aside to alter air force aircraft. Australia is getting a 'budget' Air Force One - modifing a $204 million KC-30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft (pictured) into a VIP jet carrying up to 270 passengers It's not clear how much the plane, which is essentially an Airbus A330, will cost to refit with Defence saying it will come out of $190 million already set aside to alter air force aircraft The plan was the cheapest on the table and the result will be similar to the A330 former British PM David Cameron had modified for £10 million (A$16.5 million). Defence said modifications to the KC-30A would be 'modest' but accommodate 'the continuance of government business whilst in transit' and let the PM stay in contact at all times. It will also still be able to refuel in mid-air should this be necessary.

'It's understandable that there has been political angst over the purchase – as there is for any large expensive that seems extravagant, but a plane like this is something every government in the world has and we are a serious middle power and it is entirely appropriate we have the same,' he said. Sean Kelly, a former adviser to prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, said the current aircraft were not so bad but agreed bigger ones were needed. 'Right now you have this crazy situation, where journalists who are conducting exactly the same trip as the Prime Minister... around the world, jumping from country to country, sometimes for weeks at a time, have to make their own arrangements entirely separately,' he said.  AUSTRALIA'S AIR FORCE ONE UPGRADE BY THE NUMBERS  Spec Old planes New plane  Model Boeing 737 KC-30A (Airbus 330)  Passengers  40  270  Length 33.6 metres 59 metres Height 12.5 metres 17.4 metres Wingspan 35.8 metres 60.3 metres Speed 850km/h 860km/h  Range  11,390 kilometres  14,800 kilometres    Read more: Come fly with me - Australia gets its Air Force One Share or comment on this article e-mail 430 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Search Watch Live Home UK World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather Boeing flies to Monarch's rescue with restructured fleet deal Boeing is to support the budget carrier Monarch by restructuring a fleet purchase deal announced in 2014, Sky News learns. 06:59, UK, Sunday 09 October 2016 Image Caption: Monarch airlines employs about 2,800 people Twitter Share on Twitter Facebook Share on Facebook Google+ Share on Google+ Whats App Share on Whatsapp Mail Share by email By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The low-cost airline Monarch is close to finalising a multimillion pound financing package with Boeing, paving the way for its operating licence to be extended by aviation regulators ahead of a crunch deadline next week. Sky News has learnt that Monarch, which has been the subject of intense speculation about its financial health, is putting the finishing touches to a revised fleet purchasing deal with the giant aircraft manufacturer which should safeguard its medium-term future. City sources said this weekend that Monarch's deal with Boeing was focused on an order for 45 new planes announced in 2014, and which the US-based group had agreed in principle to restructure. Under the restructured purchase agreement, Monarch will be able to enter into sale-and-leaseback arrangements for the aircraft, which sources said would free up "significant" cashflow for the carrier.  The terms with Boeing, which are not expected to be publicly disclosed, will form part of an overall £165m investment package that will see Greybull Capital, Monarch's controlling shareholder, inject new funds into the company alongside the renewal of its Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL). Firm orders have been placed for 30 of the new aircraft for delivery from 2018, with the remaining 15 subject to a future option to proceed. An insider said this weekend that the revised deal with Boeing could generate hundreds of millions of pounds for Monarch given the scale of demand in the market for aircraft financing.  That, in turn, would allow Greybull to provide more equity to Monarch, enabling it to cope more easily with a downturn in trade similar to that seen in recent months. Boeing is not expected to become a shareholder in, or lender to, Monarch under the revised deal - which is not without risk given general economic uncertainty and political instability in some of the markets served by the airline. The bulk of the £160m is in the form of new equity, according to one source, and would comprise what the airline has previously said would be the biggest investment in its 48-year history. Like competitors, Monarch has struggled with declining demand for package holidays to Egypt and Turkey in the wake of terrorist attacks, as well as protracted air traffic disruption in France.  It employs about 2,800 people and is based at Luton Airport. One insider described the relationship between Boeing and Monarch as "strong and constructive". In an email to Monarch staff sent on Friday and seen by Sky News, the airline's chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, said he had met with officials at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) this week to discuss the renewal of its licence.  Monarch's previous licence, which expired on 30 September, was extended for 12 days to give the company sufficient time to finalise its new funding arrangements. "I was at the CAA on Monday and have been spending a lot of time over the last two days with our legal and finance teams, as we dot the i's and cross the t's on the largest investment in our history - on the back of which we expect the CAA to renew our licences and which will help us move into the next stage of our growth and development," Mr Swaffield wrote. "It's been another busy week for all of us following the events of last Friday and the extension to our ATOL licences.   "All parts of the business are working hard, both to keep things 'business as usual' and maintain consumer and customer confidence, in the face of continued media and social media commentary and speculation.   "As soon as we are able to give details of our investment and confirm the renewal I will.   "But to manage your expectations, this will be on the 12th (Wednesday).   "As said before, there is a process the business must follow and this takes time." In a statement issued on 30 September, the CAA said it had granted the licence extension on the basis that "the shareholder (would) provide additional funding and because customers' money will be protected".  The regulator added: "Monarch now has 12 days to satisfy the CAA that the group is able to meet the requirements for a full ATOL licence.  "Monarch will remain ATOL-licensed until this extension expires.  "The CAA always advises consumers to ensure they book ATOL-protected air holidays and consumers who choose to book an ATOL-protected flight or holiday with the company during this time will continue to be protected by the ATOL scheme.  "During this period of extension, the CAA will continue to monitor the company." Greybull, which bought Tata Steel's Scunthorpe steelworks earlier this year and renamed the business British Steel, rescued Monarch in 2014, refocusing its network on short-haul destinations in Europe and the Mediterranean. Monarch, Boeing and Greybull all declined to comment on Saturday.

No, really, it isn't. Big powerful rockets may get us to Mars, but our trips to the Red Planet won't succeed without biological tools. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Oct 8, 2016 at 8:23AM Image source: Getty Images. Elon Musk has captured our imaginations by releasing plans to put humans on Mars by 2022 and establish a colony of 1 million individuals as soon as the 2060's. SpaceX seems to have worked out a lot of the logistics: fleets of up to one thousand spacecraft in Earth orbit, windows of opportunity for departing toward Mars, and even plans for establishing fuel and supply depots before humans arrive. What's not to get excited about? Not to be outdone, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg vowed to beat SpaceX to the Red Planet, saying, "I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket." While in the long run it doesn't really matter whose logo arrives first, competition will be key to establishing ourselves as a multi-planetary species. It got us to the moon, after all. But egos aside, rockets aren't the most important technology -- or largest obstacle -- to our success. It's easy to obsess and focus on the visible tools a trip to Mars requires, such as rockets the length of a football field, but we won't be going anywhere without the comparatively invisible tools of biotechnology.  Trek to the Red Planet What makes biotech essential to a successful trip and stay, however brief, on Mars? Quite a lot, actually. Let's consider the trip itself. On a 200-day journey to the Red Planet, a human would be exposed to the radiation equivalent of 24 CAT scans, according to Space.com. That's more than 15 times the annual radiation limit for nuclear power plant employees. While spacecraft will need to be equipped with radiation shielding to protect colonists and electronic systems, the materials are expensive and heavy -- limiting factors for interplanetary travel. We may be able to greatly reduce the need for radiation shielding by engineering ourselves to withstand higher doses of radiation, which overloads our natural ability to repair DNA. Researchers recently found that human cells engineered to produce a protein found in the microscopic tardigrade, or water bear, could reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage by 40%. It's far from reality at this point, but one genetic edit could slash hundreds of billions of dollars in expenses from regularly scheduled treks to Mars. SpaceX and Boeing (and their investors) would probably be interested in that. Radiation is far from the only threat to our health during interplanetary travel. Eighty percent of astronauts who participate on long-duration missions in space return to Earth with permanently altered vision. The condition was first recognized in astronaut John Phillips, who left Earth with 20/20 vision and returned with 20/100 vision after a six-month stay on the International Space Station. Doctors discovered that the shape of his eyes changed during his mission, which was shorter than a trip to Mars, because of pressure imbalances in the skull. The only known treatment involves spinal taps or drilling holes into a patient's skull and must be conducted at the onset, meaning in the zero-gravity environment of space. Aside from the logistical hurdles of performing invasive procedures in space, astronauts and future colonists -- SpaceX and Boeing customers -- would probably prefer a biological solution. Sustaining a colony Getting to Mars isn't the only part of Elon Musk's plan that could be greatly aided by biology. As history has shown numerous times, sustaining a colony is more difficult than establishing one. For instance, the English colony of Roanoke was established in 1585 in what is now North Carolina. Despite multiple resupply trips, the colony was abandoned five years later, without any trace of the colonists.  Because of differences in orbit, the shortest trip to Mars can be made once every 26 months. That means colonists will need to fend for themselves for roughly two years. It will be awfully expensive to launch, transport, and deposit enough food, fuel, medicine, and building materials to support even 100 colonists for two years. While some colony-building and supply missions will need to be completed ahead of the first human arrivals, Boeing and SpaceX will find their efforts much less difficult if colonists leverage biology as a manufacturing paradigm. Borrowing from industrial biotech platforms here on Earth today, it's possible to send test tubes of microbes capable of producing supplies ranging from rocket fuel to polymers for 3-D printers to the metal electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. The building blocks required for these products are already in the crust and atmosphere of the Red Planet. Better yet, test tubes are cheaper to transport than are many metric tons of raw materials. We need green tech to get to the Red Planet When discussing his plans for SpaceX to get to Mars, Musk made it clear that survival and colony-building aren't his problem, instead likening the company to the Union Pacific Railroad's role in developing the West Coast of the United States. I would argue that it is his problem. People won't be going to Mars if they won't survive the trip or stay, which makes biology, not the size of the rocket, the limiting factor. Humans made it to California without railroads, after all. The good news is that engineered biology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, especially in the past several years. We really do need bigger, cheaper, and safer rockets to get to Mars. And it will take many companies and governments to fill in all of the missing pieces. But while rockets and spacecraft are cool, know this: Boeing and SpaceX aren't going anywhere without biotechnology. Maxx Chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices, said a statement from Boeing. One of largest fleet announcements in Qatar Airways' history validates the value, reliability and performance of Boeing's twin-aisle airplanes. Today's announcement builds on Qatar Airways' current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatari national carrier boosts its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was made in the presence of Qatar's Minister of Finance Ali Shareef Al Emadi, US Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar Mohammed Jaham Al Kuwari. On the new deal, Qatar Airways Group chief executive Akbar Al Baker, said: "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead." "Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service," he stated. Qatar Airways' relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership. The airline was the first to operate the 787 in the Middle East and is a launch customer for the 777X, said Al Baker. With the commitment for the 737 MAX 8, it would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways' fleet in more than 15 years. "Congratulations to The Boeing Company and Qatar Airways on the remarkable milestone they've reached, which will significantly grow the number of Boeing aircraft in the Qatar Airways fleet," said US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. "Beyond its importance for these two companies, this agreement demonstrates the importance of global commercial partnerships in strengthening our bilateral ties. This deal will strengthen economic opportunity and job creation, and highlights the importance of strong global trading relationships," he added. Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive Ray Conner said: "We are so very proud that a discerning and market-leading customer like Qatar Airways not only continues to endorse our current products, but also has confidence in Boeing's new technology that will soon be evident on the 777X and 737 MAX." The 777-300ER is the most reliable twin-aisle airplane flying today and is considered to be the flagship of the world's elite airlines. It has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 percent - the airplane is on time, nearly all the time. The 787-9 Dreamliner is the second member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 family. The 787-9, a stretch of the 787-8, can fly 290 passengers 7,635 nautical miles (14,140 km) in addition to more cargo, allowing airlines the ability to grow routes first opened by the 787-8. Boeing's newest family of single-aisle airplanes - 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9 and 737 MAX 200 - builds on the Next-Generation 737's popularity and reliability while delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," remarked Conner.-TradeArabia News Service Tags: Qatar Airways | Boeing | planes | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Gulf Air adds Colombo to destination network Air Arabia Q3 net profit up 26pc Trump effect dampens ME tourism to the US Al Futtaim, InterCon ink deal for UAE's largest Holiday Inn Family-friendly staycation at Emirates Park Zoo and Resort Mövenpick Hotel West Bay Doha wins two top honours Emirates Skywards adds The Wall Street Journal to partner list Sharjah Museums takes centre stage at WTM London Jannah Hotels to open first RAK property in December Honda targets 80 business jets annually Modul Dubai starts hospitality management course Abu Dhabi airport interchange project on track New Doha 5-star hotel names resident manager Saudi Arabian Airlines names new CEO Jet Airways flies high with $850m revenue in Q2 Dubai hotels see occupancy, rates decline in October Bahrain Tourism Authority to take part in Jewellery Arabia Travco Group sells stakes in Air Arabia Egypt Fairmont The Palm appoints two new culinary talents WTM London closes on a high $24bn hotel projects under construction in Saudi, UAE Dubai South appoints TMIL for VIP Terminal branding Anniversary celebrations at Ramada Downtown Dubai Emirates moves to an all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet VFS Global launches France visa service in Oman Exclusive Staycation packages at Al Raha Beach Hotel Emirates Skywards eases ground travel with Careem partnership Fairmont Hotel creates first tea etiquette guide Big success for Bahrain stand at WTM London Oman Airports inks deal with Turkish firm Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

No, really, it isn't. Big powerful rockets may get us to Mars, but our trips to the Red Planet won't succeed without biological tools. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Oct 8, 2016 at 8:23AM Image source: Getty Images. Elon Musk has captured our imaginations by releasing plans to put humans on Mars by 2022 and establish a colony of 1 million individuals as soon as the 2060's. SpaceX seems to have worked out a lot of the logistics: fleets of up to one thousand spacecraft in Earth orbit, windows of opportunity for departing toward Mars, and even plans for establishing fuel and supply depots before humans arrive. What's not to get excited about? Not to be outdone, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg vowed to beat SpaceX to the Red Planet, saying, "I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket." While in the long run it doesn't really matter whose logo arrives first, competition will be key to establishing ourselves as a multi-planetary species. It got us to the moon, after all. But egos aside, rockets aren't the most important technology -- or largest obstacle -- to our success. It's easy to obsess and focus on the visible tools a trip to Mars requires, such as rockets the length of a football field, but we won't be going anywhere without the comparatively invisible tools of biotechnology.  Trek to the Red Planet What makes biotech essential to a successful trip and stay, however brief, on Mars? Quite a lot, actually. Let's consider the trip itself. On a 200-day journey to the Red Planet, a human would be exposed to the radiation equivalent of 24 CAT scans, according to Space.com. That's more than 15 times the annual radiation limit for nuclear power plant employees. While spacecraft will need to be equipped with radiation shielding to protect colonists and electronic systems, the materials are expensive and heavy -- limiting factors for interplanetary travel. We may be able to greatly reduce the need for radiation shielding by engineering ourselves to withstand higher doses of radiation, which overloads our natural ability to repair DNA. Researchers recently found that human cells engineered to produce a protein found in the microscopic tardigrade, or water bear, could reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage by 40%. It's far from reality at this point, but one genetic edit could slash hundreds of billions of dollars in expenses from regularly scheduled treks to Mars. SpaceX and Boeing (and their investors) would probably be interested in that. Radiation is far from the only threat to our health during interplanetary travel. Eighty percent of astronauts who participate on long-duration missions in space return to Earth with permanently altered vision. The condition was first recognized in astronaut John Phillips, who left Earth with 20/20 vision and returned with 20/100 vision after a six-month stay on the International Space Station. Doctors discovered that the shape of his eyes changed during his mission, which was shorter than a trip to Mars, because of pressure imbalances in the skull. The only known treatment involves spinal taps or drilling holes into a patient's skull and must be conducted at the onset, meaning in the zero-gravity environment of space. Aside from the logistical hurdles of performing invasive procedures in space, astronauts and future colonists -- SpaceX and Boeing customers -- would probably prefer a biological solution. Sustaining a colony Getting to Mars isn't the only part of Elon Musk's plan that could be greatly aided by biology. As history has shown numerous times, sustaining a colony is more difficult than establishing one. For instance, the English colony of Roanoke was established in 1585 in what is now North Carolina. Despite multiple resupply trips, the colony was abandoned five years later, without any trace of the colonists.  Because of differences in orbit, the shortest trip to Mars can be made once every 26 months. That means colonists will need to fend for themselves for roughly two years. It will be awfully expensive to launch, transport, and deposit enough food, fuel, medicine, and building materials to support even 100 colonists for two years. While some colony-building and supply missions will need to be completed ahead of the first human arrivals, Boeing and SpaceX will find their efforts much less difficult if colonists leverage biology as a manufacturing paradigm. Borrowing from industrial biotech platforms here on Earth today, it's possible to send test tubes of microbes capable of producing supplies ranging from rocket fuel to polymers for 3-D printers to the metal electrodes in lithium-ion batteries.

Saul Loeb / AFP Boeing wins $18.6 billion deal as Qatar Airways takes first 737 Max jetliner Bloomberg October 8, 2016 Updated: October 8, 2016 02:12 PM Related Airbus and Boeing jet engine maker forecasts higher profit for the year Jet-engine maker Pratt the butt of $10bn dollar jokes Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Qatar Airways to place a large aircraft order soon, says chief executive Qatar Airways business class review: Boston to Abu Dhabi is a smooth ride Topics: Qatar Airways Airbus Boeing Boeing landed an US$18.6 billion deal with Qatar Airways for as many as 100 aircraft, providing a sales boost to the US company’s upgraded 737 jetliner with one of the year’s largest commercial airplane deals. The Doha-based carrier pledged to buy as many as 60 of the 737 Max 8 jet, valued at $6.9bn at list prices, marking its first narrow-body order with Boeing since 1979. Qatar Airways also ordered 40 total 777 and 787 Dreamliner twin-aisle aircraft, Akbar Al Baker, the airline’s chief executive officer, and Boeing commercial airplane chief executive Ray Conner said Friday in Washington. With the commitment, Mr Al Baker made good on earlier threats to buy Boeing’s 737 Max after rejecting initial A320neo deliveries from Airbus Group because of engine issues. The transaction also provided a vote of confidence in the Boeing jet, which is on pace to begin commercial service months ahead of schedule in the second quarter next year. Qatar Airways will take its first Max in 2018, Mr Al Baker said in an interview. He insisted the decision to pivot to the rival Boeing model wasn’t intended as retaliation against the European planemaker. "There is no message to Airbus," he said. "We don’t send messages by aircraft purchases to each other." The order gives a boost to Chicago-based Boeing, which, like Airbus, has been contending with sales slowed by economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia and a commodities downturn in Russia and Brazil. Meanwhile, relatively low fuel prices have damped demand for new, fuel-efficient wide-body jets such as the 777 and 787 and contributed to a glut of second-hand models. Qatar Airways still intends to follow through on a 2011 order for 50 Airbus A320neo and A321neo planes, which have a combined value of $6.4bn at list prices, Mr Al Baker said. But he also took a swipe over issues with the aircraft’s geared turbofan engine, which is made by United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney unit, saying the delays left him with "no alternative" but to order the "reliable" Boeing narrow-body planes. "We never renege on contracts that we sign," Mr Al Baker said. "The aircraft that we are ordering today will serve this ever-expanding network." Qatar is also ordering 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 model and 10 777-300ER jets, valued at a combined $11.7bn at list prices before discounts that are customary for large aircraft purchases. It is Boeing’s largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into plans for the 777, the planemaker’s largest twin-engine aircraft, as well as for the Dreamliner, the company’s marquee carbon-fibre jet. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Airbus and Boeing jet engine maker forecasts higher profit for the year Jet-engine maker Pratt the butt of $10bn dollar jokes Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Qatar Airways to place a large aircraft order soon, says chief executive More Aviation Air Arabia third-quarter profit lifted by passenger gains Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Honda plans to increase business jet production Jet Airways income edges up MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai India’s currency move will hit property and gold Chinese interest in Dubai Green Fund More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Having trouble saving money in the UAE?

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. Qatar will buy 30 of the new-generation Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777, both widebody aircraft, for USD 11.7 billion. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion. Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country's history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. Al-Baker acknowledged the decision to go with Boeing also was due to "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus. Al-Baker in April publicly blasted Airbus over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. In June, Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the planes. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," Al-Baker told a news conference in Washington attended by government officials from the US and Qatar. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a time-frame for deliveries. Tags  Qatar Airways Boeing order Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Mobile version Sign Up Login Home Lebanon Middle East World Business Sports Climate Change & Environment Entertainment Offbeat Culture Science Obituaries Technology Health Entrepreneurship Roundup En ع Qatar Airways Orders 100 Boeing Planes for Up to $18.6 Billion إقرأ هذا الخبر بالعربية by Naharnet Newsdesk 07 October 2016, 16:53 Comment 2 Tweet Qatar Airways announced a large airplane order with Boeing Friday that includes up to $6.9 billion in single-aisle planes following delays in a rival Airbus offering. Under the agreement, Qatar will buy 30 new-generation Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777s, both widebody aircraft, for $11.7 billion, the companies announced.  Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 narrow-body Boeing 737 aircraft. The deal is worth as much as $18.6 billion all together. The order for the 737s follows unusual public criticism of Airbus earlier this year by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar al-Baker over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. The order would help meet growing demand for air travel, al-Baker said Friday. But the decision to go with Boeing was also prompted by "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus, Al-Baker acknowledged, appearing with Boeing executives and U.S. and Qatar government officials at a news conference in Washington. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," he said. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." Al-Baker later emphasized that his company would continue to work with Airbus and take delivery of the A320 planes when they are ready. We are not "pointing fingers or trying to embarrass Airbus," he told AFP. "We have close relations with Airbus and we are continuing to receive aircraft orders." "The decision for us to buy Boeing airplanes is to get them for certain missions which today Airbus aircraft are not able to do," he added. "We will maintain all of our commitments to Airbus." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. Al-Baker threatened to cancel the Airbus order in April due to problems with the engine and other difficulties, resulting in an "unacceptable" delay in delivering six planes. "We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B," he said at the time. Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the Airbus planes in June. The Qatar contract gives Boeing a boost. The U.S. company had net orders of 380 through the end of the third quarter, suggesting its full-year tally for 2016 will come in below last year's 868. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a timeframe for deliveries. Shares of Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.53 in afternoon trade.

The agreement for up to 100 jetliners potentially worth $18.6 billion helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal marked a key commitment by Qatar Airways to Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner, after it refused to accept three of Airbus' competing A320 aircraft earlier this year. Qatar has not ordered 737s previously. Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing's product line. Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers. "I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities," Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane. "Now it's a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together," he said. "I can't give you a real time frame on that, but we're certainly working the heck out of it right now." BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Qatar Airways' order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations. - Reuters - News National News International News Business News Sports News Documentary Links CNN News BBC News AseanMedia Channel News Asia Others About Us Contact Us Feedback Copyright © 2016 RTB News Website.

The Easton Sports Development Foundation recently won the North American bid to play host to the third leg of the Archery World Cup in 2017, '18 and '19. Next year, it will take place June 21-25. In the Archery World Cup, the top eight archers in several categories compete in four events in four different countries. More than 300 athletes from 40 countries are expected to attend, said Jeff Robbins, president and CEO of the Utah Sports Commission, which teamed with Easton and Visit Salt Lake on the bid. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Hosting these three Archery World Cup events is a key part of our Olympic legacy efforts," he added. Easton Foundations President Greg Easton said he was excited to show off the new Easton Salt Lake Archery Center, 575 John Glenn Road, in western Salt Lake City. USA Archery CEO Denise Parker credited that center, "one of the finest archery training facilities in the world," to the World Cup circuit returning to the United States. She's hoping having events in the U.S. will accelerate the "tremendous growth our sport has experienced in the last several years." In $11.7B deal, Qatar Airways will buy 40 planes from Boeing Doha-based Qatar Airways said it will purchase 40 new long-range aircraft from Boeing Co. for $11.7 billion. The quick-growing Middle East airline is ordering 30 of Boeing's new 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 widebody 777-300ERs. Boeing has a sizable presence in Utah, with large plants in Salt Lake City and South Jordan. Qatar also signed a letter of intent to buy up to 60 of Boeing's 737 MAX 8s, the new version of its best-selling short- and mid-range jet. The list price is $6.9 billion.

His contributions to geology and biology rank him as one of the greatest scientists in history. His inventions — from the parachute to the helicopter — were centuries before their time. He was able to accomplish all of this in large part because he saw all knowledge as related. So when trying to tackle one of the biggest challenges of our time — educating students today for the jobs of tomorrow — it is only natural to take inspiration from this true "Renaissance man." To best prepare students for the increasingly complex and demanding challenges in today's world, they must learn to adapt to new environments and readily envision new ideas and innovations. They must be able to think conceptually and learn from failures. They must understand science, technology, engineering, arts and math — the STEAM fields that will be critical in the 21st Century workforce — and how all of them work together in the real world. VIDEOS TOP JOBS This week we celebrate The Leonardo Museum's fifth anniversary. For the past five years, we have developed one-of-a-kind interactive exhibits to help Utah's students think more like da Vinci and become better prepared for whatever comes their way in the future. Visitors are immersed in issues that face us locally and globally and are provided STEAM concepts and tools as a way to navigate these real-world problems. Students have fun while they are learning. And because they are more engaged than they would be in a more traditional classroom, they leave with better knowledge retention, greater interest in schools, and, perhaps most importantly, critical thinking skills. But the spirit of da Vinci told us that we can't limit learning to just our faculties. So as our state's leaders emphasized teaching computer science, we wanted to expand our efforts. And we saw that there weren't enough qualified teachers to teach the courses. Around the same time, representatives from Boeing reached out to us. The company has a long history in our state dating back to 1927, and today the company has nearly 1,000 employees based here. Since the company's founding in 1916, Boeing has made giving back to the communities it calls home a core part of its mission. And around the same time we were looking for more ways to help Utah's students, Boeing took notice of the impact we were having. They reached out, wanting to invest in our efforts and help us grow. Soon after, Boeing provided the funding to help us create a Teacher Professional Development program focused on helping teachers gain the skills and resources to support Applied Computer Science classes. Since Boeing's initial investment, we have served over 200 teachers, and each of them went on to help inspire between 20 and 120 students a year. And that was the beginning of a great partnership between The Leonardo and Boeing. Today, Boeing is helping with our FLIGHT exhibit, providing not only a donation but, more importantly, the manpower to help oversee design and fabrication. For example, they connected us with Curiosity Machine, a group that creates hands-on engineering design challenges and provided activities to bolster our FLIGHT exhibit. To some, this partnership might seem odd, after all, we are a young organization, still testing what works and learning from our mistakes. Boeing on the other hand is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. Our partnership with Boeing has shown us that their leaders understand the right mix of start-up enthusiasm and the tried-and-true experience that are both needed to build something to last. In many ways, they are a lot like us at The Leonardo. Five years into this adventure, we continue to be inspired by the spirit of da Vinci, as we lean on the experience of our partners to guide us. Together, we will ensure the students of today learn the skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow.

News Boeing To 'Wait And See' If Qatar Order Can Prevent 777 Output Cut It's too early to tell if the 10 Boeing 777s that Qatar Air ordered will be enough to keep production levels steady for the widebody jet. (Boeing) GILLIAN RICH 10/07/2016 Reprints WASHINGTON — Qatar Airways announced a deal for up to 100 airplanes from Boeing (BA) on Friday, but it's still too early to tell if the 10 777s that the Mideast carrier ordered will be enough to keep production levels for the widebody jet steady. The $18.6 billion deal includes a firm order for 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ER aircraft as well as options to buy up to 60 737 Max 8 jets. Boeing shares dipped 0.4% to close at 133.85 in the stock market today, after aerospace supplier Honeywell (HON) cut guidance, citing weaker business jet and general aviation shipments. U.S.-listed shares of rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 1.9%. Raymond Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial division, said at a press briefing that while the order for 10 777s is "big," the company would have to "wait and see" if another production cut is needed, depending on where the airplanes fall in the delivery stream. The aerospace giant had already announced that it is cutting production of the widebody jet to 7 per month in 2017, down from 8.3 per month currently. But that production pace is threatened by slumping sales. Boeing hopes to maintain a certain level of output of its current-generation 777s to engineer a seamless transition on its production lines as workers shift to the next-generation 777X in the coming years. But customers have been reluctant to buy the older design, preferring to wait for the newer one. In a note Friday before Boeing's announcement, Cowen analysts wrote that a 777 rate cut is likely "even with Mideast orders," saying the deal with Qatar Air and an order from Iran for 15 777s probably won't be enough to fill gaps in the delivery schedule. Boeing still needs 777 orders for 2019-2021 as its first 777X deliveries don't start until 2020, Cowen said. IBD'S TAKE: Boeing was initiated with an outperform rating on strong cash flow and solid shareholder returns, but 777 weakness and increased competition from Airbus' A320 family are major risks to the stock's performance.  Friday's announcement came just weeks after the White House approved the sale of military planes to Qatar. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said the commercial deal was "independent" of any military deal. But sources told Reuters that Friday's order was delayed to try and speed up White House approval for Boeing to sell F-15 fighter jets to Doha.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg means to ride his dark horse straight to Mars, beating NASA, Elon Musk, and everybody else to the Red Planet. Bloomberg reports that Muilenberg, speaking at the Atlantic’s “What’s Next” conference in Chicago, said he’s “convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket.” But Jeff Bezos doesn’t mean to be outdone. Blue Origin ran a successful test of its New Shepard crew escape pod this week, and did better than anyone expected. “Today, we’re likely going to lose the New Shepard booster,” Ariane Cornell had said on the Blue Origin webcast a bit before liftoff. “Today’s [Wednesday’s] mission is totally focused on a successful crew capsule escape with the understanding that the booster will likely be lost.” But they managed to land the booster upright with a powered descent to a pad, with nothing more than a list to the side and a little bit of singeing at the edges. Sabotage of the rocket is unlikely, but this article has some great theories :)https://t.co/1fCRbZvRHo — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2016 While it might be tempting to speculate on the motives that frenemies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin or ULA might have to sabotage SpaceX, not even SpaceX thinks someone sniped their rocket. Company president Gwynne Shotwell addressed the 2016 Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council in Kuala Lumpur this week about what SpaceX has been up to lately, SpaceNews.com reports. While reassuring everyone that SpaceX has it together with regards to their ongoing operations, Shotwell dropped a few choice sound bites about the original September 1 kaboom. Shotwell appears to be pretty confident about its source. SpaceNews quotes her as commenting that “We believe that the composite over wrapped pressure vessel [the helium bottle], known as a COPv, let go in the tank.” She explained that the whole rocket is bristling with accelerometers, which let investigators find out exactly where in the rocket the disturbance began. That’s how they know it wasn’t a bullet. It probably wasn’t a design flaw with the bottle, either, and it also probably wasn’t ground systems responsible for the failure of the pressure vessel. Shotwell is pretty sure “operations” was the source, but didn’t get less vague than that. “Let go,” though, suggests a blowout. CNG tank delamination. Hammer for scale. Found on CleanMPG For reference, the above is what happens when a composite overwrapped pressure vessel “lets go.” It’s called delamination. It’s really fun to look at, and really bad for whatever used to be laminated. The image above is from a CNG-fueled car that exploded. Imagine the violence of the decompression event that could blow a composite-wrapped pressure vessel into a shaggy, fuzzy pile of fibers. Now picture something like that happening to a composite-wrapped helium bottle inside the tank of liquid oxygen, perhaps because of a thermal differential between tanks. It would certainly explain the quieter bang a few moments before the massive fireball in the SpaceX incident. Pressed to address the idea that a “nefarious actor” had tried to take out the rocket, Shotwell remarked that while you can’t ignore anything during such an investigation, no matter how unlikely it might be, “The more-than-likely — the overwhelmingly likely — explanation is that we did something to that rocket. And we’re going to find it and we’re going to fix it.” Tagged In nasa mars spacex elon musk Boeing Jeff Bezos blue origin United Launch Alliance Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Newsletter Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion.(Reuters) Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. Qatar will buy 30 of the new-generation Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777, both widebody aircraft, for USD 11.7 billion. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion. Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country’s history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. Al-Baker acknowledged the decision to go with Boeing also was due to “ongoing issues” with Boeing rival Airbus. Al-Baker in April publicly blasted Airbus over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. In June, Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the planes. “Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else,” Al-Baker told a news conference in Washington attended by government officials from the US and Qatar. “They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this.” The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. “Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes,” said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a time-frame for deliveries.   Please Wait while comments are loading...

The state-owned airline has agreed to buy 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its b-market 777-300 aircraft worth $11.7bn. At the same time it said it intends to order up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9bn. The bumper aircraft spree grows Qatar’s order backlog of Boeing airplanes from 65 to 105 and will more than double its current fleet, which consists of 84 Boeing aircraft, all delivered to Qatar’s flag carrier in the last nine years. Timelapse video shows super-fast construction of a BA 787-9 Dreamliner Play! 03:59 Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker claims that the airline’s expansion is one of the fastest in aviation history and the latest deal will power its continued growth. The airline’s rapid growth in recent years has included Qatar bolstering its stake in British Airways-owner International Airlines Group to more than a fifth of the FTSE 100 company earlier this year. Qatar said its interest in IAG as “purely financial”. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al Baker Credit: Fred Lancelot/AP Photo Late last month Qatar Airways strengthened its ties to British Airways owner with a pact to co-operate on scheduling and pricing of flights. Under the new deal the airlines will take part in 'code-sharing', so both airlines can sell tickets for the same flight, on all non-stop flights between the UK and Doha. The deal will also include connecting services to destinations in the UK, continental Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa.

Close share panel × Image copyright AFP US aircraft maker Boeing has announced a major deal to supply Qatar Airways with wide-body jetliners. The deal includes 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at $11.7bn (£9.4bn) at list prices, along with the option to buy 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9bn at list prices. It is the largest single order ever placed by the Gulf carrier. The deal gives Boeing a boost in a year when orders for widebody planes have slumped. Qatar has been frustrated over prolonged delivery problems from Boeing's European rival aircraft maker, Airbus. Media reports last week suggested the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7bn. Airplane makers typically give large discounts on the list price when carriers order in bulk. Analysis: Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The continuing fight between Qatar Airways and Airbus has turned nasty - with Boeing emerging as the big winner. The chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker, is a forthright individual. He has previously described his airline's relationship with Airbus as "strained" because of delivery delays and engine problems with the Airbus A320neos. Now Akbar Al Baker is sending Airbus a message, with a big order for its American rival. The mega deal is not just a financial winner for Boeing. It's also a huge boost for the US plane maker's single aisle 737 MAX aircraft. It is the US aerospace giant's newest plane and doesn't go into service until next year. And politics may also be at play. There was a suggestion that the Qatar government may have delayed the Boeing passenger jet order to put pressure on the US to approve a deal for Boeing fighter jets to the Middle Eastern country - a deal which the Americans now look set to approve.

Posted 07 Oct 2016 23:15 Updated 08 Oct 2016 02:55 The logo of Qatar Airways is pictured at the International Tourism Trade Fair (ITB) in Berlin, Germany, March 9, 2016. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: Gulf carrier Qatar Airways ordered 40 Boeing Co widebody jets valued at $11.7 billion and signed a letter of intent for up to 60 narrowbody 737 MAX 8 jets worth $6.9 billion, Boeing and the airline said on Friday. The agreement for up to 100 jetliners potentially worth $18.6 billion helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal marked a key commitment by Qatar Airways to Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner, after it refused to accept three of Airbus' competing A320 aircraft earlier this year. Qatar has not ordered 737s previously. Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing's product line. Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers. "I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities," Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane. "Now it's a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together," he said. "I can't give you a real time frame on that, but we're certainly working the heck out of it right now." BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Qatar Airways' order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.

Home Industry Companies Qatar Airways orders 100 Boeing planes for up to $18.6 billion Qatar Airways orders 100 Boeing planes for up to $18.6 billion Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. By: AFP | Washington | Published: October 7, 2016 11:22 PM Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country’s history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. (Reuters) Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. Qatar will buy 30 of the new-generation Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777, both widebody aircraft, for USD 11.7 billion. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion. Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country’s history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. Al-Baker acknowledged the decision to go with Boeing also was due to “ongoing issues” with Boeing rival Airbus. Al-Baker in April publicly blasted Airbus over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. In June, Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the planes. “Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else,” Al-Baker told a news conference in Washington attended by government officials from the US and Qatar. “They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this.” The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. “Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes,” said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a time-frame for deliveries. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Under the agreement, Qatar will buy 30 new-generation Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777s, both widebody aircraft, for $11.7 billion, the companies announced. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 narrow-body Boeing 737 aircraft. The deal is worth as much as $18.6 billion all together. The order for the 737s follows unusual public criticism of Airbus earlier this year by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. The order would help meet growing demand for air travel, Al-Baker said Friday. But the decision to go with Boeing was also prompted by "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus, Al-Baker acknowledged, appearing with Boeing executives and US and Qatar government officials at a news conference in Washington. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," he said. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." Al-Baker later emphasized that his company would continue to work with Airbus and take delivery of the A320 planes when they are ready. We are not "pointing fingers or trying to embarrass Airbus," he told AFP. "We have close relations with Airbus and we are continuing to receive aircraft orders." "The decision for us to buy Boeing airplanes is to get them for certain missions which today Airbus aircraft are not able to do," he added. "We will maintain all of our commitments to Airbus." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. Al-Baker threatened to cancel the Airbus order in April due to problems with the engine and other difficulties, resulting in an "unacceptable" delay in delivering six planes. "We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B," he said at the time. Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the Airbus planes in June. The Qatar contract gives Boeing a boost. The US company had net orders of 380 through the end of the third quarter, suggesting its full-year tally for 2016 will come in below last year's 868. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a timeframe for deliveries. Shares of Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.53 in afternoon trade.

Al-Baker threatened to cancel the Airbus order in April due to problems with the engine and other difficulties, resulting in an "unacceptable" delay in delivering six planes. "We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B," he said at the time. Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the Airbus planes in June. The Qatar contract gives Boeing a boost. The US company had net orders of 380 through the end of the third quarter, suggesting its full-year tally for 2016 will come in below last year's 868. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a timeframe for deliveries. Shares of Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.53 in afternoon trade.

Under the agreement, Qatar will buy 30 new-generation Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777s, both widebody aircraft, for $11.7 billion, the companies announced. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 narrow-body Boeing 737 aircraft. The deal is worth as much as $18.6 billion all together. The order for the 737s follows unusual public criticism of Airbus earlier this year by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. The order would help meet growing demand for air travel, Al-Baker said Friday. But the decision to go with Boeing was also prompted by "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus, Al-Baker acknowledged, appearing with Boeing executives and US and Qatar government officials at a news conference in Washington. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," he said. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." Al-Baker later emphasized that his company would continue to work with Airbus and take delivery of the A320 planes when they are ready. We are not "pointing fingers or trying to embarrass Airbus," he told AFP. "We have close relations with Airbus and we are continuing to receive aircraft orders." "The decision for us to buy Boeing airplanes is to get them for certain missions which today Airbus aircraft are not able to do," he added. "We will maintain all of our commitments to Airbus." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. Al-Baker threatened to cancel the Airbus order in April due to problems with the engine and other difficulties, resulting in an "unacceptable" delay in delivering six planes. "We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B," he said at the time. Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the Airbus planes in June. The Qatar contract gives Boeing a boost. The US company had net orders of 380 through the end of the third quarter, suggesting its full-year tally for 2016 will come in below last year's 868. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a timeframe for deliveries. Shares of Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.53 in afternoon trade.

airline's single-aisle fleet One of largest fleet announcements in Qatar Airways' history News provided by Boeing Oct 07, 2016, 11:39 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Oct. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] and Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at $11.7 billion at list prices, validating the value, reliability and performance of Boeing's twin-aisle airplanes. The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices. Today's announcement builds on Qatar Airways' current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatar Airways increases its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was attended by the State of Qatar's Minister of Finance, His Excellency Ali Shareef Al Emadi, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar, His Excellency Mohammed Jaham Al-Kuwari. "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead," said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker. "Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service."  Qatar Airways' relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership. The airline was the first to operate the 787 in the Middle East and is a launch customer for the 777X. With the commitment for the 737 MAX 8, it would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways' fleet in more than 15 years. "Congratulations to The Boeing Company and Qatar Airways on the remarkable milestone they've reached, which will significantly grow the number of Boeing aircraft in the Qatar Airways fleet," said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. "Beyond its importance for these two companies, this agreement demonstrates the importance of global commercial partnerships in strengthening our bilateral ties. This deal will strengthen economic opportunity and job creation, and highlights the importance of strong global trading relationships." "We are so very proud that a discerning and market-leading customer like Qatar Airways not only continues to endorse our current products, but  also has confidence in Boeing's new technology that will soon be evident on the 777X and 737 MAX," said  Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes." The 777-300ER is the most reliable twin-aisle airplane flying today and is considered to be the flagship of the world's elite airlines. It has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 percent – the airplane is on time, nearly all the time. The 787-9 Dreamliner is the second member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 family. The 787-9, a stretch of the 787-8, can fly 290 passengers 7,635 nautical miles (14,140 km) in addition to more cargo, allowing airlines the ability to grow routes first opened by the 787-8. Boeing's newest family of single-aisle airplanes – 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9 and 737 MAX 200 – builds on the Next-Generation 737's popularity and reliability while delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017.

REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschMore By Alwyn Scott and Mike Stone NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gulf carrier Qatar Airways ordered 40 Boeing Co <BA.N> widebody jets valued at $11.7 billion and signed a letter of intent for up to 60 narrowbody 737 MAX 8 jets worth $6.9 billion, Boeing and the airline said on Friday. The agreement for up to 100 jetliners potentially worth $18.6 billion helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus <AIR.PA>. The deal marked a key commitment by Qatar Airways to Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner, after it refused to accept three of Airbus' competing A320 aircraft earlier this year. Qatar has not ordered 737s previously. Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing's product line. Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers. "I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities," Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane. "Now it's a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together," he said. "I can't give you a real time frame on that, but we're certainly working the heck out of it right now." BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Qatar Airways' order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp <FDX.N> and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.

Uresh Sheth, an investment banker who tracks Dreamliner production on his All Things 787 website, said the Airbus planes in Qatar’s fleet have had performance and reliability issues . “I have to wonder if Qatar’s order for the remaining A350s is in jeopardy given the large order with Boeing,” Sheth said. The 787-9 and 777-300ER orders are among the airline’s largest fleet announcements and are valued at $11.7 billion at list prices, although airlines typically negotiate discounts. In addition to those orders, Qatar Airways signed a letter of intent to buy up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices. It would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways’ fleet in more than 15 years. “By far the biggest impact of this new order is the commitment for 60 Boeing 737 MAX 8s,” Ahmad said. “This is a direct rival to the (Airbus) A320neo, the same jet which the airline has thus far refused to take delivery of due to concerns about the GTF engines,” which have had performance problems in hot weather. “This is a massive, massive disaster for Airbus no matter which way you cut it,” Ahmad said. Friday’s announcement builds on Qatar Airways’ current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With the new order, the carrier increases its order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. “Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead,” Akbar Al Baker, Qatar Airways’ CEO, said in a statement. “Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today’s announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service.” Boeing’s “partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes,” Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement. The 787-9 Dreamliner — which is built at Boeing’s North Charleston campus and in Everett, Wash. — is the second member of the 787 family. It is a stretch of the 787-8 and can fly 290 passengers a maximum 7,635 nautical miles. The 777-300ER has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 percent.

The WTO found that it was not. A corrected version of the story is below: The Obama administration on Thursday claimed a victory in its long-running trade dispute with the European Union over whether the 28-country bloc is illegally helping airplane manufacturer Airbus. In June 2011, the World Trade Organization found that the EU and four of its member countries provided billions of dollars in subsidized financing to Airbus. While the EU subsequently claimed to have come into compliance, the United States disagreed and requested that a compliance panel intervene. The WTO panel on Thursday ruled mostly in favour of the U.S. The international body, which helps solve trade disputes, found the EU had provided billions of dollars more in subsidies, causing lost sales worth tens of billions of dollars for Airbus’ archrival Boeing Co. Boeing praised the overall ruling, which the EU can appeal, saying the “day of reckoning” has finally arrived. It went so far to say that Airbus might not even exist today if not for continued support of European governments. “Today’s historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. “This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for U.S. aerospace workers, in particular.” United States Trade Representative Michael Froman says the finding is “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.” He called on the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain to “respect the WTO rules” and “end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately. This decision is independent of the EU’s case against the United States, in which the WTO is considering whether Boeing received banned federal and state support in the U.S. “Watch this space,” Airbus said in a statement in reaction to Thursday’s ruling. “Before year-end the record subsidies for the 777X will almost certainly be condemned as illegal,” it said, referring to a new Boeing airliner. The Boeing Company is the only American producer of large civil aircraft and is the largest single U.S. exporter. Boeing has major facilities around the country, including in Washington and South Carolina. Members of the Washington congressional delegation joined the administration in hailing the ruling, which has the potential to result in tariffs that would likely cost Airbus market share. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., called on the EU to come to the negotiating table and settle, rather than wait for future tariffs on Airbus planes. “Without having to compete against illegal, market-distorting practices, Boeing should win more sales around the world,” Cantwell said. ___ Scott Mayerowitz in New York, Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Politics 'We're called redneck, ignorant, racist. That's not true': Trump supporters explain why they voted for him BUSINESS To keep drones out of high-risk areas, companies try hijacking them and shooting them down Aerospace Corp.

During a counterdrone test, Randy Villahermosa, left, and Esteban Valles show how Aerospace Corp. uses its sophisticated technology to locate a drone controller. (The Aerospace Corporation) Samantha Masunaga A public awareness campaign last year did little to deter the growing number of rogue drones flying near wildfires and forcing firefighters to ground their own aircraft. So this year, the Department of the Interior tried something a little more direct. The agency gave real-time access to data on all active wildfires to two airspace mapping companies as part of a pilot program. One of those firms, Santa Monica-based AirMap, worked with drone manufacturer DJI, which created “geofences” around wildfires. When drones hit the virtual boundary, the geofencing software overrides the flight controller and forces them to hover in place. Any drone deployed inside the barrier won’t be able to lift off. “We really want to have this new community of pilots be as responsible as the manned aircraft pilots that came before them,” said Mark Bathrick, director of the office of aviation services at the Department of the Interior. As private drone use has soared, so has concern about keeping the remote-controlled aircraft away from sensitive and high-risk areas such as airports, nuclear power plants and prisons. Those concerns are heightened by high-profile incidents such as the near collision in March of a drone and a Lufthansa jet approaching Los Angeles International Airport. In 2013 a drone crash landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a campaign event, and a quadcopter crashed on the White House lawn in 2015. Defense giants Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., as well as a handful of start-ups, have jumped into the fray, developing technology ranging from detection systems to more disruptive solutions such as software that forces unauthorized drones to go home or land safely and laser cannons that shoot unwanted drones out of the sky. The technology is of interest to commercial users as well as the government. The Department of Defense hosts an annual counterdrone demonstration called Black Dart in which the military, its allies and industry partners can assess current technology and techniques. Earlier this year, the Federal Aviation Administration tested FBI drone-detection technology at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey for a few weeks. Last year, Boeing unveiled its compact laser weapons system, which ignites targeted drones. At a demonstration in California, Boeing said it took only about 15 seconds for its 2-kilowatt laser to disable the drone. Though the counterdrone industry is still nascent, the global market — including both civilian and military uses — could be worth at least several hundreds of millions of dollars, said Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan. “With all the talk of how many drones are going to be flying around and, at least on the commercial side, how much privacy is going to be an issue, I think these companies saw an opportunity,” he said. Much will depend on how well the technology works. It’s not easy to devise a system that tracks and identifies tiny drones, and stops unauthorized ones without knocking out everything — or creating a safety hazard. “This rapid proliferation of start-ups, of large companies all proposing systems that deal with the issue in different ways, suggests to me that there isn’t one single unifying solution for how to bring drones out of the sky,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “Every single step of the process is challenging.” That starts with identifying whether drones are friendly or rogue. Autonomous drone-detection systems need to be sophisticated enough to distinguish between slow-moving drones and birds, or even the signals emitted from drones compared with those emitted by cellphones. Detection systems will likely need to integrate a number of sensors such as acoustics, cameras, radio frequency or even radar to create “multilayer capability,” Blades said. Other companies and organizations are looking into the interdiction, or disruptive, aspect of how to safely deal with a drone threat once it is identified. At Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, researchers are investigating how to isolate the link between a specific drone and its controller that could lead to a safe takeover — rather than blindly “jamming,” or interrupting, all of the authorized frequencies in that range to cause confusion and force a potentially unpredictable landing. It is illegal for nongovernment entities to operate these kinds of jammers. That sounds easier than it is. Drones change their frequency band tens of times a second to ensure an uninterrupted communications link, said Randy Villahermosa, principal director of research and program development at Aerospace Corp. But by using software-defined radios and integrating the team’s coding knowledge, the researchers have been able to successfully take over a drone’s controls in several tests, said Esteban Valles, associate director of digital communication in the implementation department at Aerospace Corp. The researchers have also worked on pinpointing the position of a rogue drone’s controller, allowing law enforcement to find the pilot. There have been more than 300 so-called drone incidents in California between April 2014 and Jan. 31, 2016, according to an analysis of FAA data by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office. More than half of these incidents involved a drone that flew within five miles of an airport. In one case from early January, a Cessna agricultural aircraft reported that it possibly hit a drone about 1,400 feet in the air near Modesto, according to the analysis. No damage was reported to the aircraft. Aerospace Corp. does not sell its products commercially but is trying to better understand how drone communications work so it can advise customers on their own technology solutions, Villahermosa said. Drone maker DJI introduced its GPS-based geofence system about three years ago. It prevents “inadvertent” drone operations in sensitive areas, such as airports or in Washington, D.C. Since drones rely on their GPS receivers to determine where they are, DJI preprograms certain locations into the geofencing system. If a drone gets close to one of these locations, operators first receive a warning, said Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs at DJI. If they continue to fly their drone, they will be stopped by the geofence. The distance around these sensitive locations can vary. A more recent version includes locations with a temporary flight restriction, such as sporting events. DJI, which analysts estimate sells up to 70% of all consumer and professional drones, has included the option of overriding the geofence for wildfires, allowing a “verified” user to input credit card information or a mobile phone number to give firefighting or other authorized personnel the ability to keep using drones for legitimate efforts. “It’s really a balance between safety and innovation,” Schulman said. “We don’t want to just shut down the technology in places it can be useful.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Watch: Interview with combatants outside of Mosul Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske interviews ISIS fighter and speaks with Iraqi military on the east side of Mosul.

The agreement for up to 100 jetliners potentially worth $18.6 billion helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal marked a key commitment by Qatar Airways to Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner, after it refused to accept three of Airbus' competing A320 aircraft earlier this year. Qatar has not ordered 737s previously. Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing's product line. Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers. "I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities," Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane. "Now it's a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together," he said. "I can't give you a real time frame on that, but we're certainly working the heck out of it right now." BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Qatar Airways' order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.

Space Exploration Technologies Corporation or better known as ‘SpaceX’, founded by Elon Musk seems to have an archrival who is bolstering claims to beat SpaceX in the big race to Mars. CEO of Boeing – the aforementioned archrival to SpaceX – Dennis Muilenburg casually remarked at ‘The Atlantic’s, What’s Next?’ conference, "I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket." What really reinforces the assertions made by Boeing is the fact that they already have rapport. For the sake of the argument, having built the boisterous ‘Saturn V rocket’, which was used to transport Apollo equipment and facilitate astronauts on their journeys to and fro from the moon; also the fact that Boeing also built the infamous Space Launch System (SLS) - which is said to be sending 20 metric tons to Mars in 2018 - surely is enough to prove Boeing’s mettle as far as probability for success is concerned. In the meantime, SpaceX has plans to debut its most potent rocket ‘Falcon Heavy’ early in 2017, despite the ensuing controversy surrounding their re-landing failures and recent launch pad explosion. Au contraire the ‘Falcon Heavy’ is said to be able to life about 13 metric tons of weight to Mars.

Like so many other things, the space race has moved into the private sector. Late last month, Elon Musk unveiled his plan to take humankind off this rock and colonize another one, with his sights set firmly on Mars. He intends to ferry up to one million people using something called the Interplanetary Transport System - essentially a ship capable of carrying up to 100 humans equipped with the largest rocket the world has ever seen. No electric powertrain here, then. Musk's vision expands over the next 50 to 100 years, which is something new for him. When talking about Tesla and the automotive industry, he says any strategy longer than five years feels like an eternity to him, but it would make sense for things to move slower in the world of interplanetary travel. However, Musk and his SpaceX won't be alone in their attempt to deliver the first human on Mars. Lockheed Martin and Boeing are also vying for a slice of the space travel pie, and they can't just sit back and watch Musk make bold claims about the future of SpaceX without some comments of their own. The first voice to respond was that of Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg who, without expanding the subject any further, told an audience gathered in Chicago for an innovation conference that he was convinced "the first person to step foot on Mars would arrive there riding a Boeing rocket.” (via Teslarati) Boeing and SpaceX are two very different companies, so the former's CEO doesn't really have the liberty to get into more detail. But while Musk's plans were farfetched and ambiguous, at least they were something. Boeing is making this claim without anything to back it up except the company's expertise and renown in the industry. Progress is best stimulated by competition, so the more companies get involved in the space race, the quicker we will begin to see results. At the moment, though, SpaceX is busy dealing with the aftermath of the Cape Canaveral explosion, while Boeing is focusing on other projects as well such as the hypersonic aircraft that should bring back passenger flights at speeds greater than that of sound. spacex Boeing space race rocket Mars Elon Musk   A Story about Expensive Car Warranties and Respect The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Automotive Antiquities: Five Of the Oldest Cars Still In Production On Electric Harleys and New Generations Six Tips To Check On Your List Before Considering An Engine Swap Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Politics 'We're called redneck, ignorant, racist. That's not true': Trump supporters explain why they voted for him BUSINESS To keep drones out of high-risk areas, companies try hijacking them and shooting them down Aerospace Corp.

During a counterdrone test, Randy Villahermosa, left, and Esteban Valles show how Aerospace Corp. uses its sophisticated technology to locate a drone controller. (The Aerospace Corporation) Samantha Masunaga A public awareness campaign last year did little to deter the growing number of rogue drones flying near wildfires and forcing firefighters to ground their own aircraft. So this year, the Department of the Interior tried something a little more direct. The agency gave real-time access to data on all active wildfires to two airspace mapping companies as part of a pilot program. One of those firms, Santa Monica-based AirMap, worked with drone manufacturer DJI, which created “geofences” around wildfires. When drones hit the virtual boundary, the geofencing software overrides the flight controller and forces them to hover in place. Any drone deployed inside the barrier won’t be able to lift off. “We really want to have this new community of pilots be as responsible as the manned aircraft pilots that came before them,” said Mark Bathrick, director of the office of aviation services at the Department of the Interior. As private drone use has soared, so has concern about keeping the remote-controlled aircraft away from sensitive and high-risk areas such as airports, nuclear power plants and prisons. Those concerns are heightened by high-profile incidents such as the near collision in March of a drone and a Lufthansa jet approaching Los Angeles International Airport. In 2013 a drone crash landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a campaign event, and a quadcopter crashed on the White House lawn in 2015. Defense giants Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., as well as a handful of start-ups, have jumped into the fray, developing technology ranging from detection systems to more disruptive solutions such as software that forces unauthorized drones to go home or land safely and laser cannons that shoot unwanted drones out of the sky. The technology is of interest to commercial users as well as the government. The Department of Defense hosts an annual counterdrone demonstration called Black Dart in which the military, its allies and industry partners can assess current technology and techniques. Earlier this year, the Federal Aviation Administration tested FBI drone-detection technology at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey for a few weeks. Last year, Boeing unveiled its compact laser weapons system, which ignites targeted drones. At a demonstration in California, Boeing said it took only about 15 seconds for its 2-kilowatt laser to disable the drone. Though the counterdrone industry is still nascent, the global market — including both civilian and military uses — could be worth at least several hundreds of millions of dollars, said Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan. “With all the talk of how many drones are going to be flying around and, at least on the commercial side, how much privacy is going to be an issue, I think these companies saw an opportunity,” he said. Much will depend on how well the technology works. It’s not easy to devise a system that tracks and identifies tiny drones, and stops unauthorized ones without knocking out everything — or creating a safety hazard. “This rapid proliferation of start-ups, of large companies all proposing systems that deal with the issue in different ways, suggests to me that there isn’t one single unifying solution for how to bring drones out of the sky,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “Every single step of the process is challenging.” That starts with identifying whether drones are friendly or rogue. Autonomous drone-detection systems need to be sophisticated enough to distinguish between slow-moving drones and birds, or even the signals emitted from drones compared with those emitted by cellphones. Detection systems will likely need to integrate a number of sensors such as acoustics, cameras, radio frequency or even radar to create “multilayer capability,” Blades said. Other companies and organizations are looking into the interdiction, or disruptive, aspect of how to safely deal with a drone threat once it is identified. At Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, researchers are investigating how to isolate the link between a specific drone and its controller that could lead to a safe takeover — rather than blindly “jamming,” or interrupting, all of the authorized frequencies in that range to cause confusion and force a potentially unpredictable landing. It is illegal for nongovernment entities to operate these kinds of jammers. That sounds easier than it is. Drones change their frequency band tens of times a second to ensure an uninterrupted communications link, said Randy Villahermosa, principal director of research and program development at Aerospace Corp. But by using software-defined radios and integrating the team’s coding knowledge, the researchers have been able to successfully take over a drone’s controls in several tests, said Esteban Valles, associate director of digital communication in the implementation department at Aerospace Corp. The researchers have also worked on pinpointing the position of a rogue drone’s controller, allowing law enforcement to find the pilot. There have been more than 300 so-called drone incidents in California between April 2014 and Jan. 31, 2016, according to an analysis of FAA data by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office. More than half of these incidents involved a drone that flew within five miles of an airport. In one case from early January, a Cessna agricultural aircraft reported that it possibly hit a drone about 1,400 feet in the air near Modesto, according to the analysis. No damage was reported to the aircraft. Aerospace Corp. does not sell its products commercially but is trying to better understand how drone communications work so it can advise customers on their own technology solutions, Villahermosa said. Drone maker DJI introduced its GPS-based geofence system about three years ago. It prevents “inadvertent” drone operations in sensitive areas, such as airports or in Washington, D.C. Since drones rely on their GPS receivers to determine where they are, DJI preprograms certain locations into the geofencing system. If a drone gets close to one of these locations, operators first receive a warning, said Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs at DJI. If they continue to fly their drone, they will be stopped by the geofence. The distance around these sensitive locations can vary. A more recent version includes locations with a temporary flight restriction, such as sporting events. DJI, which analysts estimate sells up to 70% of all consumer and professional drones, has included the option of overriding the geofence for wildfires, allowing a “verified” user to input credit card information or a mobile phone number to give firefighting or other authorized personnel the ability to keep using drones for legitimate efforts. “It’s really a balance between safety and innovation,” Schulman said. “We don’t want to just shut down the technology in places it can be useful.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Watch: Interview with combatants outside of Mosul Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske interviews ISIS fighter and speaks with Iraqi military on the east side of Mosul.

However, Musk is probably OK with that. Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing (one of SpaceX’s biggest competitors) casually loosed the remark during a session of The Atlantic’s “What’s Next?” conference. “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said during the recorded event. Boeing has good ground to stand on with its claim, not the least of which includes some moon dust. After all, it was the company that helped build the ultra-powerful Saturn V rocket, which blasted Apollo-era equipment and astronauts to the moon and back. NASA also contracted Boeing to build its similarly huge Space Launch System (SLS), which should eventually be capable of sending up to 20 metric tonnes — roughly five large, fully grown elephants’ worth of mass — to Mars after its scheduled debut in 2018. Meanwhile, SpaceX plans to debut its most powerful rocket yet, the Falcon Heavy, in early 2017, despite a recent launchpad explosion and ongoing investigation. That rocket should be able to lift about 13 metric tonnes to Mars. If the sweeping vision that Musk laid out last week during a keynote speech at the 67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, is to be believed, SpaceX could start sending uncrewed Dragon capsules to Mars as soon as 2018 and 2020, then later land the first people on the red planet in 2022. But Musk may not mind if Boeing uses SLS to beat SpaceX. “I really don’t have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets, except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multiplanetary,” Musk said during his talk. Further, when someone in the IAC conference’s audience asked the billionaire if would be the first person on Mars, Musk expressed some ambivalence. “I think it’s good for there to be multiple paths to Mars ... to have multiple irons in the fire,” he said. Musk went on: “I think it’s actually much better for the world if there are multiple companies or organisations building these interplanetary spacecraft. You know, the more the better. Anything, I think, that improves the probability of the future is good. And so multiple companies doing it, I think, would be great. So I wanted to come describe the architecture actually in the hopes that this would encourage companies and organisations around the world to perhaps do something like this.” Whether or not Boeing, SpaceX, or both companies reach Mars, however, NASA is perhaps best-poised to benefit. With multiple potential options to get to the red planet, the agency may be able to more rapidly advance the world’s understanding of that world. In a statement responding to news about Musk’s vision, the space agency wrote: “NASA applauds all those who want to take the next giant leap – and advance the journey to Mars. We are very pleased that the global community is working to meet the challenges of a sustainable human presence on Mars. This journey will require the best and the brightest minds from government and industry, and the fact that Mars is a major topic of discussion is very encouraging. “At NASA, we’ve worked hard over the past several years to develop a sustainable Mars exploration plan, and to build a coalition of international and private sector partners to support this vision. And we’ve made extraordinary progress implementing this plan, working with a number of international and private sector partners.” See Also: Idea that SpaceX's rocket was sabotaged is 'pretty much a joke,' says rival SpaceX and its biggest competitors are waging a space battle on Capitol Hill House Republicans don't want SpaceX investigating its own rocket failures Click here to visit Business Insider   Most Popular Viewed 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 Elon Musk’s surprise unveiling of Tesla’s ‘solar roof’ Shared 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 3 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 China’s giant FAST radio telescope to join hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence Commented 1 Five places hikers can get away from it all on Hong Kong Island’s wild side 2 Michelin releases new list of Hong Kong and Macau restaurants offering HK$300 meals 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 How San Francisco got its Chinese produce 5 Genetic damage from smoking measured for the first time Promotions Register your FREE copy of Home Essentials 2017 now!

Close share panel × Image copyright AFP US aircraft maker Boeing has announced a major deal to supply Qatar Airways with wide-body jetliners. The deal includes 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at $11.7bn (£9.4bn) at list prices, along with the option to buy 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9bn at list prices. It is the largest single order ever placed by the Gulf carrier. The deal gives Boeing a boost in a year when orders for widebody planes have slumped. Qatar has been frustrated over prolonged delivery problems from Boeing's European rival aircraft maker, Airbus. Media reports last week suggested the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7bn. Airplane makers typically give large discounts on the list price when carriers order in bulk. Analysis: Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The continuing fight between Qatar Airways and Airbus has turned nasty - with Boeing emerging as the big winner. The chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker, is a forthright individual. He has previously described his airline's relationship with Airbus as "strained" because of delivery delays and engine problems with the Airbus A320neos. Now Akbar Al Baker is sending Airbus a message, with a big order for its American rival. The mega deal is not just a financial winner for Boeing. It's also a huge boost for the US plane maker's single aisle 737 MAX aircraft. It is the US aerospace giant's newest plane and doesn't go into service until next year. And politics may also be at play. There was a suggestion that the Qatar government may have delayed the Boeing passenger jet order to put pressure on the US to approve a deal for Boeing fighter jets to the Middle Eastern country - a deal which the Americans now look set to approve.

Business Standard has learned that Indian embassies in Washington, Moscow and Stockholm wrote on Friday to fighter jet manufacturers in these countries to confirm whether they would partner an Indian company in building a medium, single-engine fighter, with significant transfer of technology to the Indian entity. The confidential document sent by the embassies is not technically a “Request for Information” (RFI), which is a precursor to a “Request for Proposals” (also known as a tender). However, it serves the same purpose, which is to determine which vendors are interested and what they are willing to offer. By specifying that the IAF requires a single-engine fighter, the latest letter differs from an earlier tender, issued in 2007, for 126 medium, multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA). The MMRCA tender, which had no such stipulation, saw six vendors fielding four twin-engine and two single-engine fighters. The twin-engine offerings included Dassault’s Rafale, Eurofighter GmbH’s Typhoon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and RAC MiG’s MiG-35. The single-engine fighters offered were Lockheed Martin’s F-16IN Super Viper and Saab’s Gripen D. The much-hyped MMRCA tender eventually collapsed, with the IAF last month buying a token 36 Rafale fighters. Now, the IAF has kicked off a more focused contest that will feature only single-engine fighters. Numerous airpower experts have pointed out that the IAF needs single-engine fighters to replace the single-engine MiG-21 and MiG-27 fighters that must be retired in the near future. The Rafale, a medium-heavy, twin-engine fighter, is too expensive for operational tasks that a single-engine fighter can easily manage. While Boeing, Eurofighter, RAC MiG, Sukhoi and Dassault would technically be able to respond to the latest RFI, none of them can offer a state-of-the-art, medium, single-engine fighter. Therefore, it seems likely that New Delhi would have to choose between Saab’s Gripen E and Lockheed Martin’s latest F-16 Block 70. As Business Standard reported earlier, both Saab and Lockheed Martin have kicked off high-stakes, high-voltage campaigns to meet the IAF’s needs. Both have already submitted what the IAF chief, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha described on Thursday as “unsolicited bids” for building their fighters in India. Saab has linked its offer with assistance to the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) development programme, which is being spearheaded by Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), a unit of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Saab has offered to help ADA in quickly developing the Tejas Mark IA, which the IAF chief said required four improvements — a better combat radar, more lethal weapons, dedicated electronic warfare capability and better maintainability. He said the upgraded Tejas should fly within three-four years. Saab has also offered to help ADA develop the planned next-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is pushing an offer, made through the Indo-US Defence Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI), to shift its F-16 production line from Fort Worth, Texas to India. A new, more advanced version of the F-16, designated the Block 70, has been offered to entice India. Air Headquarters insiders say there is little chance of India buying the F-16, a significantly advanced version of the Block 50/52 that the Pakistan Air Force operates. Since Washington is aware of this important bias, it remains to be seen whether the US seizes this opportunity to offer India the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a state-of-the-art fifth-generation fighter. The IAF is keeping an open mind. On Thursday, Raha stated: “I’m sure whoever gives the best deal [will win]. All the aircraft are very capable, so it will depend upon who provides the best transfer of technology; and, of course, the price tag. It’s on the table; nothing is decided as yet.” SKY WARS Indian Air Force (IAF) invites international players to make medium, multi-role, single-engine fighter jets in India   IAF also wants significant transfer of technology to the Indian entity   India needs single-engine fighters to replace the single-engine MiG-21 and MiG-27   Boeing, Eurofighter, RAC MiG, Sukhoi and Dassault may respond but none of them can offer a state-of-the-art, medium, single-engine fighter   Contest likely between Saab’s Gripen E and Lockheed Martin’s latest F-16 Block 70 Last month, IAF bought 36 medium-heavy, twin-engine Rafale fighters Ajai Shukla Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Bengaluru citizens against tech hub's 6.2-km steel flyover project Business Standard IAF kicks off contest to make single-engine fighters Competition likely between American F-16 Block 70 and Swedish Gripen E Ajai Shukla  |  New Delhi  October 8, 2016 Last Updated at 22:50 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

Since the Gwadar international airport is an important segment of the multi billion dollar game changer China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project, therefore early implementation of this project is vital to accrue full benefit from the corridor project. To make the Gwadar port fully operational and hub of regional trade, it is important that the port city’s air, rail and road links are developed in a satisfactory manner as per the international standards. According to the Chinese and our government officials, the Gwadar port will be made fully operational by the end of this year, therefore, it has become all the more necessary that Gwadar airport project, which is being dubbed as the country’s biggest and most modern landing field be implemented at the earliest in order to facilitate the visiting businessmen who are showing great interest for investment in the Gwadar special economic zone. The airport project will indeed serve as a catalyst for enhancing investment and development in Gwadar and catering to the requirements of a bustling industrial commercial city. We have no doubt in mind that the facility, because of its geo strategic location, will serve as a major hub for international flights operating in the region. Additionally, emphasis should also be laid on the skill development of the local population so that they could get jobs and fully exploit the economic activities to be generated by the execution of mega projects under the CPEC. While we appreciate the government for planning to establish Gwadar University for the promotion of higher education in the so far neglected area, it is also heartening to note that Chinese government has also given a grant of ten million dollars for building the Pakistan-China Vocational and Technical Institute. We expect that the government will not waste any time in the implementation of this important project, as it will make the local youth ready to take up technical jobs at the port and make it a success story.

By Jon C. Ogg October 6, 2016 6:09 pm EST Print Email Tweet Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) is one of the largest conglomerates out there, but it is often overlooked as a broad economic indicator like some of the companies. Maybe its $88 billion market cap just isn’t big enough these days in the world where companies need to have $100 billion market capitalization rates to be megacaps. 24/7 Wall St. cannot help but wonder if Honeywell may have just inadvertently wrecked the story for many industrial and conglomerate outfits after lowering guidance. The good news here is that Honeywell’s guidance looks limited to Honeywell, but we took a look at General Electric, Boeing and United Tech just to be sure. Honeywell has now lowered 2016 sales and earnings forecast for 2016, in part due to the aerospace and Space & Defense divisions seeing lower shipments. The separation of automation and control solutions into two new segments and the overall impact of acquisitions and divestitures was also cited — the acquisition of Intelligrated, sale of the Honeywell Technology Solutions, and the spin-off of Resins and Chemicals as AdvanSix. Earnings per share (EPS) for 2016 was lowered to a range of $6.60 to $6.64 (a gain of 8% to 9%) versus a prior range of $6.60 to $6.70. That doesn’t look too bad, but what hurts here is that Honeywell now sees its organic revenues dropping from 1% to 2% in 2016. Its prior estimate was a 1% drop. Investors might feel as though they were caught off guard here. It was a month ago when the AdvanSix spin-off was set. Things seemed normal then. After closing up 0.3% at $115.61 on Thursday, Honeywell shares were last seen trading down 3.9% at $111.05 — but only 30,000 shares or so had traded at 5:50 p.m. Eastern time. On October 4, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) announced that its 2016 gross orders were now 460, showing a change of −80 units, for some 380 net orders. Boeing has exposure for both defense and aerospace. Its shares closed down 0.18% at $134.42, but they were not seen moving in the after-hours. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) closed down almost 0.8% at $29.27 on Thursday, after an analyst lowered its price target by $1.00. Its after-hours range was not lower either, with a 52-week range of $27.10 to $33.00. GE has exposure to aerospace and as a conglomerate. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX), which was not that long ago considered a Honeywell merger partner, closed down 0.17% at $102.08. Its market cap is $85 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $83.39 to $109.83. Earlier Thursday, UTX said that it was reducing its pension obligations, but it will take a charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million. If you saw the headlines on Honeywell, then you might be more worried. After looking at the fallout and looking at the statements, the spillover and fallout doesn’t look too extreme. Stay tuned as Friday’s unemployment and payrolls report could skew how this guidance fallout impacts other companies. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Ted S. Warren / AP Photo Qatar Airways has placed a sizable order with Boeing. The airline ordered a total of 40 jets, comprised of 30 787-9 Dreamliners, and 10 777-300ER aircraft. Both of those planes are made in the Puget Sound area. The list price for all 40 planes is nearly $12 billion, but large orders typically include discounts. Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia says Qatar’s order with Boeing is less about the aircraft and more about customer service. “It’s hard to see this as a major announcement by a company that really loves these products. It’s easier to see it as an airline that’s rather annoyed at Airbus because of production delays … so they’re showing their displeasure by diverting a few of those orders to Boeing instead,” said Aboulafia. In the case of the 777, he says Qatar Airways is giving Boeing a slight boost in an otherwise dismal sales year. Qatar also announced tentative plans to order up to 60 of Boeing’s 737-MAX 8 jets. The list price for that sale is around $7 billion.

The brokerage cut its non-GAAP third quarter/2016 EPS view to $(0.19)/$(0.81) from $(0.01)/$(0.69) to reflect a lower cost reduction benefit than earlier expected. The brokerage's $(5.01) GAAP EPS estimate for the third quarter includes a $334 million ($4.83) charge for idling the Rowley facility and a $1.71 tax valuation allowance. "While we expect a disappointing 3Q16 print and for the stock to initially come under some pressure, we think improving end market commentary and the 2017 outlook will likely drive the stock higher," analyst Richard Safran wrote in a note. Related Link: Boeing And Qatar Confirm Earlier Report Of $11.7 Billion Plane Order Safran believes a lot of negative sentiment is already in the stock, as investors would mainly focus on the following: Commentary about 2017 EPS. FCF commentary. HRPF. Aerospace OE production ramp. End of cycle concerns. Demand for commodity metals. Rating, Valuation And Justification The analyst, who reiterated his Buy rating and $21 target price, expects 2017 EPS of $1.15 that is well above $0.77 consensus. "While we think ATI will express concerns about Flat Rolled growth in 2017 (we expect 1 percent y/y), we also think ATI will cite higher commercial aircraft build rates and a better mix driving High Performance growth (we expect 9 percent y/y)," Safran higlighted. Meanwhile, near-term concerns center on expectations that Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) will lower B777 production rates. But, Safran noted that ATI has very little content on the B777 or the GE 90 engine. The price target of $21 implies 18x Safran's 2017 estimated EPS of $1.15 and 8x his 2017 estimated EBITDA of $458 million. ATI currently trades at 16x his 2017 estimated EPS of $1.15, below peers at 17.5x. At time of writing, shares of Allegheny fell 2.87 percent to $17.63. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

The Doha-based carrier made good on a threat to buy Boeing's 737 Max after rejecting initial A320neo deliveries from Airbus Group SE because of engine issues. Qatar Airways is also taking 777 and 787 Dreamliner aircraft in an order flurry that could add 100 Boeing planes to its fleet, Akbar Al Baker, the airline's chief executive officer, and Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said Friday in Washington. The deal is a vote of confidence in Boeing's revamped 737 Max, which was announced after Airbus unveiled its upgraded A320neo family and has struggled to close the sales gap. Qatar Airways pledged to buy as many as 60 Max 8 models, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices, marking the carrier's first narrow-body order from Boeing since 1979. The order is a boost to Chicago-based Boeing, which, like Airbus, has been contending with sales slowed by economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia and a commodities downturn in Russia and Brazil. Meanwhile, relatively low fuel prices have damped demand for new, fuel-efficient wide-body jets such as the 777 and 787 and contributed to a glut of second-hand models. Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.39 at 12:29 p.m. in New York, paring a drop of as much as 1.4 percent. Airbus declined 1.1 percent to 53.83 euros at the close in Paris. Airbus Doubts Qatar Airways intends to follow through on a 2011 order for 50 Airbus A320neo and A321neo planes, which have a combined value of $6.4 billion at list prices, Al Baker said. But he also took a swipe over issues with the aircraft's geared turbofan engine, which is made by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit, saying the delays left him with “no alternative” but to order the “reliable” Boeing narrow-body planes. “We never renege on contracts that we sign,” Al Baker said. “The aircraft that we are ordering today will serve this ever-expanding network.” Qatar is also ordering 30 of Boeing's 787-9 model and 10 777-300ER jets, valued at a combined $11.7 billion at list prices before discounts that are customary for large aircraft purchases It is Boeing's largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into plans for the 777, the planemaker's largest twin-engine aircraft, as well as for the Dreamliner, the company's marquee carbon-fiber jet. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said last month that current sales campaigns could determine whether Boeing boosts Dreamliner output -- and whether a dearth of orders will force it again to slow assembly of current-generation 777 models before an upgraded version debuts in 2020. Delivery Delays Al Baker has signaled his growing frustration with Airbus in recent months, threatening to switch a Qatar Airways order for planes in the A320neo family to Boeing 737 Max jets. He has declined to take delivery of the first Airbus narrow-bodies because of an engine cooling issue. Airbus has also drawn Al Baker's ire for its struggles to meet delivery deadlines of the A350, the European company's most advanced jetliner, which competes with the 777 and 787 Dreamliner. The state-owned airline was the first buyer of the new Airbus wide-body. Boeing's deal with Qatar Airways was forged after the U.S. approved sales by Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. to Persian Gulf allies, including as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar. The fighter-jet sale is subject to approval by the U.S. Congress. Boeing Co. Manufacturing Airlines Today's Crain's Get our daily roundup of important business news.

Boeing/Gail Hanusa Courtesy photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Qatar Airways placed a multibillion-dollar widebody jet order with Boeing that will benefit Spirit AeroSystems and could stave off further production rate cuts on the 777, at least temporarily. Qatar’s firm order is for 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs – a deal valued at $11.7 billion at list prices, though the airline likely will receive a sizable discount. It also signed a letter of intent for as many as 60 737 Max 8s, a deal that carries a value of $6.9 billion at list prices. Qatar has a fleet of 84 Boeing 787s and 777s that have been delivered in the past nine years. The deal is significant for not just Boeing, but also Wichita-based Spirit AeroSystems. Spirit manufactures 70 percent of the 737, both the current Next Generation and the new Max. It also manufactures the forward fuselages and struts of the 787 and 777, and the nacelles of the 777. Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner said at a news conference Friday that the Qatar order could help what has been a dearth of orders for the 777, Boeing’s second-biggest jetliner. Boeing has seen slowing demand for the 777 and plans to reduce production of the airplane from a rate of 8.3 a month to seven a month starting in 2017. In the past year, analysts have become increasingly concerned that Boeing will have to further reduce 777 production because of order sluggishness and as it begins its transition to production of the new 777X. Boeing expects to deliver the first 777X in 2020. “We’ll just have to wait and see how the rest of our order stream plays out, but I can tell you that 10 777s is a big deal,” Conner said at the news conference held in Washington, D.C. “Where these airplanes fall within our delivery stream is extremely important to us in terms of how we maintain or what we do with our production rates. So I would say this order is very important from that standpoint.” Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said the gap between what’s on the order books for the 777 and the 777X is large enough that the Qatar order probably won’t be enough to prevent an additional rate cut. “It puts off the next rate cut, but the next rate cut is still inevitable,” Aboulafia said. “They need a couple hundred airplanes to bridge that gap.” He estimates the Qatar 777 order pushes back a second, 777 rate cut “by a few months, maybe.” Spirit president and CEO Tom Gentile said at a Morgan Stanley investor conference last month in California that the company was paying close attention to Boeing’s 777 rate plans. He said next year’s rate reduction would be a “proportional” reduction in Spirit revenue and profit. A second 777 rate cut could be partially offset by the planned increase in 737 production next year — from 42 a month to 47 — Gentile said, but it would likely prompt Spirit to “accelerate some of our cost reduction initiatives,” including ways to streamline the company’s overhead and infrastructure.

Photographer: Mike Kane/Bloomberg Persian Gulf carrier to order as many as 100 new aircraft Letter of intent signed for 60 737 Max valued at $6.9 billion Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Boeing Co. landed an $18.6 billion deal with Qatar Airways for as many as 100 aircraft, providing a sales boost to the U.S. company’s upgraded 737 jetliner with one of the year’s largest commercial airplane deals. The Doha-based carrier pledged to buy as many as 60 of the 737 Max 8 jet, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices, marking its first narrow-body order with Boeing since 1979. Qatar Airways also ordered 40 total 777 and 787 Dreamliner twin-aisle aircraft, Akbar Al Baker, the airline’s chief executive officer, and Boeing commercial airplane CEO Ray Conner said Friday in Washington. With the commitment, Al Baker made good on earlier threats to buy Boeing’s 737 Max after rejecting initial A320neo deliveries from Airbus Group SE because of engine issues. The transaction also provided a vote of confidence in the Boeing jet, which is on pace to begin commercial service months ahead of schedule in the second quarter next year. Qatar Airways will take its first Max in 2018, Al Baker said in an interview. He insisted the decision to pivot to the rival Boeing model wasn’t intended as retaliation against the European planemaker. “There is no message to Airbus,” he said. “We don’t send messages by aircraft purchases to each other.” Boeing Boost Boeing pared a drop of as much as 1.4 percent before the Qatar Airways announcement to trade 0.2 percent lower at $134.07 at 2:52 p.m. in New York. Airbus fell as much as 2.1 percent as news of the order broke, then declined 1.1 percent to 53.83 euros at the close in Paris. The order gives a boost to Chicago-based Boeing, which, like Airbus, has been contending with sales slowed by economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia and a commodities downturn in Russia and Brazil. Meanwhile, relatively low fuel prices have damped demand for new, fuel-efficient wide-body jets such as the 777 and 787 and contributed to a glut of second-hand models. Qatar Airways still intends to follow through on a 2011 order for 50 Airbus A320neo and A321neo planes, which have a combined value of $6.4 billion at list prices, Al Baker said. But he also took a swipe over issues with the aircraft’s geared turbofan engine, which is made by United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney unit, saying the delays left him with “no alternative” but to order the “reliable” Boeing narrow-body planes. ‘Expanding Network’ “We never renege on contracts that we sign,” Al Baker said. “The aircraft that we are ordering today will serve this ever-expanding network.” Qatar is also ordering 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 model and 10 777-300ER jets, valued at a combined $11.7 billion at list prices before discounts that are customary for large aircraft purchases. It is Boeing’s largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into plans for the 777, the planemaker’s largest twin-engine aircraft, as well as for the Dreamliner, the company’s marquee carbon-fiber jet. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said last month that current sales campaigns could determine whether Boeing boosts Dreamliner output -- and whether a dearth of orders will force it again to slow assembly of current-generation 777 models before an upgraded version debuts in 2020. Delivery Delays Al Baker had signaled his growing frustration with Airbus in recent months, declining to take delivery of the first Airbus narrow-bodies because of an engine cooling issue. He was also critical of delays to the A350, Airbus’s most advanced jetliner, which competes with the 777 and 787 Dreamliner. The state-owned airline was the first buyer of the new Airbus wide-body. Qatar Airways has only received three of the 10 A350 aircraft that are slated to be delivered in 2016, Al Baker said, adding that he doesn’t know if the remaining seven will be ready this year. Boeing’s deal with Qatar Airways was forged after the U.S. approved sales by Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. to Persian Gulf allies, including as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar. The fighter-jet sale is subject to approval by the U.S. Congress. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Home News Science, Space & Robotics Boeing wants to beat Elon Musk and SpaceX to Mars The CEO of The Boeing Company is convinced that the first humans to set foot on Mars will get there by a Boeing rocket By: Lana Jelic | Science, Space & Robotics News | Posted: Oct 7, 2016 1:31 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Elon Musk has a plan to colonize Mars, but he isn't the only one who wants to get to the Red Planet. Speaking at a conference in Chicago, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of The Boeing Company, stated that he is convinced that the first humans to set foot on Mars will get there by a Boeing rocket.     The Boeing Company is involved in space exploration practically since the founding of NASA. They built the first stage of the Saturn V rocket, the three-stage liquid-fueled launch vehicle developed to support the Apollo program for human exploration of the Moon, and was later used to launch Skylab, the first American space station. Boeing also participated with other projects in the space program, and was the first contractor for the International Space Station program.   NASA has awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station, and seems like their rivalry will continue since Boeing, like SpaceX, is also working on the design and development of a new rocket that should bring the first people to Mars.   Muilenburg also expressed doubts about Musk's optimistic plan to send first humans to Mars in 2024. NASA mentioned in their plans that the first humans could get to Mars a decade later than Musk's estimation. Musk's end goal is to send up to one million people to the Red Planet in 10,000 person flights at a time, something he believes is achievable in less than 100 years.

The move comes after Christian Estrosi broke off negotiations with TER complaining 40 trains simply do run every single day not to mention the 86 days of strike so far this year. M Estrosi said he would not tolerate that situation continuing and that the region will begin to look for alternative train service options. TER has now deployed new drivers and and say they are willing to re-open negotiations. Smoking - A strike by doctors for October 12th has been called off after successful negotiations at the Ministry of Health which include incentives for new doctors to practice at public hospitals and areas in need of young doctors such as Fréjus and Saint-Raphael who reported a drop in local healthcare this week. The Ministry of Health has also revealed figures which show France has one of the highest smoking rates in the OECD, with 28% of people smoking regularly, and 20% of pregnant women regular smokers also. The Ministry hope to cut smoking rates with a new campaign encouraging people to give up for the month of November.  The campaign is called “Moi sans Tabac”. Ferrari - The driver of a Ferrari which seriously injured a Russian man on the eve of the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Monaco has been given 15 months in jail, had his car confiscated and ordered to pay €1m to the victim. The incident happened in May when the Finnish driver, was drinking with friends in Larvotto when seven of them piled into the open top Ferrari to drive to Jimmyz nightclub. As the driver accelerated, the Russian fell out of the car, seriously injuring himself. The driver was arrested on site for drunk and dangerous driving and has been in custody ever since. Nice - The new prison promised for Nice by Prime Minister Valls yesterday, will not be built in Saint-Laurent-du-Var according to the Mayor of the area. Speaking at a lively council meeting last night Joseph Segura said; Christian Estrosi wants his prison. He can have it in Nice. We don’t want it. Meanwhile the city of Nice has announced plans to improve  security on the Promenade des Anglais with new retractable bollards to be put in place by next summer, along with other devices which will provide optimal security along the strip. More than two months after the Nice Attack investigators are discovering more about the personality of the killer, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel. While his entourage had told police he had radicalized very quickly, the investigators have found that the Nice killer actually frequented Islamist circles for at least a year. According to reports nearly a year before the attack in Nice Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel was controlled at the Italian border in Ventimiglia. Three other men were also travelling in the vehicle, one of which was linked to the jihadist networks leaving for Syria. One of the alleged accomplices of Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel has told investigators that he often went to Italy with individuals radicalized to bring food to migrants. Missing Person - Twenty four year old Valentine Breton, who was reported missing last week has been found safe and well. Mr Breton had been missing since last Friday and police had launched an investigation.He reportedly made contact by phone on Thursday much to the relief of his friends and relatives. Promenade des Anglais - Following the Nice attack, the city has announced plans to improve  security on the Promenade des Anglais. By the summer of 2017 retractable bollards will be put in place along with other devices which will provide optimal security along the coastal strip. Monaco in Russia - Prince Albert of Monaco has held talks with President Vladimir Putin. The Russian president met with his serene highness on Thursday morning at the Kremlin as part of the Monaco in Russia week. Elections - The candidate for the Republican’s primary elections Alain Juppé has chosen to hold his local meeting in Toulon rather than Marseille. Initially the meeting, which is to take place on the 27th October, had been planned in Marseille the capital of the Provence Alpes Cote d’Azur region. Juppé however reportedly changed the location after hearing that the former head of state Nicolas Sarkozy had decided to hold a meeting in Marseille on the same day. The mayor of Bordeaux is still ahead in the polls. PTA - Today 15 million French people will vote in schools across France for  Parent teaching associations. Last year a reported 50% of parents voted. Voting will take place today and tomorrow either on the school premises or by post.   National Vladimir Putin - Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold talks with his French counterpart François Hollande during a visit to France on 19th October . The two leaders “will discuss international issues including Syria and Ukraine. Putin's visit to France – his first to the country since he attended a climate summit in Paris late last year – has been in the planning for months. The trip comes amid a spike in tensions with the West over Moscow's bombing campaign in war-torn Syria. Love letters - A collection of love letters from former French president François Mitterrand to his longtime mistress, Anne Pingeot, are to be published next week. Lettres à Anne” (Letters to Anne), published by leading French publisher Gallimard, is a collection of more than 1,200 letters from Mitterrand that have been compiled and edited by Pingeot herself. She has, however, chosen not to include her replies. Business For the first time airlines have committed to a deal on greenhouse gas limits where, from 2020, any increase in CO2 emissions will be offset by activities like tree planting, which soak up CO2. Attempts have been made for almost 20 years to include aviation and shipping in climate agreements, but both sectors have managed to avoid firm targets. In other aviation news, it’s another bad day for Airbus as Boeing are about to announce a substantial deal with Qatar Airways for up to 35 widebody planes worth $18bn. Qatar are said to have run out of patience with Airbus over prolonged delivery delays. An error in automated trading is being blamed for a “flash crash” of Sterling on Asian markets this morning. At one stage the Pound fell 6% in just two minutes although it is returning to more normal levels this afternoon. Meanwhile French President Francois Hollande has said the EU must take a firm line with the UK as Theresa May told her party she wants Britain to trade freely with Europe but restrict movement at its borders. Mr Hollande said Britain wanted to leave the bloc without paying the consequences which he said was not possible. His comments are backed-up by German chancellor Angela Merkel. Shares in Twitter have continued to fall sharply on concerns about a lack of takeover interest. The company lost a fifth of its value in trading on Thursday following reports that Apple,Google and Walt Disney were all losing interest in taking it over. The cloud software firm salesforce.com is now thought to be the most likely suitor.

The weekend-Mainly fine with perhaps an occasional shower in the Alpes-Maritimes tomorrow evening.Highs of 23 degrees. And Finally With only 79 days to go before Christmas hopes of a few hours’ peace as the children put together Lego or play with model cars may be dashed as this year’s must-have toy looks like it may threaten to turn Christmas into a war zone. A new range of Star Wars-inspired toys include saucer-sized drones capable of flying at 50mph. The drones powered by four propellers are also armed with lasers and intended to allow users to group together to recreate the intergalactic battles seen in the Star Wars films. The drones are intended for outdoor use by over-14s with experience of flying drones. They are being launched in shops to coincide with the release of latest Star Wars film in December.     Advertisement Homepage Features News What's on guide Giveaways Videos Advertisers Contact Us Copyright - RIVIERA RADIO | Design & SEO by I2N

The Electronic Flying Control System gives it exceptional handling characteristics. It has a glass cockpit built around the principal of data fusion and a central computer intelligently prioritise info to display to the pilots simpler command and control. Considering that Rafale is a multirole aircraft, the pilot’s work load has been reduced considerably through most functional switches being located on the throttle and stick. The state of the art avionics consist of the RBEZ-AA AESA Radar. This is an electronically scanned phased array radar which is far superior to a mechanical scan radar. The aircraft carries a multitude of weaponry. The Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) has an effective range of approx 150 km. There is no comparable missile in its class. Scalp air-to-surface long-range general purpose stand-off cruise missile, which has a range of 300 km, is the most sophisticated available at this time. The deal includes a five-year Performance Based Logistics (PBL) plan which Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer, would ensure 75% serviceability. This also includes spares, components, rotables etc. Weapons are also included in the costing. The basic cost of each aircraft is approximately Rs 700 crore. However, it climbs to Rs 1,640 crore per aircraft if the PBL, weapons, training etc, are included. The cost increased due to certain India-specific requirements like helmet-mounted sight, radar warning receiver, low-band jammers etc. The Indian Air Force (IAF) went through a very rigid selection process based on specific Operational Requirements (ORs). Apart from Rafale, the other contenders were the Boeing F/A–18, Eurofighter, Lockheed Martin F-16, MiG-35 and Gripen. The process included technical evaluation and flight trials. The participant aircraft were flown in different parts of India through extreme hot and cold weather. Finally, Eurofighter and Rafale were shortlisted, and the “L1” – based on life cycle cost – prevailed. Around 50% of the cost would be ploughed back into India through the offset clause. Liability for the offset clause would be handled by Dassault, Thales, Airbus and other Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The principle manufacturer, Dassault Aviation, will have only 25% liability as per reports. Deliveries would begin after 36 months (2019) and will be completed after 67 months (2022). The IAF has projected a requirement of 44 fighter squadrons to face a two front threat. At present, the strength is down to 33 Squadrons. From 2016 to 2022, there will be a drawdown (reduction) of 11 squadrons of MiG-21s and MiG-27s. This would amount to a reduction of 220 aircraft. Without replacements, the IAF strength would deplete to 22 squadrons of fighter aircraft. Hence, the urgency to purchase Rafale. Albeit, the projected requirement was for 126 jets, the reduced number of 36 would still be a significant increase in capability. To make the required numbers, it is imperative that the Tejas (LCA MK1A) remains on schedule. Electronic warfare The programme is behind schedule and has already been pushed back to 2019. Issues pertaining to AESA radar and weapons are yet to be addressed. Interim discussion regarding Fifth Gen Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) with Russian collaboration is continuing. Increase in the numbers of SU-30 and Make in India programme for F-16, F-18 and Gripen are being considered. But the AESA radar combined with state of the art electronic warfare systems and avionics built around data fusion, gives Rafale a lethal capability. The combat potential ratio with our western neighbour, in terms of air assets, is 2:1 at this time. This would certainly increase substantially with Rafale. With our northern neighbour, it would give the IAF a discernible technological advantage. The IAF has different fighter aircraft in its inventory. The MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-27, MiG-29, Jaguar, Mirage 2000, SU-30MK1 and Tejas (LCA) are presently flying. Rafale would be the ninth variety. This is undoubtedly a nightmare for maintenance, logistics activity and operational planning, and training of both ground crew and aircrew also becomes difficult. Eight types of transporters and six different helicopters only add to the magnitude of the difficulty. In the 1950s and 1960s, the IAF consisted of Canberras, Hunters, Gnats and Avros from Britain. At that time, the inventory also had the French Mysteres and Toofani (Ouragan) Fighter. Strategic bilateral relations with the erstwhile Soviet Union was in the upswing during the 1960s and 1970s. At this time, the US had offered the F-86 (Sabre) and F-104 fighters to Pakistan. India sought Soviet support for defence equipment and the flow of MiG-21 series started, during the late 1960s. The MiG-21s were followed by MiG-23, MiG-25, MiG-27, MiG-29 and SU-30. Transporters and helicopters included IL-14, IL-76, AN-32, MI-4/8/17. These were provided at rock bottom prices and on favourable terms. In 1978 came the Anglo-British Jaguar, and in 1985 the French Mirage 2000. The assortment of different aircraft, radars, weaponry and communications systems were procured due to strategic compulsions and limited choices. The constraints of procurement from different international original equipment manufacturers were not dictated by the IAF’s requirements alone but also by the politico-strategic considerations. Needless to state that this mix of such platforms, from so many different sources, could well have been avoided, if our indigenous development had achieved the desired success. The IAF will have to face the challenge of multiple platforms in the medium term.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 8, 2016 at 10:13AM Textron's new V-247 Vigilant drone takes aim at NORTHROP GRUMMAN'S TERN contract. Image source: Textron. For four months we've known the results of the DARPA drone competition: AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) will not build the Navy's new "TERN" vertical-landing-and-take-off drone. Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) will -- and will potentially turn every U.S. warship into an aircraft carrier in the process. But now comes the second question: Yes, Northrop has won the rights to build TERN. But how long can they hold onto it? A competitor on Northrop Grumman's "six" Late last month, one company that wasn't even in the running to win DARPA's drone competition unveiled a new product that has the potential to upset the race, and displace Northrop's prototype. The company is Textron (NYSE:TXT), and its drone is the Bell V-247 Vigilant. Described as a "Group 5 UAS" (the military's largest) Textron's Vigilant is derived from the company's groundbreaking V-22 Osprey piloted aircraft, which Textron builds in conjunction with Boeing (NYSE:BA). The U.S. Marine Corps loves the tiltrotor Osprey, which combines aspects of helicopter and airplane design into a single platform, one Marine Corps Maj. Paul Greenberg says "far outstrips" competing platforms. According to Maj. Greenberg, Osprey can already "carry a significantly greater payload than the aircraft it is replacing, the CH-46, at twice the speed and range -- over 60% greater range than any other rotorcraft, and more with aerial refueling." And now, the Marines are looking to capitalize on those advantages in the form of an unmanned tiltrotor, Vigilant. What the V-247 Vigilant is Like Osprey, Textron says Vigilant "will combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft," providing "unmatched long-endurance persistent expeditionary and surveillance capability and lethal reach." (And that tells you Textron is designing Vigilant to serve as an offensive, weaponized drone.) Weighing eight tons empty, and able to carry up to 13,000 pounds of munitions and fuel, Vigilant will sport a 65-foot wing span and 30-foot rotor diameter, permitting it to land on warships the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and larger. Vigilant is being designed to carry MK-50 torpedoes for anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, as well as Hellfire and JAGM missiles. Vigilant will run on a single tiltrotor engine, be capable of flying at speeds up to 300 knots for as long as 11 hours at a time, and boasts a combat range of 450 nautical miles. The drone will also be capable of mid-air refueling to extend range and endurance. What it means for Textron investors -- and for Northrop Grumman Here's what we know about the potential market value of Textron's new drone offering: According to the latest numbers on the United States' Navy's "battle fleet," there are currently 178 aircraft carriers, other surface warships, and logistics and fleet support vessels with deck space equal to or larger than a destroyer, and thus theoretically capable of launching and landing a Group 5 drone of Vigilant's size. We don't know a specific price that Textron is quoting on Vigilant, but we can make a very rough guess. Based on wingspan, Vigilant appears to be about 50% larger than the TERN drone that Northrop is building for DARPA, and we estimate the price on that one to be about $18 million. Ballpark Textron's Vigilant at $27 million, therefore, and the total potential market size of putting one Vigilant drone on every naval vessel capable of carrying it, would appear to be similar to the size of the market opportunity TERN offers for Northrop Grumman: about $4.8 billion. It's not known if Textron will partner with Boeing to build Vigilant, as it did with the V-22 Osprey. But even if it must split the business with Boeing, Textron only does $13.8 billion in annual revenues. The multi-billion-dollar opportunity to build a new military drone for the Marines makes this a market well worth going after. At the same time, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Northrop Grumman only does about $23.6 billion in annual business. With nearly $5 billion in new revenues at stake, this is a contract that Northrop, too, would therefore very much like to keep to itself. It's a pity Textron doesn't seem to have any intention of permitting that.   Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Aiming to be the Canadian equivalent of Code.org, which featured famous supporters such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the project was launched by the team at Ladies Learning Code, with support from major Canadian tech figures like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke and venture capitalist Boris Wertz. Other big name partners putting weight behind the project are international corporations Microsoft, Google and Boeing, and coding education organizations hackerYou, Kidscode Jeunesse and CoderDojo. To fulfill its aim of reaching 10 million Canadians, Canada Learning Code states on its website that it will design and deliver programming, create strategic industry and public partnerships, train educators, complete research and advocate for the cause. One key element of the project will be unifying the various initiatives that have cropped across Canada. “There are a lot of people trying to tackle coding … [but] no cohesion” said Ladies Learning Code CEO Melissa Sarriffodeen in an interview with The Globe and Mail. The organization is now applying for charitable status, and hoping to raise $50 million CAD to complete its goals. Currently, it has raised one-quarter of its $2 million goal for 2017.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 8, 2016 at 8:13AM DARPA wants to build A SPACE "PLANE." Vector Space volunteers to help it traverse the last mile into orbit. IMAGE SOURCE: DARPA. DARPA wants a new space shuttle. It's getting close to building one. And in fact, it just got a little bit closer. Last month, in a little-noticed press release, privately held Vector Space Systems confirmed that it has won $2.5 million worth of contracts from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Through these contracts, Vector -- which hasn't even begun operations yet, although it has begun collecting clients -- aims to play a major part in the designing of DARPA's XS-1 Experimental Spaceplane -- and potentially, in new NASA projects as well. As Vector explains, the contracts break down as follows: First, Vector will tweak its first-stage "Vector-R" rocket for use as a second-stage rocket on DARPA's spaceplane. Second, Vector will develop a smaller "advanced prototype" Vector-R upper stage -- this time for NASA. Success in both efforts should accelerate Vector's progress toward building "a fully functional two-stage flight test vehicle" for itself, as well as advancing DARPA's and NASA's respective objectives. Flight testing to prove is slated to begin late next year. Back up a second. Remind me: What is a "spaceplane"? NASA, as you'll recall, retired the space shuttle in 2011 -- partially because of concerns over the vessel's safety, but also over concerns for its cost. DARPA's XS-1 Spaceplane project aims to address both of these concerns by developing a new "drone" spacecraft that will fly to the verge of space under its own power and there launch a smaller onboard rocket to boost satellite payloads the last few miles into actual orbit. That accomplished, XS-1 will land back on Earth like an airplane (or space shuttle), refuel, reload, and be ready to launch a new payload within 24 hours. In fact, DARPA is targeting turnaround times and consistency of operation that would permit XS-1 to launch "10 times in 10 days." As an unmanned drone, XS-1 would allay concerns about the safety of live cargo. And with launches taking place daily, rather than just a few times a year, the cost of building XS-1 would be spread out among so many deliveries as to dramatically decrease the cost of space launch -- perhaps to as little as $5 million for a two-ton cargo. So far, three industry teams have been hired to work on prototyping a spaceplane for DARPA: Boeing (NYSE:BA), working in collaboration with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin; Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), working with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic; and privately held Masten Space Systems, working with also-private XCOR Aerospace. (XCOR, however, appears to be in the process of shuttering its Lynx spaceplane project, and may be on its way out.) And Vector-R? What's that? Vector describes its new Vector-R launch vehicle as "the world's only launch vehicle dedicated to servicing the micro satellite market by providing a dedicated 50kg launch mass to orbit." Comprising a "carbon fiber airframe, lightweight pressurized propulsion systems and an agile modern avionics system," Vector-R targets the fast-growing market for launching very small satellites, rapidly and at low cost -- and leaves Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, and SpaceX to duke it out over the market for launching larger satellites. In its final form as a "fully functional two-stage" rocket, Vector-R will be the vehicle Vector uses to launch microsatellites into space. In the meantime, in between time, Jim Cantrell, CEO of Vector Space, says Vector-R's first-stage engine will be designed "platform agnostic" for its role as the spaceplane's delivery rocket. That is to say, regardless of whether DARPA ultimately chooses a prototype spaceplane from the Boeing team, from Northrop, or from Masten, Vector's rocket will launch equally well from any of them. What does it mean for investors? Experts estimate that by 2020, companies could be launching as many as 500 such "microsatellites" annually. At launch prices ranging from $250,000 per launch (CubeCab) to $1.5 million (Vector) to $10 million (Virgin Galactic), that implies an annual market size of up to $5 billion -- a market in which Vector is targeting a 12% share. Vector clearly has its eye on becoming a key player in this emerging market. At the same time, through its contract with DARPA, it's demonstrating a willingness to cooperate with (and profit from) many of the larger companies working on DARPA's new spaceplane -- and through its contract with NASA, an interest in working for the government directly as well. When you get right down to it, it doesn't really matter where the money is coming from. As long as the checks clear, Vector will take it.

Kaiketsu / Wikimedia Commons / http://j.mp/1SPGCl0 Listen Listening... / 3:15 Daniel Howes, October 8, 2016 Bill Ford Jr.’s used to taking shots. He got whacked repeatedly for touting environmentalism in the global auto industry long before going green was cool. That prompted rivals, even his own employees, to wonder if the son of America’s preeminent industrial dynasty was becoming unmoored from the realities of the family business. He got criticized for his tenure as CEO. He and Ford Motor’s directors addressed that a decade ago by naming Alan Mulally as his replacement. The new guy from Boeing led a remarkable turnaround financed by private capital — not the taxpayer money of bailouts and bankruptcy. And Republican Donald Trump rarely misses an opportunity to trash Ford Motor’s decision to move small-car production to Mexico – no matter how many times Bill Ford tells him why the automaker’s doing it and how many jobs it supports in the United States. Now Ford’s executive chairman is taking a shot of his own on the emerging mobility space. He says the multi trillion-dollar global business promises to transform personal transportation and the auto industry as surely as his great-grandfather’s Model T changed the way people live, work and play. To hear Bill Ford tell it, the Blue Oval wants nothing more than to revolutionize the business Henry Ford built. The company wants to listen to the transportation needs of everyday customers and to offer customized solutions. It wants to demonstrate the values of humility and collaboration in an industry seldom associated with either. That oughta’ be a challenge. He says Ford wants to work with municipal governments. It wants to show that what works in New York or Paris may not in Mumbai or Shanghai. It wants to prove to skeptical investors that an Old Economy player can tend to the core car and truck business, expand into mobility, and grow its profit margins. The goal, Bill Ford says, is to be “less capital-intensive … and less revenue-dependent on fixed-cost investment.” And if they fail to exploit huge opportunities in ride-sharing, self-driving cars and transportation services, he admits Ford risks being relegated to assembling other people’s technology. That’s a place it does not want to be because of the negative long-term implications for growth, value creation and its future. Michigan shouldn’t want Ford to head there, either. Done wrong or incompletely, the net effect would be lower profit margins, lower share prices, lower market capitalization and irrelevance. That’s why the mobility mobilization transfixing Detroit and the industry comes down to two words: build value. They need to understand that the recent and not-so-recent past of mediocre products, operating losses and capital destruction remain bitter lessons for investors of every size. They need to understand that hugely profitable years selling cars and trucks in North America are no guarantee of future success in the tech-driven world of mobility. There, barriers to entry are as small as a single idea executed and properly scaled. That’s not an area Ford and its largest rivals are accustomed to, but it’s fast becoming the brave new auto industry – whether they like it or not.   Daniel Howes is a columnist at The Detroit News.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 8, 2016 at 8:13AM DARPA wants to build A SPACE "PLANE." Vector Space volunteers to help it traverse the last mile into orbit. IMAGE SOURCE: DARPA. DARPA wants a new space shuttle. It's getting close to building one. And in fact, it just got a little bit closer. Last month, in a little-noticed press release, privately held Vector Space Systems confirmed that it has won $2.5 million worth of contracts from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Through these contracts, Vector -- which hasn't even begun operations yet, although it has begun collecting clients -- aims to play a major part in the designing of DARPA's XS-1 Experimental Spaceplane -- and potentially, in new NASA projects as well. As Vector explains, the contracts break down as follows: First, Vector will tweak its first-stage "Vector-R" rocket for use as a second-stage rocket on DARPA's spaceplane. Second, Vector will develop a smaller "advanced prototype" Vector-R upper stage -- this time for NASA. Success in both efforts should accelerate Vector's progress toward building "a fully functional two-stage flight test vehicle" for itself, as well as advancing DARPA's and NASA's respective objectives. Flight testing to prove is slated to begin late next year. Back up a second. Remind me: What is a "spaceplane"? NASA, as you'll recall, retired the space shuttle in 2011 -- partially because of concerns over the vessel's safety, but also over concerns for its cost. DARPA's XS-1 Spaceplane project aims to address both of these concerns by developing a new "drone" spacecraft that will fly to the verge of space under its own power and there launch a smaller onboard rocket to boost satellite payloads the last few miles into actual orbit. That accomplished, XS-1 will land back on Earth like an airplane (or space shuttle), refuel, reload, and be ready to launch a new payload within 24 hours. In fact, DARPA is targeting turnaround times and consistency of operation that would permit XS-1 to launch "10 times in 10 days." As an unmanned drone, XS-1 would allay concerns about the safety of live cargo. And with launches taking place daily, rather than just a few times a year, the cost of building XS-1 would be spread out among so many deliveries as to dramatically decrease the cost of space launch -- perhaps to as little as $5 million for a two-ton cargo. So far, three industry teams have been hired to work on prototyping a spaceplane for DARPA: Boeing (NYSE:BA), working in collaboration with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin; Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), working with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic; and privately held Masten Space Systems, working with also-private XCOR Aerospace. (XCOR, however, appears to be in the process of shuttering its Lynx spaceplane project, and may be on its way out.) And Vector-R? What's that? Vector describes its new Vector-R launch vehicle as "the world's only launch vehicle dedicated to servicing the micro satellite market by providing a dedicated 50kg launch mass to orbit." Comprising a "carbon fiber airframe, lightweight pressurized propulsion systems and an agile modern avionics system," Vector-R targets the fast-growing market for launching very small satellites, rapidly and at low cost -- and leaves Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, and SpaceX to duke it out over the market for launching larger satellites. In its final form as a "fully functional two-stage" rocket, Vector-R will be the vehicle Vector uses to launch microsatellites into space. In the meantime, in between time, Jim Cantrell, CEO of Vector Space, says Vector-R's first-stage engine will be designed "platform agnostic" for its role as the spaceplane's delivery rocket. That is to say, regardless of whether DARPA ultimately chooses a prototype spaceplane from the Boeing team, from Northrop, or from Masten, Vector's rocket will launch equally well from any of them. What does it mean for investors? Experts estimate that by 2020, companies could be launching as many as 500 such "microsatellites" annually. At launch prices ranging from $250,000 per launch (CubeCab) to $1.5 million (Vector) to $10 million (Virgin Galactic), that implies an annual market size of up to $5 billion -- a market in which Vector is targeting a 12% share. Vector clearly has its eye on becoming a key player in this emerging market. At the same time, through its contract with DARPA, it's demonstrating a willingness to cooperate with (and profit from) many of the larger companies working on DARPA's new spaceplane -- and through its contract with NASA, an interest in working for the government directly as well. When you get right down to it, it doesn't really matter where the money is coming from. As long as the checks clear, Vector will take it.

"Our test crew conducts flight trials of the various aircraft and tests their armaments here (ASTE) before inducting them into our fleet for operations and endurance in peace and war times," said the Commandant, Air Vice Marshal Sandeep Singh on Saturday, the IAF's 84th anniversary. As one of the six of its kind the world over, the 44-year-old ASTE is the IAF's only test centre in the country for field trials of its fighters, transport aircraft and helicopters that are indigenous or imported from global aerospace majors. The other five such test centres for military aircraft and weapon systems are in Britain, France, Russia and the US (two) worldwide. "In the recent times, Rafale and Typhoon multi-role medium combat aircraft (MMRCA) were short listed after their field evaluations and flight tests on 750 quantitative and quality requirements by our test pilots and engineers in all-weather conditions and situations," said Group Captain and Chief Test Pilot S. Chaki on the occasion. The other four fighters in contention were F-16 Falcon of Lockheed Martin, F-18 Hornet of Boeing, Gripen of Swedish Saab and Russian MiG-35. Though Rafale of Dassault Aviation was selected over Eurofighter Typhoon as the lowest bidder, India and France on September 23 signed a Euro 7.87-billion deal to buy 36 of them (fighter jets) equipped with latest missiles and weapon systems. As the world's fourth largest air force, the IAF operates various lean and mean flying machines, including Sukhoi-30, Mirage 2000, Jaguar, MiG-21, MiG-29, Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, Advance Light Helicopter Dhruv, Mi-17, C-130 and C-17 aircraft, keeping pace with time and technological advancements. "Flight tests and field trials of 16 platforms, including 11 fixed and five rotary wings are conducted here for selection, shortlisting and induction into the fleet and deployment at our air bases across the country and on frontline," Singh said. The ASTE is also used by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) for evaluating indigenous aircraft, choppers, weapons, sub-systems and other aerospace equipment used in aerial warfare. "Our test pilots and engineers also fly prototypes of HAL, DRDO and NAL for their indigenous development and integration of weapons and avionics systems. Aircraft upgrades also go through stringent tests and trials before induction," Chaki asserted. "Flight test of a prototype carries risk and a number of test crew sacrificed their life while undertaking hazardous flight test operations," recalled Singh. The centre's test crew also evaluated the Pilatus PC-7 basic trainer, AH-64D Apache attack helicopter and the CH-47 Chinook Heavy lift helicopter for selection. As the nodal centre for avionics systems upgrades for various fleets of the air force, the ASTE ensures that potent and operationally lethal platforms are provided to the air warriors "Core of operational capabilities of these upgraded platforms resides in their weapon systems, targeting accuracies and avionics system functionalities," Singh added. The legacy of evaluation of aircrafts and systems dates back to 1957 when the Gnat aircraft was tested for the first time. Thereafter, Vampire, Mystere, Hunter, HF-24 Marut, HPT-32, HJT-16, Avro and Embraer Air Warning and Control System (AWACS) platform and Saras transport aircraft were tested over the years. Besides flight tests, the centre also trains the air force test crew and engineers at its pilots' school for 46 weeks with specialist course every year. "The flight test course is one of the toughest, as the pilots are mentored to imbibe high degree of engineering acumen and the engineers are taught to almost become pilots," reiterated Chaki. The school is also recognised by the international Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) and the Society of Flight Test Engineers (SFTE). The school trained about 500 flight test crew over the years, while the centre conducted over 1,500 trials of various platforms and weapons, including missiles, laser guided bombs and other ammunition. Incidentally, the first and only Indian cosmonaut Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma was trained and served at the ASTE. --IANS fb/rn/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

As the nodal centre for avionics systems upgrades for various fleets of the air force, the ASTE ensures that potent and operationally lethal platforms are provided to the air warriors "Core of operational capabilities of these upgraded platforms resides in their weapon systems, targeting accuracies and avionics system functionalities," Singh added. The legacy of evaluation of aircrafts and systems dates back to 1957 when the Gnat aircraft was tested for the first time. Thereafter, Vampire, Mystere, Hunter, HF-24 Marut, HPT-32, HJT-16, Avro and Embraer Air Warning and Control System (AWACS) platform and Saras transport aircraft were tested over the years. Besides flight tests, the centre also trains the air force test crew and engineers at its pilots' school for 46 weeks with specialist course every year. "The flight test course is one of the toughest, as the pilots are mentored to imbibe high degree of engineering acumen and the engineers are taught to almost become pilots," reiterated Chaki. The school is also recognised by the international Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) and the Society of Flight Test Engineers (SFTE). The school trained about 500 flight test crew over the years, while the centre conducted over 1,500 trials of various platforms and weapons, including missiles, laser guided bombs and other ammunition. Incidentally, the first and only Indian cosmonaut Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma was trained and served at the ASTE. --IANS fb/rn/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Terrifying footage recorded by aviation enthusiast Radko Našinec shows the Boeing jet in difficulty as it attempts to come down in strong winds. YouTube/ Radko Našinec via Storyful 4 The plane can be seen coming into land at Václav Havel Airport in Prague YouTube/ Radko Našinec via Storyful 4 The right wing dips as the plane lands forcing the pilot to rebalance in strong winds The heart-stopping clip, from Václav Havel Airport in Prague, Czech Republic, shows the passenger jet wobbling as it comes into land. The right wing of the plane can be seen dipping down as the wheels hit the tarmac before the pilot rebalances the aircraft and pulls up so they can have another attempt. However, as the pilot does this, the left wing appears to scrape along the ground before they can get the jet back into the air.

The delegation is visiting several sites in the United States to choose for flight crew training. Pictured from left, Staff Colonel Al Hazeem, Major General Al Fourdari, Dennis Kintigh, and Major General Al Mazidi (Bethany Freudenthal Photo) Several high ranking Kuwaiti military officials visited Roswell Friday for a tour of the Roswell International Air Center and Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell, as part of a delegation inspecting potential locations in the United States to provide flight training to Kuwait Air Force cadets. “All of us here, we don’t want your business, we want your friendship,” said Brig. Gen. Andrew Salas. “All of us here are a team that have laid out the red carpet for you to come. As the National Guard we will do everything within our power to help the mayor and others help your training here be successful.” The project that has been in the discussion phase for three years will partner the city of Roswell and ENMU-R to provide instruction in English as a second language, contract lodging, and meal service in the university’s cafeteria for the 18- and 19-year-old cadets who will become military officers once they complete the program. If Roswell is selected, Mayor Dennis Kintigh said the program will add both economic and cultural diversity to the city, and send a message that all are welcome here. “It will strengthen our relationship with Kuwait, who is a strong ally in the war on terrorism,” Kintigh said. The consortium seeking the contract with the nation of Kuwait is comprised of RS Warbirds based in Phoenix, which will be providing the aircraft; i3 of Huntsville, Alabama, which will provide instructors and coordination of support and curriculum; and Boeing Training Services of St. Louis, which will provide air traffic control training and safety training. The contract could last up to 10 years, bringing in about 200 cadets for 30 months each, as well as many instructors who would either be located in Roswell or come for temporary duty assignments. “Roswell and New Mexico are really great hosts to foreign nations, and it’ll be good for our economy, and superb for their air force training. You just can’t get any better weather, or any better airspace than right here,” said U.S. Representative Steve Pearce, R-Hobbs. Cadets will be trained on Cessna 172s, Tucanos, a two-seat turbo prop trainer similar to a TG, and the Czech Aero L-39 Albatros, a high performance jet trainer similar to a T-38. i3 has experience training flight personnel in the Middle East, and was involved in “standing up,” the new Iraq and new Afghanistan air forces doing training in country. They are currently under a contract with the State Department and U.S. Army to provide helicopter training to the Tunisian Air Force. Roswell is one of four sites being considered for this project. Because of the small size of their country, there is limited flight training in Kuwaiti for flight crew. “We’re very excited because of the commitment these leaders from Kuwait have in training their soldiers and their airmen, and this is the perfect place for them to do it because of the perfect weather, the ranges, the airspace, the safety and security they have here, the welcoming nature, everybody here wants them to be here, and so we don’t want their business, we want their friendship,” Salas said. If Roswell wins the contract, Kintigh said it will expand the city’s air services from just maintenance to air training that could lead to contracts with other countries. In January, Roswell was visited by a high ranking member of the Royal Saudi Arabian Air Force. Since August, Tunisian Air Force cadets have been receiving helicopter training at the air center, and are expected to be here until the beginning of next year.

(Rebecca F. Miller/The Gazette) The Gazette Oct 3, 2016 at 6:00 am | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — Perhaps the sandbags and other barriers blocked your view, but as the Cedar River rose, crested and receded, there was a world of news outside the Cedar Rapids flood evacuation zone. Bullets flew in war zones, a shopping mall and in confrontations between police and civilians. The slings and arrows of political campaigns continued and, perhaps, like the river itself, surged. Baseball pennant races were decided and homecoming parades were marched. So as the tide goes out, here’s what you need to know: Sept. 22 ▪ Even though fewer than 10 percent of a potential 28,787 University of Iowa students completed a survey on sexual violence on campus, 20 percent of female undergraduates reported being raped since enrolling at the Iowa City university. ▪ Retired Prairie Home Companion host Garrison Keillor, who has made his share of Iowa jokes, was in Des Moines mixing homespun humor with political commentary to urge Iowans to support Democrat Patty Judge for U.S. Senate and reject GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Hitting the campaign trail is rare for him, Keillor said, but he likes to “speak up for Democrats in endangered places ... and I like underdogs.” ▪ In Charlotte, North Carolina, a man was shot and critically injured during a second violent night of protests, after two sharply divergent accounts emerged of the death of a black man at the hands of police. ▪ A march of a few hundred people turned chaotic after protesters attempted to follow police in riot gear into the lobby of an uptown hotel. Officers used tear gas, and then a reporter heard one shot and saw a man lying in the street near the hotel entrance. Sept. 23 ▪ Fundraisers based on setting new Guinness World Records were planned by Friends of Cedar Lake, which needed at least 408 people to set a record for the largest, five-minute Hula-Hoop workout. Iowa Valley Habitat for Humanity needed at least 1,821 people to set the record for fist-bumping. ▪ Warplanes mounted the heaviest airstrikes in months against rebel-held districts in the city of Aleppo as Russia and the Syrian government spurned a U.S. plea to halt flights, burying hope for the revival of a doomed cease fire. A hospital director told Reuters the death toll was 45. Sept. 24 ▪ Iowa State University President Steven Leath, a licensed pilot, reimbursed the university $4,637 for flying one of its planes on four occasions involving a combination of university and personal business. ▪ Later, he wrote a check for $15,000 to cover damages sustained after he encountered a downward draft while landing in Bloomington, Illinois. Leath clipped a runway light in the hard landing. ▪ Two months after refusing to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said in a Facebook message that although he had “‘areas of significant disagreement” with his party’s nominee, he would vote for Trump because he doesn’t want Hillary Clinton to become president. Sept. 25 ▪ Steve Martin and Martin Short headlined the opening of the University of Iowa’s glittering $176 million performing arts center just uphill from the original Hancher, lost to floods in 2008. More than 20,000 visited the new building this month, from 9,000 who attended two public open houses to 8,000 who came the following weekend for a free outdoor concert, followed by donors and guests who came to a gala dinner and show. ▪ President Barack Obama expressed hope that a new national museum showcasing the triumphs and tragedies of the African American experience helps bring people together. The museum, located on the National Mall, officially opened its doors Sept. 24. It contains 36,000 items that trace the journey of African Americans from slavery in the 1800s to the fight for civil rights in the 20th century. ▪ The Iowa Hawkeyes escaped from New Jersey with a 14-7 win over unranked Rutgers after making a fourth-down stand late in the game to preserve the lead. Sept. 26 ▪ United Nations officials suggested an air raid on a humanitarian convoy outside Aleppo, Syria, that killed 20 could be considered a war crime. However, the incident became a contest of international finger pointing with Russians and Syrians denying involvement and suggesting it might have been the work of a U.S. drone. ▪ The motive for a shooting in a Washington state mall that killed five was unknown, investigators said after arresting a suspect who was described as “zombielike” during the attack. FBI officials said while they had no indication the attack was a “terrorism act,” they could not rule out that possibility. Sept. 27 ▪ Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump launched into a spirited brawl as they met onstage for the first time, each jockeying for a breakout moment in their tightening race during the first debate of the general election campaign. The candidates repeatedly shouted over each other as they argued about their histories, plans and the comments each of them has made during the presidential race. “I have a feeling by the end of this debate I am going to be blamed for everything that ever happened,” Democrat Hillary Clinton said. “Why not?” Trump responded. “Join the debate by saying more crazy things,” Clinton shot back. ▪ Rockwell Collins won a contract to provide touch-screen flight displays on the new Boeing 777X jetliner, the first commercial air transport aircraft to be equipped with that type of flight displays. The displays are expected to make the flight deck more intuitive for pilots and more efficient for flight operations. Boeing has 300 orders and commitments for the 777X, with first deliveries planned for 2020. Sept. 28 ▪ More than 100 people gathered near the 1500 block of Eighth Avenue SE where police said a 13-year-old girl died from a gunshot to the head hours earlier while riding in a car with five others. Family, friends and community members held candles and balloons in remembrance of Ireshia Parks and pleaded with the young people present to stand against gun violence. Police said a 13-year-old male suspect now faces a charge of involuntary manslaughter. ▪ Midwest business conditions improved — slightly — despite weakness among manufacturers linked to agriculture and energy, according to the Creighton University Mid-America Business Conditions Index. The regional index, much as with the national reading, has indicated the manufacturing sector is experiencing anemic to negative business conditions. ▪ A key Iowa lawmaker suggested the state promote health care occupations for young people similar to a focus on STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — to meet the challenges of aging Iowans and the shortfall of trained professionals to take care of them. “Without reaching out to the next generation and showing them that they could have a fulfilling career in providing care, we will face a significant difficulty in meeting the needs of our growing senior population in this state,” Rep. Dave Heaton, R-Mount Pleasant, 75, co-leader of the Legislature’s health and human services budget subcommittee, told delegates to the Older Iowans Legislature. Sept. 29 ▪ A state audit found that a program that paid out $310 million to nearly 1,000 economic development projects from 2003 to 2014, plus an additional $1.4 billion in tax relief, created only 64 percent of the jobs promised. Of the 18,503 projected new jobs at those projects, 11,840 have been realized, according to the report. An additional 396 projects, with 24,757 projected jobs, are still in progress and do not have an accounting of jobs created. ▪ In Council Bluffs, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump accused Democrat Hillary Clinton of being corrupt and attacked her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. He also told about 1,200 people that he rejected the idea that he lost Monday’s debate, saying he won in a ‘landslide.’ About 1,200 people attended the rally. “How many more Clinton scandals can this country take?” he asked about her use of a private email server. Trump said he would lower taxes, reduce regulations, help family farms thrive, negotiate great trade agreements and repeal Obamacare while offering more choice among schools and improving national security and the nation’s borders. ▪ Congress voted Sept. 28 to override President Barack Obama’s veto of legislation that allows relatives of 9/11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for their deaths. However, family members said they knew that even with the enactment of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, their day in court is distant. Congress is expected to revisit the legislation after the Nov. 8 general election. ▪ Based on thousands of wiretaps, photographs, witness statements and forensic tests during more than two years of inquiries, international prosecutors said Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down in July 2014 by a missile fired from a launcher brought into Ukraine from Russia and located in a village held by pro-Russian rebels. The findings counter Moscow’s suggestion that the passenger plane, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in July 2014, was brought down by Ukraine’s military rather than the separatists. Sept. 30 ▪ Campaigning in Des Moines on the first day of early voting, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton predicted she will carry the state. Calling GOP nominee Donald Trump’s approach negative, she told about 2,000 people the nation has to “heal these divides.” “The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot,” Clinton said. “The election will be close. But we can win Iowa.” ▪ Federal investigators assessed whether equipment failure, an incapacitated operator or other factors could have caused a packed commuter-rail train to crash at Hoboken (New Jersey) Terminal, killing one person and injuring 100 others. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said the crash appeared to be accidental. Officials declined to speculate on a cause, but one thing is clear: The train was traveling far too fast as it entered one of the busiest transportation terminals in the New York area, crashed onto the concrete platform, destroyed the metal canopy over the platform and finally came to a rest when it crashed into the station building. ▪ Congress avoided a government shutdown by approving a continuing resolution to fund the federal government for 10 weeks beyond the end of the federal fiscal year Sept. 30. To make that happen, the House of Representatives and the Senate voted to allocate $1.1 billion in funding to address the Zika crisis, aid those affected by floods in Louisiana and give support to residents of Flint, Michigan, who have struggled with water contamination from lead pipes. ▪ Congress won’t be back in session until Nov. 14, leaving members a month to campaign for their re-elections. Oct. 1 ▪ After leading the $1.9 billion University of Iowa Health Care enterprise through a decade of historic prosperity that included world-renowned medical breakthroughs, soaring patient totals, record revenue and expansion — including a new children’s hospital and biomedical research facility — Jean Robilliard announced he’s stepping down. At almost 73 years old, Robillard, a pediatric nephrologist by training, said he intends to remain on faculty in the UI Stead Family Department of Pediatrics after his successor arrives. ▪ For now, a Decorah couple has the OK to build a home that looks like Kinnick Stadium in an Iowa City neighborhood, though their neighbors indicated they’ll likely take the issue to court. The Iowa City Board of Adjustment, which heard the neighbors’ appeal of the city’s granting the structure a building permit, split 2-2 on the issue Friday night, with one member recusing herself. That means the plan can proceed since three votes were required to overturn the city’s decision. City staff classified the house as a single-family dwelling and issued the building permit. ▪ Police say Christopher Arteberry Jr. is dead following a stabbing incident Sept. 30 in Cedar Rapids about one mile from the campus of Kirkwood Community College. Cedar Rapids Public Safety spokesman Greg Buelow said officers responded to an apartment complex at 6725 College Park Court SW at 2:09 a.m. Emergency medical care was initiated at the scene and Arteberry was taken to Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later, Buelow said. ▪ Former Israeli President Shimon Peres is laid to rest in Israel’s Mount Herzl national cemetery, eulogized by Israeli leaders, family and two American presidents as a founding father who first built up Israel’s military industrial complex and then sought peace with the Palestinians. Peres died Sept. 28 from complications of a stroke. He was 93. Oct. 2 ▪ Russian warplanes and their Syrian government allies battered rebel-held areas in and around Aleppo and rebels and aid workers accused them of destroying one of the city’s main hospitals and killing at least two patients. ▪ Iowa State University President Steven Leath has announced a historic campaign to raise $1.1 billion by June 30, 2020 — the most ambitious fundraising goal in the university’s history. ISU’s campaign, called “Forever True, For Iowa State,” comes just as the University of Iowa’s $1.7 billion capital campaign, called “For Iowa. Forever more,” nears its end. ▪ The Iowa Hawkeyes dropped their homecoming game to Northwestern with the Wildcats prevailing 38-31 at Kinnick Stadium.

The carrier is delaying deliveries of 39 of the upgraded single-aisle planes originally scheduled for 2018 to 2020, the company said in a filing Friday to Borsa Istanbul. Turkish is raising its 2022 deliveries for the workhorse jets to 30 from the six it had previously planned. The company didn’t elaborate on the models that will be deferred, but it has ordered 92 Airbus A321neo, 65 of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 and 10 of the U.S. planemaker’s Max 9 models. Turkish, based in Istanbul, said it was reducing flight frequencies and shifting to smaller planes on “demand-challenged routes” after posting a second-quarter loss of 656 million liras ($215 million) in August.

Friday’s sharp decline puts the GCI at a close below 80 points for the first time since Sept. 21 and occurred in the midst of narrow trade in U.S. markets to put stocks on course for a third straight weekly decline as investors looked at September jobs numbers that fell below economists’ expectations. GovCon Index decliners outnumbered laggers by a 5-to-1 ratio Friday with Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), McKesson Corp. (NYSE: MCK) and Harris Corp. (NYSE: HRS) the GCI’s lone S&P 500-listed stocks to close green. On a weekly basis, seven GCI stocks advanced with KBR (NYSE: KBR) as the best percentage performer over five days and Boeing (NYSE: BA) the only co-listed company to gain. Honeywell posted its biggest one-day decline in 15 months and was the S&P 500’s second-worst net performer after the company issued new third quarter earnings guidance below the Wall Street analyst consensus with a cut to full-year expectations on lower shipments in the aerospace division, the Sept. 20 sale of its government services business to KBR (NYSE: KBR) and the separation of its former automation and control solutions business into two new reporting segments. Honeywell expects third quarter earnings per share of $1.60 excluding a 7-cent stock compensation restructuring versus analyst forecasts of $1.70 and trimmed full-year EPS expectations to $6.60-$6.64 from the prior $6.60-$6.70 outlook. Honeywell also forecasts core organic revenue for 2016 to decline 1-2 percent compared to prior guidance of a 1 percent sales fall. Approximately 19.87 million shares in Honeywell traded Friday to exceed the three-month average eight-fold. The GovCon Index’s notable net decliners included other aerospace and defense stocks Rockwell Collins (NYSE: COL), Textron (NYSE: TXT) and Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) with government services contractor CACI International (NYSE: CACI) also a major contributor to the GCI’s loss. Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE: BAH) retreated below its Wednesday close to give back gains from its Thursday rally on volatility in the stock after news surfaced over the FBI probe of a firm employee as volume totaled 2.33 million shares traded to top the three-month average by three times. Volume in Booz Allen’s stock has exceeded the three-month average for three consecutive days. U.S. investors kept their expectations as is over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and now turn their attention to third quarter corporate earnings season with many GovCon Index-listed companies slated to report results this month. According to Bloomberg, bond markets have the probability of a December rate hike at 66 percent with odds of an increase in November at 17 percent compared to 24 percent before the Labor Department released September’s payrolls figures.

Currently a team of 116 employees from NASA, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and their commercial space partners are hunkered down and riding out the storm at the Kennedy Space Center's Emergency Operations Center. NASA's Kennedy Space Center NASA file After the went dropped below 50 knots, workers were able to venture out and do initial damage inspections, George Diller, a public affairs officer at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, told NBC News Friday afternoon. They found the facility made it through mostly unscathed. Related: NASA Deployed This Whale-Shaped Drone to Monitor the Hurricane "It's mostly roof damage and other collateral damage like windows and doors, but no major damage to the major facilities and none to flight hardware, including the GOES-R weather satellite, Orion or the Boeing commercial crew vehicle," he said. The group of over a hundred sheltered inside the emergency center will likely move back to their respective buildings and areas by Saturday, Diller said. NASA's facilities sit on the coast and were initially forecasted to take a direct Category 5 level beating from Hurricane Matthew. The storm was eventually downgraded to Category 4 before it hit. Each facility has their own storm plan which would typically involve a limited number of people staying behind in each facility, Diller said. But NASA decided to not take any chances. There were worries a storm surge could cause flooding, however a NASA blog post this morning reported the surge has been "relatively minimal." The Damage Assessment and Recovery Team will begin a formal evaluation Saturday morning, according to NASA. "In a Category 4 or 5 storm, they don't think its safe to have people scattered around in those facilities," Diller told NBC News on Thursday as Florida braced for impact. "We have brought in food and cots we are going to put down tonight and blankets and pillows. "We are basically here until its over," he added.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close Hurricane Matthew (image from nasa.gov) Disruptions to stores, ports, plants spread ahead of Hurricane Matthew Reuters Oct 7, 2016 (…) Hurricane Matthew (image from nasa.gov) Disruptions to air travel, manufacturing, supply chains and retail stores spread on Friday as Hurricane Matthew worked its way up Florida's Atlantic Coast, leaving people and goods stranded and plants idled. After cancelling a total of 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning. Delta Air Lines said it had canceled 240 flights for Friday, and roughly 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, Coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. The storm had also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C., also suspended operations. Wal-Mart Stores said it had closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew. A spokesman said the company is using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes. Office supply retailer Staples said it had closed stores in line with emergency evacuation guidelines. Nike has closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and encouraged "employees to follow the guidance of state and local officials to evacuate areas in the path of the storm." Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co. closed its Miami office for three to four days, and several of its Nortrax Construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it was monitoring the situation for its operations in Georgia and North Carolina. Honda Motor spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said the company was evaluating the impact of Hurricane Matthew. "At this point, the hurricane will not impact any of our manufacturing plants," he wrote. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain." Fitch Ratings estimates that if Matthew results in insured losses in excess of $10 billion, a greater proportion of losses will be borne by reinsurers as opposed to primary companies. CoreLogic, a California-based real estate data firm, estimated the storm could cause up to $189 billion in storm surge damage to residential property in Florida alone. In comparison, recovery costs from Superstorm Sandy totaled $71.3 billion in New York and New Jersey in 2012, according to estimates from their governors. Here is a summary of closures and disruptions due to the hurricane. TRANSPORTATION AIRPORTS: South Florida airports closed. Flights at Miami International Airport were resuming on Friday. FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS: Delta Airlines: About 130 Thursday, 150 Friday and 80 Saturday cancellations. United Airlines: 180 flights canceled through Saturday in Florida.

The speciality business, which is the world’s third-largest manufacturer of steel for the aerospace industry, and counts Airbus, Boeing and Rolls Royce among its customers, was put up for sale as a separate business in July. A shortlist has been reduced to two main bidders - Albion Steel, a start-up headed by Forgemasters chairman Tony Pedder, against international steel company Liberty House Group. In a letter to Mr Jha, Wentworth and Dearne MP John Healey criticised the lack of “progress” and “communication”, saying the sale appeared to be on “go slow”, with the 2,000-strong workforce left in the dark. He wrote: “We were told weeks ago that the range of potential purchasers had been reduced to two main bidders, with an indication that the one preferred buyer would be settled shortly after that. ‘Since then there has been silence from Tata, and it looks like your company is dragging its feet. It is for this reason and to help remove the continuing uncertainty that I write to ask that you end this delay, release the relevant details about your preferred bidder so that the unions, the workforce and local South Yorkshire agencies can assess the prospects for a successful sale and work with the potential new owner.” Senior officials from the trade union Community have spent the past week meeting with members at the steelworks and joined calls for Tata to come clean. Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary, said: “While so much focus is on the sale of Tata’s Strip business and the uncertainty surrounding the pension scheme, Community will not allow Speciality Steels to become the forgotten part of the steel crisis. “With over 2,000 direct employees and many thousands more in the local supply chain, this business is of huge importance to the South Yorkshire region. “When Tata announced that they wanted to sell the business, we called on them to act as a responsible seller. The continued lack of information about that process and the worry this has caused amongst their loyal workforce is highly irresponsible.” A spokesman for Tata said: “Whenever we have significant news we always seek to tell our employees first. We also communicate regularly with our employees about issues which could affect them including through briefings and newsletters. “We strive to maintain strong relationships with all our key stakeholders, including local MPs, around our UK sites. We have offered to meet John Healey MP to discuss the points in his letter. “Discussions have been ongoing with a number of interested parties regarding the sales process of our Speciality Steels business since our announcement in July. Bidders have been given the opportunity to meet with management and conduct site visits, as well as having access to information to assist in performing due diligence. “The process is ongoing and we will provide a further update at the appropriate point.” Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

HNA's Avolon group to acquire CIT Commercial Air, creating world’s third largest aircraft lessor CAPA > Aviation Analysis > HNA's Avolon group to acquire CIT Commercial Air, creating world’s third largest aircraft lessor 7-Oct-2016 Tweet © CAPA HNA Group’s remarkable spending spree continues, with the announcement that its Avolon subsidiary will acquire CIT Commercial Air, the aircraft leasing arm of CIT Group. The USD10 billion deal will create the world’s third largest lessor - and they may be more to come yet. Avolon itself was only recently acquired by HNA Group, with the USD2.7 billion purchase agreement being finalised in Jan-2016, via Bohai Capital Holdings. Avolon is now the core aircraft leasing brand for the HNA Group. Including assets from Hong Kong Aviation Capital, Bohai Capital and several smaller HNA Group leasing firms, Avolon has a fleet of nearly 250 aircraft and almost 200 more on order. Avolon will double in size with the CIT purchase The CIT Commercial Air acquisition will again double the scale of the Avolon’s business. The unified portfolio will comprise an in-service fleet of 511 aircraft, along with a managed portfolio of 50. Avolon and CIT combined have another 349 aircraft on order. This includes 282 new/next generation aircraft, including 195 Airbus commercial jets - A320neo family, A330neo and A350 - and 87 Boeing jets, comprising 59 737 MAXs and 28 787s. The entire portfolio of 910 aircraft is valued at more than USD43 billion. The combined portfolio will also expand Avolon’s existing customer base by 69 airlines in 20 countries, bringing the total to 154 customers in 61 countries. Geographically, the company’s customer base will now be split one third each across the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions, reducing risk and providing opportunities for yield improvement. Combined Avolon and CIT Commercial Air fleet metrics* Total fleet (in-service, managed + on order) 910 aircraft Fleet value USD43 billion + Owned and managed portfolio 561 aircraft Aircraft orders and commitments 349 aircraft Average fleet age (in service fleet) 4.6 years Average remaining lease period 6.7 years Customer base 154 *As at 30-Jun-2016 The transaction will be financed through a combination of Avolon’s cash, new equity contributed by Bohai and acquisition debt financing of USD8.5 billion, committed by Morgan Stanley & Co and UBS Investment Bank. The deal is expected to be completed during 1Q2017, following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Despite Avolon being just six years old, it is already a powerhouse in the aircraft leasing industry. Avolon’s management team – comprised of industry veterans from RBS - has rapidly developed the company’s international footprint across key global leasing centres. In addition to its headquarters in Dublin, the company has a strategic Asian regional head office in Hong Kong, and offices in Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore and the US. The Avolon powerhouse has even grander intentions The ambitions of Avolon CEO Dómhnal Slattery stretch higher still; and Mr Slattery has the industry’s two leading firms – AerCap and ILFC, both of which control more than 1000 aircraft – in his sights. Mr Slattery commented that the CIT acquisition is “not the summit of our ambition” but rather a “very important milestone on the journey.” Largest lessors by fleet (as at 07-Oct-2016)  Lessor Active On order Total GECAS 1630 270 1900 AerCap 1227 410 1637 SMBC 453 202 655 Air Lease Corp 278 373 651 CIT Commercial Air 380 132 512 Nordic Aviation Capital 297 194 491 ICBC Leasing 318 173 491 BOC Aviation 265 218 483 Avolon 247 185 432 BBAM 399 0 399 Aviation Capital 260 97 357 Macquarie AirFinance 223 40 263 AWAS 240 15 255 Source: CAPA Fleet Database Order and fleet portfolio discrepancies result from differing reporting times China takes on a leadership role in aircraft leasing The acquisition is also testament to the rapid expansion of Chinese players in the leasing market. Since 2007, Chinese-owned lessors have expanded their collective fleet from under 500 to more than 2200 aircraft, increasing their share of the domestic leasing market from under 10% to more than half. Even the large and rapidly growing Chinese leasing market is not enough to satisfy their ambitions, and the massive international market contains further inviting targets for JV, portfolio acquisitions or more outright purchases.

India is another focus area for Thai AirAsia. A large portion of the additional aircraft will be based at secondary cities. Approximately 30% of Thai AirAsia’s fleet is now based outside Bangkok, compared to 15% two years ago, and this portion will continue to increase as the airline expands. Thai AirAsia is particularly keen to grow its base at U-Tapao near the resort of Pattaya, which opened in Sep-2015 and now has two aircraft. Thai AirAsia plans to expand the U-Tapao/Pattaya base by one or two aircraft in 2017, enabling new routes to China. Thai AirAsia is also considering the launch of international services in 2017 from Khon Kaen, which could become its seventh base and the fifth gateway for services to mainland China. China’s role in international aviation – and tourism – in 2025. The CAPA-ACTE Global Summit 12-Nov-2016 The CATA-ACTE Global Summit in Amsterdam explored some of the changes that will likely come to Chinese aviation and tourism by 2025. The viability of secondary markets has a mixed prognosis as British Airways exits Chengdu, but Vancouver airport expects sustainability from the secondary cities it is linked to – some of the first secondary routes from Chinese airlines. Partnerships and joint ventures are expanding and becoming more pressing subjects. oneworld is without a mainland Chinese partner, while China Eastern is exploring partnerships outside its SkyTeam alliance: it has a JV with Qantas and a partnership with BA, but Delta's minority equity investment gives it footing. Partnerships will influence, or be preceded by, liberalisation – including eventual China-US open skies. Although the Chinese outbound travel market is celebrated for its growth, a downturn can occur just as quickly. While visa liberalisation with Morocco has resulted in the country becoming a new popular market for Chinese visitors, terror attacks in France have reduced visitor growth not only in France but also in neighbouring countries, as visitors shun the region. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio October 6, 2016 The tests in the Nevada desert come as tensions rise with Russia and the Pentagon seeks to replace its aging nuclear arsenal. A pair of U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers dropped two 700-pound faux nuclear bombs in the middle of the Nevada desert within the past few days. Now the Pentagon wants to tell you about it. Conducted “earlier this month,” according to an Oct. 6 press release, the test involved two dummy variants of the B61, a nuclear bomb that has been in the U.S. arsenal since the 1960s. One was an “earth penetrator” made to strike underground targets, the other a tactical version of the B61. Neither carried an actual warhead. “The primary objective of flight testing is to obtain reliability, accuracy, and performance data under operationally representative conditions,” said the statement from the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department arm that oversees such tests. “Such testing is part of the qualification process of current alterations and life extension programs for weapon systems.” But why now? Perhaps it has to do with tensions with Russia, which are higher than they have been in decades, and which have sparked fears of a new nuclear arms race. Earlier this week, the Russian government announced it would conduct a massive drill to prepare its citizens for nuclear war.

But it may also have to do with the Pentagon’s quest to replace its decades-old nuclear arsenal with new bombs and delivery vehicles, an endeavor whose price tag tops several hundred billion dollars. The Air Force, for one, has been making its case for new intercontinental ballistic missiles and a nuclear cruise missile. At an Air Force Association conference in the Washington suburbs last, Boeing touted its work on the Minuteman III ICBM, mounting large-scale models of the long-range missiles front and center in its sprawling display area. “[We] are used to sustaining the [current] systems in pieces,” said Larry Shafer, a Boeing executive working on the company’s work to build a new ICBM to replace the Minuteman III. “This is a unique opportunity to build an ICBM system as a whole.” There has been much debate over building new ICBMs, a project the Air Force calls the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. Former Defense Secretary William Perry has argued that it is unnecessary. The cruise missile project, called the Long-Range Standoff weapon, has also been called redundant to the improved version the B61 set to enter service in the 2020s. The Air Force put out a notice in August that it is soliciting bids from companies to build new ICBMs and a nuclear cruise missiles. At the time, Maj. Gen. Scott Jansson, commander of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center and Air Force program executive officer for strategic systems, called the Long-Range Standoff weapon “a critical element of the United States’ nuclear deterrence strategy.” Last year, the Air Force inked a deal with Northrop Grumman to build a new long-range, stealth bomber — recently named the B-21 Raider — that will eventually be equipped to carry nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Navy is preparing to buy 12 new Columbia-Class submarines that will replace the Ohio-Class, which can launch nuclear missiles. The total price tag for the all of the new nuclear weapons is projected to cost between $350 billion to $450 billion over the next two decades.

(October 6, 2016) Bo Rader The Wichita Eagle Mykel Taylor, assistant professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, talks about the ag forecast during the annual Economic Outlook Conference on Thursday morning at Century II. Bo Rader The Wichita Eagle 1 of 4 i By Dan Voorhis dvoorhis@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story How’s the Wichita economy going to do next year? The same as in 2016, but more: aircraft manufacturing kind of flat. Oil and gas and agriculture still down. But everything else up. The net: About 2,500 more jobs in the Wichita area, and 12,000 more jobs statewide. Both are less than a 1 percent increase and slower than growth nationally. That’s the takeaway from the scores of charts and three-plus hours of talking by forecasters Thursday morning at the 2016 Wichita Area Economic Outlook Conference. Many of the business leaders in the audience have lived through the slow Wichita recovery and said they understand underwhelming forecasts. “It’s fair, and it’s conservative,” said Mark Murphy, a commercial banker with Fidelity Bank. “Some sectors in the service are seeing some growth, and there’s been some growth in the aircraft sector.” “It’s about right,” said Junetta Everett, vice president with Delta Dental. “I’m optimistic. “It’s faster than Topeka, slower than Kansas City.” But for some sectors, things are moving a bit faster. “This is a booming period,” said Derek Volgamore of Sunflower Bank. “There are all sorts of business that are wanting to talk about loans with all of the low interest rates.” Corporate aircraft Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, said Wichita’s aircraft industry took a bigger hit in 2009 than anyone. Sales of the small- and medium-sized jets made in Wichita and sold to companies in North America never rebounded as credit remained tight and the corporate culture shifted. Instead, local airplane makers faced increased competition from Brazilian planemaker Embraer, even as the large business jet makers – such as Gulfstream – saw their sales to oil-rich countries soar. That has changed in the past two years. Plunging commodity prices have hurt the large jet makers, and Embraer seems to have stalled in its attempts to grab more market share. Aboulafia said he expects the small- and medium-jet market to remain flat or rise slightly over the next five years. That’s a clear benefit to Wichita, he said, although the health of Bombardier Learjet remains a question. Commercial aircraft Wichita also benefits from trends in commercial aircraft, Aboulafia said. It looks like Boeing and Airbus are getting close to overproducing for the market demand. But that overproduction is coming mainly in wide-bodies, such as the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A330, while demand for the narrow-body 737 will remain strong. Wichita’s Spirit AeroSystems makes 70 percent of the 737 and depends heavily on demand for it for its well-being. Aboulafia forecasts a slowing of growth followed by a slight dip in 2021, but the decline will leave Wichita largely unaffected, he said. Agriculture, energy Mykel Taylor, a professor at Kansas State University, said farmers’ incomes have plunged since 2014, which has rippled out into the rural economy. She sees accelerating job losses throughout the rural parts of the state. Declining farm land values are pushing farmers to operate very conservatively, and banks are stretching out repayments and even forcing a few to sell off equipment or land. “I think it will continue at least a couple more years,” she said. “Most will figure out a way to continue with lower costs, but some producers will not make it out.” The energy sector is in similar straits, with low prices wrecking the ability of local producers to keep operating. Caron Lawhorn, senior vice president for One Gas, the largest natural gas supplier in Kansas, said the overall energy market in the U.S. remains in flux. Part of the uncertainty is who gets elected at the federal level. That will probably determine how hard environmental controls on emissions are applied. Some of her predictions: Renewable energy will continue to grow; nuclear will remain in the mix; coal will continue to shrink; natural gas will replace much of coal in generation of electricity. Real estate The area’s real estate really looks good, but not great, said Tom Johnson, president of the Martens Cos., which distributed its annual commercial real estate forecast on Wednesday. “We’re generally pretty optimistic, overall,” said Johnson. “The economy is growing, but nothing dynamic. Jobs aren’t growing at any fast clip.” Highlights of the report: ▪ Office: A lot of activity, with sizable companies moving, but it hasn’t cut down on the overall vacancy rates. Vacancy rates will actually rise and rents will stay level. ▪ Retail: With employment and incomes growing, this sector is expanding, particularly northeast and northwest. Vacancy rates will fall and rents rise. ▪ Industrial: After years of no new construction, a lot of new industrial space was built in the last year. That will continue. Vacancy rates will fall and rents rise.

Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- As tensions between Washington and Moscow flare, the Russian military is warning the United States that it has the ability to target stealth aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit that might be operating over Syria with the Almaz-Antey S-400 (NATO: SA-21 Growler) and the recently arrived S-300V4 (NATO: SA-23 Gladiator) air and missile defense systems. However, Western defense officials and analysts are skeptical and note that both the F-22 and the F-35 were specifically designed to counter those Russian-developed weapons, the National Interest reported. "Russian S-300, S-400 air defense systems deployed in Syria's Hmeymim and Tartus have combat ranges that may surprise any unidentified airborne targets,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Russian state media outlet Sputnik. “Operators of Russian air defense systems won't have time to identify the origin of airstrikes, and the response will be immediate. Any illusions about ‘invisible’ jets will inevitably be crushed by disappointing reality.” However, while Moscow makes bold claims about the counter-stealth capabilities of their S-400 and S-300V4 air defense systems, the fact remains that even if Russian low-frequency search and acquisitions radars can detect and track tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft such as the F-22 or F-35, fire control radars operating in C, X and Ku bands cannot paint low observable (LO) jets except at very close ranges. Stealth is not—and never has been—invisibility, but it does offer greatly delayed detection so that a fighter or bomber can engage a target and leave before the enemy has time to react. Tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft must be optimized to defeat higher-frequency bands such the C, X and Ku bands—that’s just a simple matter of physics. There is a ‘step change’ in an LO aircraft’s signature once the frequency wavelength exceeds a certain threshold and causes a resonant effect. Typically, that resonance occurs when a feature on an aircraft—such as a tail-fin or similar— is less than eight times the size of a particular frequency wavelength. Fighter-sized stealth aircraft that do not have the size or weight allowances for two feet or more of radar absorbent material coatings on every surface are forced to make trades as to which frequency bands they are optimized for. That means that radars operating at a lower frequency band such as parts of the S or L band are able to detect and track certain stealth aircraft. But ultimately, to counter lower frequency radars, a larger flying-wing stealth aircraft design like the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit or the B-21 Raider—which lacks many of the features that cause a resonance effect—is a necessity. But at the UHF and VHF band wavelengths, designers are not trying to make the aircraft invisible—rather engineers hope to create a radar cross-section that will blend in with the background noise that is inherent to low-frequency radars. Low frequency radars can be used to cue fire control radars however. Additionally, some U.S. adversaries have started to make an effort to develop targeting radars that operate at lower frequencies. However, those lower frequency fire-control radars exist only in theory—and are a long way off from being fielded. “Stealth is ‘delayed detection’ and that delay is getting shorter. SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) radars are shifting their frequencies into lower frequency bands where U.S. stealth is less effective,” said Mark Gammon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F and EA-18G program manager for advanced capabilities, had told me some time ago. “Early warning radars are in the VHF spectrum where stealth has limited if any capability. These radars are networked into the SAM radars giving the SAM radars cued search.” But low-frequency radars do not themselves provide a “weapons quality” track that is needed to guide a missile onto a target. There are various techniques that have been proposed to use low frequency radars for such purposes, but none of those are likely to prove viable. U.S. Air Force Col. Michael Pietrucha had described one possible approach to me to accomplish such a feat in an article I wrote for Aviation Week & Space Technology a few years ago. However, U.S. Air Force officials were dismissive of the technique. “Just because something is technically possible doesn't make it tactically feasible,” one Air Force official with extensive stealth aircraft experience explained. Meanwhile, operational Raptor pilots tell me “it would be really classified to discuss specific SAM counter tactics,” however, the F-22 is more than capable of defeating any of the current Russian surface-to-air missile systems that are currently or projected to be fielded. Hopefully, we will not have to find out the how effective the Raptor truly is during a shooting war over Syria—since conflicts can rapidly escalate out of control, as history loves to teach us over and over again . Despite the theoritical bases put forward by the the National Interest report, the Russian air defense unit deployed in Hmeymim and Tartus have managed to identify several radar avading aircraft of the US army from a long range in practice. Last week, a US spy plane was spotted flying off the coasts of Syria near the Russian base in Tartus while another one was picked up by radars as it was conducting reconnaissance operations over the Russian fleet near Crimea in the black sea, western websites said. The western websites that monitor military movements across the globe reported that a US spy plane of RC135W with tail number 62-4138 left Souda Bai Airbase in the Greek Crete Island and launched reconnaissance operation over the Russian navy fleet Southwest of Crimea's coast. The website added that another US P-8A spy plane with tail number 169958 also left Sigonella Airbase in Sicily on a reconnaissance mission over the Russian warships and base in Eastern Mediterranean Sea and Southern Cyprus. The US plane's spy operation near Syria's waters lasted for around half an hour before it moved towards Lebanon. Also last month, a US P-8A Poseidon spy plane was spotted again flying off the coast of Lebanon and Syria, near Tartus. The US Navy reconnaissance plane was spotted at the time flying a few kilometers away from Russia’s Humeimim airbase in Syria. The P-8A Poseidon aircraft flew close to Syria’s Mediterranean coast where Russia’s naval task force operates. It was the fourth time that a US spy plane was spotted near the Russian base in Humeimim. Humeimim military airport, Southeast of the city of Lattakia, is Russia’s strategic center of operations against the ISIL and other terrorist groups. According to reports, the P-8A Poseidon aircraft, designed and built for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, took off from the Mediterranean island of Sigonella in Sicily. The aircraft, with tail number 168761 then flew over Syria’s coast for one and a half hours in close proximity to the Russian airbase and logistics facility located at Tartus port, South of Lattakia. Observers believe that the US spy planes have recently increased their flights over Syria to gather intelligence on the Syrian army and the Russian forces' moves in the region. According to reports, on August 30, September 2 and September 17, the P-8A Poseidon spy plane was also spotted flying toward the vicinity of the Russian airbase.         Related News More US Spy Planes Spotted Flying over Russian Bases in Black, Mediterranean Seas  US Reconnaissance Plane Spotted again Near Hmeimim Airbase  US Spy Plane Spotted Flying over Russian-Controlled Hmeimim Airbase  LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Battle for Mosul Day 27: Iraqi Forces Win Back Ancient City of Nimrud Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- After seizing control of Dhahiat al-Assad and Menyan in the weekend, the Syrian army and popular forces continued their advances against the terrorist groups in New Aleppo, Jamiat al-Mostaqbal, Menyan and al-Hamdaniyeh regions.

The transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 2017 after regulatory and shareholder approval. Chen Feng, chairman of Hainan Airlines, will control the largest Chinese-owned fleet of leasable aircraft. HNA's Avolon Holdings Ltd will expand its fleet to 910 aircraft valued at more than billion, according to a statement issued on Thursday by Ireland-headquartered Avolon Holding Ltd, an international aircraft-leasing company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen-listed Bohai Capital Holding Co Ltd, a subsidiary of HNA Group. Li Xiaojin, a professor at Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said: "As a diversified enterprise, acquiring an aircraft-leasing and lease management services company will help HNA Group expand its global aircraft leasing business coverage." China has become the most dynamic market for international air travel, due to strong domestic and overseas travel demand, and a rising middle class. In the next two decades, China is likely to become the first country with an aviation market exceeding trillion, according to a recent report by Boeing Co. By the end of June, CIT Group held total assets of .1 billion and liabilities of .7 billion. "The sale of CIT Commercial Air represents an important milestone for CIT. This transaction will strengthen our balance sheet, simplify our business and enable us to return significant capital to our shareholders," said Ellen R. Alemany, chairwoman and CEO of CIT Group. The move is part of the ongoing trend of HNA Group acquiring overseas assets to recombine and step up its domestic and global expansion. The deal would add to a string of overseas acquisitions of HNA Group, whose assets are now valued at more than 600 billion yuan ( billion).

Hurricane Matthew stalls planes, plants, ports and trains Reuters 10/7/2016 Nick Carey and Meredith Davis © Wilfredo Lee/AP There are no lines to board flights at the Palm Beach International airport after flights in and out were cancelled in the afternoon as Hurricane Matthew advances, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, in West Palm Beach, Fla. Disruptions to air travel, manufacturing, supply chains and retail stores spread on Friday as Hurricane Matthew worked its way up Florida's Atlantic coast, leaving people and goods stranded and plants idled. After canceling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Quotes in the article Toyota Motor Corp TM ▲ 111.95 +1.09 +0.98% American Airlines Group Inc AAL ▲ 42.93 +0.63 +1.49% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 46.38 +0.43 +0.94% Southwest Airlines Co LUV ▲ 43.84 +0.20 +0.46% Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines said it had canceled 270 flight from Wednesday through Saturday. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Toyota Motor Corp like several other automakers, holds new vehicles at ports prior to final shipment to dealerships. A Toyota spokesman said Friday the company moved most of its vehicles parked at the port in Jacksonville inland ahead of the storm. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it had also moved some vehicles from the port prior to its closure and BMW accelerated deliveries inland. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew, as did office supply retailer Staples Inc and Nike Inc, which closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company was monitoring the situation at its Georgia and North Carolina facilities. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and should reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc temporarily shuttered facilities and offices in both Florida and South Carolina. Vulcan Materials Co closed facilities in the Bahamas and Miami, and all along the East Coast, spokesman Jimmy Fleming said. Vulcan's crushed stone is mixed with materials like concrete, cement and asphalt to repair roads and buildings. "We'll need to reopen (when possible) because we supply material to fix things," Fleming said. Honda Motor Co Ltd said Hurricane Matthew would not impact any of its manufacturing plants. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said.

Posted 08 Oct 2016 05:17 Updated 08 Oct 2016 05:20 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Oct 7, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks finished lower on Friday (Oct 7) after official data showed the US economy added 156,000 jobs in September, missing expectations by a bit. While solid, analysts said the jobs number was not enough to confirm the Federal Reserve's plans for hiking rates by the end of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 28.01 points (0.15 per cent) to 18,240.49. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 7.03 points (0.33 per cent) to 2,153.74, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 14.45 points (0.27 per cent) at 5,292.40. Analysts said that the September jobs report showed firm wage growth as well as the return to the labour force of some workers who had been on the sidelines. "We did see a slightly soft headline payroll figure but wages were up and hours were up and I think the details of the report were a bit better than the headline," said Eric Viloria, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Viloria said the Federal Reserve would likely hike interest rates in 2016, though some analysts said there was still enough weakness in the data for the Fed to hold off. Honeywell shares plunged 7.5 per cent after the international conglomerate lowered its profit and sales forecast, citing, among other things, lower shipments in its aviation business and delays in some of its defence and space programmes. Other industrial stocks were weak, with Dow members General Electric and United Technologies losing 0.7 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. Boeing, another Dow member, lost 0.4 per cent despite announcing a contract to sell Qatar Airways up to 100 planes for as much as US$18.6 billion. Gap surged 15.2 per cent after the apparel retailer reported that comparable sales for September fell three per cent, but added that the performance was hindered by a fire at a New York distribution centre. Analysts viewed the report as strong and said it indicated a better trend for the retailer after a lengthy slump. The figures boosted other retailers, with Macy's, Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters all rising at least one per cent. Insurers Allstate, Chubb and Progressive gained one per cent or more as Hurricane Matthew's trajectory suggested the southern US might avoid a worst-case scenario. The much-smaller Universal Insurance Holdings, a big player in the region, surged 14.5 per cent. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines said it had canceled 270 flight from Wednesday through Saturday. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Toyota Motor Corp like several other automakers, holds new vehicles at ports prior to final shipment to dealerships. A Toyota spokesman said Friday the company moved most of its vehicles parked at the port in Jacksonville inland ahead of the storm. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it had also moved some vehicles from the port prior to its closure and BMW accelerated deliveries inland. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew, as did office supply retailer Staples Inc and Nike Inc, which closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company was monitoring the situation at its Georgia and North Carolina facilities. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and should reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc temporarily shuttered facilities and offices in both Florida and South Carolina. Vulcan Materials Co closed facilities in the Bahamas and Miami, and all along the East Coast, spokesman Jimmy Fleming said. Vulcan's crushed stone is mixed with materials like concrete, cement and asphalt to repair roads and buildings. "We'll need to reopen (when possible) because we supply material to fix things," Fleming said. Honda Motor Co Ltd said Hurricane Matthew would not impact any of its manufacturing plants. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said.

Home Af-Soomaali Africa Europe Asia Middle East World news Contact Us Somalia news Sponsored Links The Dawn of Climate-Friendly Air Travel 7th October 2016 Mo Business 0 by Christiana Figueres,Laurence Tubiana-MONTREAL – As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, demand for air travel is growing, Christiana Figueres was Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from 2010 to 2016. with more than 30,000 new large aircraft expected to take to the skies in the next few years. But if we are to sustain growth in air travel without aggravating global warming, we must quickly reduce aviation-related CO2 emissions, which are substantial and not covered by the Paris climate agreement that more than 190 countries agreed to last December. Fortunately, now is the perfect time to decouple aviation emissions from air-travel growth. Representatives from 191 countries convened in Montreal this week for the 39th Session of the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization; after decades of wrangling, they have agreed to an aviation-specific climate agreement. The new ICAO framework aims for “carbon-neutral growth” in international aviation from 2020 onward, and has as its centerpiece a global Laurence Tubiana, the French Ambassador for Climate Change market-based measure (GMBM) to help airlines affordably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels. When implemented, it will be the first carbon-emissions cap on a global industry that does not noticeably increase costs for consumers. And airlines will purchase emissions reductions from other economic sectors, thus funneling billions of dollars into low-carbon development around the world. For the first six years, the new framework will apply only to flights between countries that have voluntarily adopted it, which means that the ICAO will have to encourage adequate participation for the program to be effective. This opt-in approach has some critics, but whether a program is categorized as “voluntary” or “mandatory” is beside the point, because international accords generally apply only to the sovereign countries that have decided to join them. Some 64 countries have already signaled their willingness to sign on to the ICAO agreement, and together they account for nearly 80% of expected growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. That isn’t 100%, but it’s a great start, and we can expect more countries to join when they see others reaping the benefits of low-carbon development. The airlines themselves will welcome a coherent global framework that establishes clear and predictable compliance metrics, rather than a regulatory patchwork that differs from country to country and complicates international operations. To minimize compliance costs – and because environmental sustainability is now a key competitive marker for customers and investors alike – airlines will likely encourage the countries where they do business to participate in the ICAO program. The new agreement provides an enormous opportunity to prevent the emission of 2.5 billion tons of CO2 in the first 15 years – the equivalent of taking roughly 35 million cars off the road every year the program is in force. The agreement will also spur major manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer – which are already investing in quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and efficiency improvements for existing models – to develop cleaner technologies that will allow them to purchase fewer emissions offsets. However, the framework decided in Montreal is not complete, and crucial details need to be worked out quickly so that airlines can begin to plan how they will meet the new environmental targets. Developed countries have already offered to help implement the GMBM, which, it is hoped, will pave the way for investments in emerging economies that are becoming new aviation powerhouses. If the countries can leapfrog over old technologies, they can become new leaders in carbon-smart flying. They should seize the opportunity before them and join the ICAO framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward. At the Paris climate talks last year, we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change. No fewer than 187 countries – large and small, developed and developing – announced emissions-reduction targets in the months before the conference, which created the momentum to reach a landmark accord. With the Paris climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months – more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible – we still have that momentum. The ICAO agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change. Together, the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth. By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet. <p>Copyright: Project Syndicate 2016 – <a href=”https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/airline-carbon-emissions-agreement-by-christiana-figueres-and-laurence-tubiana-2016-10/english”>The Dawn of Climate-Friendly Air Travel</a></p> Sharing is caring!

This comes a month after US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter approved the Army’s proposed multiyear procurement plan. Col. Jeffrey Hager, the Apache program manager, told Inside Defense that a signed agreement can be expected by early 2017. The Senate and House versions of the fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act have both been approved, but concerns over the cost efficiency of production and procurement programs has kept any bill from being passed. The director of defense pricing for the Pentagon's acquisition directorate, Shay Assad, approved the Apache proposal. Assad told Politico in April that his years spent as an executive at Raytheon showed him how companies often overpay for multi-year defense contracts. As a result, Assad claims that he requires contractors to justify their prices, in an attempt to garner the most savings.  © AP Photo/ BAE Systems BAE Wins $49Mln Contract to Maintain US Main ICBM Radar Defense System Pentagon spokesperson Mark Wright vouched for the effectiveness of Assad’s tactics, citing the latter’s leadership on negotiations for the acquisition of the F/A-18 fighter jet "that returned in excess of $500M to the taxpayers," according to Wright. Assad also led talks on the multi-year deal for Boeing’s C-17 Globemaster. According to a fact sheet released by the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), if the Apache deal is approved it could potentially yield some $1 billion in savings over five years.  © Flickr/ The U.S. Army Alabama Firm Wins $128Mln US Missile Defense Management Contract The HASC recently voted for an additional $583 billion defense budget, which includes 25,000 reservists, 27,000 additional active-duty troops, an increase in the Navy’s shipbuilding budget, and the acquisition of new aircraft for the Navy. Defense News quotes US House Representative Adam Smith as saying, "This bill is based on a lot of hope in what will happen next April or May…While this is a good bill, it spends more than we have, and this is a problem we will have to wrestle with in this markup, on the floor and once we get to conference." ...

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and roughly 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines raised its total number of cancellations for Wednesday through Saturday to 270 from 180. Many of the additional cancellations affect Georgia and South Carolina. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew. A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes. Office supply retailer Staples Inc said it had closed stores in line with emergency evacuation guidelines. Nike Inc has closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and encouraged "employees to follow the guidance of state and local officials to evacuate areas." Online retailer Amazon said it was working closely with its employees to ensure their safety and get donations of supplies to areas hit by the storm. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office for three to four days and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it was monitoring the situation for its operations in Georgia and North Carolina. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and were tentatively slated to reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc has closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Honda Motor Co Ltd, which has a plant in South Carolina, is evaluating the impact of Hurricane Matthew. "At this point, the hurricane will not impact any of our manufacturing plants," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain."

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and roughly 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines raised its total number of cancellations for Wednesday through Saturday to 270 from 180. Many of the additional cancellations affect Georgia and South Carolina. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew. A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes. Office supply retailer Staples Inc said it had closed stores in line with emergency evacuation guidelines. Nike Inc has closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and encouraged "employees to follow the guidance of state and local officials to evacuate areas." Online retailer Amazon said it was working closely with its employees to ensure their safety and get donations of supplies to areas hit by the storm. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office for three to four days and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it was monitoring the situation for its operations in Georgia and North Carolina. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and were tentatively slated to reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc has closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Honda Motor Co Ltd, which has a plant in South Carolina, is evaluating the impact of Hurricane Matthew. "At this point, the hurricane will not impact any of our manufacturing plants," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain."

The strongest winds of 120 mph were just offshore, but Matthew’s wrath still menaced more than 500 miles of coastline. Two million people were warned to flee inland as the most powerful storm to threaten the Atlantic coast in more than a decade charged toward Florida. Matthew left more than 280 dead in its wake across the Caribbean. “This storm’s a monster,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned as Matthew started lashing the state. “I’m going to pray for everybody’s safety.” The number of homes and businesses without power jumped by the hour as the storm edged closer to the coast. More than 270,000 were in the dark by early Friday. The winds picked up along Vero Beach, midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral, stripping away palm fronds, ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face. Waves crashed on the beach, and rain came in short bursts.   As it moved north Thursday evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4.4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects. As of 5 a.m. EDT Friday, the hurricane’s western eyewall was approaching Cape Canaveral, according to the National Hurricane Center. Matthew was centred about 40 miles east-southeast of Cape Canaveral and moving north-northwest around 13 mph. But even though the eye was still off-shore, Florida was already seeing strong winds. The Hurricane Center said sustained winds of 46 mph and a gust of 70 mph were reported in Melbourne early Friday. After Florida, forecasters said Matthew would probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea — perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm. Millions of people in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were told to evacuate their homes, and interstate highways were turned into one-way routes to speed the exodus. Florida alone accounted for about 1.5 million of those told to clear out. “The storm has already killed people. We should expect the same impact in Florida,” the governor warned. The hurricane had been a potentially catastrophic Category 4 storm, but weakened slightly early Friday to a Category 3. Forecasters said it could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more.

The storm killed at least 108 people in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, with the final toll expected to be much higher. NICOLAS GARCIA / AFP/Getty Images They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds — which newer buildings can withstand — but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a 500-mile stretch from South Florida to the Charleston, South Carolina, area. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, freeing up federal money and personnel to protect lives and property. The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down, and the Orlando airport planned to do so as well. The Palm Beach International Airport reported a wind gust of 50 mph with the centre of the storm 70 miles offshore, the National Hurricane Center said. Airlines cancelled more than 3,000 flights Thursday and Friday, many of them in or out of Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Amtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York, and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm, which in some cases will mean more days at sea. Orlando’s world-famous theme parks — Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld — all closed. “I never get time off. I’m a little sad,” tourist Amber Klinkel, 25, of Battle Creek, Michigan, lamented at Universal. Patients were transferred from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations. Thousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters, and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte, North Carolina, reported brisk business. At the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes, since the shuttle fleet is now retired. But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm’s effect on its leased seaside pad. The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U.S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage.   The co-ordinator for Haiti’s Interior Ministry in the area hit hardest by Hurricane Matthew said the confirmed death toll in that southwestern zone was 283. Emmanuel Pierre told The Associated Press late Thursday that he expects the toll to rise as authorities reach remote places that were left isolated by the storm. Bodies have started to appear as waters recede in some areas two days after Matthew smashed concrete walls, flattened palm trees and tore roofs off homes. In the Bahamas, authorities reported many downed trees and power lines but no immediate deaths. With hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 60 miles, Matthew could wreak havoc along the U.S. coast even if its centre stayed offshore. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the entire Georgia coast, covering more than a half-million people. It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999, when the state narrowly escaped Floyd. “We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house … might not be here when we get back,” said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia’s dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. “You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.” Some coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay. Darcy O’Connor, a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah, Georgia, a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century, said she and most of her neighbours were sticking around. O’Connor noted that her home, built in 1883, has weathered hurricanes before: “Half the windows, if you look, still have the original glass. So that tells you something.” Maintainance workers try to remove a tree from a road in Nassau, New Providence island in the Bahamas, on October 6, 2016, after the passing of Hurricane Matthew. Shelters along the eastern coast of Florida were jammed amid a frantic race to protect people and pets from the “potentially catastrophic” effects of Hurricane Matthew as the deadly storm barrels in from the Caribbean.

Earlier Thursday, Obama made the declaration for Florida. Obama’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate efforts to protect lives, property and alleviate the suffering caused by the hurricane. Emergency declarations are designed to help provide emergency services to protect lives and property, and to lessen the threat of a catastrophe. The White House says President Barack Obama has spoken by telephone with each of the governors in states bracing for Hurricane Matthew. Charge your electronic devices now if you live in E. #Florida in the path of #Hurricane #Matthew, power outages will be widespread. #FLwx pic.twitter.com/CyKE6unMNp — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) October 7, 2016 Thoughts w all those affected by #HurricaneMatthew. To those in its path tonight #Florida & #EastCoast, stay safe! pic.twitter.com/1FFMW1T6vY — Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) October 7, 2016 The most powerful storm to threaten the U.S. Atlantic coast in more than a decade is moving toward Florida with winds of 140 mph. The White House says Obama committed to providing the necessary federal resources to help the states respond to the hurricane. The calls were with Govs. Nathan Deal of Georgia, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Pat McCrory of NorthCarolina and Rick Scott of Florida. All are Republicans. The White House says people in the path of the hurricane need to take the storm seriously and says Obamahas “directed his team to be as proactive as possible” in its response. 9:10 p.m. The coordinator for Haiti’s Interior Ministry in the area hit hardest by Hurricane Matthew says the confirmed death toll in that southwestern zone is now 283. Emmanuel Pierre told The Associated Press late Thursday that he expects the toll to rise as authorities reach remote places that were left isolated by the storm. The overall death toll in Haiti is not clear. Shortly before Pierre spoke, the headquarters for Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency had put the number of confirmed deaths for the whole country at 122. Bodies have started to appear as waters recede in some areas two days after Matthew smashed concrete walls, flattened palm trees and tore roofs off homes. #HurricaneMatthew has strengthened again to a Category 4 and has sustained winds of 140 mph https://t.co/nRPBDEg2we pic.twitter.com/IehoOJQtx6 — Orlando Sentinel (@orlandosentinel) October 7, 2016 ___ 8:30 p.m. Florida Gov. Rick Scott maintains that state and local officials are prepared for Hurricane Matthew, even as he called the storm bearing down on the state a “monster.” “Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts,” Scott says. Scott says people in the northeast part of the state still have time to evacuate and residents could still choose to go to a shelter. Authorities have told roughly 1.5 million people across the state to evacuate. The mass exodus led to crammed highways, full hotels and the need to open dozens of hurricane shelters. The looming storm also has led to gas shortages, though Scott said the state still has five days’ worth of fuel supplies. Officials are expecting massive power outages across the region once Hurricane Matthew hits full-force. Although the state has food and water supplies ready for after the storm, Scott cautioned that people need to be able to take care of themselves for the first three days. ___ 8:10 p.m. The National Hurricane Center says the center of Hurricane Matthew is over the western end of the Grand Bahama Island and tropical storm conditions are lashing the east coast of Florida. At 8 p.m. EDT, the storm had weakened slightly and had 130 mph (210 kph) sustained winds, down from 140 mph (225 kph). Matthew is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of West Palm Beach, Florida. The storm left more than 100 dead in its wake across the Caribbean, and 2 million people across the Southeast have been warned to flee inland. It’s the most powerful storm to threaten the U.S. Atlantic coast in more than a decade. ___ 7:45 p.m. Hurricane Matthew prompted two college football postponements, and has the NFL plotting just-in-case scenarios for games scheduled in Tampa and Miami this weekend. A pair of college games set to be played Saturday — LSU at No. 18 Florida, as well as Charlotte at Florida Atlantic — were postponed. Saturday night’s game that has No. 23 Florida State visiting No. 10 Miami remains on as scheduled, though officials remain somewhat cautious. The fate of Saturday’s Georgia at South Carolina football game also remained unclear. A major issue with games in Florida this weekend isn’t the weather forecast for Saturday and Sunday, because those days look to be generally fine around the state. It’s whether police, first responders and other key personnel needed at football games that draw massive crowds will be deployed to assist in areas that will take the brunt of Matthew’s wrath. ___ 7:30 p.m. The Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency says authorities have rescued at least 30 people who were trapped in their homes by floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew on the island of New Providence. There has been extensive flooding across the island but no reports of any deaths or injuries. The island includes the capital, Nassau. New Providence was drenched by Hurricane Matthew throughout Thursday. Forecasters predicted up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain and storm surge of around 15 feet (5 meters) over normal tide across the most populous island in the Bahamas. Agency spokeswoman Lindsay Thompson said the government was still conducting a full assessment of damages across the island chain east of Florida and were waiting until the storm was clear of Grand Bahama before declaring the all clear for the country. __ NASA is bracing for its first hurricane without space shuttles to worry about. Now it’s SpaceX and Boeing fretting about hurricane-force wind and equally devastating storm surges. Before the shuttle fleet’s retirement in 2011, rollbacks from the launch pads were commonplace during hurricane season at Kennedy Space Center. Now both pads are empty, at least for the time being. NASA is modifying Launch Complex 39B for its still-in-development Space Launch System mega-rockets intended for outer-space travel. SpaceX is leasing the other pad, 39A, from where Apollo astronauts departed for the moon and multiple shuttle flights began. SpaceX was counting on this historic pad to get its rockets flying again, possibly in November, once modifications were complete. The SpaceX pad at neighboring Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was damaged Sept. 1 when a Falcon rocket exploded during prelaunch testing. ___ 5:30 p.m. Police are patrolling St. Augustine, Florida, neighborhoods, announcing through a bullhorn that the area is in a mandatory evacuation zone as Hurricane Matthew approaches the state. Dana Harrison, who lives on a barrier island across from Anastasia State Park, said she planned to wait out the storm with an out-of-town friend and her cat. The 57-year-old Harrison says she used to live in St. Thomas and survived Hurricane Hugo in 1989, though the storm destroyed her house. She said she feels more secure in her current home. About 1.5 million people in Florida have been told to flee inland as the dangerous and life-threatening Category 4 storm makes it way toward the state. ___ 5 p.m. Officials in the Florida Keys say the island chain got lucky and did not receive major damage from HurricaneMatthew. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said any schools, libraries, parks and government offices that had closed would be reopened on Friday. All roads and bridges in the islands are open. The Key West and Marathon airports will open Friday, though flights may be delayed or canceled due to the hurricane’s effects elsewhere. Coastal waters throughout the Keys were expected to rise up to 2 feet above ground, flooding some neighborhood roads but not the narrow Overseas Highway that links the islands with Florida’s peninsula.
